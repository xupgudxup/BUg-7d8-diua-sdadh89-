    "fullText": "Most Super Bowl advertisers stick to a familiar formula: inoffensive humor and A-list celebrities. Hims & Hers is breaking from the playbook.\n\nTitled \"Rich People Live Longer,\" the digital health company's 2026 big game spot takes aim at a divide in access to quality healthcare between wealthy Americans and everyone else.\n\nOne scene features a space-suited cowboy over the TV news-style chyron \"World's richest man in orbit again.\" The scene is reminiscent of tech billionaire Jeff Bezos emerging from a capsule after completing Blue Origin's first passenger spaceflight in 2021.\n\nAnother shows a shirtless, muscular man strapped to an oxygen mask while sprinting on an exercise bike, alongside text reading \"spends millions\" and \"cheats death\" — perhaps a reference to biohacker Bryan Johnson, who has been known to test oxygen therapy as part of his expensive, public quest against aging.\n\nDan Kenger, the chief design officer at Hims & Hers, told Business Insider that the figures in the ad \"aren't specific individuals,\" and instead \"symbols of an intimidating, members-only healthcare culture.\" Kenger said Hims & Hers is aiming for the ad to be a provocative conversation starter about health inequity.\n\n\"We don't shy away from uncomfortable truths, and we fully expect this will ruffle some feathers,\" Kenger said. \"But if our message makes the industry uncomfortable, it's because we're exposing an outdated system that benefits the very few at the expense of everyone else.\"\n\nHims & Hers is no stranger to advertising controversy. Its \"Sick of the System\" Super Bowl ad last year drew backlash from senators and lobbyists for promoting non-FDA-approved compounded weight-loss drugs in a spot that lacked the sort of safety information typically disclosed by pharmaceutical companies. At the time, Hims & Hers said it adhered to advertising regulations and aimed to raise awareness of the obesity health crisis by showcasing the difficulties of accessing affordable weight-loss treatments.\n\nFor this year's campaign, Hims & Hers also plans to partner with podcast hosts and influencers to produce content across Meta, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms. It also has commercials planned throughout the Olympics, which begin next month.\n\nThis year's Super Bowl takes place on Sunday, Feb. 8.",

    "description": "How Amazon's decision translates to your own workplace.",
    "fullText": "16,000 jobs down. How many more to go?\n\nThe sequel to Amazon's mass layoffs last fall came yesterday with another round of deep job cuts. I'd love to tell you it's an isolated incident, but it feels representative of a broader shift across tech and corporate America.\n\nAI is ushering in a new era for workplaces, and companies are adjusting accordingly. As the ones closest to the tech (and spending the most on it), Big Tech would be the first to evolve. Make no mistake: Where Big Tech goes, the rest of the business world will likely follow.\n\nSo what can we glean from Amazon's layoffs? Fortunately, my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart are crushing it with scoops. Their stories provide context about Amazon's decision and how that translates to your own workplace.\n\nNo one is safe: Internal Slack messages Ashley viewed show how many teams were bitten by the layoff bug. That includes businesses within AWS (its AI cloud service and cloud data warehouse service) and Amazon's retail business.\n\nOne Amazon worker used an AI tool to flag roles on the chopping block. That list is even broader, although it may contain inaccuracies since it's AI-generated. Another noticeable trend is how software engineers got hit particularly hard, as has been the case in tech recently.\n\nOwn it: After a not-so-hot start, Amazon has coordinated its post-layoffs communications. And there's one word that keeps cropping up: ownership.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP of AWS Infrastructure, and Colleen Aubrey, SVP of Applied AI Solutions, both described \"doubling down on a culture of ownership\" in memos Ashley viewed. That sentiment, coupled with the changes Eugene reported on in performance reviews, signals that the further away you are from doing the actual work, the more at risk you are.\n\nAI can be a friend as much as a foe: Artificial intelligence often takes a lot of blame for why jobs are getting swallowed up. A memo from AWS VP Greg Pearson that Eugene viewed paints a different picture.\n\nHe urged workers to \"keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work.\" It's something I heard a lot of last week when chatting with execs: \"AI won't take your job, but the person willing to use it will.\"\n\nMake change, don't manage it: I'm not a tech career coach (I'll leave that advice to this guy), but the layoffs, coupled with CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing war against bureaucracy, indicate a desire to get more people rolling up their sleeves.\n\nIt's reminiscent of a recent convo I had with Cisco president and chief product officer Jeetu Patel. He stressed the importance of figuring out the change you want to make and working toward it, rather than focusing on a job title.\n\n\"If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,\" Patel told me. \"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.\"",

    "description": "\"You lose people, employees.\"",
    "fullText": "The second week of January brought hope of a snowstorm for Santa Fe, New Mexico, businesses.\n\nSki resorts and winter sports shops were struggling because of high temperatures and a lack of snow, KOAT reported.\n\nBluebird Mountain Sports assistant manager Wanonce Rakestraw said: \"Usually, our season extends out to the first week of April. Past seasons used to be second week of April. But now, if it keeps going the way it is, we're looking last week of March, if not mid of March.\"\n\nThe warmer weather highlights a worldwide trend in which temperatures have drastically risen because of humans' burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gas. In the United States and elsewhere, this change varies by region, but winter temperatures in the continental U.S. have climbed 3 degrees since the preindustrial era, according to The Climate Reality Project.\n\nIn the Southwest, that means drier winters that increase drought risks. In addition to the impact on businesses and economies, this \"season creep\" is stressing agriculture and ecosystems.\n\nFarmers rely on snowmelt to irrigate crops in spring, while plants and animals have evolved to rely on seasonal cues for survival instincts that include reproduction. People similarly have built their lives around the rhythms of Earth.\n\n\"It's been really slow,\" Rakestraw told KOAT. \"When places lose business, you lose people, employees. You close early.\"\n\nSki Santa Fe general manager Ben Abruzzo said his business was using snowmaking machines to remain open. Others have not been so lucky. In France, hundreds of ski resorts shut their doors, and some in the western U.S. couldn't open as usual because of a lack of snow. Excessive snowfall in the Northeast and Midwest underscored the variability.\n\nWarmer weather can also mean more rain, which may create flooding issues.\n\nWhile some ski resorts may be able to supplement low snowfall, they cannot stay afloat without more of the white stuff. Adapting to new weather patterns should be one priority, while investing in infrastructure and planning upgrades should be another.\n\nDo you think America could ever get all of its power from clean energy?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe rise in temperatures at the root of the problem may only be mitigated by the transition to solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy, which do not produce pollution that traps heat in the atmosphere.\n\nYou can make a change — and even save yourself a ton of money — by installing solar panels, replacing your gas-powered vehicle with an electric one, and changing how you update your wardrobe.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A former marketing manager explains why leaving corporate life to freelance after having kids led to burnout and mental health struggles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bullon of activ Marketing Franchise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my firstborn, I was working in the corporate world as a marketing manager. It was an intense job that I absolutely loved, both as a single person and then as a newly married one. I got to travel the world, quickly advance in my career, and diversify my skill set, but I could only do the job because I didn't yet have kids.\n\nI knew once I started a family, I wouldn't want to continue working in the corporate world full time. I never wanted to be in a position where I had to choose between taking care of my kids and doing my job, so I initially decided to go back to my role part time, thinking that would be a happy medium.\n\nBut after keeping in touch day, a reintroduction to work after maternity leave, when my son was 7 months old, it became clear I couldn't even manage the part time role. To do the job well, to the high standard I expected of myself, I had to give it my everything.\n\nI remember finishing the keeping in touch day, crying in my boss's office, telling her I just couldn't come back. The day had been a reminder of my old life — the life of a young, free, travelling corporate marketer. It was a life I knew I couldn't maintain with a baby in tow, and I mourned the end of my life as a corporate professional.\n\nI quit my job and, after months of deliberation and dreaming, decided to go freelance — I was really excited. Surely, I thought, I would strike a healthy balance of parenting and working if I worked for myself.\n\nThe plan would be to devote all my attention to my son when he was awake, and pull out my laptop to work while he slept.\n\nBut the reality of being self-employed as a new mom was not what I had imagined.\n\nI was running on empty all the time, exhausted from sleepless nights. I didn't know what I was doing with parenting, as I had never done it before, and often felt I was doing it all wrong. I adored my son even more than I had imagined I would, and not being with him while I worked constantly pulled at my heartstrings.\n\nIt was from this state that I then tried to work, attempting to be at clients' full-time disposal. Even though I knew about marketing, I didn't fully take into account the amount of work or the number of non-billable hours I'd be working as a self-employed individual. As opposed to working for a corporate company, I was the sole person responsible for every aspect of the business. It was all on me.\n\nNot keen on putting my son in a day care to save us a bit of money, I tried to build the business with him around most of the time, save for a few hours a week when my mom or sister would have him.\n\nI was on a hamster wheel from the moment I woke up, becoming more and more exhausted as I tried to work as if I didn't have a child, and parent as if I didn't have a job.\n\nThe standards I set for myself as a mother and business owner were unachievable, and I could feel myself starting to burn out as I attempted to do it all.\n\nOnly 20 months after my first son was born, I gave birth to my second son, and I continued trying to balance my own business with parenting, this time with a toddler and newborn in tow.\n\nMy second didn't ever take a bottle, so I frequently sat with him breastfeeding on one side with my laptop set up on the other. I was absolutely determined to do it all, and do it all perfectly.\n\nI suppose part of me wanted to prove people wrong, to show them that I could be a completely present mother while also being an incredibly successful self-starter.\n\nMy mental health crashed. My physical health deteriorated. My relationship with my husband was rocky. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I had hit rock bottom.\n\nIt wasn't what I had expected freelancing to be like, and it most certainly wasn't what I wanted motherhood to be like.\n\nWhile self-employment might seem like the \"easier than corporate path\" for new mothers, it wasn't — not for me.\n\nSomething had to change, so I went back to the drawing board, considering what I could do differently, and joined a marketing franchise. It allowed me to continue doing what I loved, marketing, but I had the back office and a team of people behind me to carry out all the work that had overwhelmed me when I was working on my own.\n\nIf I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say: You can't do it all, nor should you.\n\nAs a mom, I can't put myself last. I must build my life in a way that prioritizes me; otherwise, I'll burn out repeatedly, which is detrimental to ume, my family, and my work.",

    "description": "I used points to upgrade to United Polaris business class on an eight-hour flight. From the lounge access to the amenities, the upgrade was worth it.",
    "fullText": "I never thought I'd prefer sleeping 35,000 feet in the sky to my own bed, but my recent trip in United's business class proved me wrong.\n\nI like to take red-eye flights when I'm traveling to a destination in a different time zone because it helps me keep my sleep schedule on track. However, if I don't get proper rest on these flights, I land feeling completely groggy and end up missing out on my first day of travel.\n\nSo, on a recent overnight flight from New Jersey to Morocco, I decided to upgrade to United Polaris business class in hopes of getting a good night's sleep. I originally had a regular economy ticket and, as a frequent flyer, used my PlusPoints to get the upgrade at no additional charge.\n\nBetween the Saks Fifth Avenue blanket and a toiletry kit filled with skincare products, the experience did not disappoint.\n\nBecause I was flying business class on an eligible long-haul international flight, I had access to United's Polaris lounge.\n\nI typically like to be in and out of the airport as quickly as possible, but this time, I arrived a few hours early just to enjoy the perks.\n\nAs I walked in, I thought the space itself was stunning. It had a sleek, modern design with a marble check-in area and an overall elevated, luxury feel.\n\nThe lounge featured an extensive hot and cold buffet, but I opted to visit the full-service dining room instead.\n\nI ordered the tagliatelle pasta, which was perfectly al dente, followed by a warm sticky toffee cake that practically melted in my mouth.\n\nAfter my meal, I stopped by the bar to enjoy one of the signature cocktails before boarding.\n\nAfter boarding, I made my way to my seat, which was set up in a private pod. I immediately noticed how spacious the layout was and how it provided a real sense of privacy.\n\nWaiting at my seat was Saks Fifth Avenue bedding, including a plush pillow, a duvet, and a cooling-gel pillow. I also requested a mattress pad and a pair of slippers for extra comfort.\n\nOn my seat, I also found a complimentary toiletry bag with some travel essentials.\n\nInside was everything I needed for a long-haul flight — an eye mask, cozy socks, tissues, a dental kit with a toothbrush and toothpaste, earplugs, and a pen.\n\nIt was also stocked with Perricone MD skincare products, including a cleansing wipe, eye gel, hand cream, lip balm, and face mist.\n\nAll of it was super helpful for staying refreshed throughout the flight.\n\nAt this point, I was so comfortable I could've fallen asleep at any second, but I had to stay awake for the food.\n\nBefore the meal service began, the flight attendants came around with warm towels, which was a thoughtful, elevated touch. They even pulled out my tray table and placed a cloth napkin down.\n\nFor dinner, I was served a welcome snack, an appetizer (salad, bread, and an olive tapenade), and my main course. I also had a glass of white wine.\n\nHowever, I was left a bit underwhelmed by my entrée. The steak was cooked more than I would've liked it to be, and the potatoes tasted underseasoned.\n\nBecause I had a satisfying meal at the lounge, though, I wasn't too disappointed.\n\nHowever, dessert is where things really stood out. The flight attendants came around with an ice-cream sundae cart, where passengers could build their own treat with different toppings.\n\nI went all out with caramel sauce, hot fudge, chocolate chips, and cherries.\n\nAfter eating, I got ready for bed in the spacious cabin bathroom and settled in for a good night's rest. Honestly, the best part of this seat was how well I slept.\n\nBeyond the luxury bedding, the seat itself reclines into a completely flat bed. There's even a footrest up front that adds extra room.\n\nAccording to United's website, the bed offers about 77 inches of sleeping room. As someone who's just over 5 feet tall, this was more than enough space to stretch out completely.\n\nThe controls on the side of the seat made it easy to adjust everything exactly as I liked. Between the fully flat bed, plush bedding, walls surrounding my pod, and my sleeping mask and earplugs, I slept just as comfortably as I would've at home.\n\nSince my flight was a red-eye, I landed in Morocco at 9 a.m. with a full day of events ahead of me. Being well-rested made all the difference and allowed me to hit the ground running.\n\nAlthough I thought the upgrade was completely worth it because I used points, I probably wouldn't pay full price for a business-class seat.\n\nHowever, I'd gladly use any points or upgrades I had available to recreate this experience in the future.",

    "description": "ICE activity and tariffs are making for an especially tough month for Perennial Cycle in Minneapolis. The owner is focusing on the community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luke Breen, co-owner of specialty bike shop Perennial Cycle in uptown Minneapolis. The following conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nPerennial is a specialty bike shop. We do cargo bikes, city utility bikes, and commuting bikes, and have been a niche business for 33 years.\n\nPerennial focuses on community events. Last year, we did 35 organized community rides. So, while we do rely on selling bikes, we're very community-driven. That's always been a big piece of Perennial Cycle.\n\nYou cannot be in Minneapolis without ICE's presence impacting your day-to-day. You just simply cannot. Imagine: We had to shut down our schools to keep children safe. It is insane what is happening right now.\n\nAs a bike shop, we've had meetings so we can be aware of each other's levels of anxiety — how we're doing, is everybody OK? For some people, it's going to affect them a little differently, and we've come up with a plan for if ICE is on the block.\n\nWe were closed on Friday, January 23, for the ICE OUT protest. To me, it's a big ask to have small businesses go on strike, and later I heard that it was the first general strike in 80 years. I'm really glad that Perennial did that.\n\nI also went to the march in downtown Minneapolis last Friday afternoon and was a little overwhelmed with emotions. I had no idea how massive it was. When you're in a march like that, you can kind of see the few thousand people that are around you. It isn't until later when you see those overhead videos posted online, and it's like, 'Oh my God.'\n\nIt had an amazing vibe. There was not a lot to cheer about, and yet there's a lot to be together about. It took a lot of awesome organizing to pull that off. There were restaurants that were handing out food. There were tables with cases and cases and cases of hand warmers. It was minus 10 when I went down there, and the wind was blowing. I did not expect that many people because it was so cold.\n\nWe held a fundraiser for MIRAC, a local immigrant rights organization, scheduled for Sunday. I talked with Brieanna, the artist and screenprinter I am working with. We considered canceling. Brieanna and I decided that canceling is exactly what ICE would want us to do. We did not cancel the event.\n\nThere was a line outside the door that was a half-block long at one point. Tons of people showed up. Everybody was just happy to be part of the community. A couple of legal observers explained what it's like to be an observer, knowing that lots of people are very curious about it, but it's pretty intimidating when you just go by what you're seeing on the news and on Instagram. That was part of the aim of the fundraiser: to foster observer conversations.\n\nWe raised over $4,000. We brought in, I don't know, probably like 20 grocery bags of food for a food shelf. All those things were great, but the most appreciation came from people saying they were happy to be together, happy to have a place to go and be around other people who were kind of in mourning.\n\nWe had little cheat sheets with information about the event that we handed out when visitors walked in the door. One of the things was, \"Yes, we're a bike shop Monday through Saturday, but today we're not. Please don't ask us questions about bikes.\" We just didn't have the capacity to do bike stuff.\n\nThere were plenty of people at the fundraiser who weren't familiar with the bike shop. But plenty of people who were like, \"Wow, this is kind of weird. Why is this happening in a bike shop?\" And that was kind of fun explaining that, actually, this is very normal because we focus on community events. We have Cambros containers for serving coffee to 100 people. We have serving trays for treats. We have all the things that are necessary to organize an event like this. The bike shop actually already has the musicians who were singing.\n\nIt's off-season for me. I am really happy to have found a place to plug in to be useful during what's happening in Minneapolis right now. Numerous people came up and thanked me for opening the shop and doing the fundraiser. Most of the kind words were about community and not about raising money.\n\nHopefully, the shop will make it through, but honestly, it is a real challenge.\n\nOur city's under siege, but in reality, we all know it's our country that's under siege. We know a lot of people are super challenged by what's going on right now. I sell pretty expensive bicycles. These cargo bikes are not cheap. So for me, the tariffs have completely turned my life upside down. I'm learning that there is a plural for the word crisis, and it's crises. And that's what I'm looking at — one crisis on top of another.\n\nI have high seasons and low seasons. It's a low season, so I have to be very protective with my money right now. Any loss of income is a big deal because we're barely going to cover expenses for the month. This is a typical cycle for a business in Minnesota, a very seasonal business, so none of that is overwhelming. But, yeah, that's why the strike was definitely a big ask, and I'm so happy I did it. I believe that the store will reap rewards on the other side of this.",

    "fullText": "If you hadn't heard, there's an AI race sweeping through Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile stalwarts like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, are grabbing the headlines as they unveil model after model, there are plenty of startups trying to find a foothold.\n\nFor investors, it can be hard to tell which of these upstarts have true technical potential and which are likely to fade into tech oblivion.\n\nThat's part of why Jenny Xiao, the cofounder of Leonis Capital, said it's important for venture capitalists to get serious about understanding the AI technology they're investing in.\n\nLeonis Capital, founded in 2021, is now deploying its second $40 million fund. The venture capital firm is focused on next-generation AI companies and has invested in over a dozen since its launch, including MaintainX, Motion, and SpectroCloud.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Xiao and her cofounder, Jay Zhao, to share the top five questions they ask founders when evaluating their tech. They shared their responses over email, which have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe best founders don't think in terms of incremental feature improvements — they think in capability thresholds. We're looking for whether they understand that progress in AI is often non-linear, and whether they can anticipate which future capabilities might fundamentally change or even break their product.\n\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from our Leonis AI 100 — where we benchmarked the most important AI startups — is that the strongest AI founders build just ahead of the next technical breakthrough.\n\nA good answer talks about entirely new workflows that get unlocked, not just marginal efficiency gains, and clearly explains how the company would adapt or pivot as the technology evolves.\n\nMost AI startups don't fail because they're bad, but because they're building something that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google can eventually ship \"for free\" as a feature.\n\nThat's why we don't accept \"they're not focused on this\" as an answer. We push founders to explain what internal constraint would actually prevent a foundation model lab from building the same thing. If the answer comes down to focus or culture, that's not a real moat.\n\nStrong answers acknowledge that the big labs technically could build it, but doing so would break their incentive structure, pricing, or distribution model; require operational complexity that doesn't scale for them; or shift value to downstream execution rather than model capability.\n\nSome founders can also credibly argue they have a 12- to 18-month head start. Weak answers, by contrast, lean on claims like being \"more vertical,\" having \"more niche data,\" or understanding customers better — responses we hear from about 95% of founders.\n\nWe've noticed a consistent pattern: Most founders underestimate foundation models, and most VCs underestimate them even more.\n\nAsking \"How much proprietary data do you have?\" is usually the wrong question, since no early-stage company has truly meaningful data. And if a founder's pitch boils down to \"we have more data, therefore our models are better,\" that's a red flag: foundation models often improve faster than proprietary ones, and the companies building them have enough capital to buy data and quickly close any gaps.\n\nWhat matters much more is not how much data exists today, but whether the product naturally generates better data over time. For example, industrial systems where data only emerges once software is embedded in workflows, or products where switching costs come from accumulated context.\n\nWe ask this question to understand where defensibility actually lives once code becomes commoditized. If a founder can't answer it clearly, they likely don't understand their own moat.\n\nCosmetic advantages like code, UI, or models are easy to copy, while structural advantages — such as being a system of record or being embedded into compliance, audits, or standard operating procedures — are much harder to replicate.\n\nThe question also reveals founder temperament: Strong founders are candid about their vulnerabilities (\"Here's what we're most worried about\"), while weaker ones tend to get defensive and insist a threat \"would never happen.\"\n\nThis question forces founders to explain their earliest technical decisions and the trade-offs they intentionally made, revealing whether they understand system dynamics rather than just iterating on features.\n\nStrong answers sound like, \"We chose to execute actions, not just make suggestions, which increased liability but created real lock-in,\" or \"We became the system of record instead of a thin layer, which slowed integrations and sales early but made switching organizationally expensive later.\" By contrast, many founders default to saying they want to \"stay flexible,\" which often signals they haven't yet designed anything fundamental.\n\nThe best AI systems are opinionated by design, deliberately removing degrees of freedom and hard-coding assumptions about workflows, authority, or data flow.\n\nReal insight usually comes from abandoning old assumptions. This question helps distinguish founders who simply stumbled into AI from those who experienced a genuine shift in how they see the world.\n\nWe're looking for intellectual flexibility, not credentials. Strong answers point to a specific belief the founder once held, why they believed it, and what changed their mind; weak answers stay vague, like saying they \"realized AI was going to be big.\"\n\nThis question assumes copying is possible and pushes founders to explain what isn't obvious. Shallow answers fall back on claims like \"they couldn't move as fast\" or \"they don't have our data,\" while stronger ones point to hard-to-see advantages such as deep operational knowledge, customer-specific integrations, or accumulated context that isn't visible from the outside.\n\nFounders who can't point to moments where they changed their mind usually aren't learning — they're executing a fixed plan in a world that won't stay fixed.\n\nThis question reveals epistemic humility and whether a founder is genuinely truth-seeking or just looking for confirmation. AI moves too fast for people who can't update, and we're especially wary of founders who treat every pivot as vindication rather than correction.\n\nMarket timing, regulatory shifts, and platform dependencies kill far more startups than bad management. This question tests whether founders think probabilistically about external forces and whether they've designed for resilience instead of relying on luck.\n\nFounders who say \"nothing\" haven't thought hard enough. The ones we want to back can name several concrete external risks and explain how they're hedging against them.\n\nThe best founders aren't contrarian for its own sake, but they can hold an unpopular position long enough for the world to catch up.",

    "description": "It turns out investors are willing to forgive huge capital spending if a company's core business is thriving.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Wednesday's hoy trinity of earnings — which saw Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla report within five minutes of each other — everyone knew that updates on AI progress would be the only game in town.\n\nHow those results ended up playing out shed crucial light on where we are in the AI trade right now.\n\nThe overarching focus for the Big Tech trio was not who has immediately seen results from AI investment. Instead, it was whether those companies were doing enough to support the appearance of maybe, eventually doing something. Investors love the prospect of future upside, and want a reason to preserve their optimism.\n\nEach of the three companies showcased this trend in their own unique way. Let's go one by one:\n\nLast quarter, Meta was punished for its capex-spending plans. This quarter, the company once again blew the doors off spending forecasts … but this time the market seemed OK with it.\n\nWhat changed? Look no further than the company's stronger-than-expected first-quarter revenue, driven by a big beat in advertising. Meta CFO Susan Li also got investors hyped on the earnings call by saying the company will fund its AI ambitions primarily with cash, rather than debt.\n\nIn the end, it's not that Meta has tangible proof that its AI spending is going to generate monstrous future earnings growth. The company has instead fallen back on its cash-cow advertising business to alleviate financing pressures and buy itself more time.\n\nWe haven't yet gotten an answer about whether the AI spending will pay off. We just know the company can afford to keep pursuing it.\n\nMarket reception: Very positive\n\nI present the counterpoint to Meta's well-received quarter. Microsoft also announced much larger-than-expected spending plans … and its stock fell.\n\nThe difference? One of Microsoft's main cash cows — its Azure cloud-computing unit — showed slowing growth. Suddenly, big spending doesn't look so appealing when your backstop is weakening.\n\nWhile Tesla's AI push has taken the form of self-driving vehicles and robotics, the company's lofty valuation is still being largely driven by hopes that big AI-linked profits will one day be unlocked.\n\nBut unlike Meta, the EV-maker is doing it at a time when its core business is in decline. One overlooked highlight of Tesla's report was that — even though the company posted a bottom-line beat — it also saw first-ever decline in annual revenue.\n\nIt didn't matter. Investors instead focused on Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI, the company owned by Elon Musk. They also seemed to take the discontinuation of the Model S and Y vehicles in stride.\n\nAgain, the perception of eventually monetizing AI won out. In the AI race, it's not what you're doing, it's what you can convince everyone you're going to do down the line.",

    "description": "Some small-business owners in Portland, Maine, are debating how best to support staff and customers amid a federal immigration crackdown.",
    "fullText": "After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a \"No ICE\" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly.\n\nGerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung \"No ICE\" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state.\n\nFor Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business.\n\n\"The posters are up, and they're not coming down,\" Gerry said.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.\n\nAlso on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign.\n\nGerry said that some owners he's been speaking with favor taking part in the stoppage, and others are calling for businesses to remain open to divert profits to groups helping immigrants.\n\nAlready this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. His current thought: Close for the day and donate weekend proceeds to charities helping those affected by the immigration sweep.\n\nThese are the sorts of calculations that many small-business owners across the US have considered over the past few months. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week.\n\nWhile some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action.\n\nSome workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention.\n\nGerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep.\n\nHe said he contacted restaurant review sites to flag the negative ratings, and he and his co-owners instructed the restaurant's more than 50 staffers on how to handle negative phone calls. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to \"review bomb\" the restaurant.\n\nEarlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a \"No ICE\" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. The following week, she attended an online training conducted by a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union about where federal agents are permitted to go within a business if they don't have a warrant.\n\nMillecchia said she feels she's in a more privileged position to speak up than some other shopkeepers.\n\n\"I'm the white lady who can yell,\" she said.\n\nYet, Millecchia said, motioning toward the poster, the sign is a \"hollow gesture\" — other than the show of support it sends.\n\nWhat is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said.\n\n\"They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here,\" she said, referring to the presence of federal officers.\n\nThat could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. Another disruption: She plans to close on Friday to support the strike.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. The cards were printed in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Somali, and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in parts of Africa.\n\nAn employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community.\n\nHe estimated that foot traffic at the store had fallen by at least half from what's typical for January.\n\nAt a skate shop called Mocean, owner Jasper Tripp said he hung a \"No ICE\" sign because it aligned with his beliefs. Ordinarily, he said, he tries to separate his political views from the store he has run for nearly a decade.\n\n\"It just feels right,\" Tripp said of the decision to put up the poster. He worked with an artist to design an anti-ICE T-shirt. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said.\n\nFor some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. One restaurant owner said she plans to shut down for at least a week — and pay workers — while she's out of town. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.\n\nShe asked that Business Insider not use her name or that of her restaurant to protect her employees, who she said are legal immigrants but who nevertheless feel threatened.\n\nShe taped a \"No ICE\" poster to the door to help employees and customers to feel safe, not to denounce immigration agents, she said.\n\nThe balance is tricky, the owner added. \"I have the responsibility to keep people safe. I also have an economic responsibility.\"",

    "fullText": "Lord Stockwood says people in government ‘definitely’ talking about idea as technology disrupts industries\n\nThe UK could introduce a universal basic income (UBI) to protect workers in industries that are being disrupted by AI, the investment minister Jason Stockwood has said.\n\n“Bumpy” changes to society caused by the introduction of the technology would mean there would have to be “some sort of concessionary arrangement with jobs that go immediately”, Lord Stockwood said.\n\nThe Labour peer told the Financial Times: “Undoubtedly we’re going to have to think really carefully about how we soft-land those industries that go away, so some sort of [universal basic income], some sort of lifelong mechanism as well so people can retrain.”\n\nA universal basic income is not part of official government policy, but when asked whether people in government were considering the need for UBI, Stockwood told the FT: “People are definitely talking about it.”\n\nThe technology entrepreneur, who took up his ministerial post in September, said part of his motivation for joining the government was to help ensure the workforce was prepared for rapid change.\n\nFears continue to grow about the impact of artificial intelligence on Britain’s job market. This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

    "title": "Oprah Winfrey turned her weight-loss journey into a business. Here's how her health empire has evolved.",
    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",

    "fullText": "After Microsoft reported results on Wednesday, CFO Amy Hood sent an internal memo to employees calling attention to recent developments in AI chips and coding tools, and deals with OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nHood sends these emails every quarter when Microsoft discloses its financials. Her missives mostly rehash what the company reports publicly, such as how revenue and profit are growing, or what is discussed on analyst earnings calls.\n\nStill, these memos provide insight into what Microsoft executives deem most important, and what they want employees to know.\n\nThe latest memo highlighted how Microsoft is gaining share in markets where the total addressable market is expanding.\n\nHood specifically mentioned the launch of the GitHub Copilot software development kit in the growing market of AI coding tools, and the release of Microsoft's new Maia 200 AI chip.\n\nHood's email also called out Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic that helped increase commercial bookings, basically the deals Microsoft closed in the quarter, by 230%, year over year.\n\nCapital expenditure on computing and datacenter infrastructure also broke yet another quarterly record, reaching $37.5 billion, she also noted.\n\nThis afternoon, we announced our second-quarter financial results. We exceeded Wall Street expectations, growing revenue 17% and 15% in constant currency and operating income by 21% and 19% in constant currency -a strong finish to the first half of the fiscal year.\n\nIn the quarter, Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $50 billion for the first time, growing 26% and 24% in constant currency.\n\nThere were many highlights this quarter, but a few stand out as reminders of the value our products and services deliver to customers - and as proof points of the progress we are making:\n\nInvestors tune in to our earnings call for the full details on this quarter and a look ahead to Q3. It's a helpful way to stay aligned as we deliver on our commitments. Join live today at 2:30 PM Pacific, listen on-demand, or check the transcript on the Investor Relations website.\n\nThis quarter's results reflect meaningful progress on core priorities. We continue to add capacity with pace, drive steady efficiency gains across our fleet, and invest in each layer of the stack\n\nAs we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we're operating in markets with expanding TAM where we continue to gain share and you can see our progress in many places, from last week's announcement of the GitHub Copilot SDK to Monday's Maia 200 announcement. We are innovating and delivering together. And we're doing it with the quality and security our customers expect from us. All of this builds trust from customers and partners as they rely on us for mission critical workloads.\n\nThanks again for all your work.\n\nWith appreciation and gratitude,\n\nHave a tip?

What you don’t do with a new release, is something that falls awkwardly between those two approaches. Enter Highguard.\n\nThis new online multiplayer title from newcomer Wildlight Entertainment has an excellent pedigree. The studio was formed by ex-Respawn Entertainment staff, most of whom previously worked on Titanfall, Call of Duty and the aforementioned Apex Legends. They know what they’re doing. But the launch has been … troubled.\n\nThe game was revealed via a rather oblique trailer that closed last December’s lavish Game Awards event. Most viewers were expecting the ceremony to end with something huge – a major new announcement from Hideo Kojima, perhaps, or maybe a GTA 6 song and dance number. What they got was a short look at a fantasy-themed online shooter that no one had heard of – and it didn’t go down well.\n\nIt turns out that Wildlight hadn’t planned to reveal the game before its 26 January launch – they were going to pull another Apex Legends shadow drop – but Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley played the game, liked it and offered them a free slot at his show. The team couldn’t turn it down. Although perhaps, with hindsight, they should have.\n\nNow it’s out in the open and it’s actually pretty interesting. Combining elements of an online shooter and a Moba (multiplayer online battle arena game), players get into two teams of three, select from a group of differently skilled hero characters and then try to destroy the other side’s base before their own is destroyed. The action comes in phases – first you fortify your castle, then you explore the landscape for loot and power-ups, then the fighting begins. Each part sort of feels like a different game and as I played the first few rounds, I was constantly thinking “ooh, that’s a bit like Rainbow Six Siege” and “ooh, this bit’s like Fortnite”. But the game does have an identity of its own, thanks to its fantasy/mythological styling – you get to ride a sort of spirit horse around the landscape, while different heroes throw lightning bolts or erect walls of ice.\n\nHowever, they also carry shotguns and assault rifles, so that it feels like a weird cross between Call of Duty and a Ray Harryhausen movie. What Respawn has always done well is design incredibly smooth kinetic playspaces, where traversal is rarely impeded. This is a trait that Wildlight Entertainment has inherited – in Highguard you can run, slide, climb and leap in seamless movements, rarely getting stuck on the scenery.\n\nBut sadly, the game’s disproportionately opulent reveal at the Game Awards has caused some issues. Almost immediately after launch, negative reviews started streaming on to the game’s Steam page, with players complaining about visual performance issues and long queues to get a match – which doesn’t feel that fair for a game that had only been online for a couple of hours. You have to wonder how destructive that unexpected Game Awards teaser was – the gamer community can be incredibly judgmental and they have long, bitter memories.\n\nHighguard did attract around 100k players on day one, not a bad start for a newcomer to the crowded online multiplayer space, but there’s a lot of work to do. The last couple of years has been a battlefield for online blasters, the scarred landscape strewn with the skeletons of failed competitors from Concord to Hyenas and Battleborn. On top of this, Valve, the company behind Steam, has its own Moba-inspired online team game, Deadlock, in development and reaction to the closed beta tests has been positive. Valve is not a rival anyone really wants to go up against.\n\nAnd there’s a reason everyone wants to be in this space – Fortnite is making around $5bn a year, and Battlefield 6 was one of the bestselling games of 2025. But considering the risks (hundreds of millions of dollars in development and marketing costs) and the volatile, unpredictable market, I can’t help but feel worried for the Highguard team. They’re banking on players staying around for months, building a community of adoring fans, maintaining huge concurrent player numbers. But it’s going to take a lot to get over the hurdle of that botched reveal.\n\nBesides, I have a feeling the next mega hit online shooter won’t be a Frankenstein’s monster of a game, sewn together from the recognisable body parts of previous hits. It’ll be something wild and fresh and new – a Godzilla, emerging from the depths of the game-development ocean, unexpected and bizarre and covered in seaweed. And whatever it is, it won’t get the end slot at the Game Awards, we’ll never see it coming.\n\n“Is this another one of your masochist games?” asked my partner, somewhat warily, watching me play mountain-climbing game Cairn this week. (He is well aware of my affection for extremely difficult video games; he’s witnessed me struggle through so many of them.) Cairn is a game about extreme mountaineering, in which you must move storied climber Aava’s individual limbs to find hand and footholds in the forbidding cliff faces of Kami, a mountain that has never been summited. Aava is obstinately determined to be the first person to get to the top, and as the game progresses, I began to question that obsession (and my own obsession with playing it). It is thoughtful, beautiful, and not always easy, and has provoked a lot of reflection. Look out for the full review on the Guardian tomorrow, in which I will be able to say much more.

Pantaloon offers its premium subscribers access to a range of new titles for £3.99 a month. Co-founder Jamin Smith stated, “We’re trying to invite risk back into the equation, find weirder, more wonderful, more creatively refreshing work that we can put our names to.”\n\nAs one of the few people who actually played on the Virtual Boy when it arrived in 1995, I was surprised to see that Nintendo is bringing the headache-inducing retro system to the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, complete with replica accessory and downloadable games. Now it’s been revealed that the lineup of digital titles will include an unreleased sequel to classic racer F-Zero named Zero Racers. You’ll need a subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online service to play it, but this is a fascinating and rare chance to play a Nintendo game that never made it to the shelves. Also coming is platforming adventure, D-Hopper which was cancelled due to the demise of the Virtual Boy. Just make sure to have painkillers to hand.\n\nThe pleasure of watching seasons pass in Animal Crossing is the theme of this lovely piece by journalist and author Jay Castello. Although you could feasibly skip the game’s fallow winter periods, having patience and embracing the darkness is part of the game’s slow charm.\n\n‘I didn’t have anything to prove’: what Traitors finalist Jade Scott learned about survival from video games\n\nPikachu and pals go wild: Pokémon theme park opens in Tokyo\n\nWhy I’m launching a feminist video games website in 2026\n\n‘It’s the underground Met Gala of concrete murderzone design’: welcome to the Quake Brutalist Game Jam\n\nReturn to Silent Hill – video game horror series births another middling movie | ★★☆☆☆\n\nKeza answers this week’s question from reader Caitlin:\n\n“I am endlessly thinking about games that take gamer expectations and use them in some way to enhance or subvert the experience – like Tunic, which plays with nostalgia for game manuals and secrets from the SNES days, or Inscryption, or Alan Wake 2. In each case there’s a way you think the game should go, and then the designers use your own gaming literacy to challenge those expectations. Can you say more about this small wave of games?”\n\nThis is also a favourite mini-genre of mine, as someone who for both professional and personal reasons has played really a lot of video games. One of the first games like this I ever played was Shadow of the Colossus. Go kill the big monster, the game tells you, as hundreds of games had before. Then you find the first colossus, and it’s just peacefully wandering around. You climb it and slay it, and there’s no fanfare for you. The creature crumples and dies. I felt a little bit sick. Spec Ops: The Line was also famous for doing this: telling the player to kill, then inviting them to feel awful about it. But as you point out, there are plenty more ways to subvert player expectations now. Frog Fractions is a classic; if you know nothing about this game, that’s perfect, just play it. The Stanley Parable was a great comedy-ish entry in this tradition, as is Undertale. And then there’s the recent run of games – Indika, Baby Steps – that mock you and your “gamer brain”. Never forget that Zelda: Breath of the Wild awards you with a poop-shaped trophy if you go to the immense trouble of finding every single Korok seed in the game.

    "description": "The layoffs mark the second round of mass cuts at Amazon since last October, when the company laid off roughly 14,000 employees across its corporate workforce.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"\n\nBeth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\n\n\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"\n\nAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.\n\nThe 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people.\n\nAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.\n\nJassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster.\n\nAmazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest \n\nLast October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.\n\nJassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

    "description": "Reid Hoffman says business leaders are wrong to stay silent and that they have a responsibility to speak up.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders who believe staying quiet about the Trump administration will protect their companies are making a dangerous miscalculation, says Reid Hoffman.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder and tech investor said in an episode of the \"Rapid Response\" podcast published Tuesday that he rejects the idea that executives can simply wait out political turbulence.\n\n\"The theory that if you just keep your mouth shut, the storm will blow over and it won't be a problem — you should be disabused of that theory now,\" Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman is a longtime Democratic donor and one of Silicon Valley's most outspoken political voices. He has backed Democratic candidates and causes for years and has publicly clashed with pro-Trump business leaders, including the White House AI czar, David Sacks.\n\nIn 2024, Hoffman contributed $2 million to a super PAC that spearheaded a write-in campaign for President Joe Biden in New Hampshire.\n\nHoffman said fear of retaliation from the Trump administration has made many business leaders hesitant to speak publicly, but fear is exactly the wrong guide. Executives should speak out instead of rationalizing that \"it's the right thing for my business,\" he added.\n\nHoffman framed public engagement as a responsibility that comes with wealth and power.\n\n\"Human beings first,\" he said. \"Humanity, society, right, you are members of both of those.\"\n\n\"Anyone who's wealthy in the society should be extremely grateful for being part of the society. You have responsibilities,\" he added.\n\nHoffman said he is \"regularly called out by the White House\" and added that it should not be punitive for leaders to speak based on their knowledge and experience.\n\n\"Precisely when you feel fear, you should think about, is this a time for courage?\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be speaking up, and we need to be figuring out how to solve our problems together,\" he added.\n\nHoffman's comments come as some business and tech leaders have broken their silence over the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and the broader immigration crackdown under the Trump administration.\n\nPretti's death — the second killing by federal officers within weeks — has drawn sharp public debate over federal enforcement tactics and accountability.\n\nSome business and tech leaders reacted strongly. Google DeepMind's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wrote in response to a video of the shooting on X that \"this is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nOthers have joined in, including former Meta chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun. LeCun bluntly labelled the footage of the shooting \"Murderers.\"\n\nA group of more than 60 Minnesota-based CEOs signed a letter on Sunday urging \"de-escalation\" and collaboration among state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\nOther CEOs have remained quiet on the issue. Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote Tuesday that business leaders have several reasons for staying silent, including concern that the Trump administration has made it clear it is willing to pressure or punish companies that don't bend to its will.",

    "fullText": "A move that resonates well beyond a simple change of office address sees Ford Motor Company confirmed that its Lincoln luxury brand will shift its corporate headquarters to Michigan Central Station in Detroit in February 2026.\n\nThe new location will house Lincoln’s marketing, sales, and service leadership teams, while design and engineering functions will remain at Ford’s primary Dearborn campus, now anchored by the new Ford World Headquarters.\n\nAt face value, this relocation might look like a real estate shuffle. But for industry watchers with an eye toward long term strategy, it represents a deliberate effort by Ford to reshape Lincoln’s identity and carve out a distinct role for the luxury marque in a crowded and rapidly evolving market.\n\nMichigan Central Station was once one of the most iconic transportation hubs in the United States. It opened in 1913 and served thousands of passengers a day until rail travel declined sharply in the mid-20th century.\n\nAfter lying abandoned for decades, Ford acquired and undertook an extensive renovation of the station and surrounding campus beginning in 2018, creating a 640,000-square-foot innovation district designed to attract tech partners and startups alongside Ford employees.\n\nThis context is important because Ford’s decision to base Lincoln at Michigan Central couldn’t have been simply a branding exercise. It places the luxury brand at the center of a testbed for future technologies, from autonomous systems to new mobility services.\n\nThe innovation district already hosts Ford’s Model e electric vehicle team and external partners like Newlab, creating a synergy that Lincoln’s leadership must hope will fuel fresh thinking.\n\nLincoln, Ford, Michigan Central Station, Detroit, headquarters, relocation, luxury brand, corporate strategy, innovation district, automotive news, Corktown, brand identity, Joaquin Nuño-Whelan.\n\nLincoln has historically been intertwined with Ford corporate operations. Until recently, the brand’s leaders shared office space with Ford’s global executives in Dearborn’s famed Glass House, a mid-century architectural landmark that served as Ford’s headquarters from 1956 until late 2025.\n\nThe new Ford World Headquarters, known internally as “The Hub,” has replaced the Glass House as Ford’s administrative center. It brings thousands of employees into closer collaboration on product development and corporate strategy. But Lincoln’s leadership must have seen an opportunity in stepping outside that central locus.",

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn mid-January, I gathered my staff of 10 for a training session on what to do if ICE agents showed up at my restaurant. It came after days of hearing how concerned the team was following news of an increased presence of ICE agents in Portland.\n\nThis is not the kind of information we, as restaurant workers, are accustomed to needing to know and relay.

I'm acquainted with people who have been taken, and I don't know where they are right now.\n\nMy two children have said there are dozens and dozens of kids in their school not showing up because their parents are afraid for their safety.\n\nEveryone has been holding their breath to see what happens next.\n\nMy restaurant is only two blocks from City Hall in downtown Portland. Scattered around our streets, I know there are ICE agents — they are there in plain sight — and it was understandable that my staff were worried about what to do if they knocked on our door. I had to support my staff by giving them some information and direction regarding what to do if one of the ICE agents showed up.\n\nWe learned agents can enter the restaurant, but they aren't entitled to go into private or locked areas without a judicial warrant (we had to define what this warrant is). We don't have to answer questions from agents, and we're allowed to record their actions and words.\n\nI want my staff to know that, although the presence of these agents feels unpredictable, I'm in this with them. We're in it together. I want to be able to talk about what we can control and understand as much information as possible in preparation.\n\nAlthough I can't fix this situation, I can communicate with the people around me to ensure they know I will support them and I will support their communities.\n\nI've owned my restaurant for 12 years. I'm white. I'm a heterosexual man. I don't present as someone who ICE might come after right now, so I want to use my voice in ways others are frightened to.\n\nI haven't had to close my restaurant's doors yet, but I know several restaurant owners who have had to do so on certain days because so many of their staff were too scared to show up to work. These are people who are legally allowed to be in the United States. These are people with no criminal history. And they are petrified to go to work.\n\nThis is going to dampen our local businesses if ICE agents remain in Portland. It already has.\n\nEditor's note: Business Insider reached out to ICE and CBP for comment.",

    "fullText": "Don't expect to see Sam Altman lamenting the absence of \"masculine energy\" in corporate America to Joe Rogan anytime soon.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO sent employees a message on Slack criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement — and appears to have taken the opportunity to also take a subtle jab at his rival, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe reference can be found where Altman wrote that OpenAI aims to \"not get blown around by changing fashions.\"\n\n\"We didn't start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular,\" Altman told employees.\n\nLast year, Zuckerberg championed a return to masculinity at Meta on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\"\n\n\"The masculine energy, I think, is good,\" Zuckerberg said in the January podcast episode. \"Society has plenty of that, but I think corporate culture was trying to get away from it.\"\n\nZuckerberg described the merits of a corporate culture that \"celebrates the aggression\" of business.\n\nThe Meta CEO said that the intent of corporate culture's shift away from masculinity was good. Women likely feel that companies are \"too masculine,\" he told Rogan, and that things are \"biased\" against them. But the shift had gone too far, the Facebook cofounder said.\n\n\"It's one thing to say we want to be welcoming and make a good environment for everyone,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's another to basically say that masculinity is bad.\"\n\nAltman also wrote in his memo that OpenAI didn't \"become super woke when that was popular.\"\n\nMeta didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Altman's remark.\n\nAltman and Zuckerberg are currently engaged in a talent war for top AI researchers and engineers.\n\nZuckerberg has attempted to poach OpenAI employees with eye-popping compensation packages, which Altman in June said included $100 million signing bonuses.\n\nWhile Altman at the time said that he was happy that \"at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,\" Zuckerberg successfully hired away some prominent OpenAI talent.\n\nThe Meta CEO, who even hand-delivered soup to an OpenAI employee he was attempting to poach, hired away ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao and three researchers who helped build OpenAI's Zurich office.",

    "description": "Entrepreneurs like Kim Magaraci, Seneca Connor, and Gloria Hebert use AI tools like ChatGPT to ditch admin busywork and focus on growth and customers.",
    "fullText": "Over eight years of writing for travel publications, Kim Magaraci developed a passion for domestic travel. She learned that travel tips online couldn't compete with those destinations you could only discover by word-of-mouth.\n\nSo, when she founded her travel business, KGM Travel Design, in 2024, she hoped to emphasize personal relationships with vendors and customers and avoid using AI, despite her experience with it.\n\n\"I don't think you can get good advice asking ChatGPT for an itinerary,\" she says. \"It's antithetical to everything I stand for.\"\n\nAnd yet, Magaraci realized that using AI for administrative tasks like analytics, compiling reports, and generating condensed client briefs allowed her to spend more time on the personalized relationships that set her business apart.\n\nShe's one of many solopreneurs who told Business Insider that outsourcing administrative tasks to AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Nano Banana — Gemini's photo-editing AI — has allowed them to scale their business by spending more time on strategic and creative work, including growth decisions and building personal connections with customers.\n\n\"It's getting harder and harder to deny the time-saving aspects,\" Magaraci says, adding that she has embraced AI \"in order to run a successful business and grow this business into what I want it to be.\"\n\nSeneca Connor, founder of The Bag Icon, an accessories brand, uses Nano Bana and other AI products to edit photos and videos. That not only saves her money — up to $2,000 per monthly photo shoot, she says — but also time.\n\nWith the hours saved, Connor has been able to design more original bags and launch a greater number of bags curated from other designers, all while reducing her marketing costs.\n\nAs a result, The Bag Icon saw more than a 20% year-over-year increase in profits last year, despite the impact of tariffs.\n\nAccountant and solopreneur Gloria Hebert uses ChatGPT for her business, Aybear Services, to instantly create educational client worksheets that previously took an hour or two to set up.\n\nThis frees up time that she then uses to prioritize analyzing financial data from her bookkeeping clients — data she doesn't feed into AI because of privacy concerns. Managing finances is the core of her business, so having more time to spend on that has allowed her to streamline her workdays.\n\nThe time saved also allows her to organize networking events and community education classes for local business owners, which has led to an uptick in business. \"Several of those entrepreneurs hired me to do their books,\" Hebert says.\n\nLisa York is the owner of Sell More Stuff, an email marketing business. Although she has a small audience, she saw a 33% conversion rate for sales last year, she says. She credits that growth to her personalized, voicey emails, which always open with a personal anecdote and are never written with AI.\n\n\"I use a lot of story-led emails,\" York says. \"People enjoy them, and they open the email because they can see my name.\"\n\nThat's something AI just can't replicate, she says. But York is able to spend time drafting engaging copy because she outsources other tasks — including tech support for her website, research, and brainstorming marketing strategy — to ChatGPT.\n\nLike York, Connor uses the time that AI saves to build robust communication and rapport with her customers, which she says builds loyalty to her business. Less time spent on photos and video gives her more time to respond to emails and direct messages from clients seeking advice about their purchases.\n\n\"It's building community that's missing in the big brands,\" Connor says.\n\nWhile AI has allowed these solopreneurs to grow their businesses without hiring a team, the technology shouldn't take over the core aspects of a business, Hebert says. Rather, it can be a tool that allows owners to focus on those critical areas.\n\n\"Use it as a resource,\" she says.\n\nYork — whose target clientele are other solopreneurs — says she's seeing more people recognize that. \"People aren't scared of it anymore,\" she says.\n\nConnor plans to expand her use of AI this year. She's experimenting with a digital clone — a video avatar that can deliver a script explaining new products. That approach will save her time on filming videos, but she says she'll always be the one dishing out the original advice that her clients have come to trust.\n\nEven if a video is created using AI, Connor says, \"all thoughts, ideas, and suggestions — those are my own.\"",

    "description": "The horse toy with an upside-down snout has resonated with tired corporates across the country.",
    "fullText": "A horse toy in China meant to be a Lunar New Year decoration has turned into a symbol of corporate agony on Chinese social media.\n\nThe red horse toy in question, made by the shop Happy Sisters in China's western Yiwu city, features an upside-down snout, giving it a morose look at odds with its festival golden bell. Per the Chinese zodiac, the incoming year will be the year of the horse.\n\nThe seller told local media that a shop worker had accidentally sewn the horse's smile upside down, turning it into a frown. But after the toy went viral on social media, the shop decided to produce more of the defective toy.\n\nHappy Sisters did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor many Chinese workers, the crying horse came to represent permission to be vulnerable — rare in the country's high-pressure work culture. China is infamous for its grueling 9-9-6 work culture, which means 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.\n\nA user, He Qingshan, wrote on RedNote earlier this month that the doll is \"healing in a high-pressure society.\"\n\nPriced at about 25 Chinese yuan, or $3.60, its affordability helped it spread quickly online, turning it into a \"national-level emo doll\" and a form of \"collective emotional projection,\" they wrote.\n\nAnother person on RedNote, Liang Chenxing, said in a post in January that the horse's \"drooping mouth\" had \"struck a chord with contemporary workers.\" The post received more than 1,000 likes.\n\n\"Who hasn't had moments when they want to cry but still have to hold it together?\" the user wrote.\n\nOn the platform, creators have begun placing the horse beside their office computers, posting photos with captions like: \"Me when my proposal gets rejected.\"\n\nOne RedNote user described keeping it on their desk as having \"a little companion that understands all your fatigue and your dreams.\"\n\n\"It's okay to cry on the face, but life must always be moving forward!\" they wrote.\n\nMark Tanner, the managing director of Chinese consumer research firm China Skinny, said he wasn't sure he believed the manufacturing error story, but it was a smart business move nonetheless.\n\n\"This has been happening for some years, particularly with movements like lying flat, but it captures a general psyche where many Chinese consumers are feeling less optimistic at the moment,\" Tanner said.\n\nJacob Cooke, the CEO of Beijing-based e-commerce consulting firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that \"younger consumers are increasingly comfortable acknowledging stress in light, ironic ways.\"\n\n\"Consumer products and internet memes can act as outlets for discussing work pressure, especially on platforms like Xiaohongshu, where consumer culture and emotional expression are tightly intertwined,\" Cooke said.\n\nHe compared the crying horse toy to Chinese toymaker Pop Mart's \"ugly-cute\" IPs, Labubu and Crybaby.\n\nAnd Jason Yu, the managing director of Beijing-based CTR Market Research, said the handmade sewing mistake on the toy resonated with audiences because it did not feel like a \"cold assembly-line product.\"\n\n\"The emotional value the toy conveys is higher than any perfect toy can provide,\" Yu said.",

We then took the geometric mean of the ones that pay at least $75,000, based on 2024 median annual wage data, and are expected to need more workers, based on projected employment growth from 2024 to 2034. We then ranked the jobs, with the larger the geometric mean, the better the rank.\n\nMany of the top 12 fell into one of three job groups: construction and extraction; protective service; or installation, maintenance, and repair.\n\nFirst-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers took the top spot. Employment of these supervisors is expected to grow by 49,000 from its 2024 level, and they typically make about $79,000 annually. It's also one of the roles that typically don't require a degree, but often require job seekers to have relevant experience.\n\nEmployers may be interested in candidates with higher educational attainment.

    "description": "All seven new management committee members come from Goldman Sachs' growing asset and wealth management division, which oversees $3.6 trillion.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs just announced seven new power players it's vaulting to its most powerful echelon — and the fact that they all sit in the same division tells you something about where the bank is headed.\n\nThe firm's management committee — currently 41 members — is adding seven seats for partners the bank appointed on Monday. All sit within the asset and wealth management business, which holds $3.6 trillion in assets, offering a snapshot about who's gaining influence at the highest levels of 200 West Street.\n\nThe executives run businesses spanning private credit, public investing, alternatives, and wealth management.\n\n\"The opportunity to continue to grow our franchise across AWM is a core strategic objective for the firm, and this group of leaders will help us advance our goals,\" CEO David Solomon said in an accompanying statement.\n\nThe management committee is Goldman's most senior governing body, responsible for overseeing strategy, capital allocation, and top leadership decisions. Its members still meet weekly to set the bank's agenda.\n\nTwo longtime leaders are stepping down from the committee, the bank said — Vice Chairman Richard Gnodde and Asset Management Chairman Rich Friedman — bringing the new tally to 46 people who collectively steer the firm.\n\nThe new management committee members are:\n\nThe leadership updates also mean new roles for Mallory and Somaiya — both partners, who have spent more than 25 years each at Goldman, are currently leaders in the private banking group. Now, they'll assume the title of global co-heads of wealth management.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Goldman said private banking and lending revenue rose 16% in 2025, while assets under supervision across asset and wealth management climbed to a record $3.6 trillion, driven by management fees, lending activity, and client inflows.\n\nTheir appointments come as the bank steels itself for what it hopes will be a gangbuster year for business — maybe even rivaling storied 2021 levels.\n\nBut Goldman is also facing mounting competition from all corners of Wall Street — intensifying battles for clients and talent, and a more crowded market for private credit and wealth services.\n\nUnder Solomon's tenure, Goldman has spent several years pursuing a broader effort to grow its asset and wealth management business, making it a more well-rounded institutional investor active across multiple asset classes.\n\nIn late 2022, the firm moved Marc Nachmann, a former senior investment banker, into the role of running the merged Asset & Wealth Management division, combining them under the same roof. Since then, Goldman has worked to operate the businesses as one integrated platform, spanning public investing, private markets, private credit, and private wealth. Over the past three years, the business' collective assets under supervision have swelled more than $1 trillion from about $2.5 trillion at the end of 2022.\n\nAnd the bank has pursued a multi-year effort to connect those businesses through its One Goldman Sachs initiative, designed to encourage cross-collaboration and -pollination of commercial opportunities between bankers and financial advisors who can share the same clients and maximize profits.",

You have several reasons to be quiet.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not asking you to launch an ad campaign, or order up some performative Instagram posts, or any other kind of corporate theatre.\n\nJust say the thing you believe is right: It's wrong for masked federal agents to kill protesters in the streets, and that you condemn it.\n\nYou can go further if you'd like. Perhaps a call for the Trump administration to take accountability for its agents' actions. Maybe you can ask for a truly independent investigation into Pretti's killing. Whatever your conscience tells you.\n\nAnd yes, I know that it's easier for me to say this than for you to do it. There could be consequences for you and your companies when you speak out: Most people are appalled by Pretti's death, but not all of them.\n\nShortly after Pretti's death, Trump administration officials described him as a \"would-be assassin\" who \"wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\" — characterizations without evidence, but meant to justify Pretti's death. On Saturday, Trump posted a photo of a gun administration officials say was removed from Pretti, and argued that \"ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do!\" In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that the administration was \"reviewing everything\" about the shooting, but said that overall, his agents had done a \"phenomenal job\" in Minnesota.\n\nSo there could be real risk for you. But the bigger risk is silence.\n\nThat's because your silence tells everyone who is appalled by Pretti's death that they shouldn't speak up, either. That gives the federal government the tacit permission to carry on.\n\nSo say you're against that. Now. Before it stops shocking you.",

    "title": "8 Americans explain how capitalism has shaped — and failed — their lives",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke to readers in their 20s to 80s about what capitalism means to them and why some of them are rethinking the system.",
    "fullText": "Business Insider recently launched our Future of Capitalism series to examine shifting attitudes about capitalism, fairness, opportunity, hard work, and success in the US — everything from the federal government's role in the economy to the change in how capitalism is being taught in high schools.\n\nWe also wanted to hear directly from you, our readers, about how America's economic system has shaped your life.\n\nHundreds of you weighed in, and several people agreed to be interviewed to share more deeply their experiences, uncertainty, frustration, and cautious optimism — a revealing snapshot of how capitalism is being reassessed in real time, across generations.\n\nAn 81-year-old woman in California living on Social Security described spending her life climbing a hill that keeps getting steeper. A 54-year-old in Las Vegas says he's still waiting for boomers to pass his generation the baton. A 25-year-old from Tennessee who enlisted in the military to pay for college said the system isn't really working, while a 64-year-old New Jersey retiree called capitalism the \"greatest economic system in the world.\"\n\nBelow, we highlight eight people's personal experiences of capitalism. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAlex English, 38, is based in Tampa, FL, and is currently unemployed after being laid off.\n\nI've been unemployed for a year and a half. Before being laid off, I lived in LA and worked in marketing and communications at a startup. I was making almost $125,000 and still felt poor.\n\nCapitalism makes us think we constantly need more: to shop more, to accumulate more, to keep up. I'm back in Tampa, where I grew up, because I didn't have the savings to sustain my life in LA.\n\nI don't feel great about my ability to improve my situation through hard work alone. I've relentlessly networked to find a full-time job, taken on freelance work, and gotten a retail job. I'm working harder than I ever have and yet making significantly less money than before.\n\nWe're inheriting a system that feels ultimately outdated. Everything from private property and ownership to the climate crisis feels unsustainable. We're paying into Social Security, and that may not be there for us when we're retirement age.\n\nSince my layoff, I've been reading a lot about economics and business. Is there another way that we could be doing things? My generation — millennials — is in favor of something kinder and more egalitarian than the policies we've seen since the Reagan era. Not because we're lazy or unwilling to work hard, but because we believe all people deserve basic rights and dignity, and that American exceptionalism is dead in the world.\n\nHarish Bhandari, 64, Cape May, New Jersey. He retired from his job in the advertising industry at 59.\n\nI'm happily retired. I spent my entire career in advertising and marketing — worked on Madison Avenue, then spent 23 or 24 years at an agency in Minneapolis, and 15 years at my last company.\n\nCapitalism is the greatest economic system in the world. As long as you're willing to work hard over a long period of time, you're going to be rewarded, and success should follow.\n\nI didn't grow up wealthy. I lived in Darien, Connecticut. My father was from India, and my mom was German. She grew up during the war and didn't go to college. My father passed away when I was 13. I'm not going to say we were poor, but we weren't wealthy. I'm thankful I've worked hard my whole life and made some good moves.\n\nThe obvious legacy my generation is leaving is that we're able to pass generational wealth to our kids. I'm an early baby boomer. Boomers get a hard time as far as having been lucky, but I think we've also worked very hard. Sometimes you create your own luck that way. We didn't have social media and cellphones, so we didn't have a lot of things bombarding us that would distract us from what we believed was important.\n\nI currently have a very high level of trust in our economic institutions because it's about the free market. As long as the institutions provide security and stability, the market has always worked as far as this country has been around. When you try to start messing with that market, that's the problem.\n\nMatthew Doutt, 25, Knoxville, Tennessee. He's an accountant.\n\nIn my senior year of high school, a military recruiter sat down with me and explained the average in-state college tuition. I didn't see any options to earn my degree that didn't involve the military or going into debt.\n\nI knew college was expensive, and my parents were kind of pushing me toward the military for that reason. Once I enlisted, I realized many other people there were in the same boat, or very similar boats, as I was. I'm grateful for the benefits from the military, but my mental health was at an all-time low during my time in the Guard. It's a travesty that any American would need to sign a contract that could result in their death to pay for a degree without going into debt.\n\nEven after I finished my bachelor's degree in 2022, the firm I started working at wasn't a good fit, so I left. I couldn't find work for four months. I was completely reliant on the Guard again, this time to pay my bills. That was another moment when I realized this system really isn't working as intended.\n\nI now hold both my bachelor's and master's degrees, as well as a CPA license. I worked hard for them, but I wouldn't have been able to earn my bachelor's degree without the Guard, and I wouldn't have been able to get my CPA license without my firm paying for it.\n\nI believe my generation has inherited difficult circumstances. Corporations are more concentrated, and the US DOJ has been less empowered than ever to break up monopolies.\n\nI want to trust these major institutions and systems because they don't improve if you don't believe in them. At the same time, if what they're doing isn't good to begin with, it's kind of hard to trust them.\n\nJeremy Holmes, 40, lives in Denver. He is a senior developer in the furniture import industry.\n\nMy dad is what I'd call a bad capitalist, because he takes care of his employees. He owns an IT firm, and I worked for him until I was in my early 30s. He was a firm believer that hard work will get you far in life. And it did; he was a kid of immigrants, and he clawed his way out. My mom is Lakota, grew up on various reservations, and got out.\n\nMy parents have a very nice upper-middle-class life. They're not yacht-money people. My dad went from working as a 12 or 14-year-old in a print shop and has always had that \"work hard and you will be rewarded\" mentality. I was raised with that. Then I entered the workforce and started looking around. The hard workers aren't the ones who are getting paid the most.\n\nI feel the people working in the factory are working much harder than the people on the other side of the office. I'm fortunate enough to be on that other side because I got a leg up from my parents. I don't see a way for people to claw their way into a comfortable living if they weren't born into it.\n\nMy main concern is being a programmer in the AI era. I've been doing this for most of my life. I can stay above it, but I'm more worried than I was before. I don't see how anyone can bring a child into this world and not be terrified for them. I have plenty of friends who are not doing as well, and I used to tell them to get into IT; I can't even tell them that anymore.\n\nJenni Abbott,71, lives in Antioch, IL. She works as a principal scientist.\n\nI don't believe that hard work alone plays any significant role in an outcome. Not working hard can cost you your job. Working hard does not guarantee any sort of success.\n\nI left the industry for about 20 years to be a stay-at-home mom of four kids. When I was 42, my husband died suddenly. I went into education. I was first a kindergarten aide for three years, and then a high school registrar for six. I was lucky enough to get a job as an associate toxicologist. We were literally running out of money at that point.\n\nI've now been with the same company for over 20 years. While I'm not completely satisfied with how I was rewarded in my career, I also understand that I am doing better than a great number of people out there, and I'm relatively financially secure. One of the reasons I'm still working is that I don't want to be that poor.\n\nI'm all for a mixed system. I believe capitalism is a good start, but I don't believe it's a good ending place. I believe that additional resources need to be there for it to be successful, and there needs to be support in place so everybody has the same chances at upward mobility.\n\nI don't think we baby boomers lived up to our potential for what we should've left behind for the next generation. Social safety nets are important for a lot of people, and we could have done a much better job of preparing our country for that.\n\nKathy Curtis, 81, lives in California. She works part-time in customer service and data entry for a local water company.\n\nI started out like everybody else with the expectation that you grow up, get married, have children, and live happily ever after, which is what we were taught. That didn't happen for me because within a year of following the plan, all of a sudden, I was a single parent. At one point, I was working four jobs.\n\nI didn't have the strength to branch out into other fields of study or work to try to get ahead because I was so busy trying to just maintain everything. From my 20s to my 40s, I felt I could keep climbing up the hill. I think after my 40s, in general, that hill got steeper, and not as many people were able to climb it.\n\nI'll struggle for the rest of my life. My main income at this point is Social Security, and I still work two days a week, earning $18 an hour in a customer service and data entry role for a local water company. I've learned how to not look like a poor person when I am one, and not live like one. So much of life is attitude.\n\nKirk Reynolds, 54, lives in Las Vegas. He is an architect.\n\nI entered the workforce in 1997 and have spent the last 28 years working as an architect. I worry a lot about the future liquidity of Social Security because if we don't have Social Security in 10 years' time, I don't know what I'll do.\n\nI'm fortunate to now own my home outright, but it took a lot of sacrifice over the years to get there. I didn't travel or spend a lot of extra money; it was a deliberate and challenging choice. However, wages have somewhat stalled out. I earn more now than I did when I started in the workforce, but after 28 years, I don't earn much more. I was around 28 when I started my 401(k), and I have less than $100,000 in it 20-some years later. I'll be lucky if there's $115,000 in there when I retire.\n\nI think part of the problem is the boomer generation; they're among the oldest people in our society now, and a lot of them just haven't left the CEO roles, the managerial roles. I'm not sure if that's purely because they can't afford to retire, or if there's also an element of ego involved, but I'm 54, and I'm still waiting for them to finally pass the baton to the next generation.\n\nI'm worried that my generation will be skipped because all of a sudden, when the leaders in their 70s and 80s finally retire, they'll give the roles to the 40-year-olds.\n\nIt's sad because I think Gen X would do a very good job of leading. We are the bridge generation, born at a time when we can recall how things were in the 1970s, and how things are now.\n\nGabrielle Benson, 29, lives in Chicago. She works in inclusion and experience at a tech company.\n\nI'm on the cusp of millennial and Gen Z. There was so much transition, development, and growth that we came up through. Some people in my generation think capitalism is great and were able to benefit from that change, but a lot of us recognize its more negative impact.\n\nWe're coming from a background in the post-recession, post-Obama, post-social media era. We don't see the American dream as a gilded promise the way previous generations did.\n\nI grew up Black and middle-class in Washington, DC. But I went to a private boarding school for high school, so I've had proximity to a lot of wealth. The experience of being at this school and then going home to my mom, who worked two jobs, compared to the other parents, who worked just as hard, but had institutional knowledge or advantages that we didn't, started opening my eyes. Hard work is not valued equally under this system.\n\nInequity is not a side effect of capitalism; it is a condition required for it to function. Instead of family stories about hard work granting stability or prosperity, we have stories about hard work being stolen or dismissed by the systems meant to reward it.\n\nThere are so many factors outside an average person's control that can determine their success: the job market, housing market, healthcare, race, sex, and gender. I have a corporate job, a degree, and retirement accounts, and it still feels like it can all be taken away by factors outside my control.\n\nI think we have a lot of opportunities as millennials. We're still young; we can still make a lot of change, but I think it will require a lot of unlearning the knowledge we were passed down, like the idea that you just have to work hard.\n\nI don't think that we're going to have a different system in our lifetime. Maybe that's something our grandkids might be able to experience. We're going to have to navigate and manage capitalism.\n\nShare your thoughts about capitalism in America by filling out our survey.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "fullText": "I did some AI consulting for computer vision. A lot of times, the value that I brought to the company was telling them not to use AI. I was the AI expert, and they described the problem, and I said, “Don’t use AI.” This is my value add.\n\nLast year, I went through some exercises to clarify what I do for clients. I ended up with descriptions of various lengths, but still felt like I needed something shorter and more generic.

Now, it’s time to define the title in more detail.\n\nMy commitment to AI/ML success and to serving people and causes I care about is a large part of why I work independently rather than as an employee. It makes it easier to say no to unnecessary projects, and avoid going down the path of reluctant data engineering.\n\nMy current LinkedIn tagline is “helping climate tech founders ship AI/ML solutions that support multi-million dollar growth goals”. This means my typical leads have a low chance of success, as more than 90% of startups and 80% of AI/ML projects fail.

    "fullText": "As kids, there was always that one place we begged our parents to take us to, or got excited about visiting for a birthday party or a school field trip.\n\nAfter all, kids' fixations are simple: Give them pizza and entertainment, and they'll happily stay occupied for hours. When a business offers both, it often becomes a welcome break for parents as well.\n\nEveryone has their own version of that place, whether it's Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster's, or Main Event. Over the years, these spots have become go-to destinations for families across the country. In Texas, however, one chain has long stood apart as a source of Lone Star pride.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza began in 1964 as a small restaurant called \"The Pizza Place\" in Stephenville, Texas. Five years later, it relocated to Austin and was renamed Mr Gatti's, in honor of the founder's wife's maiden name.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Mr Gatti's brand expanded into a chain and introduced buffet-style dining, an innovation that helped distinguish it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the Austin restaurant predated the first Chuck E. Cheese location (which opened in San Jose, California, in 1977), Mr Gatti's didn't really jump onto the entertainment-plus-pizza trend until the 1980s. The concept quickly won over families, and today Mr Gatti's Pizza operates more than 200 locations across Texas and the southeastern U.S.\n\nIndustry experts say this hybrid model has become increasingly valuable as traditional casual dining struggles to compete for consumers. According to a 2025 McKinsey & Company survey, 45% of surveyed consumers have reduced their spending at pizza restaurants.\n\n\"When there's good entertainment and good experiences, check averages go up,\" Downtown Restaurant Investments President and BYOD CEO Dave Dittenber told Restaurant Dive.\n\nDittenber added that entertainment only works when paired with strong service and quality food.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza has sold a majority stake in its business to OneRyan Global LLC, the family office of businessman and philanthropist G. Brint Ryan, according to a press release. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nOneRyan has been a franchisee of Mr Gatti's Pizza since 2022, but its involvement with the brand has steadily expanded.\n\nIn September 2025, OneRyan acquired a minority stake in the company and, a month later, purchased a corporate-owned restaurant at South Park Meadows in Austin. That transaction completed Mr Gatti's Pizza's transition to a fully franchised system and concluded the re-franchising of all company-owned locations.",

Debt rated in the CCC tier, the lowest ratings that commonly trade in the US, gained 1.15% this year through Thursday’s close on a total return basis. That’s better than just about every other kind of US debt, including other types of junk bonds. Treasuries are down about 0.2%, according to Bloomberg index data.",

    "title": "How business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis",
    "description": "The killing of Alex Pretti, a US citizen, by ICE in Minneapolis on Saturday has drawn sharp responses from many Americans, including business leaders.",
    "fullText": "Federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a US citizen in Minneapolis — the second fatal shooting involving ICE officers this month — adding more fuel to an already explosive national debate over immigration enforcement.\n\nThe killing sparked an outcry on Minneapolis streets, as well as online, eliciting sharp responses from all sides, including leaders in the business and tech communities.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, for instance, wrote in a post on X that it was \"time to take the temperature down before more lives are lost.\"\n\nMinnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, criticized the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for what they said were overly aggressive tactics. The DHS, meanwhile, defended its agents, arguing that they are being provoked by unruly protesters and an uncooperative city government and police.\n\nThousands of ICE officers began descending on Minnesota on December 1 as part of Operation Metro Surge. The DHS says it is targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state and has deployed over 2,000 ICE agents across Minnesota.\n\nResidents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been protesting since the federal immigration agents arrived. Those demonstrations grew more intense after the first fatal shooting on January 7. In that incident, ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good, 37, as she tried to drive away in a car.\n\nHere's how business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest violence.\n\nThe hedge-fund billionaire called for calm in an X post on Saturday, lamenting that the United States had reached a point where \"there are only two sides to every issue and every incident.\"\n\n\"Individuals are 'convicted' of serious crimes in the headlines, by politicians appealing to their base, and ultimately in the minds of the public, or they are exonerated, before all of the facts are in and a detailed investigation has been completed,\" He wrote. \"This is not good for America.\"\n\nJust two hours later, in another post on X, Ackman laid the blame on Minnesota's state government.\n\n\"It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner,\" he said, tagging Walz. \"Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences.\"\n\nLike Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. He has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE \"out of control.\"\n\nIn another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out \"chronically online tech leaders\" for suddenly falling quiet. Another X user called on business and tech leaders to use their platform to stand up to the Trump administration and its immigration enforcement tactics, to which Hoffman replied, \"It's time for all Americans to do so.\"\n\nJeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: \"This is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nMinneapolis police confirmed that Pretti, who was filming ICE agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun.\n\nBorder Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot.\n\nJason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular \"All-In\" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\"Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,\" he wrote. \"True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.\"\n\nHe later posted that \"all of this violence\" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally.\n\nCristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident \"indefensible\" in a post on X.\n\n\"The victim's legally owned handgun was removed from the scene, and then ICE agents shot him multiple times. It's far from law enforcement — it's just murder,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Those who defend this don't care about law or order. It's about money, power, and protecting an executive branch that's already been bought and paid for.\"",

    "title": "5 acquisitions, winning over skeptical engineers, and spending tens of millions: Inside a public company's 'AI native' push",
    "description": "Amplitude gave Business Insider the inside look at its AI overhaul, from acquisitions to efforts to increase staff adoption of AI coding assistants.",
    "fullText": "There's a long banner hanging in Amplitude's San Francisco office. It reads: \"NO MAGICAL THINKING.\"\n\nNo, it's not some rag on Joan Didion. It's a reminder, CEO Spenser Skates told Business Insider, that technology can never replace deep thinking and hard work. In the AI age, that reminder is more important than ever — so much so that employees must look up at it every day.\n\nAmplitude, an 800-person, publicly traded analytics company, is undergoing an AI transformation — with the goal of reinvigorating its business.\n\nAmplitude went public in September 2021 at the height of the pandemic, climbing to an all-time closing high of $84.80 per share several weeks later before dropping significantly and largely plateauing in in recent years around $10. It closed at $10.25 on Friday.\n\nSince October 2024, the company has acquired five AI startups. Amplitude hired an AI-savvy engineering head and appointed one of its acquired founders to a new AI leadership position. It got Cursor and GitHub Copilot licenses for employees, and ran a heads-down AI week.\n\nIt's a change many companies are making: Rapidly moving from little-to-no AI to trying to become \"AI native,\" a term that's curiously hard to pin down. Large language models are popping up everywhere in white-collar work as companies chase the promise of efficiency gains.\n\nAmplitude's case may be especially informative, given just how skeptical of AI its CEO was. In 2023 and some of 2024, Skates said he viewed the AI industry as full of \"grifters,\" the visionaries promising to end world hunger and salesmen promising to automate everything.\n\n\"It had all sorts of problems,\" Skates said. By mid-2024, he realized \"there's probably going to be a breakthrough in the analytics space in the next two or three years.\"\n\n\"We've got to go make that ourselves,\" he said. \"So, we went all in.\"\n\nSkates had two opening moves for his AI overhaul.\n\nThe first: hiring a new chief engineering officer with a history in AI. Wade Chambers had advised the company since 2016, while holding leadership roles at Twitter and Included Health.\n\nWhen Chambers joined in October 2024, only 1% of the engineering, product, and design teams at Amplitude were using AI.\n\nThe second was the acquisition of Command AI, a chatbot startup. It was the first of a string of acquisitions, including June, Kraftful, and Inari. Amplitude announced its most recent acquisition, InfiniGrow, on January 14.\n\nYana Welinder was CEO of Kraftful, one of Amplitude's acquisition targets. Kraftful could spot power users of its product, one of whom was Amplitude's then-CPO. She reached out, and they chatted in February. The deal closed in July, and Welinder was named Amplitude's head of AI. A company blog post with an introductory Q&A referred to her as \"AI maven.\"\n\nWelinder's first order of business: speeding the company up. Kraftful shipped new product every week. Amplitude was shipping less than monthly.\n\n\"If you have this cadence of shipping infrequently, then the team slows down, which isn't appropriate in the age of AI,\" she said.\n\n\"Analytics will look very different 6 months from now,\" Skates wrote in his email. \"We have the opportunity to be the AI native company in Analytics and we are going to pull every piece of firepower we have.\"\n\nHe also asked employees to share a coming launch on X, as opposed to LinkedIn, because that's \"where the AI natives are.\"\n\nHow much has Amplitude spent on AI, from tools to acquisitions? \"Tens of millions, for sure,\" Skates said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it got past $100 million.\"\n\nThen comes the harder part: convincing employees to really use the tools.\n\nWhile some engineers are excited about AI's promise, others are skeptical about its helpfulness, or worried about possible job losses. Not every engineer is as gung ho about AI as their management is.\n\nSkates said that engineers were especially sensitive to the \"grifting\" that went on in AI, making many of them skeptical. With a bottoms-up approach, that skepticism dissipates, he said.\n\nSoon after joining, Chambers began planning an \"AI week\" for the first week of June. It took six months of prep and borrowed heavily from Facebook's mobile push. He took the entire engineering, product, and design team offline for the week. To kick off, Chambers required that leaders get onstage and vibe-code something in front of the entire company.\n\n\"It didn't go well,\" Chambers said of the live vibe-coding demonstration. \"They had to work through it. They had to re-prompt a couple of different ways.\"\n\nBut the message stuck, he said. Leaders who weren't coding all day were able to build something \"pretty cool\" within the hourlong session, save a few hiccups.\n\nAdditional momentum came from the \"zealots,\" engineers passionate about exploring the new tech (some of whom Chambers brought over from his prior job). These engineers lead by example, he said.\n\nAmplitude shared its internal data tracking how many employees use its AI tools. In the final week of March, 14 employees were actively using Cursor. That figure peaked in the first week of December — after AI week but before the holiday vacation cycle — at 174 employees.\n\nAnd what of the thorny question about AI implementation in the enterprise: ROI? After all, a 2025 MIT study indicated 95% of firms publicly disclosing use of AI pilots reported no measurable ROI.\n\nAfter implementing these tools, developer productivity shot up 40% and stayed there, Chambers said. On some specific engineering teams, those gains looks more like 300-400%, he said.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people who are thinking they're the world's best expert at something,\" Chambers said. \"Increasingly, even the most cynical team members have come around.\"",

    "description": "80-year-old Robin Blair runs his family's greengrocer's, founded in 1875. He started helping in the business at age 5 and says he will never retire.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with greengrocer Robin Blair, 80, the owner of JJ Blair & Sons in Darlington, in the North-East of England. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWe have an old saying in our family: \"There are two chairs that will kill you in life — the electric chair and the armchair.\"\n\nCapital punishment won't apply to me, or at least I hope not! And there's no way I'll retire to put my feet up and sit in front of the TV.\n\nIt's not in my nature, or my blood. My father, Joe, worked in our greengrocery, founded in 1875, until he was in his nineties.\n\nYou could say I joined the trade when I was a few months old in 1940. We're based at an indoor market, and my mother would tuck me under the counter while she served the customers.\n\nYou were expected to help at the nursery almost as soon as you could walk. By the time I was 5, I'd be sowing seeds, planting cabbage, and looking after tomatoes.\n\nMy siblings and I — including my younger brother, Keith, my business partner until he died in 2013 — were given our own plot of land to work.\n\nWe were allowed to keep the proceeds. I used to grow vegetables with an easy return, like lettuce, because they matured quickly. There was a friendly rivalry among us kids over who made the biggest profit.\n\nI couldn't wait to leave school at 15 and work full-time, even though it was physically demanding at times. We grew everything ourselves until we began moving toward wholesale.\n\nYou spent the morning harvesting and washing the produce. Then you'd load up the wooden cart and our trusty horse, Bobby, would pull it three-and-a-half miles to the market.\n\nMy grandfather, Jack, who established JJ Blair & Sons 150 years ago, was a proud man and wouldn't let Bobby leave without polishing his harness. Neither he nor my dad would dream of having a mechanical vehicle. Everything was horse-drawn.\n\nBack then, the market ran from 3 p.m. to midnight. The manager would ring a bell at 9 p.m., signaling that you could start auctioning the stuff you had left over.\n\nIt was fun shouting out your wares to attract the highest bidder. There was no refrigeration in those days, and you'd take the leftovers back to the nursery to compost.\n\nOur motto was \"More flash, more cash,\" meaning that the better the produce appeared, the more money you made. I still live by that rule.\n\nThe apples gleam on our stand, and the bananas are at the right stage of ripeness. We grow our own soft fruits in our greenhouses, including strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. They always look delicious.\n\nI also pride myself on writing the signs that show the prices, both in pounds, ounces, and kilograms. The letters are spelled out nicely. It's a bit like doing calligraphy.\n\nThe glory days were the 1960s, 70s, and much of the 80s. The indoor and outdoor markets were bustling with nearly 200 stands. They were right in the center of town, a hub of activity.\n\nThen the big supermarkets came along. It changed everything. They're fighting among themselves over pricing, undercutting us, and it's hard to compete. People like the ease of going to them, especially with the free parking.\n\nStill, we have many loyal customers. Sadly, we're the only greengrocers left in the market today. Shoppers come for the fresh produce, the personal service, and the lively conversation.\n\nA strong work ethic was instilled in me as a child, and I have no problem getting up at 4:30 a.m. daily to prepare for the market, which opens at 8 a.m.\n\nI usually get back to the nursery around 3 p.m., where we also grow bedding plants. My working day can last until 8 or even 10 p.m. in the summer, to take advantage of the lighter nights.\n\nThis trade has given me a better life than I could have hoped for. I wish Keith were still here, but I'm delighted to be running the business at 80.\n\nIt makes me sad to think what might happen after I'm gone. When I ask my daughter, Alyson, if she'll continue in the family tradition, she'll laugh and say, \"Never say never.\"\n\nMeanwhile, my long-suffering wife, Alwyn, keeps me happy and healthy, and I keep a positive outlook. It's my 81st birthday in May, and I plan to keep going for years after then.\n\nDo you have a story about working a job longer than most? Please email Jane Ridley at jridley@businessinsider.com",

    "fullText": "Kyle Elliott, who's been a full-time career coach since 2017, spends his days helping tech employees solve their most challenging work issues.\n\nHe's noticed a common problem among clients: difficult bosses, including micromanagers.\n\nOne key mistake employees make when they're trying to fix a problem, Elliot told Business Insider, is venting to the wrong person — particularly your boss.\n\nIt makes sense to push back against a difficult boss when their behaviour or expectations are disrupting your work, said Elliot, who is based in California. But venting to them will rarely make the situation better, but nearly always damage trust, he added.\n\nEven if you have a good relationship, it would be more appropriate to vent to a friend, family member, or career coach. They can also help you brainstorm solutions.\n\n\"Your boss is not your therapist. You want to come to them with solutions, or at least a clear sense of how they can help you improve the situation or the working relationship,\" he said. \"If you want a promotion, you want your boss to view you as someone who is thoughtful and solution-oriented, not someone who complains.\"\n\nWhen you organize the feedback session with a difficult boss, choose a private setting, such as in a 1-1 meeting, and interlace constructive feedback with positive remarks about things they do that you like.\n\nAnother common issue Elliott encounters is clients misusing their time with him by ranting about their struggles with their boss and what's frustrating them, he said.\n\n\"They often believe they must provide extensive context in order to receive effective coaching, but this isn't true,\" he said.\n\n\"You can vent,\" Elliot added, but \"it's a very expensive venting session.\" While it may feel cathartic, you're better off airing your frustrations to a friend and using your paid coaching session to outline what you can change, such as what battles with your boss to choose, or how to communicate better with them.\n\n\"Coaching is about empowering you, not venting about your manager. Your boss isn't in the coaching session. You are,\" he said.\n\nRead more of Elliott's tips for dealing with a difficult boss.",

    "fullText": "The global elite of Davos probably isn't what you think of when you think about spunky Business Insider. But we sent a small editorial team to bring you the best of it — BI-style — and I want to tell you about it.\n\nAki Ito is our chief correspondent on careers, a huge topic for Davos — and for us. She asked people across business tough questions about the future of work (believe me, I was in the room) to help bring insights for your success. She also moderated a conversation with chief people officers from companies across the business world. You'll see her takeaways from that soon.\n\nBen Bergman on tech, same thing. Ben is a leading scoop-getter and thinker on our crackerjack tech team. We know you care about tech from every angle — innovation, work, investments, culture, productivity hacks, fun. Ben was all over town meeting with people and moderating panels so that we can be in-the-know on what's in and what's out for you. You might have caught Ben on CNN twice last week!\n\nDan DeFrancesco is the lead writer on this newsletter every weekday. As you know, it's a smart, witty read across tech, markets, and business — the opposite of aggregation that's common in newsletters. So it's important for us to make sure Dan has the widest view of what's going on in the world. As he hustled around, Dan also wrote our new pop-up Davos Diary newsletter every day last week. We hope to do more special editions to meet these moments!\n\nKim Last leads our live journalism — events like panels and conferences IRL, and live conversations online. We put on three events at Davos, convening some of the most interesting and in-the-flow people on the mountain. We'll keep you informed of what's on our calendar, as conversing with the audience we're serving is a top priority at BI right now. (Kim also got a now-famous hair blowout at the start of the week — Davos hack!)\n\nWe know not everyone can make it across the world. That's why, in addition to the special newsletter, we did a daily live blog, bringing you everything from the serious to the wacky. Across last week, we did 180 posts, not just from the five of us, but from reporters and editors who did an excellent job following the chatter from around the world. Those blogs, and our wrap post, are available here.\n\nWhat about me? I was there doing the Davos thing — meetings, moderations. But I also made a point to snap some photos of the fabulous fashion. You can find all that we gathered on that fun front here.\n\nAll of which is to say, we dive into the biggest things happening in the world, in our style, for you.\n\nPlease stay in touch at eic@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "I recently launched Trivet, and I've enjoyed seeing people install it on websites ranging from personal homepages to business blogs.\n\nBefore AI, Trivet would have taken me a few weeks to build. Now, Codex wrote the first version in 40 minutes.\n\nIn the past, building software was so difficult that launching something was impressive in and of itself. But as things get easier to build, it's harder to stand out. Code has become content - abundant, disposable, something you produce rather than labor over. We've transitioned from \"make something people want\" to \"make anything you want\".\n\nFor example, I'll open-source the theme powering this site. A few years ago, this would have represented a lot of work. There would have been utility for people making their own templates. Instead, today it's a footnote - a curiosity for those who want to \"view source\" on this website and see how it works.\n\nAs a maker, AI enables me to build more and faster than I ever could have dreamed. But projects are no longer the investment they used to be. I find myself with decision fatigue - I ask \"what should I build next?\" every few days, instead of every few months. In the age of AI, it's harder to think of a \"big project\" to work on slowly in my free time.\n\nWith code getting easier, I find myself thinking more about data. My old coworker Jason posted a video about using Claude Code to organize his notes. There's so much useful knowledge spread out across many sources. People know Claude for writing code, but its superpower is searching and understanding thousands of files.\n\nWhen I went to Japan last year, I wanted to ask \"what is every Tokyo coffee shop and jazz kissa mentioned on craigmod.com,\" but I couldn't. That desire led me to build Contraption MCP - so I could have a research agent over my writing. The first time I used it and got a real answer synthesized from years of posts, it felt like a new kind of utility - a digital proprioception enabling me to fluidly navigate and explore my writing.\n\nExploring information is still a hard problem in the age of AI. MCP is useful, but more of a technical protocol. \"RSS for AI,\" as Stan summarized to me.\n\nThe next project I'm contemplating is codenamed \"Bell\" — a search agent for this blog, built on top of the Contraption MCP. I want it to be more accessible than raw MCP: something you can use in a browser, drawing on a variety of sources. It could answer questions like \"which craft-focused books are mentioned on this blog,\" but also \"how does subscriber export work on Postcard.\" Part of the motivation for Bell is building software for myself. But, the other part is continuing to explore the future of digital tools through making projects.\n\nSo, what should I build next? Two things feel true: we should default to building for ourselves, and understanding our own data is where some hard problems now live.\n\nI think the widespread impulse to take a photo of everything is in fact, at root, a creative one. It reflects a desire to not just receive life passively, but to intervene in it creatively: To frame the shot, to find the most compelling angle, to draw out the emotion, to honor the light… to participate.\n\n- This life gives you nothing, Blackbird Spyplane",

    "description": "Not sure if you should claim a domain or form your LLC first? Use our guide to prioritize these goals for your unique business needs.",
    "fullText": "Starting a business—and not sure if you should get a domain or form your LLC first? Dive into our guide to learn how these steps are connected, and which to prioritize first for your unique business needs.\n\nDeciding whether to register a domain or form an LLC first can feel like a chicken-and-egg situation. In reality, it’s just a matter of balancing competing priorities. You need to secure a legal business name with the state (where options may be limited) and snag a domain name that’s short, easy to remember, and on brand for your business (also no small feat). Should your business name and domain name match? And which name should you prioritize at the beginning stages of starting a business?\n\nWe have answers. In this guide, we’ll help you vanquish indecision and get on the track to starting a business with a great website.\n\nYour business name is what appears on official paperwork you file with the state. The state usually has specific requirements about words that must be included in your name based on the type of business you’re running. For example, many states require LLCs to include an abbreviation like “LLC” or even the phrase “Limited Liability Company.” This is considered the legal name of your business.\n\nYour domain name is what people type into their browser’s address bar when they want to visit your website. It does not have to include identifying words like “LLC.” In fact, there’s no requirement for it to match your business name at all. Domain names can only use letters, numbers, and hyphens.\n\nThere’s no requirement—legal or otherwise—for your business name and your domain name to match. That’s because your business name and your domain name serve two very different purposes.\n\nYour business name is your entity’s legal name. You’ll use it to do legal stuff, like enter into contracts, open business bank accounts, and pay taxes.\n\nYour domain name, on the other hand, serves as the web address for your company. It’s what people who come across your business online—on social media or via search engines—will associate with your business.\n\nBoth names are key parts of your business’s brand—a fancy marketing term that really just means the personality or identity of your business. You’ll want to choose the business name and a domain name that best serve these two functions. This means your domain name and business name may or may not match.\n\nThis is a slightly different question, and the answer is complicated. In some cases, it’s best for your domain name and business name to match—or at least get as close as possible. But many businesses use a completely different domain name than company name. Here, we’ll break down a few scenarios.\n\nWhen your business name and domain name shouldn’t match:\n\nWhen your business name and domain name should match (or get close):\n\nIf you’ve determined your business name and your domain name should more or less match, but your the domain name that matches your business name isn’t for sale, you have a few options. You can:\n\nSuppose you buy a domain name that doesn’t match your business name. After some time, you find that you actually like your domain name more than your business name. In fact, you’d like to do all your business—not just the online side—under your domain name.\n\nIn that case, you don’t have to form a whole new LLC or change your LLC’s name. You just need to register a DBA (doing business as) name with the state. A DBA is like a nickname for your business, and filing one is usually pretty inexpensive (depending on where you live).\n\nRemember that registering a DBA is not the same as registering a legal entity—a DBA affords you no liability protection.\n\nSo should you register a domain or form an LLC first? Like other aspects of your business, there’s no single answer that applies to all businesses and situations. Here’s a list of questions and considerations worth keeping in mind as you work through your decision.\n\nLet’s say you’re starting a business that only sells items or services online and does not have a brick-and-mortar location. In this case, the success of your business depends on your online presence and branding, and a solid domain name is a key part of that. You should secure a domain name first and worry about naming your business second.\n\nHow do you find out if a domain name is available? Go to any domain registrar – like domainregistry.com – and type in the domain name you’re seeking. You’ll get an answer in seconds.\n\nA brick-and-mortar business may find that deciding on a business name and forming an LLC first makes the most sense. To find out if your desired LLC name is available, visit your state’s secretary of state’s website. There, you’ll find a database of all the businesses registered in your state, and you can search to see if your desired name is available.\n\nIf someone’s already claimed your name, you’ll need to find an alternate one. The good news is that when you do form an LLC, you’ll prevent anyone else in your state from coming along and using the exact same business entity name.\n\nAn LLC is a type of business entity. When you form an LLC you gain liability protection in the separation of your business assets from your personal assets. That keeps someone from claiming personal assets (like your home) in a lawsuit they file against your LLC.\n\nThere are some businesses that will need liability protection sooner than others. For instance, any establishment that serves food has to worry about customers getting food poisoning or having allergic reactions. A gym has to worry about people getting hurt while doing deadlifts. A miniature golf course has to worry about golfers getting boinked in the head by a runaway golf ball. However, a freelance writer may find that they’re willing to put off getting liability protection until after their website goes live.\n\nDon’t wait. You can buy a domain name, then park it for a while before you turn it into a professional website for your business. Buying a domain and holding off on developing it fully is a common practice known as domain parking. Because you’ll be competing for a good domain name with people around the world and not just in your home state, you don’t want to snooze on an opportunity you might not have again.",

Today, the company sells its products in thousands of stores and operates hundreds of restaurants worldwide.\n\nAfter more than a century of success and becoming a New York icon, the company is now taking a major step that could reshape its future for years to come.\n\nSmithfield Foods has agreed to acquire Nathan's Famous (NATH) for approximately $102 per outstanding share in cash, valuing the deal at about $450 million, according to a press release.\n\nSmithfield has held an exclusive license to manufacture, distribute, market, and sell Nathan's Famous products within the U.S, Canada, and Sam's Club locations in Mexico since March 2014.\n\nWhile that license was set to expire in March 2032, the closing of this acquisition would allow Smithfield to secure full ownership of the Nathan's Famous brand and continue expanding across both retail and foodservice channels.\n\n\"Since entering into our licensing agreement in 2014, we have made significant investments to build and grow the Nathan's Famous brand,\" said Smithfield President and CEO Shane Smith in the press release. \"With our manufacturing scale, marketing strength, product innovation capabilities, and retail and foodservice channel expertise, acquiring Nathan’s Famous will allow us to take the brand to new heights.\"\n\nNathan's Famous CEO Eric Gatoff agrees with those sentiments, calling Smithfield's acquisition a \"natural fit\" for the brand's next phase of growth.\n\n\"As a long-time partner, Smithfield has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to investing in and growing our brand while maintaining the utmost quality and customer service standards,\" Gatoff added.\n\nSmithfield Foods (SFD) is an American food company and the world's largest pork producer and food-processing company, reporting over $14 billion in annual sales, according to its website.",

    "fullText": "We recently published 10 Stocks Delivering Double-Digit Gains Effortlessly; 4 Hit Highs. Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) was one of the best performers on Thursday.\n\nPlug Power snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, jumping 16.67 percent to close at $2.59 apiece, as investors loaded portfolios ahead a special shareholders’ meeting next week.\n\nIn a notice to its investors, Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said that it would hold a special meeting at 10 AM on Thursday, January 29, to vote on two company proposals, including increasing its authorized capital stock to 3 billion from 1.5 billion at present.\n\nPlug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said the capital stock increase was necessary to meet its financial obligations, maintain operating flexibility, and continue executing its business plan.\n\nShould shareholders reject the said initiative, Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said that it would implement a reverse stock split in order to create sufficient share availability to meet its financial obligations and maintain business flexibility.\n\nIt would also seek approval of the shareholders to modernize voting standards by aligning the company’s charter with current Delaware corporate law. If approved, such an amendment would allow certain future charter amendments to be approved by a majority of votes cast, where permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL).\n\n“This change ensures that outcomes are determined by the stockholders who actively participate in the voting process, rather than by shares that are not voted at all. Under the Company’s current charter, shares that are not voted effectively have the same impact as votes cast against a proposal, which can prevent proposals from passing even when a clear majority of voting stockholders support them,” it said.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of PLUG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

    "fullText": "Most people dream about winning the lottery. But for one 29-year-old man, his $15 million windfall came with a side of guilt, entitlement, and a family-sized headache.\n\nIn a post shared on Reddit, the anonymous winner explained that his financial plans were anything but reckless. He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The videos are then used to teach Optimus how to mimic the same movements.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said during an interview at Davos on Thursday that Tesla has the humanoid robot doing \"simple tasks\" in its factory, though he didn't specify which.\n\n\"By the end of this year I think they'll be doing more complex tasks but still deployed in an industrial environment,\" he said. \"By the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public.\"\n\nHe warned earlier this week in a post on X that production of Optimus — and the company's Cybercab, which will be produced in Austin — will be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla has been sharing sneak peeks of Optimus' capabilities since the product was first announced in 2021. In 2024, the automaker posted a video that showed the robot arranging batteries while tied to an overhead support structure at the company's lab in Palo Alto. The company said that it deployed two autonomous Optimus robots in one of its factories in 2024.\n\nTesla employs several dozen Optimus trainers. The company's factory workers, who number in the thousands, could be an ideal group to help train the robot due to their expertise and workforce size.\n\nLast year, Tesla moved from primarily training the robot using teleoperation to collecting video data — a strategy that could help the carmaker rapidly collect larger amounts of data without the constraints of motion capture suits, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTesla's Optimus trainers are outfitted with large helmets with cameras that point in several directions. The helmet is attached to a heavy backpack, which can be unwieldy at times. Tesla has experimented with a lighter fanny pack setup, but it's unclear if the company plans to use it in factory data collection, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nMusk has pitched Optimus as the \"biggest product of all time.\" He's said the humanoid robot could be the solution to everything from housework and factory work to operating data centers in outer space.\n\nThe town hall also covered non-Optimus developments. The company is working on updating several production lines and construction will continue to be ongoing at the factory.\n\nOver the past year, the carmaker has repeatedly slashed production hours for its Cybertruck line and moved workers to the Model Y line amid lackluster sales numbers for the electric pickup truck.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "description": "More slick dramas filled with family feuds and shady business dealings.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Sheridan and Billy Bob Thornton are such a natural pairing that it's not at all surprising that Landman has been yet another hit for the creator behind Yellowstone and it's many spin-offs. Thornton plays Billy Norris, a crackerjack consultant, fixer, and general hired gun for a major oil conglomerate in present-day West Texas. Beyond the complicated economics and politics of the oil industry, the poor guy's also dealing with extremely complicated family drama, debt, criminal ties, and substance-abuse issues. Call it Dallas for a new generation.\n\nYou can stream Landman on Paramount+, and check out these similar shows after your binge is complete.\n\nAnother Taylor Sheridan creation, this one stars Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky, head of a family that’s been keeping the peace, more or less, in the title's company town for decades. The \"business\" of the corrupt burg just happens to be incarceration, and the McLuskys thrive when business is up, even if Mike himself has slightly different ideas about how to run things. The show deals, at least broadly, with systemic racism and inequality in the prison system, but mostly it's a modern day western about bringing justice to a corrupt town. Stream Mayor of Kingstown on Paramount+.\n\nIt's tempting to direct you back to the original series' 14-season run, but that one's a harder to stream—and besides, this direct continuation is still pretty fun. Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and Larry Hagman (as the original's J.R.) are all back, joined by a new generation lead by Josh Henderson, Jesse Metcalf, and Jordana Brewster. They're every bit as scheming, conniving, horny, and oil obsessed as their parents. Stream Dallas on Tubi.\n\nThe Taylor Sheridan drama that launched an empire, as well as a thousand spin-offs (well, seven, including those in development). The Dutton family of Montana, owners of the largest cattle ranch in the state, deal with family and political drama—a bit like a modern Dallas, but with the vibes of HBO’s Succession. Though the main series ended after five seasons, mostly to accommodate the departure of Kevin Costner, there's plenty more to explore in the past and future of the Yellowstone universe. Stream Yellowstone on Peacock.\n\nTerrence Howard leads a truly impressive cast (among them Taraji P. Henson, Gabourey Sidibe, and Vivica A. Fox) in this juicy, glossy, hip-hop infused soap opera. Howard plays Lucious Jackson (neé drug dealer Dwight Walker), who changed his own fortunes by building Empire Entertainment from the ground up. As the series begins, the music mogul is diagnosed with ALS and given a life expectancy of only a few more years. Refusing to watch his life's work die, he sets his three sons at odds to determine who’ll be the one to control things when he’s gone. His schemes are complicated by the release from prison of Cookie Lyon (Henson), the co-founder of the company and Jackson’s ex-wife. As the kids say: drama! There's a little bit of Dallas and a little bit of Succession (which Empire predates) here, sharing with those shows and Landman the whole family dynasty thing, but with hip-hop rather than black gold. Stream Empire on Hulu and Tubi.\n\nIf the pull of Landman is Billy Bob Thornton as a complicated anti-hero with substance abuse issues, this David E. Kelley legal drama will work just fine as a streamalike, even in the absence of oil wells. Here, Thornton plays Billy McBride, a once-successful lawyer who left the firm he built after a murder suspect he'd gotten acquitted went on to kill his family. After a long run of doing not much other than drinking, he's drawn back into the fray when a dead man's sister asks for his help on a case involving his old firm, a major corporation, and some very crooked cops. Stream Goliath on Prime Video.\n\nAmerican TV shows tend to view the wealthy with nuance, even when they're engaged in overtly criminal behavior. South Korean creators, on the other hand, have no problem criticizing the 1% (Parasite and Squid Game are hardly outliers), particularly the plutocratic chaebol families who control huge portions of the country’s economy. The minseries Mine centers the women who are jockeying for control of the massive, fictional Hyowon Group from within their family’s outrageously opulent (and extremely photogenic) residential compound. The plans of two increasingly powerful women who married into the family, Hi-soo and Seo-hyun, are thrown into disarray when the new housemaid begins a romantic relationship with one of the male heirs, while a new tutor seems ready to expose old family secrets. It’s very much a Dynasty-style soap opera, with various family members crawling over each other seeking control and a sense of identity. Stream Mine on Netflix.\n\nSwapping big-time oil for a family fishing business may seem like a big leap, but we've still got plenty of crime and drugs in this Netflix series. Holt McCallany plays Harlan Buckley, returning to manage the family business, one which is tied up with multiple dueling drug cartels, as well as unreliable family members and at least one (Supergirl's Melissa Benoist) who's looking to escape her own legal problems by working with the FBI against her father and brother. Stream The Waterfront on Netflix.\n\nA vibe match that, while it doesn't replicate Landman's family and business drama, still runs with the neo-western feel that defines a Taylor Sheridan show. Michael Dorman stars as Joe Pickett, a Wyoming game warden with a violent past and, well, a violent present too. Dorman's Pickett is less of a tough action hero type, and more of a likable, everyday guy who just happens to be wrapped up in a murder via his day job. It’s not a comedy, but is definitely a bit weirder and more surreal than the more literal style of something like Landman, which lacks flourishes like Pickett's memorable emu wrestling scene. Stream Joe Pickett on Paramount+.\n\nAnother intense family business drama with a dash of a succession crisis: In Queen Sugar, three largely estranged siblings in distant cities are brought together by the death of their father, who has left them each an equal share in an 800-acre sugarcane farm in rural Louisiana. The Ava DuVernay-produced (and sometimes directed) series offers plenty of scandal and soapy drama, but ultimately, it’s a show about a family coming back together to preserve its legacy. The siblings (Rutina Wesley, Dawn-Lyen Gardner, and Kofi Siriboe) are a bit less gritty and troubled than the Norris family (they're mostly trying to do the right thing), but they still generate enough drama to fuel seven successful seasons. Stream Queen Sugar on Hulu.\n\nThe popularity of Taylor Sheridan-esque neo-westerns leads us, inevitably, to something closer to an actual western. In this series, adapting Philipp Meyer's 2013 Pulitzer Prize-finalist novel of the same name, Pierce Brosnan plays Eli McCullough, a ruthless cattle baron making moves to get in on the burgeoning oil industry in the Rio Grande Valley of 1915. A parallel narrative sees Eli as a young man, kidnapped and raised among a Nʉmʉnʉʉ family. While his backstory lends the character welcome complexity, in the present, he's as determined to build his empire as he is to prepare his son and grandson to take over when he's gone. Stream The Son on Prime Video and AMC+.",

    "fullText": "US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over private share sale that values business at $800bn\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly lining up four Wall Street banks to help the company list on the stock market as investors prepare for an expected rush of US tech listings.\n\nSpaceX is considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in an initial public offering, according to the Financial Times and Reuters.\n\nThe US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over a private share sale that values the business at $800bn (£591bn), months after it was valued at $400bn. Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.\n\nLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.\n\nReports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. The potential IPOs have been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms and datacentres into orbit.\n\nReferring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AI IPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?\n\n“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and SpaceX were approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "The TikTok divestment deal is done, and the company's CEO is jubilant.\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok's top boss, Shou Chew, sent a message to US staffers, toasting the \"great news\" and thanking them for their \"resilience.\"\n\nHe also announced that \"more than 200 million Americans now come to TikTok to be entertained, learn, and grow their business with a broader global community.\"\n\nChew has good reason to take a victory lap.\n\nAfter battling for the company's survival for over a year and a half, TikTok now has confidence it will avoid a US ban after its owner ByteDance sold off enough of its business to meet the demands of a 2024 sell-or-ban law.\n\nThe deal is a major win for TikTok and ByteDance, which will be able to continue operating in the US without having to disconnect US users from the rest of the world. The arrangement is also a victory for TikTok's new US investors, a hodgepodge of investment firms and individuals like Michael Dell, who get a stake in a fast-growing business.\n\nThe deal involved setting up a joint venture with an investor consortium that now owns just over 80% of the new US entity. The group, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX, is tasked with securing US user data, content moderation, and trust and safety.\n\nByteDance, meanwhile, gets around 20% ownership in the new venture. It will also maintain control of key TikTok business lines, such as e-commerce, marketing, and advertising. The company is splitting up its US employees into different entities based on whether they'll stay under ByteDance's wing or work for the new joint venture, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.\n\nThe closing of the joint venture agreement is the culmination of a half-decade saga for TikTok, which initially faced the prospect of a ban in 2020 under President Donald Trump's first administration. The court blocked Trump's efforts to ban TikTok, but the app was targeted again in a 2024 law known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nTikTok lost its legal challenge to the law in the Supreme Court a year ago, and it was only able to continue operating in 2025 due to a series of executive orders from Trump, who chose to preserve TikTok rather than destroy it.\n\nMoving forward, Chew will continue to run TikTok globally, while trust and safety executive Adam Presser will oversee the US joint venture. TikTok staffers will need to \"continue to follow data privacy, content assurance, code compliance, and trust and safety protocols\" that were already in place, Chew wrote in his memo.\n\nI am pleased to update you with some great news.\n\nToday, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC has been established in compliance with the Executive Order signed by President Trump on September 25, 2025, enabling our US users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok's vibrant global community and experience.\n\nAs we take this significant step forward, I am proud to share that today more than 200 million Americans now come to TikTok to be entertained, learn, and grow their business with a broader global community. We are grateful for the incredible support of our user base, and the unwavering dedication and resilience of our employees that has allowed us to continue delivering at a high level.\n\nTikTok's growth in the US nicely sets up the Joint Venture for strong future success. The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users. It will be led by Adam Presser who, today, has been chosen by the Joint Venture's Board of Directors for his impressive track record with the company leading large-scale teams in the areas of Trust & Safety and Operations. Please find more details on today's news here.\n\nInteroperability will be critical in enabling users and creators to have the same global experience that they know and love, and for the 7.5 million US businesses to continue to thrive on TikTok by reaching customers around the world. To ensure this continuity for our users, new subsidiaries including \"TT Commerce & Global Services LLC,\" have been created to manage global product interoperability as well as commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\n\nTo date, we have provided compliance training for all TikTok employees. Going forward when working with the newly created USDS JV, I expect everyone to continue to follow data privacy, content assurance, code compliance, and trust and safety protocols.\n\nI thank you all for the tireless work you do every single day in fulfilling our mission to inspire creativity and bring joy.",

    "title": "7 mistakes you should never make during a job interview, according to a business-etiquette expert",
    "description": "The etiquette expert advises against leaving your camera off during virtual interviews, dressing too casually, and using filler words or slang.",
    "fullText": "For many, job interviews can be a nerve-racking experience. Even with proper preparation, it's common to struggle with this important step in the hiring process.\n\nTo help you avoid common mistakes, Business Insider asked business-etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore about the things candidates should avoid doing during an interview. Here's what she said.\n\nWhitmore told BI that a simple but common mistake candidates make is arriving to the interview unprepared.\n\n\"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media,\" she said. \"There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"\n\nWhitmore also said it's important to ask the interviewer questions tailored specifically to the company.\n\nAccording to Whitmore, dressing too casually is another common mistake she sees interviewees make.\n\n\"Very rarely do we see someone overdressed for a job interview,\" she said. \"They oftentimes don't put a lot of thought into the details, like the color of their belt or that their shoes are matching their outfit.\"\n\nWhitmore told BI that even when candidates do wear office-friendly attire, they may overlook other key details, like forgetting to cut off the tags or not cutting open the vents in the back.\n\n\"Why would an employer want to hire someone who doesn't pay attention to the details?\" Whitmore asked.\n\nBefore stepping into a job interview, it's important to consider how you're presenting yourself online, especially since Whitmore said the first thing an employer will likely do is Google you.\n\n\"They'll look at all your social media pages. They'll look at what you eat, what you drink, what you wear, who you hang out with, what your lifestyle is — and they make judgments,\" she told BI.\n\nFor that reason, Whitmore suggested adjusting your privacy settings and cleaning up your social media presence to eliminate anything that could be used against you.\n\nWhen in a job interview, Whitmore told BI that candidates should never use inappropriate language, such as profanity, slang, or terminology the employer might not understand.\n\nShe also said to be cautious of filler words and phrases such as \"like\" or \"um\" to avoid muddling the conversation.\n\nWhitmore suggested recording yourself before the interview or practicing ahead of time to ensure you're speaking clearly and precisely.\n\nOne mistake to avoid in virtual interviews is refusing to turn your camera on.\n\nCandidates may choose to keep their cameras off for a number of reasons, such as being worried about making eye contact or feeling uncomfortable with face-to-face interaction. However, Whitmore said keeping the camera on is a good idea so the employer can see your facial expressions.\n\nShe added that candidates should be wary of what their background looks like and make sure their room appears tidy.\n\n\"If you just have to have a blank wall, that's better than a huge distraction. But I definitely recommend that you put a little thought into your background,\" she said.\n\n\"Showing up late for an interview is a huge no-no,\" Whitmore said. \"I've always said when you're on time, you're still late. You should show up early.\"\n\nArriving early ensures you have enough time to find parking or the meeting room. Whitmore added that doing so also allows you to use the restroom and gain your composure before the interview starts.\n\nSending a thank you note is an important step in the interview process.\n\n\"I go overboard. I send a thank you email and a thank you note because this is an opportunity for you to get into the employer's eyes at least twice,\" Whitmore told BI.\n\nBe sure to follow up within 24 hours of the interview and personalize the note.\n\n\"Address the person by name. Tell them why you enjoyed the interview and why you would be a good candidate,\" Whitmore said.\n\nIf you're feeling stuck, she suggested writing out a note and using an AI tool like ChatGPT to polish it.\n\nThis story was originally published on January 14, 2025, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "title": "I trust Tesla FSD enough for me to close my eyes. I'm now spoiled and want full autonomy.",
    "description": "Business Insider tested Tesla's Full Self-Driving system and found it a highly capable driver assistance feature. Full autonomy will be a game changer.",
    "fullText": "Two things can be true of Tesla's Full Self-Driving: It's an impressive piece of technology, and it still doesn't go far enough.\n\nFSD is Tesla's big bet. CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights.\n\nToday, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. The promise is to advance FSD enough to make the system unsupervised — meaning the driver behind the wheel can take their eyes off the road or even fall asleep. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle.\n\nThe gap between what the tech can do and what it can't is where my experience landed.\n\nI recently demoed a 2025 Tesla Model 3 that came installed with FSD v14.2.1, the latest software version available at the time.\n\nWith my friend riding shotgun, I drove around the East Bay Area, taking the Model 3 through various road environments, including a university campus, parking lots, and the highway, on a clear Saturday afternoon.\n\nFSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system.\n\nI drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway.\n\nOne was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.\n\nThe system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.\n\nFSD's \"Mad Max\" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. Calling it \"Mad Max\" feels a little gratuitous, but I appreciate that a more urgent driving mode is available.\n\nAt no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.\n\nMy friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a \"spaceship.\" That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be.\n\nI gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley.\n\nThe car kept driving for a bit, but I was inevitably warned to pay attention to the road.\n\nAs good as FSD is, the technology doesn't allow you to completely disengage mentally. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. The technology is — or at least feels — so, so close.\n\nPeople who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders.\n\nI agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic.\n\nThe problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The drive is mostly a straight shot. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway.\n\nI obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS?\n\nFSD feels like the burden of driving was just shifted away from my hands and feet to my attention.\n\nMusk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system.\n\nThat would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nI'm likely spoiled because I know what full autonomy feels like.\n\nI have constant access to Waymo. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking.\n\nThat's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised.\n\nI'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.\n\nTesla's decision to remove the safety monitor from some of its robotaxis suggests the company could be close.",

    "title": "Why this NATO fighter wing says its American-made Hornets work well for front-line air patrols",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke with Spanish pilots who are deployed to Lithuania to contribute to NATO air policing missions.",
    "fullText": "ŠIAULIAI AIR BASE, Lithuania — Lt. Col. Fernando Allen has logged over 1,000 hours flying the EF-18, an American-made fighter jet designed specifically for the Spanish air forces. He firmly believes it's the \"best machine ever made.\"\n\nAllen, the detachment commander of a Spanish Air Force wing deployed to Šiauliai Air Base to support NATO air policing operations, says the EF-18 fighter is perfect for intercepting fast-moving jets — or slow-flying drones.\n\n\"I think it's the best multi-role asset because it's very easy for the pilot to get all the info in the cockpit,\" he told Business Insider during a visit to the air base this week. The jet's screen layout, he explained, is what makes it simple.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing deployed to Šiauliai in Lithuania at the start of December for a four-month rotation to contribute to NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission, designed to protect the airspace above and around Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia — the Baltic nations on the front lines of the alliance.\n\nFighter jets are routinely scrambled on short notice from the Šiauliai base and other bases in the region to intercept Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea that aren't using their transponders, haven't filed official flight plans, or aren't communicating appropriately with air traffic control.\n\nLast year, NATO's Air Command recorded more than 500 scrambles across allied airspace as part of its air policing missions and other defensive operations.\n\nThe 200-member Spanish detachment arrived at Šiauliai with 11 EF-18M fighter jets, upgraded versions of the twin-engine F/A-18 Hornet, designed by former American defense contractor McDonnell Douglas (which later merged with Boeing).\n\nThe fourth-generation F/A-18 made its first flight in the late 1970s and entered service with the US military in the early 1980s. The fighter jet has seen extensive combat experience across the Middle East and southeastern Europe and is flown by roughly half a dozen countries today.\n\nSpain operates its own specialized version of the F/A-18 Hornet. The airframe of the EF-18 (\"E\" for España) is made in America, but Madrid has been responsible for upgrading and modifying the jets in the decades since it first purchased them, modernizing features such as the software.\n\nThe jet's exterior may look the same as those flown by Finland or Canada, but the interior is completely different, with \"all the latest technology,\" said Allen, the detachment commander.\n\n\"It's very easy to fly an F-18,\" he said. \"The most difficult part is to manage everything you have inside.\"\n\nWhen the EF-18s deployed to Šiauliai are scrambled, it is usually in response to a nearby aircraft flying without identification or failing to follow — intentional or not — international rules. While most interceptions occur without incident, the fighters are armed, ready for a threat scenario.\n\nThe Spanish EF-18s are armed with an M61A1 Vulcan 20mm cannon and can be equipped with IRIS-T short-range air-to-air missiles and AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles. The two missiles use infrared and radar homing technology, respectively.\n\nThe utility of combat-proven air-to-air weapons such as these was underscored in September when NATO fighter jets shot down Russian drones that crossed into Polish airspace during an attack against Ukraine.\n\nThe troubling incident sparked discussions among Western officials and military leaders about finding more cost-effective ways to shoot down cheap drones without relying solely on expensive jet-fired missiles.\n\n\"We can carry many air-to-air weapons, air-to-ground weapons,\" Allen said. He praised the EF-18 fighter's thrust, saying that the fighter can travel at both high and low speeds, the latter coming into play for a growing area of concern affecting alliance air policing missions.\n\n\"You can fly very, very slow,\" Allen said. \"For us, to intercept drones or small aircraft, it's not easy, but it's easier for us than any other aircraft.\"\n\nThe EF-18 is the only fighter Allen has ever flown, but others under his command have had the opportunity to experience the capabilities of other airframes firsthand.\n\nLt. Arturo Guitán, an EF-18 pilot with the 15th Wing, told Business Insider he prefers his jet to the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon, developed by a consortium of European defense firms, even though the latter is a more technologically advanced aircraft.\n\n\"We love it,\" Guitán said of the EF-18, adding that the fighter is capable of performing all the mission requirements.\n\nCountries contribute to the Baltic Air Policing mission on four-month rotations; the 15th Wing will be replaced in March by Romania and France. The Spanish fighter pilots began training for the job long before they deployed to Lithuania, routinely practicing for scrambles.\n\n\"We are honored to be here, and we are very proud to be part of this kind of mission,\" said Lt. Jesus Ortín, another EF-18 pilot. \"It's a peacetime mission, so we are highly trained for this.\"\n\nDespite praise from pilots, Spain has gradually moved in recent years to replace its EF-18 fleet with orders for dozens of new Eurofighter jets. The country has also pivoted away from buying the stealth fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II, made by the US defense giant Lockheed Martin, opting instead for a European aircraft.",

    "title": "I'm the CEO of a tourist company in Greenland. Trump's interest in the island boosted business, but now some customers are postponing trips.",
    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

But the benchmark index has whipsawed this month between a 2.1% gain at its peak and a 0.8% decline at its trough.\n\n\"Lower interest rates would help, as would continued news that AI actually results in higher productivity, and continuing 15% plus earnings gains,\" Gross told Business Insider by email.\n\nGross, who cofounded PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly 30 years, wrote in his outlook that stocks are being shored up by rosy earnings forecasts, which are underpinned by fiscal and monetary stimulus.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that US markets could falter as \"political unrest\" threatens to undermine core capitalist principles such as \"competition and survival of the fittest.\"\n\nGross said that even in the AI space, \"tariffs and government aid\" could lead to the \"unfittest\" surviving in future marketplaces.\n\nA major trend of President Donald Trump's second term has been greater executive intervention in the business world. The federal government has taken equity stakes in corporations such as Intel, imposed sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and thrown its full weight behind AI companies' infrastructure buildout.\n\nGross also warned in his outlook that high valuations are a concern, noting a version of the Buffett Indicator that compares the S&P 500's price to nominal US GDP is at a \"historic high.\"\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite gauge shows \"froth is visible\" in the market as stock prices are rising faster than GDP, Gross told BI.\n\nThe Wall Street veteran wrote in his outlook that \"productivity, tax rates and geopolitical influences can suggest no need for a cane.\" He noted that some market bulls believe AI has changed the game, so they expect \"no wobbling — just sprinting.\"\n\n\"But I throw my hat in with the old wizard Warren Buffett,\" Gross wrote. \"Valuation casts a shadow over markets in 2026. No crash, just a forward weave requiring a cane, unlike 2025.\"\n\nOther high-profile investors have flagged lofty valuations as a headwind.\n\n\"Just your daily reminder that stocks are expensive,\" Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said in a X post last week, adding that high prices depress returns.\n\nGMO cofounder Jeremy Grantham echoed Burry on a recent podcast: \"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward.\"",

    "fullText": "AI evangelist Peter Kyle wants to scale up businesses, attract overseas investors and look out for UK’s poorer regions\n\nThe UK business secretary, Peter Kyle, has said he is “betting big” and “picking winners” as the government takes direct stakes in growing businesses to boost economic growth.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been talking up Britain’s prospects, Kyle said ministers were taking an “activist” approach to industrial policy.\n\nThe idea of “picking winners” is closely associated with the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s attacks on Labour’s 1970s strategy and her argument that it should be the private sector that decides which companies thrive.\n\nKyle was unabashed about invoking the phrase, arguing a muscular approach could accelerate economic growth. “I want to make sure that the benefits of growth are felt quicker than is currently the case. We’re predicted to grow 1.5% this year. That is not enough.”\n\nHe highlighted the recent decision to allow the £26bn state-owned British Business Bank to buy equity stakes in companies, including the announcement last week of a £25m investment in the energy supplier Octopus’s software spin-off, Kraken.\n\n“The most potential in our economy, in the short and medium term, is scale-up companies,” Kyle said. “I was at Octopus yesterday. They’re now employing 1,500 people in their head office in London alone.\n\n“We can find other companies that are on that kind of trajectory and we can expedite their growth. Then it will create thousands of new jobs, and it will create enormous amounts of wealth, which will recycle through the economy in a really fast way.”\n\n“I am betting big. And I am picking winners,” he added. “It’s more activist. And there will be things that don’t work out, sure. But to have a healthy economy, failure leads to success.”\n\nThis week’s summit in the Swiss ski resort has been overshadowed by Donald Trump’s threat to slap tariffs on eight European countries if they stood in the way of his hopes of annexing Greenland.\n\nThe president backed away from the idea of punitive import taxes on Wednesday evening, after discussions with the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, but several leaders in the Swiss ski resort have said the global economic order has irrevocably changed.\n\nKyle insisted international uncertainty was no reason not to press ahead with Labour’s agenda, highlighting the prospects of a “wave of opportunity that technology and life sciences and all these huge, huge, positive waves of innovation are going to present to us”.\n\nHe said: “If we are too intimidated by the global challenges, if we are too distracted by domestic political to and fro, then we will take our eye off the ball, and we will miss the opportunity of a lifetime, and that means real things to real people.\n\n“There will be kids growing up like me that will not end up becoming successful like I have. It’ll be communities that, at the moment, are poor, and they will never have a hope of becoming prosperous. And I won’t stand for it. I would literally do anything. And if that means betting [on] winners, and getting it wrong from time to time, I’ll take it.”\n\nAnnouncing the beefing up of the government’s “global talent taskforce” in his department, the business secretary suggested that the UK hoped to capitalise on the instability unleashed by Trump’s policies to help it attract jobs and investment.\n\n“I will suck the best talent in from wherever it exists, and talent goes both ways across the Atlantic. And I want to make sure that we have a good balance in that because for too long it’s been in one direction,” he said.\n\nHighlighting the need to attract innovators in particular, Kyle added: “America is being disruptive with tariffs, but America isn’t the most friendly place for scientific endeavour in any case at the moment. Do the maths and add up where we’re going with this. We are going out there and we’re saying: ‘Actually, we have one of the best regulatory environments in the world for life sciences, and across the board.’”\n\nKeir Starmer has taken a tough line on migration – despite pushback from some quarters in the party – promising to reduce it and condemning Boris Johnson’s administration for what the prime minister has called an “open borders experiment”.\n\nBut Kyle said he did not think public scepticism about migration extended to wealthy entrepreneurs. “People are deeply concerned about the immigration system we inherited, and the asylum system, which was overwhelmed, and was poorly administered by the Tories, and therefore broken,” he said.\n\n“I’ve never had anybody that says that people with a lot of money to invest in our country, who want to come here and create jobs, create businesses, shouldn’t be coming to do so.”\n\nHe added: “I have a taskforce that’s doing this, embedded in our global network. We can offer the world’s most talented a bespoke package to come to the UK swiftly, to embed, and then, of course, be part of a funding landscape that is bountiful.”\n\nThe 55-year-old MP for Hove and Portslade has been business secretary since Starmer’s September reshuffle, replacing Jonathan Reynolds, who had done the job for several years in opposition.\n\nKyle is politically close to the health secretary, Wes Streeting – who has been repeatedly mooted as a potential challenger to Starmer – but has been scrupulously loyal to the prime minister in public.\n\nEarlier this week, the business secretary rejected the suggestion that the UK try to negotiate a customs union with the EU, for which Streeting has signalled his support, telling the FT: “I think at the moment it would be foolish to slip towards what would be simple solutions.”\n\nKyle has dyslexia and left his state school “without any usable” qualifications, as he has put it. He made his way to university aged 25, and went on to secure a PhD, then worked in the charity sector before entering politics.\n\nIn his previous job of technology secretary, he was forced to defend his closeness to powerful tech companies. He is a regular user of the chatbot ChatGPT and an evangelist for the opportunities offered by the technology – and is often seen in the casual garb favoured by “tech bros”.\n\nSoon after taking on his current role, Kyle struck a deal with business groups and trade unions to water down the implementation of Labour’s Employment Rights Act, introducing a six-month probation period before the promised “day-tone rights” come into force.\n\nHe has continued to work closely with his successor and friend, Liz Kendall, and said he has insisted the connecting door that blocked the corridor between their two offices be opened up.\n\nAsked whether AI would cause mass layoffs as companies decide they can manage without entry-level staff – a hot topic at Davos – Kyle said: “People are anxious and it’s going to be painful and difficult because change is always painful and difficult.”\n\nKyle said Labour was ready to intervene to ensure the adoption of AI was less painful for poorer communities than the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, which cast a long shadow.\n\nHe said: “Waves of industrial change have always gone badly when governments stand on the sidelines and are not participants. And I will not allow that to happen.\n\n“As tech secretary I was negotiating deals for investment in digital infrastructure, insisting it happened in poorer parts of the country. I’m the gatekeeper into our country for a lot of investors. And if they want to come and benefit from our country, then they can contribute to it as well.”",

    "fullText": "OpenAI has pulled in a billion-dollar month from something other than ChatGPT.\n\nSam Altman said in a post on X on Thursday that OpenAI added more than $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the past month \"just from our API business.\"\n\n\"People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!\" the OpenAI CEO wrote.\n\nOpenAI's API enables other companies and developers to embed its models into their own products, from internal productivity software to coding tools.\n\nMany of Silicon Valley's high-profile startups rely on OpenAI's models as core infrastructure. Perplexity uses OpenAI's models to power parts of its AI search and answer engine. Harvey, one of the fastest-growing legal tech startups, is built on OpenAI's models to assist lawyers with research and drafting.\n\nAltman's comments underscore how OpenAI's infrastructure business is emerging as a key growth engine, even as the company faces massive costs for computing power and data centers.\n\nThose pressures have pushed OpenAI to look beyond consumer subscriptions.\n\nLast week, the company said it is gearing up to test ads inside ChatGPT as it faces about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments over the coming years.\n\nIt's a notable shift for a company that once treated ads as taboo. Less than two years ago, Altman said advertising was a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nSince then, Altman has struck a more open tone. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't \"totally against\" ads, though he stressed it would need to be approached carefully.\n\nEarlier this week, OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised the idea of \"licensing models\" that would let the company share in downstream sales if a customer's product succeeds.\n\n\"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,\" Friar said in an episode of \"The OpenAI Podcast\" published Monday.",

    "description": "TikTok has closed a joint-venture deal for its US business, handing over some operational control to an investor group.",
    "fullText": "TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group.\n\n\"The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,\" the company said.\n\nAdam Presser is leading the new venture, according to the company's announcement. Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.\n\nTikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.\n\nWhile Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.\n\nThe company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.\n\nFollowing the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok.\"\n\nHe said the deal had reached a \"very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.\"\n\nThe deal has been in the works for a year. At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.\n\nSince then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.",

    "fullText": "Energy is integral to the world, and every investor should probably have some exposure to the sector.\n\nChevron is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, providing diversification across the energy sector.\n\nChevron offers an attractive combination of yield and financial strength, relative to its closest peers.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›\n\nThe world is trying to shift away from dirtier energy sources, such as coal and oil. However, it's likely to be a long transition. Oil and natural gas will both be needed for decades to come, as the most likely energy strategy is an \"all of the above\" approach.\n\nEvery investor should probably have some exposure to the energy sector. That's the foundational reason why you should consider adding Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to your portfolio. Here are three company-specific reasons why.\n\nThe energy sector is volatile by nature, with oil and natural gas prices rising and falling regularly. You could focus on a narrow niche of the industry, but most investors will be best served by a company with a diversified portfolio of assets that provide exposure to the entire energy value chain. That's what integrated energy companies like Chevron do.\n\nChevron is best known for its oil and natural gas production, which falls into the upstream segment of the industry. However, it also owns energy infrastructure assets, such as pipelines, which help move oil and natural gas around the world.\n\nThat's the midstream. It also owns chemical and refining businesses that operate in the downstream segment of the industry. These businesses process energy into the products that actually get used, like gasoline.\n\nEach segment of the industry operates a little differently through the energy cycle. The best example of the benefit is that low oil prices put pressure on upstream producers but reduce costs in the downstream segment, where oil is a key input into the production of other products. From a foundational perspective, integrated Chevron has an attractive business model.\n\nChevron's dividend yield is currently 4.1%. That's well above the S&P 500 index's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.1% yield and the 3.3% yield of the average energy stock. Chevron clearly has an attractive yield on an absolute level.\n\nChevron, however, doesn't have the highest yield among its closest integrated energy peers. That title goes to TotalEnergies at around 5.9%. However, Chevron does have an over 30-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it. That's second in the sector to ExxonMobil's over-40-year streak, but Exxon's yield is only around 3.1%. All in, Chevron is a reliable dividend stock with an attractive yield that stands out from its peers.",

    "description": "In a World Economic Forum panel moderated by Business Insider, robotics experts dove into how bots are going to change the world.",
    "fullText": "In a world of AI chatbots and agents, we're not talking enough about physical AI.\n\nAt a Thursday morning Davos panel moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, robotics experts dived into ways bots are going to change the world — and their key limitations.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the World Economic Forum panel, which featured robotics and automation experts and a trade minister:\n\nOne phrase dominated the conversation: digital twins.\n\nExecutives from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a distant possibility is now delivering real productivity gains for companies.\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object, person, or process. They can help organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, allowing them to make better decisions.\n\n\"Digital twins have been around, but the technology has exponentially improved, and the computing power has exponentially improved,\" said Automation Anywhere CEO Mihir Shukla.\n\nHe added, \"Let's say digital twins tell you that there is going to be a problem in manufacturing. You can proactively act on it. It has implications on your inventory. It has implications on your shipping planning.\"\n\nSiemens' CEO Roland Busch said that the productivity boost is showing up in numbers.\n\nHe said that the company's output is 20% higher and that energy costs are 20% lower.\n\n\"You have much, much faster and ramping up, you don't make mistakes,\" if you use a digital twin, he said.\n\nRobots can do work that humans are unable to — or don't want to — do, said Peggy Johnson, the CEO of Agility Robotics.\n\n\"It's very hard to hire for these manual jobs,\" she said. \"They're dull and dirty, and they're dangerous at times because you're lifting over and over again, very repetitive. It's kind of mind-numbing work.\"\n\nFaster progress in robotics means a better quality of life for the humans who are doing such jobs.\n\n\"The injuries are also another thing,\" she said about jobs that require a lot of heavy lifting. \"We have an aging workforce. A lot of young kids don't want to go into environments like this. So the older employees are also getting hurt more.\"\n\nThani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the Minister of Foreign Trade for the United Arab Emirates, echoed that robotics was the future of \"non-skilled\" labor.\n\n\"It's too difficult to attract new young people to start working on the construction,\" he said. \"Robotics is the main solution.\"\n\nBut building robots that are safe to use in human environments is also key, Johnson said.\n\nAl Zeyoudi added that financing AI is only the first step toward AI integration.\n\n\"Sometimes you have the money, but you haven't diagnosed the right solution to the problem that you're having,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the UAE's push for AI includes government appointments, policy development, and research and development, which was the \"main game changer.\"\n\n\"Many, many stakeholders are avoiding that because they say someone else will do it,\" he said, referring to R&D. \"I'll just copy and paste it.\"\n\n\"But when it comes to AI, it's too late,\" Al Zeyoudi added. \"You have to start working on R&D because you ensure to customize things to your own ecosystem, your own environments, your own conditions.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider is tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.",
    "fullText": "From Davos to Washington to America's high school classrooms, people are questioning the foundations of our economic system — and we at Business Insider are tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.\n\nPolls show Americans' trust in capitalism is falling fast, as daily life has grown more expensive and less secure. Our own recent survey of readers found that people are worried their wages aren't keeping up with their expenses, that housing feels out of reach, and that the whole system seems shaky. Many employers are leaning even more heavily into a capitalistic approach, deemphasizing loyalty and tenure in favor of ruthless meritocracy. Meanwhile, the US government has taken a more hands-on role in the economy, becoming a shareholder in several companies and upending its place in the capitalist system.\n\nAs questions about the state of capitalism grow, leaders are pitching competing visions of the economy's future. President Trump told a room full of CEOs, executives, and media figures at Davos this week that the US is reshaping the rules to make sure the country comes out of this period of transition \"bigger and better than before.\" Some are pushing for reform, like California governor Gavin Newsom, who called for a \"rules-based, competitive\" model at Davos. Others, like New York City's self-described socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, want to rethink the system from the ground up — and have a lot of voters on board.\n\nWhile capitalism's future hangs in the balance, Business Insider is digging in. We're exploring how and why the system is being reshaped — by government policy, by companies, and by you.\n\nTell us what you think about the future of capitalism. Test your own understanding. And stick with us as we track how this system is evolving in real time, and what it will look like next.",

    "title": "Trump called Greenland a 'piece of ice.' To Greenlanders, it's so much more.",
    "description": "President Donald Trump repeatedly called Greenland a \"piece of ice\" while speaking at Davos. Three Greenlanders gave Business Insider their responses.",
    "fullText": "For over 56,000 people, Greenland is far more than a \"piece of ice\" — it's home.\n\nThat's what three residents of Greenland told Business Insider on Wednesday after President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the island as a \"piece of ice\" and called it \"Iceland\" on several occasions during a speech to World Economic Forum attendees at the Davos Conference.\n\nOn one occasion, Trump took a more complimentary tone and referred to the autonomous territory of Denmark as a \"big, beautiful piece of ice.\" He added that the US \"alone can defend this giant piece of ice,\" calling it a \"core national security interest.\"\n\nTrump isn't the first US president to want to acquire Greenland. In fact, the US has been discussing it since the 19th century. However, residents across Greenland — in the south, the north, and the capital — told Business Insider they don't appreciate Trump's rhetoric.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Just calling Greenland a 'piece of ice' is so inaccurate,\" 32-year-old Ole Olsvig told Business Insider. Olsvig, an entrepreneur and tourist guide in Qaarsut in North Greenland, called the rhetoric \"outrageous,\" \"disrespectful,\" and \"commoditizing.\"\n\nTechnically, about 80% of Greenland is covered by a giant ice sheet. That's not what concerns Olsvig, though; it's what the remarks imply.\n\nIt erases people and implies disposability, he said. \"Greenland is like being treated as an asset, not a society of people.\"\n\nTrump has spoken of acquiring Greenland since his first presidential term. In his Davos speech on Wednesday, he called for \"immediate negotiations\" about the US taking control of Greenland, saying, \"We need it for strategic, national security, and international security.\"\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer who lives in Qassiarsuk in South Greenland, told Business Insider.\n\nShe added that she thinks Trump wants Greenland for more than just national security reasons — he also wants access to Greenland's trove of natural resources.\n\n\"We have very strict rules in the mining industry, which is good. So even though he really wants to buy Greenland, it's not just like a place he can just buy and then make a mine,\" she said.\n\nAnother point of contention among Greenlanders is that Trump's portrayal of Greenland as a \"piece of ice\" ignores the territory's rich and distinct culture.\n\nGreenland has its own official language, self-governance, and cultural practices, including hunting, fishing, and sled dogs, Olsvig said. \"Greenland isn't just a blank map.\"\n\nKleist added, \"We're not becoming part of America,\" despite Trump's wishes.\n\nThe attention Greenland has gotten on the world stage has had some positive effects, said 28-year-old Casper Frank Møller, the CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, which is based in Nuuk.\n\nFor example, his company saw a surge in interest from tourists at the start of 2025 when Trump re-raised the topic of acquiring Greenland.\n\nHowever, Møller said that the US's raid on Venezuela has caused further concerns among people in Greenland because \"there was just way more power behind the words.\" He estimates that 20 to 30 customers have postponed travel plans to Greenland as they wait out the situation.\n\nHe added that Trump's aggressive approach toward Greenland has actually made the country a little less polarized and more united toward potential independence.\n\n\"We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?\" he said.\n\n\"We as Greenlandic people, we are democratic, we aim for diplomacy, and we don't want any warfare to be happening here in Greenland. We're looking for diplomatic solutions,\" he added.\n\nMøller, for one, seemed to see some truth in the description of Greenland as a \"piece of ice.\"\n\n\"Greenland for sure has an immense, abnormally big piece of ice in the ice sheet,\" he said. \"It's true.\"\n\nThat said, \"we have some of the most beautiful places on Earth. Some of the most remote, untouched areas that you can imagine,\" he added. \"And I would say, for that big chunk of ice, that's what we call home.\"",

    "description": "Michael Rumph and Darlene Person, siblings in Atlanta, built a profitable 13-car Turo fleet that started with their mother's car in 2022.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Michael Rumph, 60, and Darlene Person, 61, siblings in metro Atlanta who run JDM Whipz, a 13-car Turo fleet. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDarlene: For several years, my brother, Mike, and I talked about wanting to go into business together. We considered a few ideas but hadn't settled on one.\n\nIn February 2022, we rented an Escalade from Turo for a family trip. Almost exactly a year later, we launched our own Turo business, JDM Whipz.\n\nDarlene: Mike dove into research, sending me videos and websites every week. We began meeting on Sundays to discuss launching a Turo business.\n\nI'm a federal government employee, and I still work full-time. Most of my Turo work takes place in the evenings, when I prep cars after my day job. When we started, both of us were balancing full-time jobs.\n\nMike: I'm an IT nerd with 37 years of experience in desktop support, server support, and project management. Now, I'm a full-time Turo project manager.\n\nMike: The Corolla belonged to our mom, who died in June 2022. It's still on the platform; I just had the front end repainted and protective film added.\n\nFrom there, we purchased a 2017 Mazda, a 2017 Chevy Malibu, a 2017 Equinox, and a 2018 Equinox. By the end of our first year, we had 10 cars. We purchased eight with cash and used \"creative financing\" for the other two, purchasing them with 0% credit cards\n\nToday, we have 13 vehicles — we own 12 outright and have one payment on a 2019 Chrysler Pacifica. We've had five cars totaled in the past year, but because I hold a dealer's license and buy vehicles wholesale at auctions, we've been able to replace them and even come out ahead on insurance payouts.\n\nMike: Enterprise once quoted me $805 for an SUV from Friday to Sunday. Turo cost us $360 for four days and 600 miles when we rented that Escalade.\n\nDarlene: We listed mom's Corolla as a trial, but the first renter kept extending her trip week after week, and it ended up being 2.5 months total. The car was gone, and we had nothing to do, so we said, \"Let's add another.\"\n\nFrom the start, we reinvested every dollar back into the business. That's how we grew to 10 cars in a year.\n\nWe choose Turo's 60% protection plan: we keep 60%, Turo takes 40%, but our deductible is lower. Hosts can take up to 90% but risk a much higher deductible. Understanding that trade-off is important.\n\nMike: Day-to-day, I'm checking cars in and out, cleaning, handling inspections, and keeping up with competition in the Atlanta market.\n\nI left my IT job last April after paying off all my debts. I was breathing and dreaming of Turo at work. Now it's my focus.\n\nDarlene: Atlanta is huge, so Mike covers the north side, and I handle the south. We've never had all 13 cars sitting at our homes at once, where we store them.\n\nUsually they're rented out, coming back for a day or two before heading out again. I've learned more about cars in these two and a half years than I ever imagined.\n\nDarlene: We're obsessed with customer service. Over the years, we've both complained about poor service elsewhere. When we started JDM Whipz, I told Mike, \"I want people to feel valued.\" Our reviews consistently mention exceptional service, which is the most rewarding feedback we receive.\n\nMike: I built JDMWhipz.com because Turo's search doesn't show business names. Our site lets visitors view our entire fleet in one place without having to search. When ready to book, they tap a link that takes them directly to Turo to complete the reservation process.\n\nThe biggest challenge for new hosts is capital. Ideally, buy or own your first car outright. Read Turo's Terms of Service carefully to understand the responsibilities of both the host and the guest.\n\nDarlene: Most people start Turo while working full-time. You need excellent planning and time management. We learned the hard way: clean a car as soon as it returns.\n\nEarly on, we'd say, \"I'll do it in the morning,\" and then get a 7 a.m. booking. At 5 a.m., with car washes closed, you're in the driveway scrubbing, photographing, and prepping the car. Now it's a habit: the car comes in, and it gets cleaned.\n\nMike: Revenue now depends on the season and the vehicle. Our Corolla rents for $42 to $46 per day. Some cars earn $800 a month, while others earn $1,200 during peak season in Atlanta, which typically spans from March to September.\n\nWe're still making six figures in profit a year.\n\nDarlene: Check Turo's website for rules, like no cars older than 12 years or with more than 130,000 miles when listed.\n\nWatch videos from Turo hosts on YouTube, but vet their advice. Don't be afraid to ask experienced hosts for guidance. Mike and I mentor people all the time; we love helping new hosts succeed.\n\nOur long-term goal is to become Atlanta's go-to personal car rental company. We're proud of what we've built — and even prouder to do it together as siblings.",

    "description": "Business Insider visited an air base in Lithuania where Spanish jets are deployed to support NATO air policing operations.",
    "fullText": "ŠIAULIAI AIR BASE, Lithuania — The fighter pilots quickly grabbed their gear and stormed out the door of the small command building as alarm bells wailed from a loudspeaker. The countdown had started.\n\nThe Spanish pilots and the support crew piled into two vans, which swiftly shuttled them down snow-covered roads to the hangars. The powerful EF-18 jet engines roared to life, and with pre-flight checks complete, the fighters taxiied out onto the runway.\n\nAs the planes took off into the frigid January sky, the air base fell silent.\n\nFighter pilots from the 15th Wing of the Spanish Air Force deployed to NATO's forward edge have just 15 minutes to get airborne once a quick reaction alert mission is activated, usually in response to a nearby aircraft flying without identification or purposefully dodging international regulations.\n\nFighter jets are frequently sent out on very short notice to intercept Russian military aircraft over the Baltic Sea. NATO’s Air Command recorded more than 500 such rapid-response launches, known as scrambles, across allied airspace last year as part of air policing missions and other operations.\n\nAt Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania, Business Insider observed Spanish fighter jets taking off for what began as a training sortie. Once they were airborne, though, the flight became an \"alpha scramble,\" meaning they were tasked with responding to something suspicious — potentially a real threat.\n\nLt. Col. Fernando Allen, the commander of the Spanish detachment, could only say that the target was an unidentified aircraft. Recent NATO scrambles have intercepted Russian aircraft, including fighter jets and surveillance planes.\n\nAllen said that he and his fellow airmen are deployed to Lithuania \"to make safe skies for partner nations and allies.\"\n\nNATO launched the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2004 following the accession of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the alliance. Member states take turns deploying fighter jets to Šiauliai and two other bases in the region on a four-month rotational basis.\n\nThe mission is to protect the airspace above and around the three Baltic states — often referred to as NATO's front lines — amid anxiety over Russian activities in and near allied skies.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing deployed at the start of December to Šiauliai Air Base, where it is contributing to the air policing mission and the Eastern Sentry operation that NATO launched in September after Russian drones violated Polish airspace.\n\nThe Spanish detachment arrived with just over 200 personnel and 11 EF-18M fighters, upgraded versions of the American-made F/A-18 Hornet that only Madrid operates. The jets are armed with air-to-air missiles and equipped for round-the-clock operations, including night flights, with pilots using night-vision goggles.\n\nAlpha scrambles follow a step-by-step procedure. Control centers are monitoring the airspace 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If crews detect an unidentified radar track or an aircraft failing to follow international rules, they relay the information to one of NATO's combined air operations centers.\n\nWhen commanders decide to launch an alpha scramble, the pilots receive an order to take off and must be airborne within 15 minutes. They normally complete the task well ahead of time.\n\nThe scramble alert can come in at any moment, so pilots and support crews are always on standby. Some might be resting or even sleeping, but when the alarm bells ring, airmen are ready to get moving.\n\n\"You don't have time to think about what's happening. You only think about getting dressed and running to the airplane,\" Lt. Jesus Ortín, one of the Spanish EF-18 pilots, told Business Insider during a visit to Šiauliai this week. \"We are not waiting for it. We are on alert.\" There is an expectation that even at rest, they're ready.\n\nLt. Arturo Guitán, another EF-18 pilot, said his reaction to a scramble order is automatic in his brain, drilled in through extensive preparation before the deployment. \"I think it's quite easy to scramble,\" he said, \"because we train every day.\"\n\nFor identification and intercept missions, NATO fighter jets — regularly scrambled in pairs or fours — fly alongside aircraft until they move farther out into international airspace. Intercepts commonly occur over the Baltic Sea, a busy route linking mainland Russia with its heavily militarized Kaliningrad exclave between allied countries Poland and Lithuania.\n\nNATO has said that Russian aircraft often approach or fly near allied airspace without using transponders, having filed an official flight plan, or communicating with air traffic control. However, the culprit behind a scramble alert isn't always Moscow; civilian planes can trigger an alpha scramble as well.\n\nMembers of the 15th Wing couldn't disclose exactly how many alpha scrambles they have carried out since their deployment began. Allen, the detachment commander, said there were lots in December, but 2026 started off relatively quiet.\n\nSome weeks may trigger five scrambles, while others may see only two, the 15th Wing said. They appear random, and while intelligence officers are trying to map out any patterns, they've been unable to do so.\n\n\"We are proud to be here, and it's an honor to help our allied partner countries,\" Allen said. \"I know we're farther in the east, but we are doing the same mission that we were performing in our own country.\"",

In a statement, Saks said it is committed to \"trusted relationships with brand partners,\" and that funding it secured through the bankruptcy will \"facilitate go-forward payments to brand partners.\"\n\nBecoming a fashion designer was never a part of my vision board. When I founded Elisamama, I was still working a corporate job.\n\nI felt like I wanted to live a life of more meaning and purpose. My family is from Nigeria, and I spent time there growing up. I got the idea to start a brand that supports women artisans in the country.\n\nElisamama is a women's wear and children's brand inspired by African artistry and prints. At first, I sold the clothing at flea markets; later, I listed on Etsy and promoted it on social media.\n\nSaks really gave my business a platform to grow. Now, it's going through bankruptcy and hasn't paid me for some of my inventory. I'm not sure how to trust the company going forward.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, someone found us on Instagram and, unbeknownst to me, dropped our name with a Saks buyer. When the department store initially reached out, I thought it was a scam, and I didn't respond. Then, a vice president from the company DM'd me on Instagram.\n\nI freaked out and was very scared. I thought: How are we going to do this? I even told them I needed time to figure it out because I didn't want to mess up this opportunity.\n\nSaks really walked alongside us, gave us guidance, and helped us dip our toes slowly into its world. It was rapid-fire learning, trying to understand all the vendor requirements, including shipping and routing guidelines.\n\nWe hired more artisans in Nigeria. We beefed up our production. We worked on our supply situation. Everybody was winning; it helped us help other people grow their own businesses.\n\nIn 2023, Saks selected us to join its New Wave program for emerging designers. We came to New York, connected with industry experts and the press, and the company gave us a grant.\n\nAt the end, we had our products placed in the window at Saks' flagship store in New York. That was a remarkable moment for me and my team in Nigeria, who are so proud of this work. It was nothing that I could even have imagined for Elisamama.\n\nThe exposure it gave us was significant and gave us confidence.\n\nWe signed with a showroom and started selling in retailers like Shopbop, Tuckernuck, and several specialty boutiques. Things were ramping up, and the more I did this work, the more joy I found in it. In 2024, I left my corporate job.\n\nSaks has been a great partner to us. It has placed orders with us every season since 2020. It's 50% or 60% of our business.\n\nThe problems started in February of last year, when Saks sent vendors a memo about paying in installments. Prior to that, we were consistently paid on the agreed-upon payment terms.\n\nI thought: We can wait a few months to get paid. They're important partners.\n\nWe got a check for a couple of hundred dollars in July, and in August, we were paid a more substantial amount. I thought we were back on track and kept sending inventory. Then, no other payments came in.\n\nWe fulfilled two additional orders after that, operating on faith that things would shake out properly. The company kept saying it would get back to us with updates.\n\nNow, Saks owes us six figures. I'm considering cutting half of our team to stay viable.\n\nI employ 20 people full time in Nigeria; we have some consultants and contractors, as well. The amount Saks owes us means a lot.\n\nWhen Saks' bankruptcy was announced in January, the ax dropped. Because of the proceedings, Saks said it'd prioritize debts incurred after January 13 and get back to us on other payments owed.\n\nI have been trying to expand my partnerships and sales channels to protect my business, as we've been hearing about Saks' struggles for a long time.\n\nI want to see Saks win, but I don't believe the company anymore. We're sitting on Saks' most recent order, given the situation.\n\nI've told the buyers that any future shipments would have to be paid for before we ship. I'm also considering asking them to send back the inventory they have on hand, so at least we can cut our losses.\n\nSaks is so powerful and significant in the fashion space that partnering with it is valuable. What's happened is a disappointment, but it's also grief and sadness.\n\nSaks needs to restore trust with its suppliers by putting money behind its orders. If it did that, brands would continue to send goods because it's that important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Saks? Email Madeline Berg at mberg@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The Big Four firm is giving its US employees a new job title, according to an internal presentation seen by Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "In the consulting industry's era of AI upheaval, even job titles aren't safe.\n\nThe Big Four firm Deloitte is rolling out a sweeping overhaul of how it refers to its US workforce and introducing a new class of leader.\n\n\"All professionals will receive a new title that we will start to use internally and externally on June 1, 2026,\" said a presentation shared with employees during a meeting on Wednesday morning, which Business Insider has seen.\n\nDeloitte plans to tell employees their new job titles on January 29, before they take effect at the start of the firm's next financial year in June.\n\nThe meeting, hosted by Mo Reynolds, Deloitte US's chief people officer, was held for the consulting division, but the changes apply to all Deloitte's US divisions, the presentation said. Deloitte had 181,500 employees in the US as of May 31, 2025.\n\nThe firm also announced a new leadership role during Wednesday's meeting.\n\nCurrently, the most senior titles at the firm are partners, principals, and managing directors — known as PPMD. Starting in June, a role titled \"leaders\" will join the group, according to the presentation.\n\n\"We are modernizing our talent architecture to provide a more tailored experience reflective of our professionals' broad range of skills and the work they do,\" a Deloitte spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe overhaul of titles comes as Deloitte and its peers face existential questions posed by AI in the consulting industry. The technology is changing what it means to be a consultant, affecting long-held talent structures, pricing models, and the work that clients want from their consultants.\n\nIn the internal presentation, Deloitte frames the changes as a necessary modernization for a changing market.\n\nAfter a slide titled \"why now?\" the firm explains that its current talent architecture is \"outdated\" and unable to \"support our business of tomorrow.\"\n\nThe current structure was designed for \"a more homogenous workforce of 'traditional' consulting profiles,\" according to the presentation. \"But so much has changed.\"\n\nDeloitte's workforce and business have grown, employees are seeking more tailored talent experiences, and \"our clients are demanding new skills and capabilities,\" the presentation said.\n\nDay-to-day work, leadership, and the firm's \"compensation philosophy\" will all stay the same, according to the presentation.\n\nConsultants at Deloitte have traditionally followed a progression path of analyst, senior analyst, consultant, senior consultant, manager, and senior manager, before promotion to the top echelons of the firm.\n\nUnder the new system, these titles will become more specific and include reference to a \"job family\" and \"sub-family,\" which are another new feature introduced in the talent overhaul.\n\nIn an example from the presentation, an employee with the current job title of \"senior consultant\" could become \"senior consultant, functional transformation,\" \"software engineer III,\" or \"project management senior consultant\" on June 1.\n\nInternally, employees will also be assigned an alphanumeric reference to indicate their job level, such as L45 for what is currently a senior consultant and L55 for current managers.\n\nThese more specific titles will \"drive greater clarity and market relevancy,\" according to the presentation.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump had a change of heart on tariffs after meeting with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, where he shared an anecdote about his decision to lower the tariff rate on Swiss imports from the 39% he proposed in July. He said meetings with Swiss businesses, including watchmaker Rolex, influenced the decision.\n\nTrump said, \"all hell really broke out\" after he proposed the tariff rate.\n\n\"I was paid visits by everybody,\" he said. \"Rolex came to see me.\"\n\nTrump said that watch brands like Rolex had contributed to a trade deficit with Switzerland.\n\n\"But I realised, and I reduced it because I don't want to hurt people,\" he said of the tariff rate.\n\nAs it stands, there's a 15% cap on the tariff rate for Swiss imports.\n\nHowever, that rate could change again, Trump said. He said he initially planned a 30% tariff on Switzerland, then raised it to 39%, before lowering it to 15%.\n\n\"We brought it down to a lower level. Doesn't mean it's not going up, but we brought it down to a lower level,\" Trump said.\n\nSome US watch sellers have said higher tariff rates could lead Swiss watchmakers to raise prices, which could affect consumers.\n\nRolex didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSwiss business leaders met with Trump last year to discuss the tariffs, and Rolex left him with a desk clock modeled after one of its iconic watches, watch publication Hodinkee reported.\n\nTrump had kind words for Swiss watchmakers at Davos.\n\n\"They make beautiful watches, great watches, Rolex, all of them,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aliett Buttelman, cofounder of Fazit. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen people hear that my company took off after Taylor Swift wore our product, they might assume it was a matter of luck. But really, it was the result of a 360-degree strategy we'd developed to get the product into Taylor Swift's hands.\n\nI started Fazit with Nina LaBruna about three years ago. Nina had been a marketing client of mine, and she had pitched me on the idea of entering the skincare patch market. From there, we expanded into cosmetics, which was a truly revolutionary move. We launched glitter freckles — a makeup patch to put glittery spots on the cheekbones — in April 2024, and the product immediately went viral online, selling 100,000 units in its first week.\n\nWe felt Taylor Swift embodied the essence of the glitter freckles. There would be no one better in the world to wear it. So, we started sending the product to the wives and girlfriends of Kansas City Chiefs players, to Taylor's make-up artists, and to Sabrina Carpenter, who was opening for her at the time, hoping to catch her attention.\n\nThe night Taylor wore the freckles, in October 2024, I had just come home from hot yoga, and the Monday night football game was already on. The Chiefs were playing, and a content creator noticed the freckles on Taylor and messaged me. When I saw the product on her face, I just started bawling.\n\nA part of me just couldn't believe it. The biggest celebrity in the world was wearing our makeup patches, validating all the hard work Nina and I had put in. But really, I was crying because I knew this moment counted: it was about to open the door to so many possibilities. It was our chance, despite the brand being so young.\n\nWe immediately got to work. People noticed the freckles, but didn't know Fazit was the brand behind them. I started reaching out to as many media contacts as I could and hired a publicist. The next day, I was on CBS and Peacock.\n\nNina handles the back end of the business, and she was just as busy. She had to double the size of our warehouse overnight. Shipping labels were printing nonstop. We generated seven figures in sales within the first 48 hours after Taylor wore the freckles, and our web traffic increased by 4,800%.\n\nThe first two months were primarily about staying afloat and avoiding too many cracks in the business. Before the Taylor effect, Fazit only had one employee in addition to Nina and me. After that, we called any friends and family we could, asking for help with fulfilling orders.\n\nThe influx of sales significantly changed the company's financials. Nina and I initially bootstrapped the company with $13,000 of our own savings. After some success, we raised $200,000 from friends and family. But in the fall of 2024, we only had enough cash on hand to run the business for about five more months.\n\nTaylor changed that. We had private equity and venture capital firms reach out, but we haven't needed to fundraise. For the first time, Nina and I were able to take a distribution. Now, we have a business that is so profitable and healthy that we can really focus on the next stage of growth.\n\nA year after Taylor wore the freckles, she donned them again, which gave us another sales boost. This time, we were better prepared. Yet, a lot of the past year and a half has still felt like a fight or flight response. We're just trying so hard to take advantage of opportunities and make all the right decisions.\n\nNina and I weren't friends when we started the company together. Now, she's my life partner. We're closer than friends — we're family. No one, with the possible exception of our husbands, can truly understand what it's like to go through this hyper growth.\n\nThe highs are so high, the lows are so low, and there are many unexplainable emotions.",

    "fullText": "A trade war between the US and Europe is heating up as President Donald Trump demands American control over Greenland.\n\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, and France are four of the eight European countries that could face new tariffs once February kicks off. Trump made the tariff threats after those countries sent troops to Greenland earlier in January.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said he will levy a new 10% tariff in February on imports from those countries, set to jump to 25% in June \"to protect Global Peace and Security\" because these countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown\" and \"have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" Trump added that the tariffs will be in effect until a deal to buy Greenland is reached.\n\nThat new round of tariffs could affect a slew of goods, with medicine and cars leading the way. The US imported a total of $365 billion in goods from the eight targeted countries in 2024. That included about $44 billion in pharmaceutical preparations and nearly $40 billion in new or used passenger cars. Some other main imports included aircraft, industrial engines, and toiletries and cosmetics.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response.\"\n\nTrump continues to insist the US acquire Greenland, but said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that he won't use force to do so.\n\n\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that,\" he said.",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "Jason Myers plays bass in the heavy metal band Icarus Witch and still works full-time as a senior vice president for a boutique marketing firm.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Myers, a marketing-firm executive and professional bass player in the band Icarus Witch. He is based in Pittsburgh. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started playing bass in heavy metal bands in junior high. I wanted to become a professional musician, but as soon as I got out of college in 1993, I started a side hustle doing publicity for concert promoters and record labels for in case my rock-and-roll dreams didn't pan out.\n\nThe side hustle was really a full-time day job, which made managing a serious band challenging. I'd have to book studio time at night and work until the sun came up, and I could only book shows on weekends unless I took time off from my job.\n\nIn 2003, the band I'm still in today, Icarus Witch, got signed to a label. We put out our first record in 2005 and started getting radio play. As our popularity grew, I wanted to accept longer tours. But the money you earn from touring is essentially a loan against your royalties, so I had to keep working to sustain myself.\n\nOut of a 24-hour day, the band is only on stage for maybe an hour. The rest is spent traveling, waiting, and sleeping. There was a lot of wasted time I knew I could fill, and we were entering an era of greater WiFi capabilities.\n\nAs the years passed, I started to recognize that the music industry was shrinking. People were downloading songs instead of buying CDs, and there were fewer opportunities to make money. Even though my band was successful, it felt more like a personal victory, and I realized it was time to make some adult decisions about how I would protect myself in the future.\n\nIn 2010, I was asked to join a marketing and PR startup called The Content Factory that was early into the remote work thing. I had previously worked with the owner and founder, Kari DePhillips, at another startup. Though I'd only ever done publicity and marketing for bands, Kari said that didn't matter.\n\nSoon after, my band went on tour with the veteran group Y&T, and they were gracious enough to let me work from their bus since we were following them around in a small van. When we'd stay at a hotel, I'd sit in our room after shows working, while my bandmates would check out the local bar scene and meet up with fans.\n\nThese days, my band is more selective about the shows we play because going on tour doesn't make as much financial sense as it once did. That's why you see exorbitant ticket prices when a band does decide to go out.\n\nI'm still with The Content Factory. I worked my way up from account rep to senior vice president of PR and social media marketing. I still enjoy the hell out of playing music, but the company's well-being is on my mind all the time now.\n\nWhen you're in a band on the rise, it's easy to feel invincible, like this is going to last forever. But you have to look out for yourself. No one is going to save you.\n\nI used to have this mindset that if I allowed myself to think about a Plan B, I'd somehow jinx my chances of making it big. In hindsight, I realize that's foolish. You can plan for your future and live the wild life at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.",

    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of Senegal football fans lined the streets of Dakar on Tuesday as the Lions of Teranga held a victory parade to celebrate their triumph in the Africa Cup of Nations final against Morocco.\n\nThe players and coaches brandished their trophy from an open-top bus which inched its way through immense crowds across the capital, winding towards the country's presidential palace.\n\nAs the players travelled the final stretch of their journey along the city's oceanside highway, the Corniche, fans walked and sometimes ran alongside the bus, with throngs of people lining the sidewalks.\n\nDowntown was overcome by a fever pitch of almost deafening noise -- revving engines, horns, vuvuzelas and shouting -- as the players neared the palace, where they will be officially received.\n\nIn the morning, thousands had gathered at the parade's starting point in Patte d'Oie, a working-class neighbourhood across town, wearing team jerseys, chanting, whistling and blowing vuvuzelas.\n\nAll along the route old and young, men and women turned out decked in the country's green, yellow and red colours, sometimes watching on from buildings and bridges, or even climbing on top of cars and billboards.\n\nSecurity forces were also present in large numbers, including anti-riot police.\n\nThe Senegal team made its way across the capital after arriving on a special flight from Morocco shortly before midnight on Monday, where they were greeted by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and other members of the government.\n\nSenegal won the Africa Cup of Nations when they beat hosts Morocco 1-0 in a chaotic final in Rabat on Sunday that saw the eventual champions storm off the pitch late in the game.\n\n\"I wouldn't have missed this moment for the world,\" 26-year-old fan Doudou Thiam told AFP from the parade's sidelines in the Bourguiba neighbourhood, wearing a Senegal jersey.\n\n\"The Lions are our pride and they deserve all the honours. Even if it meant staying here all day, I would have done it\", he said.\n\nA ruckus of whistles and horns has been almost constant since Senegal's victory on Sunday night, when fans flooded the streets, filling the air with honking, fireworks and the deafening roar of vuvuzelas.\n\nThe win marked Senegal's second title, after their 2022 victory over Egypt in Cameroon. It was the team's third final in just the last four editions.\n\nHortense Kenny brought her five-year-old child to Patte d'Oie to watch the parade.\n\n\"The Lions made an entire nation proud, beating the host country in those circumstances,\" she told AFP, referring to the end of the match.\n\n\"Now, all that's left is to win the World Cup. With Sadio Mane, anything is possible,\" she said, referencing the team's biggest star.\n\nHis role as peacemaker during the final -- he was the one who stayed on the pitch and persuaded his teammates to return -- has been widely praised.\n\nNearby Abdulai Sy, a 49-year-old, told AFP he felt personally touched by the victory which gave him a \"big sense of pride to also be Senegalese\".\n\nTuesday's crowd seemed unphased by a cloud of controversy surrounding their team's decision to storm off the pitch late in normal time in protest at a penalty awarded to Morocco.\n\nPrompted by Mane, they returned to the pitch and an attempted 'Panenka' penalty from Morocco's Brahim Diaz was easily saved by Senegal's goalkeeper before Pape Gueye won the game with a superb shot in extra time that stunned the Moroccan crowd.\n\nThe Moroccan FA said it had referred the incidents, including protests from Senegal players and fans, to the Confederation of African Football and FIFA.\n\nFar from Morocco, football's lucrative business side had trickled down even to the streets of Dakar on Tuesday.\n\nAmath Ndiaye, a 36-year-old street vendor who usually sells tissues, told AFP he has switched to hawking jerseys, flags, vuvuzelas and whistles for the duration of AFCON and the celebratory aftermath.\n\nOn Tuesday, he was basking in the wisdom of his decision.\n\n\"I'm doing well,\" he told AFP from Patte d'Oie, near the joyous crowd decked out in patriotic Senegalese gear and waving flags.",

    "fullText": "Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools.\n\nMore than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland.\n\nThey included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nJetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThe most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider.\n\nBuying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower.\n\nThe world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August.\n\nAt 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours.\n\nOther major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay.\n\nPrivate jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro.\n\nLondon was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose.\n\n10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai.\n\nDozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week.\n\nTuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy.",

    "description": "\"The Diary of a CEO\" host said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that using AI to translate podcasts into Spanish broadened its reach.",
    "fullText": "Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,\" Bartlett said during the \"What it Takes to Build\" panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nThe British entrepreneur and host of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast was in conversation with Jessica Lessin, the CEO of The Information, alongside Bret Taylor, formerly the co-CEO of Salesforce and CTO of Meta.\n\nBartlett said using AI tools to translate the podcasts was initially an \"expensive experiment.\" The problem he was trying to solve, he said, was reaching the untapped market of non-English speakers.\n\n\"If we're just in English, we're reaching like 10% of the world,\" Bartlett added.\n\nThere were technical challenges, too. Some languages use longer words, Bartlett said, meaning three-hour English-language conversations could become significantly longer when translated, risking the audio and video falling out of sync.\n\nTwo years ago, Bartlett announced on LinkedIn that \"The Diary of a CEO\" had hired a full-time data scientist who helped the company achieve a technological breakthrough, enabling them to use AI to translate the podcast into \"EVERY language.\"\n\nAt Davos and in the LinkedIn post, Bartlett did not elaborate on exactly how the AI translations work. Today, however, the videos show Bartlett speaking Spanish in a voice similar to his own, a shift he said had significantly expanded the podcast's reach.\n\n\"This month, 28% of my audience is Spanish,\" he said, adding that Spanish speakers now have access to interviews with some of the world's most high-profile podcast guests, citing his own interview with former first lady Michelle Obama as an example.\n\nOther guests on the podcast include former vice President Kamala Harris, Simon Cowell, and the psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nSpotify said in its \"2025 Wrapped\" press release in December 2025 that \"The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett\" was the platform's second-most-listened-to podcast globally, behind \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" On YouTube, Bartlett's podcast channel has 14.5 million subscribers.",

    "title": "Citi has quietly built a 4,000-person internal AI workforce",
    "description": "Around 4,000 employees globally have volunteered to fan out across their business units as \"AI accelerators.\"",
    "fullText": "At Citi, some of the people leading the Wall Street bank's AI push aren't part of a specialized tech team. They're colleagues a few desks over.\n\nThose employees are part of the bank's AI Champions and Accelerators program, which got off the ground in early 2024 and now counts around 4,000 people among its ranks of voluntary AI helpers. At its most basic level, the program aims to have the designated \"accelerators\" help colleagues within their business units leverage and understand AI tools. The program's approximately 25-30 \"champions\" help lead the accelerators in their line of business.\n\nCiti's program is one of many ways banks are racing to adopt AI, from offering engineers capstone-style courses to luring top tech talent by promising a seat at powerful managerial tables. To date, Citi's AI tools are available in 84 countries for 182,000 employees. Adoption of the firm's proprietary tools is above 70%, Citi CEO Jane Fraser told analysts during the bank's earnings call last week.\n\nAnd it's clear that she has high expectations for all employees, including accelerators. In a January memo, she told staff she expected \"a more disciplined, more confident\" workforce in 2026, and that AI will likely \"reshape how work gets done.\"\n\nAmong the bank's range of initiatives to encourage AI uptake, the accelerators and champions model is uniquely embedded throughout teams and based on peer-to-peer interactions, said Carey Ryan, one of the initiative's leaders and the chief of staff for the technology organization.\n\n\"A small central team would never be able to reach where we are now,\" Ryan said.\n\nTech leaders at Citi came up with the program when brainstorming how to engage a wider swath of its population with AI, Ryan said. Originally, her team only planned to have 2,500 accelerators, but they saw more interest than expected and still maintain a waitlist for the program.\n\nWhile colleagues nominate champions for the position, anyone can volunteer to be an accelerator. The only requirement is being excited about AI, Ryan said.\n\nJosh Goldsmith is the AI champion for internal audit, where he's also the head of digital solutions and innovation. He's been a part of the program since its inception, and said that \"demystifying AI\" is among its greatest successes so far.\n\n\"It's a lot different when you hear from a colleague as to how you can leverage these tools, as opposed to having someone who's, let's say, a technologist trying to push this,\" he said. \"To be able to see someone put it in action: 'Hey, they can do it! I'm just like them, I can do it as well.'\"\n\nRyan also said that the peer-to-peer approach is part of what makes the initiative work, since a more general team couldn't understand all of the job-specific AI use cases across the bank. She added that accelerators have helped host more than 100 Citi AI Days, where they hold demonstrations and answer questions.\n\nAccelerators meet with their cohorts two times each month to participate in demos, learn about new tools, get training, or talk about their recent work. Goldsmith oversees around 50 participants; between attending their meetings and his own bi-monthly champion meetings, he said he devotes between three and five hours to the program each week, on top of his usual job.\n\nThe program members can also opt into trainings on topics including agentic AI to earn visual \"AI badges,\" which they can include in their email signatures. There are no specific engagement metrics, though, and people can drop out of the program if it becomes too demanding a time commitment.\n\n\"One accelerator might have five interactions, and maybe they're five small interactions,\" Ryan said. \"Another accelerator might have one really big interaction, where they're doing something with hundreds of people.\"\n\nAmong the AI peer coaches in internal audit, between 70% and 80% have stayed in the program, Goldsmith said. He added that, despite the extra hours, participating has given him a broader perspective on AI across Citi, and \"a clear vision in terms of what's coming next.\"\n\nFor Carey, there's something of a symbiotic relationship between program leads, participants, and the rest of the bank. Accelerators will explain what they're hearing from their lines of business — where people are struggling, what they might need — as Citi continues to fine-tune its approach to AI. They have, for example, helped Citi tweak AI tools, suggesting enhancements like adding notifications and allowing employees to upload larger files.\n\n\"It's an important conduit for feedback back in,\" she said.",

CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call in November that DoorDash would invest hundreds of millions of dollars this year in key initiatives, including a global tech platform for all its brands and autonomous tech.\n\nDoorDash employees don't just work on big problems, though. The company requires its corporate workforce to periodically make deliveries themselves through a program called WeDash.\n\nSome of the people making all of that happen at DoorDash corporate have joined the company from outside the US, and the company has sponsored H-1B visas.\n\nEmployers include salary information when submitting applications to the US Department of Labor for H-1B work visas. The publicly available data includes ranges for base pay, but excludes equity or other benefits that companies often offer employees. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers in similar roles.\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2025, DoorDash submitted roughly 540 H-1B visa applications, which can offer insight into what the delivery company pays for certain jobs.\n\nThe H-1B visa application process is changing under President Donald Trump.\n\nIn September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which DoorDash has disclosed salaries in the work visa data. DoorDash did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter at abitter@businessinsider.com or via encrypted messaging app Signal at 808-854-4501.

    "fullText": "On a Monday morning in early December, I met Gina Jaguttis as we loaded our surfboards into the camp van just before sunrise. We only got to talking on a choppy boat ride that took us a mile off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe 26-year-old real estate project manager from Munich came to the surf camp to improve her skills on the water. I came to talk with adventurous travelers about their big ideas, from new businesses to life after layoffs.\n\nAt our camp's bonfire that night, she began to tell me why she made a second solo expedition to the tropical island. As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",
