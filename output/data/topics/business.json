    "fullText": "SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI creates business worth $1.25tn but whether premise behind deal will work is questioned\n\nThe acquisition of xAI by SpaceX is a typical Elon Musk deal: big numbers backed by big ambition.\n\nAs well as extending “the light of consciousness to the stars”, as Musk described it, the transaction creates a business worth $1.25tn (£920bn) by combining Musk’s rocket company with his artificial intelligence startup. It values SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, with a stock market flotation expected in June to time with Musk’s birthday and a planetary alignment.\n\nHowever, there are questions over the deal, such as whether it is good for SpaceX’s non-Musk shareholders and whether the technological premise behind it can succeed.\n\nFor Musk, a key part of the deal’s rationale is to move datacentres – the central nervous system of AI tools – into space.\n\nAI companies are too dependent on earth-bound datacentres that carry immense energy demands, Musk argued this week. The solution, he says, is to put as many as a million satellites into orbit to form vast, solar-powered datacentres.\n\nProf Julie McCann and Prof Matthew Santer, the co-directors of the school of convergence science in space, security and telecoms at Imperial College London, say solar-powered datacentres could be a future option for AI companies. However, there are limits to how much compute power can be mustered by current satellites, they say, so it would need a “planet-wide distributed computer composed of many satellites” – as envisioned by Musk.\n\nBut even executing the concept might be affected by the quality of connection between the orbiting devices, which will need to operate in tandem in order to replicate terrestrial datacentres as they beam their outputs down to Earth.\n\nThere are other problems to be ironed out, they add, including solar radiation and maintenance. “Datacentres on earth are constantly maintained – component failure is normal. Shipping components to space is complex and expensive, and you would have to be innovative regarding how components are fitted.”\n\nMusk talks of these datacentres adding 100 gigawatts of AI capacity annually – current global datacentre capacity is about 59GW – so his vision is ambitious. The world’s richest person believes a merger of rocket hardware and AI software is a winning combination and, in a message to employees, said it would create the “most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth”.\n\n“This merger is aimed at creating a new path to generate a low cost of generating AI compute within the next two to three years by bringing together the top internet/space exploration company with top datacentre builders,” says Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services company Wedbush Securities.\n\nMusk’s artificial intelligence company, xAi, is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure – datacentres, computer chips – needed for their products. The company, which has developed the Grok AI tool and also owns the social media network X, reportedly burned through $13bn last year and, unlike Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, does not have a cash-generating legacy business to fund its efforts.\n\nCombining with SpaceX will give xAI better access to cash and investors, according to Ross Gerber, an investor in Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n“Musk is already running low on capital for xAI and it is competing with companies putting hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI investments. If you merge SpaceX and xAI you can support xAi because SpaceX is an extremely attractive prospect to a lot of investors,” he says.\n\nSpaceX’s technology is complex but it is a straightforward business. It generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service. SpaceX made about $8bn in profit on $15bn to $16bn of revenue ​last year, according to Reuters.\n\nThe addition of xAI adds narrative complexity to the SpaceX story, says Michael Sobel, the president and co-founder of Scenic Management, which buys secondary stakes in privately held companies and has invested in the AI company Anthropic.\n\nSobel, who speaks to SpaceX investors regularly, says: “By folding in xAI, which carries a significant monthly cash burn, you change the financial profile of the company overnight. In the secondary market, ‘simple’ is usually rewarded. This merger requires investors to do a lot more homework on how xAI’s cash burn impacts SpaceX’s overall valuation and IPO timeline.”\n\nThere is also the added burden of X, a social media platform that is a regular subject of regulatory scrutiny and political ire.\n\nNonetheless, Sobel adds, the argument in favour of the deal is compelling.\n\n“For a long-term investor, this secures the most advanced AI ‘brain’ for the most advanced hardware ‘body’ in existence. The upside is a $1.25tn entity that controls the entire stack, from the launchpad to the neural network.”\n\nGerber, who invested in Musk’s original buyout of X in 2022 when the platform was better known as Twitter, says he welcomes the deal but is less sure about SpaceX investors.\n\n“For me as a Twitter shareholder, I could not be happier. I pretty much figured I had lost my money but that has now been parlayed into owning SpaceX shares. It’s awesome for me but if I was a SpaceX shareholder I would be pissed.”\n\nMusk owns about 44% of the newly enlarged SpaceX business and 17% of Tesla, where he is the chief executive. Is the next step a combination of the two?\n\nIves believes there is a “growing chance” that a one-stop shop for investing in Musk businesses will be created.  “Musk wants to own and control more of the AI ecosystem and step by step the holy grail could be combining SpaceX and Tesla,” he says.\n\nGerber believes the timing is right, with both companies currently worth $1.25tn. “This is the time to create a multitrillion-dollar company. I know Elon. It’s going to happen,” he says.",

    "fullText": "New Anthropic campaign suggests other AI platforms will incorporate targeted ads in their chatbot conversations\n\nThe Seahawks and the Patriots aren’t the only ones gearing up for a fight.\n\nAI rivals Anthropic and OpenAI have launched a war of ads trying to court corporate America during one of the biggest entertainment nights of the year.\n\nAhead of the Super Bowl, Anthropic has launched a series of ads going hard at its rival.\n\nFor the scrawny 23-year-old who wants a six-pack, a ripped older man who is supposed to depict a chatbot suggests insoles that “help short kings stand tall” because “confidence isn’t just built in the gym”. And for the man trying to improve communication with his mom: his therapist prescribes “a mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars” in case he can’t fix that relationship.\n\nAll four ads end with the same tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” There’s no explicit mention of ChatGPT, but the subtext is clear.\n\nEven Sam Altman laughed. But he also called the ads “so clearly dishonest” before diving into a lengthy critique on X.\n\n“Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”\n\nAltman stressed that OpenAI’s decision to include ads, announced last month, makes the product more accessible. “We believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access,” he wrote. And Altman didn’t shy away from taking some shots of his own. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” he wrote. (Claude has a free subscription version, too.)\n\nChatGPT’s ad policy is not live yet, but OpenAI maintains on its website that ads will be “separate and clearly labeled” and won’t influence the answers users see. The company also states that it will not share conversations with ChatGPT with advertisers, and is focused on prioritising trust, claiming it will give users the option to turn off personalization or opt for an ad-free paid plan. The company said the chatbot would initially have ads show up at the bottom of answers “when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation”.\n\nAltman wasn’t always sold on including ads in ChatGPT’s business model. In October 2024, he dismissed the idea as a “last resort”. But in recent years, as OpenAI invests even more heavily in AI infrastructure, the company’s growth in new subscribers has dwindled.\n\nAnthropic’s critique of OpenAI didn’t come out of nowhere: Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI researchers who left based on concerns about the company’s direction on AI safety. Anthropic wrote in a 4 February blogpost that Claude would remain ad-free because doing otherwise would prevent the chatbot from being a “genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking”. The company likened open-ended conversations with AI assistants, which are often deeply personal or complex, to those with a trusted adviser. “The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous – and, in many cases, inappropriate,” the company wrote.\n\nEven if OpenAI says it won’t share user data directly with advertisers, targeted advertising more broadly has been criticized for exploiting users’ vulnerabilities. In this case, that concern could extend to users asking ChatGPT questions about their mental and physical health, similar to the issues shown in Anthropic’s ads. But there’s also a chance targeted advertising could help with reining in AI’s most toxic attributes. Big corporations that buy in may pull out in response to hateful or egregious content. Many websites and apps, from Google to Instagram, already have ads, so it may not be a huge adjustment for users.\n\nIt is unclear whether Altman’s attempts to deliver more revenue with ads will drive users to ad-free competitors. But Anthropic is betting on it.",

The Trump Administration found MAJOR FRAUD in programs THEY control, Newsom's Press Office's X account posted, linking to a New York Post exclusive on the announcement.\n\n\"The state has no role running / administering these programs.Were they hiding this??? California doesn’t hide fraud … we fight it. Nearly 1,000 arrests + over $125 billion STOPPED under @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom.\"\n\nLoeffler continued that the alleged California fraud comes after the SBA suspended 6,900 borrowers in Minnesota associated with 7,900 potentially fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans, which totaled roughly $400 million.\n\n\"As we did in Minnesota, we are actively working with federal law enforcement to identify the criminals who defrauded American taxpayers, hold them to account, and recoup the stolen funds. As we continue our state-by-state work, our message is clear: pandemic-era fraudsters will not get a pass under this Administration,\" Loeffler said, comparing California to its investigations in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota became ground zero for welfare and social services fraud surrounding the pandemic late in 2025, when investigators uncovered sweeping fraud schemes that could top $9 billion.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "The race to dominate the burgeoning AI market is pushing tech giants to adopt business models reminiscent of IBM's (IBM) in the 1960s.\n\nBig Tech \"hyperscalers\" Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are all in various stages of developing their own custom AI chips to put in their data centers and power their cloud and software offerings. Alphabet, the farthest along of the four companies, is even reportedly in talks to sell its physical chips called TPUs to Meta — a move that would see it go head-to-head with leading chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nThose efforts have led Bloomberg Intelligence analysts to predict the custom AI chip market will grow to $122 billion by 2033.\n\nBig Tech's production of their own components goes beyond chips: Microsoft and Amazon are actively investing in dark fiber, or currently unused fiber-optic cables that are already underground, RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin said in a recent note to clients. Google and Meta also own their own cables but still buy from third parties, he wrote. Those cables are necessary to connect companies' data centers and the enterprises that use them.\n\nThe dynamic in which cloud providers are making their own components (hardware) to run their core products (software) shows Silicon Valley swinging back toward vertical integration — an operating model pioneered by oil and steel tycoons in the late 19th century and adopted by IBM during the digital revolution.\n\nIBM was one of the most successful vertically integrated companies in the 1960s, when it made the hardware components for its mainframes, or large computer systems. IBM's strategy emerged from the idea that making its own specialized parts would improve its end product (mainframes) and profit margins — and amid concerns over supply shortages of parts for early computers. It worked: In 1985, the company accounted for more than half the market value of the computer industry, Carliss Y. Baldwin noted in her book \"Design Rules.\"\n\nOf course, that all fell apart later. In the 1990s, the falling costs of producing semiconductors — as well as the rise of software powerhouse Microsoft and chip leader Intel — dug into IBM's once-formidable competitive moat, and the company no longer claimed to be vertically integrated by 2000, Baldwin said.\n\nJust as the emergence of computers pushed IBM toward vertical integration, the popularization of AI since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 has put today's cloud giants on a similar trajectory. In particular, the steep costs of Nvidia's chips and their limited availability have pushed tech giants to advance their AI chip efforts. Those custom chips are cheaper and better optimized for the companies' software.",

    "description": "Replit founder Amjad Masad says AI can remove drudgery at work, letting employees build and own ideas inside large companies.",
    "fullText": "Amjad Masad thinks the modern workplace is broken — and he believes AI can help fix it.\n\nThe Replit founder and CEO says traditional corporate work has become deeply alienating, with employees siloed into narrow roles where ideas die in backlogs.\n\n\"One thing that I found extremely depressing is how atomized and siloed people are,\" Masad recently said on the \"Possible\" podcast with Reid Hoffman. \"People become sort of cogs in the machine. And I don't think that is conducive to the human spirit.\"\n\nAI, he said, is starting to reverse that dynamic by letting people inside big companies build, test, and ship ideas themselves — without waiting for engineering approval.\n\nMasad's bet is that AI agents can automate much of the repetitive, standardized work that dominates corporate life — documentation, internal tools, workflows — freeing employees to think and act more like entrepreneurs.\n\n\"As the boring things, the automated things actually are taken care of by machines, we're left to be more entrepreneurial and more creative,\" he said.\n\nMasad isn't the only tech leader seeing huge potential in deploying AI agents.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said AI agents can already handle work typically done by junior employees, Microsoft's AI platform product lead Asha Sharma has said they could flatten corporate hierarchies, and McKinsey's CEO Bob Sternfels has said the firm is already deploying 25,000 AI agents alongside its human workforce.\n\nOn the \"Possible\" podcast, Masad pointed to one case, where an employee at a big real estate marketplace had an idea to improve how buyers were routed to agents, but couldn't get engineering resources.\n\nIn the past, Masad said, \"the idea is dead,\" but now, the employee built a working routing algorithm himself using Replit, an AI-powered coding platform that lets users build and deploy software without traditional engineering support.\n\n\"He built a new routing algorithm that drove tens of millions of dollars, if not hundred million dollars, to the business,\" Masad said.\n\nThe result wasn't just business impact — the employee was promoted repeatedly and now helps guide the company's AI strategy at the board level, he said.\n\nMasad sees this as a form of entrepreneurship inside a large business where domain experts — not just engineers — can turn insight into execution.\n\nThat shift, he said, restores meaning to work by reconnecting people with the outcomes they create.\n\n\"Humans are fundamentally creative,\" he added.\n\nIf AI succeeds at removing drudgery rather than replacing judgment, Masad believes corporate jobs could become less soul-crushing and far more human.",

    "title": "A couple built a $1 million business turning shipping containers into vacation homes. Here's how they decided when to stop growing.",
    "description": "A couple started The Box Hop, a shipping container vacation home business. They are making $1 million in revenue but have decided not to expand.",
    "fullText": "There are several reasons to visit Hocking Hills, a foliage-rich region in the Appalachian foothills of Ohio: the majestic views, year-round outdoor adventures, and the chance to escape overwhelming city life.\n\nThe six shipping container homes dotting the region are another.\n\n\"Right now, I feel like the big push is experiential hospitality for people. It's no longer just staying at an Airbnb,\" Emily, 38, told Business Insider. \"What does it look like? What does it feel like? What's the experience like when you're there?\"\n\nWhile shipping containers might conjure visions of warehouses or loading docks, Seth and Emily Britt believed they could create a successful business transforming the storage units into modern vacation destinations. They earned over $1 million in revenue last year through their business, The Box Hop, which launched in 2018.\n\n\"When Emily and I were dating, I mentioned to her that someday I want to build a house out of shipping containers,\" Seth, 36, told Business Insider. \"Then she actually brought it back up in 2017, like, 'Hey, why don't we do that and chase that dream down?'\"\n\nNow, they have six vacation rentals and a wedding venue called The Seventy Five Venue. The couple also expanded their services to include construction, interior design, and cleaning.\n\nHowever, building their real estate portfolio involved making tough calls, including making the decision to downsize.\n\n\"I thought by now we would have a lot more properties, but I'm really glad we're where we're at because you can grow so much that you implode,\" Seth said.\n\nScaling a business is a tricky feat that has stumped major companies like WeWork, let alone small, family-owned operations trying to do the same thing.\n\nThey built their first rental home in 2018 by placing two shipping containers side by side and setting a third container on top, with the third facing the opposite direction. The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home has a rooftop patio, hot tub, full kitchen, and access to 18.5 acres of land.\n\n\"As soon as we built The OG, we were booked 100% every night for two years, and we booked out in advance a year,\" Seth said. \"We quickly realized we needed to increase the supply just to try to keep up with the demand.\"\n\nBuilding more vacation rentals in Hocking Hills was a natural step, but Emily and Seth also set their sights on new horizons: North Carolina and Michigan. The couple purchased the properties in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\"We're dreamers and were ready to jump into the next thing headfirst,\" Emily said.\n\nPreparing to scale took several steps, including applying for a loan, purchasing the properties, and gaining approval to move forward with the projects. While most business owners might have cheered and gone full steam into the expansion, Seth and Emily hesitated.\n\n\"The only thing that stopped us was the fact that the interest rates were so high,\" Emily said. \"It would almost be a wash for the business. There wasn't a lot of profit there, so it would have to run extremely lean, and it would not be for a huge amount of return.\"\n\nPlus, Emily and Seth live in Ohio, meaning they would likely have to pay other companies to maintain their properties, squeezing the budget and profits even more.\n\nWhen business owners get caught at a crossroad like this, Seth said it's important to start with the question \"why?\"\n\n\"Is it just to make more money? What's the point? \" Seth asked.\n\nAs enticing as branching out seemed, they ultimately sold the North Carolina property in 2023 and the Michigan property in 2025.\n\n\"We were super proud that we got it that far and had the option to continue, but in order to pace properly and not bite off more than we could chew, we said, 'Okay, it's not the time for that approach. We're in a critical time to save and profit.'\"\n\nAlthough Emily and Seth stepped back from those two projects, they've continued to push The Box Hop forward.\n\n\"People always joke about rentals being passive income. It's not passive, but there's a lot of freedom, fun, and beauty in what we do. She's stuck with me all the time, so it's been good,\" Seth said, referring to Emily.\n\nIn addition to more vacation rentals, the couple now wants to offer their interior design and construction services to short-term rental owners across the country.\n\n\"We have a business partner that we've been working tirelessly for two years to figure out how do we take The Box Holp and expand it,\" Emily said. \"People from all over the nation and all over the world are saying, 'How do we get one of these?'\"\n\nShe added: \"We'll play more of the middleman role by bringing all of the pieces of the puzzle together and figuring out how to do it.\"\n\nManaging their business is a full-time job, but Emily and Seth wouldn't want it any other way.\n\n\"My workweek now is a heck of a lot harder than it was working 40 hours a week in a manufacturing facility, but we have more freedom,\" Seth said. \"We're not missing our kids' sporting events, and we're able to be present. That's been huge.\"",

    "fullText": "Being the ultimate sports fan doesn't come with a warning label, but maybe it should. Cheering on your favorite team can cause severe mood swings, violent outbursts, and even, at times, tightness in your chest. It's why I'm a fair-weather fan.\n\nThere's a backstory: I used to have a team. As a Baltimore native, when the Ravens came to our city in 1996, I was all in. After buying tons of black and purple, winning two Super Bowls, and then white knuckling through the lackluster seasons that followed, I decided to set a boundary for my own sanity.\n\nFor me, and the bold, ambiguous fans like me, being a fair-weather fan isn't about disloyalty; it's a form of self-care. It's choosing which stressors I'm letting get to me — and football was no longer one of them.\n\nGloria Chan Packer, who helps ambitious professionals manage stress and burnout in the workplace, writes in an essay for BI that \"we can't eradicate stress entirely,\" but advises that we should aim \"to establish a healthier and more sustainable relationship with your stress.\"\n\nSo yes, I've decided to protect my peace while still respecting the game and showing up when it matters most. It won't be this Sunday when the Seattle Seahawks face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, but guess who's not stressed about that? Me.",

    "description": "Harry Luu explains how he left academia to build a business selling rare plants, supporting a family of eight through data-driven decisions.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Harry Luu, owner of PlantZaddyTherapy. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always been a gardener and enjoyed being around plants. While I was in graduate school studying math, my collection of houseplants grew. There's an attention to detail and a hyperfocus that I found in both mathematics and plants, so my hobby complemented my academic career.\n\nDuring the pandemic, my interest in rare plants blew up. I started getting a bigger collection and trading up for more valuable plants.\n\nEventually, my hobby transformed into a business. I finished my graduate degree and started teaching math in California, but three years ago, I left academia to sell plants full-time.\n\nI grew up in Vietnam, and I'm the embodiment of the American dream for my family. They put all their eggs in my basket, which allowed me to come to America and study. Now, I feel it's fair to return their investment. I support not only myself and my husband, but also my parents, my brother, my sister-in-law, my niece, and my nephew.\n\nLeaving my job while supporting a family of eight in California might seem risky, but it was calculated. I had reached the point where I saw the potential for financial freedom from investments I had made during grad school that had very good returns. I had years of data on plant sales, and also knew I could return to academia if needed, so I had a safety net.\n\nI was already connected to the rare plant community, so selling increasingly expensive plants felt like a natural progression. I grew my platform on Palmstreet, an online marketplace.\n\nThis year, I had two record-breaking sales in one day. I sold a $16,000 plant (an Anthurium Variegated Forgetii x Heinz, one of only two in the world), then a $26,000 plant (the only specimen of the True Variegated Lux Albo Mother Plant).\n\nI'm a math person, so I use a formula to price. I calculate rarity and desirability and compare them with price data from the previous three years. These plants were both very rare and highly desirable, which drove prices up. However, I didn't want to price them too high, because I'm thinking about the long-term viability for my brand: people have to be able to purchase what I'm selling. Given how rare the plants were, their five-figure prices weren't too big a splash.\n\nDespite those big numbers, the business's income fluctuates dramatically. My best single week was over $200,000 in sales, but other weeks I might have no sales. The market is seasonal, and winter is slow. I've had to adapt to not having a steady, reliable income.\n\nThe money comes and goes, but the work never stops. Right now, I spend about 100 hours a week on the business. We have plants in our home, and also a large greenhouse on our property. My brother does some of the maintenance care for the plants, but all the breeding decisions are made by me.\n\nI'm on the cusp of the company being able to sustain itself without me working so much. I look forward to that — when I can step back from the business side and focus more on the joy of growing. I would like to share my knowledge about rare plants and take the plants on the road to connect with my community more, since that's what got me hooked on growing in the first place.",

    "title": "Taylor Swift's latest business move is another attempt to hack the charts — and it'll probably work",
    "description": "Taylor Swift is temporarily withholding the \"Opalite\" music video from YouTube. The unconventional move is a reaction to new Billboard chart rules.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift is the biggest-selling artist in the world by most reliable measures, so when she makes an unconventional business move — no matter how random or trivial it may appear — it's worth paying attention.\n\nOn Friday, Swift unveiled the self-directed music video for \"Opalite,\" her latest single from \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" Upon release, the cameo-laden clip was available exclusively on Spotify and Apple Music, with its YouTube premiere scheduled for a two-day delay.\n\nStreamers like Spotify and Apple Music specialize in hosting songs, albums, podcasts, and playlists — not visual works. Meanwhile, YouTube is famously a destination for music video lovers. So what gives?\n\nAs usual, when it comes to Swift, the answer seems to lie with her bottom line. In December, YouTube announced it would withdraw its streaming data from Billboard's chart formulas because the music company tweaked its methodology so that streams from YouTube subscribers were weighted even more heavily than free streams. YouTube's stance is that the ratio is unfair to fans.\n\nSwift recently scored her longest reign yet on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" the lead single from \"Showgirl,\" which charted at No. 1 for 10 weeks. With \"Opalite\" officially serving as its follow-up, Swift appears to be making moves to boost the song's chart performance.\n\nIf fans were flocking to YouTube today to watch her new music video, none of those views would help \"Opalite\" reach No. 1 — and nobody wants to follow a personal best with a personal flop, least of all an athlete-style competitor like Swift.\n\nOf course, this savvy tweak to the song's promo schedule was paired with a physical release: a seven-inch vinyl single in \"pearlescent blue,\" only available in Swift's online store for 48 hours.\n\nSwift's unyielding commitment to commerce isn't just something to behold. It's something to study. Swift's sales tactics often become instructive for other artists.\n\nMuch has been made about Swift's push to sell physical albums, for example, but many fellow pop stars have followed suit. Charli XCX released about two dozen vinyl variants for her 2024 album \"Brat\" and its deluxe editions. Sabrina Carpenter, a self-professed disciple of Swift's work, released 13 vinyl variants last year for \"Man's Best Friend,\" in addition to seven-inch singles, cassettes, and CDs. As a result, \"Man's Best Friend\" scored the ninth-biggest vinyl sales week of the modern era, according to Billboard. (Seven of the top eight slots on that list belong to albums by Swift.)\n\nSo, it could very well mean that Swift's strategic video rollout will start a trend as well. Although YouTube is the customary platform for music videos, customs can be changed, and she isn't the only artist who cares about climbing the charts.\n\nIt could also be that Swift's premiere delay will inspire YouTube to rethink its attitude toward Billboard. If one of the most influential celebrities in the world is delaying their content to your product, that could be bad for business — and it wouldn't be the first time Swift convinced a major company to change its tune. Back in 2015, she criticized Apple Music for refusing to pay artists during a new user's free trial. Within 24 hours, Apple updated its policy and tagged Swift in the announcement online.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether \"Opalite\" will affect the music industry beyond Swifties, but if the song's lyrics are any indication, Swift is content to manufacture success on her terms — or, in her words, to make her own sunshine.",

    "description": "After co-creating Amazon Alexa, William Tunstall-Pedoe became an angel investor. When he started his second business, he drew on the invaluable experience of his mentees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, an angel investor and founder based in the UK. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "description": "The new A380 business class is an example of how Lufthansa is keeping the world's largest passenger plane competitive amid widebody shortages.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa is doubling down on a jet that many thought was history.\n\nThe German flag carrier announced Friday that it will install a new business-class cabin on all eight of its Airbus A380 superjumbos as part of its broader multibillion-dollar fleet renewal.\n\nAirlines are racing to meet growing demand for high-dollar premium experiences on long-haul flights. The new A380 business class will deliver an upgrade over the current layout, with more space, modern technology, and aisle access for all passengers.\n\nHowever, it will not be part of Allegris, Lufthansa's new signature economy and premium cabins rolling out across its old Boeing 747-8s and newly delivered Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s.\n\nLufthansa said the A380 seat, from manufacturer Thompson Aero, was chosen strategically because it is already certified for the jet type. Allegris is not, and using it would require a separate, lengthy certification process.\n\nThat means Lufthansa can quickly retrofit the A380 planes and get them back in the air. The project is expected to start in February, with the first refreshed jet returning to service in April.\n\nThe move comes as airlines face delayed deliveries of next-generation widebodies — particularly the Airbus A350-1000 and the yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777X — creating a crunch in long-haul, money-making capacity.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that Lufthansa's A380 refurbishment was planned well in advance and isn't a direct response to shifting delivery timelines.\n\n\"Lufthansa is investing in an aircraft that has already been in scheduled service for several years,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, we always want to offer our guests a modern and high-quality cabin product.\"\n\nStill, Lufthansa has repeatedly delayed retiring its A380s.\n\nIt considered ditching the jet after COVID halted travel (six aircraft were permanently removed from the fleet), but a strong post-pandemic rebound brought some planes back from storage and pushed the retirement of the remaining A380s to 2026.\n\nIt now has at least another five years. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in October 2025 that the A380s will continue flying into the early 2030s as the airline awaits new widebodies.\n\nLufthansa is the expected launch customer for Boeing's 777X, now expected to be at least seven years late in 2027 due to production and certification issues. The airline has also faced delivery delays for the 787 and A350.\n\nCarriers like Dubai-based Emirates, Australian flag carrier Qantas, and British Airways are similarly keeping older planes flying longer as they await new planes — including refurbishing the A380 with expensive new economy and premium cabins.\n\nData from the aviation analytics firm Cirium shows roughly 91,500 A380 flights are scheduled for 2026, about 1,500 more than in 2025. That uptick comes after the number of A380 flights plunged from about 120,000 in 2019 to just under 14,000 in 2021.\n\nThis increase comes despite the A380's inefficiencies. Its four fuel-hungry engines make it costly to operate, its size limits the number of airports it can serve, and its roughly 500 seats are challenging to consistently fill. While a few ultra-high-demand routes can justify the capacity, it doesn't work across an entire network.\n\nAirlines are also increasingly favoring smaller, more flexible twin-engine widebodies that can better adjust to fluctuating demand and efficiently serve both point-to-point routes — nonstops that don't go through a mega hub — and traditional hub-and-spoke networks.\n\nAirbus ultimately ended A380 production in 2021.\n\nLufthansa's A380s presently feature a 2-2-2 business-class layout, which forces window-seat passengers to climb over a neighbor to reach the aisle — a frustration for travelers paying a premium for privacy and flexibility beyond what economy offers.\n\nRenderings show the new cabin will switch to a 1-2-1 layout, giving every passenger direct aisle access. The design also adds Bluetooth connectivity, privacy partitions, and a lie-flat bed longer than six feet when the seat is fully reclined.\n\nOnce retrofitted, the A380 will feature eight seats in first class, 68 in business, 52 in premium economy, and 371 in regular coach.\n\nThe cabin won't have sliding doors, double beds, or big front-row suites — features that have become increasingly popular across the industry and are included on certain Allegris seats.\n\nThat added complexity, however, has slowed Allegris' rollout. The cabin includes multiple seat types and configurations within a single aircraft and has not yet been certified for the 787.\n\nAs a result, some Dreamliners are currently flying with business-class seats blocked from sale while Lufthansa awaits regulatory approval, limiting premium-cabin capacity and revenue.",

    "description": "Gary Marcus advocates caution about AI's risks. He told Business Insider that using OpenClaw was like giving your passwords to a stranger at the bar.",
    "fullText": "AI researcher and author Gary Marcus is worried about those viral agents and their social network.\n\nAnimated lobsters flooded X last week. First, it was OpenClaw (previously called Moltbot and Clawdbot before Anthropic came knocking). The AI agent runs locally and can independently make decisions on common consumer apps without human supervision.\n\nThen came Moltbook, the Reddit-like social forum where AI agents post and comment. No humans are allowed — though it appears some humans may have managed to sneak their way in.\n\nMarcus is known to pour cold water on the most hot-headed AI fanatics. It's in the title of his book: \"Taming Silicon Valley.\" The entrepreneur and scientist founded Geometric Intelligence, a machine-learning startup he later sold to Uber. Now, he advocates for AI regulation and risk consideration.\n\nHis take on these new tools was no different. In a Substack post, he was blunt. \"If you care about the security of your device or the privacy of your data, don't use OpenClaw,\" he wrote. \"Period.\"\n\nCurious to hear more about his thoughts on the latest viral moment in AI, we followed up with Marcus over email for a short Q&A, which was lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHere's what he had to say about those AI agents popping up everywhere.\n\nLet's start with OpenClaw. When did you first run into it, and what was your reaction?\n\nI think it was called something different then, oh so many days ago (seven?). My immediate reaction is, this is just like AutoGPT and it will be a complete security disaster if it becomes popular. Maybe, if we are lucky, it will become a teachable moment and the damage will be modest.\n\nWhy do you think OpenClaw grew so popular (at least online)?\n\nI imagine it is super fun to play with, and it must make users feel like they have an express ticket to the future. Personally I wouldn't touch it.\n\nYou compare OpenClaw to AutoGPT. How are they similar and different?\n\nThey are both basically connectors between LLMs and services. The underlying LLMs are better now than in 2023, but the security risks are roughly the same: immense. It's like giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out. Yeah, maybe.\n\nIs there any secure use of OpenClaw? What about those who have already set it up — what should they do?\n\nI doubt there is any real secure use. Personally I would stop running it and try to uninstall it and change passwords for banks and things like that.\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said he's taken steps to make it more secure. (Here's one example.) What do you think of these efforts?\n\nNoble, but maybe like putting a finger in dike to hold off a flood?\n\nMoving to Moltbook. Is there any argument to set your agent live on the site?\n\nOn TBPN, Matt Schlicht made the argument that startups should build businesses \"on top of Moltbook.\" What do you think of his proposal?\n\nGood luck to you. Don't blame me if your customer base gets scammed because of prompt injection attack you didn't notice.\n\nMeta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, said that he didn't find Moltbook interesting, because these agents were trained to speak like humans. Thoughts?\n\nFacebook did actually have some related experiments years and years ago; he's right that we shouldn't be entirely surprised. The interest comes mostly from the scale.\n\nWill we be talking about Moltbook in two weeks, or is this just another meme cycle?\n\nI don't know. AutoGPT exploded like a rocket in March 2023 and faded because of issues around reliability and accuracy; I wouldn't be surprised if this is just another fad, like Sora videos or pet rocks. But we'll see.",

It may be elegant or technically impressive, but it has no economic value. Software only matters insofar as it supports a business outcome.\n\nThat framing matters because it establishes the correct hierarchy.\n\nTechnology is not the goal.\n\nTechnology is a tool.\n\nAnd tools are chosen based on the job they need to do.\n\nEarly on, nobody knows whether the business will work.\n\nYou don’t know if users care. You don’t know if they will pay. You don’t know if the problem is real or imagined.\n\nAt this stage, obsessing over the “right” stack is misplaced effort. The dominant constraint is uncertainty, not scalability or architectural purity.\n\n“The FIRST rule of enterprenuership is you use what you have” - Alex Hormozi\n\nThis is simple rule of entrepreneurship applies surprisingly well to engineering.\n\nFounders and early teams start with what they already know. Not because it is theoretically optimal, but because it minimizes friction. Familiar tools reduce cognitive overhead, increase speed, and allow faster learning.\n\nEarly success is rarely determined by technical elegance. It is determined by whether you can ship something people want before you run out of time or money.\n\nAs the business grows, the constraints change.\n\nRevenue appears.\n\nUsers depend on the system.\n\nThe team grows.\n\nThe cost of failure increases.\n\nNow the stack begins to matter more. Not because some technologies are inherently superior, but because the software must support new business realities. Hiring, onboarding, operational cost, maintainability, performance characteristics, and risk management all become relevant.\n\nThis is where teams often conclude that an early stack choice was “wrong.” In most cases, it wasn’t wrong. It was right for the phase the business was in. The mistake was assuming it would remain right indefinitely.\n\nTwitch is often mentioned as a scaling story, but the more interesting part is how long the architecture stayed simple.\n\nAt one point, Twitch was serving millions of users with a monolithic Ruby on Rails application and a single PostgreSQL database. That setup was not elegant or future proof, but it worked. It allowed the team to move quickly, ship features, and grow the business without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOver time, the constraints changed. Growth amplified failures. Database contention increased. Reliability, support load, and churn started to matter more than raw development speed. The cost of incidents became visible in a way it had not been before.\n\nThat was when the architecture began to evolve. The database was scaled and restructured, services were split out, and new infrastructure and languages were introduced. None of this happened because the original stack was flawed. It happened because the business had outgrown it.\n\nThe technology changed in response to the business, not the other way around.\n\nIf you want to read more about how Twitch migrated from a monolith to microservices, see Breaking the Monolith at Twitch and Breaking the Monolith at Twitch: Part Two.\n\nIf you want to know more about how Twitch scaled its database, see How Twitch Uses PostgreSQL.\n\nAgentic coding tools make this even more important.\n\nTools like Claude Code and Cursor reduce the advantage of deep, framework-specific familiarity. Generating boilerplate, navigating unfamiliar code, applying patterns across modules, and keeping implementation consistent are no longer manual, error-prone tasks.\n\nWhen an agent can help you stay productive across technologies, the cost of switching or extending a stack drops. What remains expensive is not syntax or APIs, but domain knowledge, product decisions, and the long-term behavior of the system.\n\nIn other words, the more the tooling levels the technical playing field, the more tech stack decisions become about business fit.\n\nInstead of asking whether one technology is better than another in the abstract, ask questions that reflect the reality of the business:\n\nWhat are we optimizing for right now? Speed, cost, reliability, hiring, or time-to-market?\n\nHow quickly do we need to validate this idea?\n\nHow expensive will change be later, and what changes are most likely?\n\nWhat kind of team will maintain this system?\n\nWhat risks could realistically kill the business, and does the stack reduce or increase them?\n\nOnce framed this way, stack decisions become clearer and less emotional. Sometimes multiple choices are equally valid. Sometimes the boring option is correct. Sometimes speed matters more than correctness. Sometimes correctness matters more than speed.\n\nThere is no universal answer. The answer depends on the context.\n\nMost tech stack arguments are debates about taste, not outcomes.\n\nOnce technology is treated as a business decision rather than a personal identity, those arguments lose their intensity. The question stops being “what do I prefer?” and becomes “what does the business need right now?”\n\nThe right stack is not the one that wins debates.\n\nIt is the one that helps the business survive and grow at its current stage.\n\nIf are starting a project and need help with tech stack decision, connect with me on LinkedIn and I’ll take it from there.\n\nSoftware Developer specializing in Flutter, Android, and mobile development.\n Writing about code, architecture, and developer productivity.",

    "fullText": "Pizza Hut plans to close several of its locations this year due to underperformance, company officials said.\n\nAccording to executives at the restaurant’s parent company, Yum! Brands, about 250 locations are expected to close, officials announced during an earnings call on Feb. 4.\n\nThe shutdowns are part of the company’s “Hut Forward” strategy, which Pizza Hut Chief Financial Officer Ron Ricks said on the earnings call is expected to shrink the brand’s global footprint and reduce operating profits by about 15%.\n\nThe company has not said whether any Texas locations will be affected.\n\nAccording to the Pizza Hut website, there are 974 locations in Texas.\n\nThe closures are also tied to a broader “strategic review” announced by Yum! Brands in November, which could include a potential sale of the chain. Beyond confirming the closures, officials said they would not provide additional details until the review concludes at the end of 2026.\n\n\"Pizza Hut’s performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,” CEO Chris Turner said in a statement. “To truly take advantage of the brand we’ve built and the opportunities ahead, we’ve made the decision to initiate a thorough review of strategic options.”",

    "description": "The rivaling AI companies pushed GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, and had back-to-back appearances on a tech and business podcast.",
    "fullText": "The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic intensified this week.\n\nThe two companies released dueling new AI models on Thursday and had back-to-back podcast appearances on \"TBPN.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model that the company says would improve performance on office productivity and coding tasks, with an expanded \"context window\" that allows it to work through longer documents and more complex projects in a single session.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI punched back with its own new coding-focused model called GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company says runs faster, uses fewer computing resources, and can generate and manage complex software from English instructions. The new version also comes alongside a stand-alone Codex desktop app.\n\nBoth Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and Sholto Douglas, one of Anthropic's leading researchers, appeared on the \"TBPN\" podcast in back-to-back chats with show host John Coogan and Jordi Hays.\n\n\"I think we will be heading towards a workflow where a lot of people just feel like they're managing a team of agents,\" said Altman. \"And as the agents get better, they'll keep operating at a higher and higher level of abstraction.\"\n\nDouglas, who appeared in the subsequent timeslot, told Coogan and Hays that users have been comparing previous Anthropic and OpenAI models, and they have noticed some key differences.\n\n\"The OpenAI models were a bit better at trying really, really, really hard on tough problems, but the Anthropic models were much faster and so forth,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"And so they worked on speed while we worked on making the models much, much better at really, really tough problems,\" Douglas added of the Opus 4.6.\n\nThe latest release is part of a long-running competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, dating back to 2021, when a group of OpenAI researchers left to form Anthropic, aiming to develop safer and more controlled AI systems.\n\nThis week, Anthropic's launch of industry-specific plugins triggered a stock market sell-off as Wall Street worried about AI's impact on software.\n\nAnthropic also took a subtle shot at OpenAI with a series of ads released this week, including one that will air during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ads feature unnamed humanized AIs dropping ads in the middle of their advice, alongside the promise that its model, Claude, will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI announced in January that ads are coming to ChatGPT for users of the free version.\n\nAltman subsequently hit back, calling Anthropic \"dishonest\" and defending ChatGPT as a product that brings AI \"to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.\" He also clarified that the ads will be \"clearly labeled\" to differentiate themselves from the chatbot's answers to queries.\n\n\"We are not stupid. We respect our users. We understand that if we did something like what those ads depict, people would rightfully stop using the product,\" Altman told the \"TBPN\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Our first principle with ads is that we're not going to put stuff into the LLM stream,\" Altman added. \"That would feel crazy dystopic, like a bad sci-fi movie.\"",

    "fullText": "Taiwanese airline Starlux is set to fly a new Airbus A350 variant that will expand its number of business-class seats by over 50%.\n\nThe seven-year-old startup is introducing 18 new A350-1000s to its fleet, with the first delivered in January.\n\nIts A350-1000 configuration offers 40 business-class seats, up from 26 on Starlux's current A350-900s.\n\nThe new aircraft adds 30 economy-class seats, bringing the total to 270 in coach. The rest of its A350-1000 offerings are unchanged from the A350-900, with 36 premium economy seats and four first-class suites.\n\nStarlux showcased its new plane at the Singapore Airshow this week, and Business Insider went aboard for a look.\n\nIt's known regionally for selling business-class tickets on short and medium-haul flights at roughly $1,500.\n\nSome of its longer routes, such as San Francisco to Taipei, can offer regular round-trip business-class fares as low as $2,600.\n\nSince launching flights in 2020, the Taiwanese airline has increasingly leaned on premium seat offerings, a trend among full-service carriers as market prices for economy seats have generally fallen.\n\nThe light under the passenger seat number changes from green to red when do-not-disturb mode is activated.\n\nCabin crew typically open and close the doors for passengers, but an emergency latch on the inside also allows the sliding panel to come loose.\n\nEssentially, that means the seat elevates the head and feet over the rear for better posture, so the passenger's body resembles a \"W.\"\n\nIf a passenger has two windows next to their seat, they can dim the second with a remote.\n\nThese seats have no overhead luggage compartments; instead, they feature a personal closet for each passenger. They're lined with leather, while business class seats are made of fabric.\n\nThere is no curtain or wall separating Starlux's business and first-class areas.\n\nIn-flight entertainment is available for every seat, with an extendable screen for those sitting in the front rows.\n\nChatting with a passenger across the aisle may prove more difficult on the A350-1000.\n\nThe new plane is also scheduled to begin flying Starlux's Phoenix route this summer. Starlux flies to 31 destinations, with five routes to the US.",

The German industrial heavyweight is betting that the \"Mayor of Flavortown,\" Guy Fieri, can help change that as it pours billions of dollars into the region.\n\nOn Thursday, Bosch released the ad it intends to air during the Super Bowl this weekend.

His French Bulldog, Cash, also has a cameo in the ad, which carries the tagline, \"Like a Bosch.\"\n\nBosch joins a crop of Super Bowl LX advertisers leaning on comedy and recognizable faces this year, as they look to grab attention and avoid controversy during a politically charged year. Major brands are spending more than ever on A-list celebrity talent in their marketing, with CMOs under pressure to produce ads that cut through and deliver meaningful results.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, Paul Thomas, president of Bosch North America, said the company hopes the big game ad will help improve its brand recognition. Through Fieri and the lighthearted, comedic tone of this year's spot, Bosch also wants to foster a stronger emotional connection between customers and the brand, he added. It marks a shift from Bosch's more traditional marketing, which typically focused on technical features.\n\n\"There are a lot of things we're trying to accomplish with the campaign, but primarily to show that the Bosch brand is something you can rely on and helps you improve your life,\" Thomas said.\n\nFieri was a \"no-brainer\" to help achieve these goals because he cooks and does his own construction, often using Bosch products.\n\n\"He represents the confidence, too,\" Thomas said.\n\nSuch was Fieri's transformation for this campaign that some social media users lambasted the celebrity chef's early teaser posts as \"AI slop.\" Bosch said it didn't use AI and instead relied on a makeup artist and some visual effects editing.\n\nA post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri)\n\nBosch is working toward a goal of North America contributing 20% of the company's global sales by 2030, up from around 18% in 2024. It's doubling down on certain categories — such as cordless power tools and home appliances — where Bosch lags rivals in market share. The company has announced more than $6 billion in US-based acquisitions since 2023.\n\nIts big push in the US comes as the company cuts costs elsewhere. Bosch recently confirmed it is cutting 20,000 jobs in Germany after its profits nearly halved last year. The industrial giant is facing competition from Chinese companies in its automotive business, as well as pressures from US tariffs and a decline in demand for household appliances.\n\nThe average price of a 30-second spot during this year's Super Bowl reached $8 million, with some slots fetching up to $10 million, per NBCUniversal, which is broadcasting the game. Thomas said the expenditure on the Super Bowl amid cost-cutting within its home business reflected the balance many companies need to make as they focus on growth.\n\n\"If you don't have a brand campaign, do the problems get even worse in the future?\" Thomas said.\n\nBosch made its Super Bowl ad debut last year and saw \"tangible lifts\" in consumer engagement, such as people entering hardware and appliance stores to specifically ask for Bosch products, he said.\n\n\"It would really be a pity if you did it once and didn't continue on with it because then you lose all the momentum that you could gain,\" he said.",

    "title": "Taco Bell's CEO says the chain's 'magic formula' is fueling growth as rivals fall flat",
    "description": "Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant told Business Insider that the chain's advantage lies in strong value perception, menu innovation, and customer loyalty.",
    "fullText": "Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant has a simple explanation for why his brand keeps winning while much of the fast-food industry is struggling: it's doing more than one thing well at once.\n\n\"When you look at being a buzzy brand, you look at value, you look at digital, you look at category entry points and innovation, and all those things are working in concert with each other,\" Tresvant told Business Insider. \"Other brands can do one or two. When we do it, we get all four right, and we're very good in each part of that magic formula.\"\n\nYum! Brands, Taco Bell's parent company, announced during its earnings report on Wednesday that the Mexican-inspired chain delivered 7% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter, far outpacing the rest of the segment as consumers continue to pull back on dining out.\n\nWhile much of the fast-food industry is grappling with slowing traffic as customers watch their wallets, Taco Bell's growth was driven by bigger-ticket transactions, especially among younger diners, even as competitors relied heavily on discounting.\n\nFoot-traffic data backs that up. A Placer.ai analysis of Yum Brands' fourth-quarter performance found that Taco Bell locations held up better than many quick-service competitors during key value-driven periods, even as broader fast-food visits softened amid inflation fatigue.\n\nTresvant says Taco Bell's advantage comes from combining the things competitors often struggle to balance: offering consistently good value rather than short-term deals, rapid-fire menu innovation, and a growing loyalty program that's actually driving incremental visits. That formula, he told Business Insider, has allowed Taco Bell to keep growing traffic and relevance \"in any environment,\" even as other fast-food brands fight simply to stay flat.\n\nTaco Bell's numbers reflect its loyalty push. Tresvant said active loyalty members climbed 31% in the fourth quarter, while digital channels grew 29%, as app-exclusive drops and rewards nudged customers to visit more often. Tresvant said the goal isn't just engagement, but turning loyalty into repeat traffic — which keeps the brand resilient.\n\nAlthough value-focused options now make up 17% of Taco Bell's menu, like its $5, $7, and $9 bundle offerings, what especially appeals to Taco Bell consumers is its pace of menu innovation — even when they're full price. From the return of its Quesarito and recent launch of its sauce collaboration with Frank's RedHot, to limited-time beverage offerings at its Live Más Café locations, every new rollout, Tresvant said, is \"determined on consumer needs and wants.\"\n\nAcross the restaurant industry, traditional quick-service strategies aren't working as they once did because of the uneven pressure of the K-shaped economy, where lower-income consumers have pulled back on dining out while higher-income spending remains stable.\n\nMany chains have leaned hard into deep discounting and short-term deals to lure customers back, but analysts and industry executives warn that constant promotions can erode pricing power and fail to drive meaningful traffic growth.\n\nAt the same time, competitors like Chipotle are recalibrating for smaller, wealthier consumer segments, underscoring how uneven the recovery has been across the sector.\n\nThat's not the strategy for Taco Bell. Instead of narrowing its focus, the chain has leaned on loyalty perks and app-exclusive offers to keep a broad range of customers coming back — particularly younger diners who are more likely to engage digitally even as they cut costs elsewhere.\n\n\"We continue to innovate on the menu, but not only on the menu,\" Tresvant added. \"We're going to make sure we're innovating from a guest hospitality standpoint, we're going to innovate in operations and innovate around the brand, not just in food.\"\n\nThat means continued exploration of voice AI ordering systems, which are being tested at 600 Taco Bell locations, as well as other efficiency-optimizing technologies to streamline back-of-house operations and improve the guest experience.\n\nIt also means giving consumers new ways to stay connected to the Taco Bell brand, like its Y2K-era cross-brand collaboration with Hollister, which sold out late last year.\n\nFor Tresvant, that momentum has created rare room to experiment at a time when much of the fast-food industry is still focused on defense.\n\n\"The things we're doing are working, and that just gives us a little bit of permission to take big swings in 2026,\" Tresvant said.",

    "title": "Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software.",
    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "A Louisville business is facing criticism after the owner told employees to \"leave religion and politics at the door” when she received a note from a customer who said he was treated disrespectfully because he was a member of law enforcement.\n\nPlease & Thank You owner Brooke Vaughn told The Courier Journal that she sent the message to her management team Feb. 3 after receiving an email from a man, who identified himself as a police officer, saying he had been treated disrespectfully. In the email, the man said he was “greeted by a rude person” and got “evil looks from all of the employees.”\n\n“REMINDER to leave your religion and politics at the door when you come to work for PLEASE & THANK YOU,” the message reads. “If you discriminate against anyone inside our shops, you are not meant to be a DAY MAKER and should consider a career elsewhere.”\n\nA screenshot of the message was posted to Reddit around 1:30 p.m. Feb. 3, with the post saying it was sent after Vaughn received an email from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Vaughn said the officer who complained to her wrote that he was in uniform during his visit, but did not confirm if the man was an ICE agent.\n\nWithin hours of the message being posted to social media, Vaughn said she and other staff members started receiving several complaints, adding that she was forced to turn off the comment feature on the business' Instagram page due to ongoing arguments.\n\n“People are showing up at shops and calling our employees ‘fascists,’” she said.\n\nVaughn added that the store's media accounts have also gained followers since the message was posted, but she was unsure if they were following to support the business or to \"see [them] fail.\"\n\nThe criticism comes after two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests. Thousands of federal immigration officers were previously sent to Minnesota in December, and President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan announced Feb. 4 that 700 immigration enforcement personnel would be leaving the state.\n\nMetro columnist Joe Gerth contributed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Please & Thank You owner facing backlash after memo posted online",

    "description": "\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" said Selkirk Sport co-founder Mike Barnes.",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes started selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement when they were teenagers. It was part of a homeschool project and evolved into a profitable business.\n\nA few years later, they launched a pickleball equipment company at ages 19 and 22. They had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball would ever take off.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down,'\" Rob told Business Insider. \"And we were like, let's double down, see what happens.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, that bet has paid off. Selkirk is now one of the leading pickleball equipment brands, known for its premium paddles, and the family-run company expects to generate nine-figure revenue in 2026.\n\nThe Barnes brothers say that while they skipped traditional higher education, learning has always been central to how they run their business. They've learned from other successful founders and executives by reading a lot of business books.\n\nThey shared six of their top recs.\n\nBoth brothers say they gravitate toward biographies and autobiographies because they show how decisions actually play out in the real world.\n\n\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" Rob said. \"You have people literally talking about how they made a decision and why, and then showing how it played out, good or bad.\"\n\nSome of their favorite autobiographies and memoirs include:\n\nOne business book the brothers said influenced them early on was \"The E-Myth\" by Michael E. Gerber, which dispels myths about starting a business.\n\nThey also recommend \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" which tells the story of RJR Nabisco's fall.\n\n\"It was interesting — more of a warning about how corporate governance can get out of hand,\" they said of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's bestseller.\n\nFinally, one of Mike's favorites is \"The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.\"\n\nThe book profiles eight relatively unknown CEOs who delivered extraordinary results by ignoring convention.\n\n\"They weren't very big on public perception,\" Mike said. \"But they ran their companies really well in unconventional ways. And it worked.\"\n\nThe brothers are very willing to question conventional wisdom.\n\nThey don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business, and said they try to avoid a \"best practices\" mindset.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nRob added, \"No one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does. Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "description": "Business Insider was on the scene at a WSJ conference that brought together leaders from Blackstone, Lazard, and Citi.",
    "fullText": "Most people flock to Palm Beach for sunshine and an escape. But on Tuesday, Wall Street's elite got 40-degree weather and nonstop talk about one company: Anthropic.\n\nAs the morning session of The Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event kicked off, the AI startup announced its new \"Claude Cowork\" legal plugins, a tool designed to automate contract triage and NDAs. The news unnerved investors, dragging down indexes like the Nasdaq and tech stocks from Palantir to Oracle. Thomson Reuters had dipped 20% by mid-afternoon, experiencing one of its worst single-day drops as investors panicked that software investments deemed cutting-edge a few years ago could soon be rendered passé.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of the investment bank Lazard and a former Obama administration official, offered a sobering macro view. \"The US economy and the equity market at this point are highly levered bets with regard to AI taking off,\" he said. \"What I think you're seeing is when people get nervous about whether that'll happen.\"\n\nThat said, he didn't contest the tech's future — just that some key players might not be around in a few years. \"You can bet on the technology paying off,\" he said, \"but that the firms making the investments today are not necessarily the ones that benefit.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, which manages over $1.3 trillion, emphasized the lucrative effects of the mini-economy that's sprung up to meet the physical and infrastructural demands of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"To us, you don't necessarily have to know who the winners and losers are going to be,\" Gray said. \"You know that the data centers, the autonomous vehicles, the robots, they're all going to plug into the wall, and there's going to be a lot of need for digital infrastructure.\"\n\nSeveral attendees had recently returned from last month's World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps and were likely hoping to leave the chill behind. But alas, one woman I spotted was bundled up in fur, and I personally had to fish out a 10-year-old coat from the back of my closet to make it from my Uber to the event's entrance.\n\nAt lunchtime, we decamped to the courtyard for a salmon salad and sweet iced tea, and the conversation drifted between the rise of South Florida in the post-pandemic era and the outlook for financial sponsors' spending this year. But as we shuffled back to our seats for the afternoon's lineup of speakers, the chill returned as we caught up with the market's increasingly dour reaction to Anthropic's news.\n\nSteven Tananbaum, founder of GoldenTree Asset Management, saw an opportunity in the rout. For a credit specialist, \"indiscriminate selling\" is a chance to find value where others see only collapse. \"The idea that all software is the same is what's exciting,\" he said about the broad sell-off. \"There's just indiscriminate selling regardless of what the prospects are.\"\n\nThe day ended with a reminder that while the markets might be sweating over incremental news, the C-suite is playing a longer game.\n\nAs it happened, I got to ask the final question of the day's concluding speaker, Mark Mason, Citi's chief financial officer, who's stepping down from his role this spring. He pointed to the cost-saving potential of AI, which would free up more money for Citi to devote to advancing CEO Jane Fraser's mission: putting the bank's multiyear overhaul behind it. The bank is applying the tech to its most critical processes, he said.\n\n\"What will it take to actually drive greater efficiency in that process? And I think that's a much better approach than the way others have thought about use cases,\" he added, referring to other banks.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hemant Taneja, the CEO of General Catalyst, a major VC backer of Anthropic, conceded that the economy will shed jobs due to AI, urging attendees to focus on education to retrain workers. \"Never ever was there a case that every skill in any job can be better done by AI and robotics,\" he said, \"which is, I think, where we are headed in the next, not five, but 20 to 30 years.\"\n\nStill, some speakers, like billionaire activist Nelson Peltz, brought some levity to the proceedings. Peltz — famous for his high-profile corporate showdowns with executives like Disney's Bob Iger — expressed enthusiasm for technology that could pump out faster, simpler answers to his legal questions.\n\n\"Not being a lawyer, I'm sort of happy,\" he said, as anxious laughter coursed through the room.",

    "description": "As Google's earnings report looms, its AI strategy and ad business with Gemini 3 put it at the forefront of a volatile AI market.",
    "fullText": "Google has had a great run since its last earnings report. Can it last?\n\nThat's the big question ahead of the tech giant's earnings report this afternoon. BI's Hugh Langley, our resident Google expert, breaks down what you need to look out for in the numbers and on the call.\n\nGoogle has been on a three-month tear since its last check-in, launching Gemini 3 to much fanfare and joining the $4 trillion market-cap club. The string of successes put it at the front of the highly competitive AI race.\n\n(A quick aside on these arbitrary rankings. You could argue Nvidia's the biggest winner of the AI race, but it's really in its own bucket. I'm talking about companies with competing chatbots. No further questions at this time.)\n\nBut here's the thing about the AI race. It's highly volatile. One quarter, you're the belle of the ball; the next, you can't even get your texts returned. Just ask Meta and Microsoft.\n\nInvestors are expecting a big swing one way or another. Google's implied one-day share move following earnings is 4.9%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nYou don't have to search too far to find the key to Google's earnings.\n\nGoogle Search (get it) and the ad business built around it are still the company's crown jewel. It's also an area many have speculated AI would upend. (Why \"Google it\" if you can \"ChatGPT it\"?)\n\nGoogle has managed to incorporate AI features without cannibalizing its cash cow. But it's a tricky balancing act, and Google is already blurring the line between Search and Gemini.\n\nThe real tipping point will be ads. Google executives have been adamant that there are no immediate plans to bring them to Gemini anytime soon. However, if Search's massive traffic ultimately gets passed to the chatbots, advertising's arrival feels inevitable.\n\nIt also might not have a choice.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to roll out ads to some ChatGPT users despite Sam Altman previously calling them a \"last resort.\" In such a highly competitive race, and with so much money on the line, giving your rivals any type of headstart is a risk.",

    "fullText": "Digital pinboard business cutting 15% of workforce as it invests heavily in AI\n\nPinterest has fired two engineers who created a software tool to identify which workers had lost their jobs in a recent round of cuts and then shared the information, according to reports.\n\nThe digital pinboard business announced significant job cuts earlier this month, with the chief executive, Bill Ready, telling staff he was “doubling down on an AI-forward approach”, according to a LinkedIn post by a former employee.\n\nPinterest, which is based in San Francisco and has an office in London, said the cuts would affect about 15% of its workforce, or about 700 people, but did not specify which teams or staff members would be affected.\n\nTwo engineers at the company then wrote code to identify sacked staff.\n\nA spokesperson for Pinterest said: “Two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly. This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues’ privacy.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the engineers, who have not been named, shared the information with colleagues, or with people outside Pinterest.\n\nThe script – a set of commands written to automate a task within existing software or change its function – was aimed at internal tools for workers to communicate, the BBC reported, citing an anonymous source.\n\nThe source, whom the BBC said was “familiar with the firings”, said the code created an alert as to which employee names were being removed or deactivated.\n\nPinterest has been investing heavily in AI to create more personalised content for its users and automated tools for marketers. But shares in the company have dropped by more than 20% this year as investors assess the threat from more advanced AI platforms.\n\nReady said in a company-wide meeting that while “healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions”, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.\n\nThe chief executive said Pinterest was facing a “critical moment” and that staff should consider a job elsewhere if they were “working against the direction of the company” and disagreed with its mission, CNBC reported.\n\nIt comes amid a wave of job cuts in the techy sector, as businesses increasingly rely on AI. Last week, Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 roles worldwide, its second round of redundancies in three months.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs division to redirect resources to AI wearables and phone features. Meanwhile, Autodesk, a design software maker, announced plans this month to cut about 1,000 jobs.",

    "description": "A senior software engineer at Google took 40 Coursera courses and got multiple grad degrees to shift from business to AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Max Buckley, a 38-year-old senior software engineer at Google, based in Zurich, Switzerland. His identity and employment has been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a senior software engineer at Google in Zurich, where I've worked since 2013.\n\nMost people don't go from business to a more technical background, but my bachelor's degree was in business studies, and I joined Google out of undergrad as a financial analyst intern.\n\nOver several years, I pivoted from financial analysis to business analysis, then to trust and safety, and onto an engineering team in 2016. I joined several other software engineering teams, and then eventually joined Google Cloud AI, where I worked on one of the cloud AI products for a few years.\n\nThen I joined an internal LLM innovation team within Google's core infrastructure group, which we later turned into an LLM information retrieval applied research team, where I am today, leading the team.\n\nTo make multiple shifts like this, you need to upskill and explore other areas. Here's how I did it:\n\nAs soon as I joined Google, I decided my North Star was to become a data scientist. Initially, I had a lot of success broadening my skillset with online courses like Coursera, edX, or Stanford. I used them to explore finance, then statistics, then spent most of my time in the computer science and data science space.\n\nAll in all, I completed roughly 40 online open courses, most of them through Coursera.\n\nSome of the courses I took include:\n\nThe courses were spread out from 2013 to 2021, and I took them on evenings and weekends. I didn't have much time for video games, but I still made time to go to the gym, eat, sleep, and spend time with my girlfriend.\n\nI wasn't super structured in my approach to taking courses. I didn't say \"I must do five hours a day,\" or anything like that. I took them as I felt the need to do one or to learn more about a particular topic. I didn't burn out from it.\n\nThe most measurably impactful courses I completed were the first two Coursera courses: Data Analysis and Computing for Data Analysis. I did them right before I interviewed for my internship at Google and the interviewer happened to have done the same course, so we had this instant rapport.\n\nI also did more formal part-time study.\n\nI finished my Bachelor of Business Studies in 2013. Then at Google, I got a part-time postgraduate certificate in statistics, which took a year. Then I did a part-time master's degree in Business Analytics, which took two years. Then I pursued a part-time master's degree in software engineering, which took close to five years. Most recently, I did a diploma in Advanced Studies In Data Science, which took another two years.\n\nI did a bunch of summer school certificates, which is when you spend a week doing PhD-level courses.\n\nMy message to others who want to transition is don't be discouraged. When I first wanted to join Google, several hiring managers weren't interested because I didn't have a computer science undergraduate degree. Similarly, when I applied for a Master's in Business Analytics, I was initially declined because I didn't have a technical undergraduate degree and two semesters of programming experience, even though I was programming at Google. There were hurdles that I had to work around.\n\nI always wanted to study computer science, but my dad told me it's better to learn something different because I'll probably end up in it anyway. In hindsight, he was right.\n\nStudying computer science would have certainly expedited my career track, but I'm in a place where it's no longer a hindrance, and I'm familiar with a bunch of business theories, like Porter's Five Forces. They're not always useful, but every once in a while, it comes up in conversation.\n\nThe constant here is that my background includes continuous learning. When recruiters or hiring managers see my profile, they see that I'm not someone who gets complacent.\n\nDid you make a career pivot? We want to hear from you.

    "description": "After 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard, Andrew Miller landed a corporate role at Amazon — but with 6 kids, it didn't leave him enough time to be a dad.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

Recent deadly shootings by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Minnesota have pushed some CEOs, from big names in tech to small business owners, to comment publicly on politics again.\n\nGriffin, one of the GOP's biggest donors, was also asked about whether he has plans to run for public office, Griffin said that he hasn't ruled it out. \n\n\"I'd like to believe at a future point in my life I will be involved in public service,\" adding that it was unlikely in the next few years.\n\nIn terms of others' public service, Griffin praised Trump's pick for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, calling the nomination a \"powerful assertion that the Fed will maintain needed independence in policy decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "fullText": "Frozen weapons are among the many challenges NATO soldiers would face in an Arctic conflict.\n\nSoldiers have to be careful not to let the harsh elements cause their guns to malfunction.\n\nBut they also can't let the guns get too warm, as that creates new problems.\n\nSODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "fullText": "The transfers of Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz were two of the biggest in Liverpool's history.\n\nThe duo were seen as the best way for Liverpool to take their next step and to even replace Mohamed Salah in the future.\n\nAnd, while Wirtz is finally getting back to his best, it's clear that some new signings still need to be made at Liverpool.\n\nThis has caused plenty of confusion among the football world, with Paul Merson now slamming the recruitment process undertaken by Hughes.\n\n\"With all the money Liverpool have spent, the squad looks wafer-thin,\" Merson told Sky Sports in quotes relayed by The Mirror.\n\n\"Looking at it now, they got it horribly wrong in the summer.\n\n\"By going bang, bang with a load of attackers and thinking they were going to dominate English football for the next four or five years, it's backfired.\"\n\nEven though attackers were needed to replace Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz at Liverpool, they still spent far too much money.\n\nIsak and Wirtz alone cost the Anfield outfit around £240 million, which, for any team is a massive chunk of change.\n\nThe Reds have often spent their money wisely and have chosen to upgrade multiple areas of their squad, rather than splashing the cash in one place.\n\nAlthough the chances of a new player arriving before January's deadline day look slim, that doesn't mean that they can't eye up potential targets for the 2026-27 summer window.\n\nHowever, if Hughes, Slot and Edwards do end up drafting up a shortlist of potential targets, they must ensure that their entire squad is benefitting, rather than just one area of it.\n\nOtherwise, they could end up in the same situation all over again next year.",

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "description": "A Business for Good-Harris poll found that 75% of Americans agree \"hands-on skills and practice experience\" matter more than formal degrees.",
    "fullText": "Americans think the future of work is in their hands.\n\nA poll commissioned by the Business for Good Foundation, a nonprofit focused on reducing the wealth gap, found that 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\n\"You've got a lot of people that have historically didn't think the American dream was for them,\" Ed Mitzen, cofounder of the Business for Good Foundation, told Business Insider ahead of the poll's release. \"I would argue that it isn't broken, it's just moved, and it's moved to places we stop looking.\"\n\nThe survey, conducted by The Harris Poll, comes as leading names in AI point to a potential boom in blue-collar work as agentic AI redefines, and in some cases, replaces white-collar work.\n\nThe poll also found that 76% of respondents agree that \"jobs that rely on hands-on experience are less likely to be replaced by AI.\"\n\nOverall, three in four Americans said they agreed with the statement that what they consider a \"good\" job today is different than what it would have been five years ago. And 78% agreed with the statement \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" as society puts a greater emphasis on hands-on skills.\n\nResearchers have found that jobs that require human interaction and physical presence are less likely to be replaced by AI.\n\nIndeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index recently examined how generative AI could perform jobs that require problem-solving ability and physical labor. Their findings were that nursing, childcare, and construction were the least likely to be affected by AI.\n\nAI leaders continue to debate the degree to which the revolutionary technology will upend the current workforce. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has stood by his prediction that AI could eliminate roughly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs over the next 1 to 5 years. Others, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned the extent of Amodei's dour prediction.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said at the World Economic Forum that now is the perfect time to go into the trades. In part because the AI industry itself will need an influx of workers to help build the massive data centers it wants to build.\n\n\"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" Huang said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk previously said that any job that involves manual labor is likely to survive much longer amid the \"supersonic tsunami\" that is AI.\n\n\"Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,\" Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan in November. \"But anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning.\"\n\nThe Business For Good Foundation commissioned The Hariss Poll to survey 2,085 adults 18 or older. Harris Poll conducted the survey online in the US from January 13th through January 15th. The overall margin or error is ±2.5 percentage points.",

    "fullText": "The Women's Super League transfer window shuts on Tuesday - so what might we expect to happen on the final day?\n\nClubs have been doing business since 2 January and have until 23:00 GMT to complete any last-minute deals.\n\nAmong some of the biggest moves to have gone through are USA international Sam Coffey's switch from Portland Thorns to Manchester City for £600,000, and Aston Villa's £450,000 deal for Chelsea midfielder Oriane Jean-Francois.\n\nBottom side Liverpool also broke their record signing to bring in Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan for £300,000 from North Carolina Courage.\n\nSo are there more big moves to come?\n\nEvery WSL winter window transfer\n\nArsenal are already lining up huge signings for the summer, with England international Georgia Stanway close to signing a pre-contract agreement to join when her Bayern Munich contract expires.\n\nThey are also in advanced discussions with Barcelona full-back Ona Batlle to bring her in on a free deal in the summer.\n\nThe Gunners have been known to pounce late in the window and want more midfielders. Will they make a surprise move on deadline day?\n\nChelsea have had a bid for Nigeria midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down by Paris St-Germain but might make another attempt. But with the French window already shut, PSG cannot replace her so it is unlikely they will budge.\n\nThere could be a departure from the Blues with USA striker Catarina Macario attracting interest from National Women's Super League (NWSL) clubs.\n\nGermany midfielder Sjoeke Nusken's future has also been questioned but it looks like she is set to stay at Chelsea unless anything rapidly changes. The Blues are yet to make any signings in this window and manager Sonia Bompastor has hinted at frustration over a lack of squad depth.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester City defender Codie Thomas, 19, has a loan deal in principle agreed with Glasgow City.\n\nLondon City Lionesses are hoping to add one more before the deadline but still have work to do, while Aston Villa have looked at attacking options all winter.\n\nEverton might still do some business, with Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar on the verge of joining on loan with an obligation-to-buy clause. A medical is planned for Tuesday.\n\nFrance forward Kelly Gago has requested to leave the Toffees but nobody has met the £500,000 release clause in her contract.\n\nWest Ham have fought off interest in striker Shekiera Martinez so far, while Leicester City have a few young players that might be heading out on loan.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "title": "Disney's latest earnings show why Josh D'Amaro is widely viewed as the CEO frontrunner",
    "description": "Under Josh D'Amaro, Disney's experiences business has carried the company's profits. It shows why he's considered a top CEO contender.",
    "fullText": "Josh D'Amaro appears to be the frontrunner in the race to be Disney's next CEO, and the Mouse House's latest quarterly earnings showed why.\n\nDisney's experiences business, which D'Amaro oversees, is the backbone of a company that's being weighed down by the struggling pay-TV business and isn't yet lifted up by its streaming profits. And when that part of the business sneezes, the stock catches a cold.\n\nAlthough the unit generated record profits, and Disney overall slightly beat Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings, the stock fell about 5% in early trading.\n\nInvestors seemed worried about Disney's reference to \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks. Other possible factors driving down the stock were Disney's year-over-year decline in earnings per share and its lukewarm second-quarter guidance.\n\nBoth the record experiences profits and the investor concerns underscore just how important D'Amaro and his fiefdom are to the company.\n\nBloomberg reported on Monday that Disney's board of directors \"is aligning on promoting\" D'Amaro to replace longtime CEO Bob Iger, who's planning to retire later this year. Business Insider could not independently confirm the reporting. Disney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUsers on the prediction market Kalshi assigned Josh D'Amaro a 92% chance of becoming the next CEO as of Monday morning.\n\nDana Walden, who runs Disney's entertainment and TV businesses, is widely seen to be the other top contender for the coveted CEO job. Walden has grown the streaming unit, which also turned in record profits in the last quarter. It's crucial to Disney's future, since traditional TV networks are losing their value due to continued cord-cutting.\n\nStill, D'Amaro's division is the profit-generating machine. Disney's parks, cruises, and products accounted for more than 70% of its operating income, despite making up a relatively small slice of its revenue at under 39%. Jason Bazinet, a media analyst at Citi, said Monday on CNBC that almost all of Disney's earnings underperformance last quarter came from the entertainment segment.\n\nBazinet added that \"virtually everyone\" on the buy side that he's spoken to \"would prefer that Mr. D'Amaro is named the new CEO.\"\n\n\"Nothing against Ms. Walden, but people just like Mr. D'Amaro a bit more,\" he said.\n\nD'Amaro's experiences segment has pulled off an impressive feat: consistently reeling in record revenue and hefty profits by making more money from each visitor, without alienating its biggest fans. The Mouse House has raised ticket prices for its US parks in each of the past four years.\n\nDisney said per-person spending at its US parks rose 4% last quarter, though attendance only increased by 1%, due in part to a dip in visits from international guests. That means the company is making more per customer, in part by upselling through Lightning Lane fast passes. While Disney could risk losing lower-income or middle-class visitors if it keeps hiking prices, its results suggest that's not an issue yet.\n\nOn Disney's earnings call, one analyst remarked on how the parks business had gone from the worst part of the company's portfolio to its profit engine.\n\nIger responded that he's \"very, very bullish\" on the parks business, which has \"never been more broad or more diverse.\"\n\n\"We have a healthy competition now at our company, in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the No. 1 driver of profitability for the company,\" Iger said, in reference to the experiences and entertainment businesses — though he could also have been slyly nodding at the race between Walden and D'Amaro.",

    "description": "While many companies try to foster an “ownership culture” to boost engagement and performance, true success comes when employees are given actual equity stakes. However, financial ownership alone is insufficient; the most effective organizations combine broad-based equity with three key management practices: financial transparency, empathetic leadership, and rigorous measurement and management of culture. These practices—clear communication about how individual actions impact business outcomes, leaders who listen and build trust, and data-driven approaches to people and culture—drive higher engagement, retention, and operational improvements. Importantly, even companies without equity programs can replicate these results by applying the same principles to bonuses, profit sharing, or career development, making ownership behaviors accessible and impactful for all.",

WeissFebruary 2, 2026PostPostShareSavePrintSummary.   Leer en españolLer em portuguêsPostPostShareSavePrintU.S. worker engagement has stagnated for decades, with more than two-thirds of workers feeling detached or disengaged from work. To reverse the trend, many executives have strived to build an “ownership culture,” hoping personal responsibility will drive productivity. Yet most omit the most vital ingredient, actual ownership. We spent the past four years studying companies that committed to this missing piece, extending equity to all employees. While broad-based ownership isn’t new, a recent surge led by private equity has made it a potent economic force. Since 2022, more than $1.3 billion has been distributed to 41,000 non-executive employees, with projections exceeding $20 billion in the coming decade.",

At one point, it oversaw 15 data centers with a combined capacity of 533 megawatts and controlled over 50% of the domestic Bitcoin mining market, according to HSE Center for Electric Power Research. The company reported more than 10 billion rubles ($131.6 million) in revenue in 2024, before its power lines began to dim.\n\nOn Jan. 27, the Sverdlovsk Regional Arbitration Court initiated monitoring procedures for Fox Group of Companies LLC, which owns 98% of BitRiver Management Company, according to a report by Kommersant.\n\nInfrastructure of Siberia, part of energy conglomerate En+ Group, filed the bankruptcy petition over a canceled equipment supply deal. The firm paid more than 700 million rubles (approx. $9.1 million) in advance for mining hardware that never arrived.\n\nAfter the contract was terminated, courts sided with En+ in April 2025, but enforcement efforts found no recoverable assets, prompting the bankruptcy filing. BitRiver’s accounts were later frozen, a move legal experts warned could “paralyze operations,” Kommersant reported.\n\nLeading miner walks away from Bitcoin\n\nNasdaq sends delisting threat to another crypto firm\n\nAbundant Mines CEO says post-halving Bitcoin mining will look different\n\nThe En+ dispute is just one part of BitRiver’s broader financial unraveling. The company faces mounting electricity debts and multiple lawsuits from energy suppliers.\n\nCourts are reviewing claims totaling more than 940 million rubles ($12.2 million), including 133 million from En+ Sbyt, 640 million from the Irkutsk Electric Grid Company, and 168.7 million already awarded to NTEK. Regional utilities under Rosseti have also filed collection suits.\n\nBitRiver’s internal structure has deteriorated in parallel. Layoffs began in early 2025, followed by salary delays and executive resignations.",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

    "fullText": "Stephen Miller’s podcaster wife threw a hissy fit online after watching Pete Davidson’s ICE-bashing return to Saturday Night Live.\n\nKatie Miller, 34, did not take kindly to the jokes in SNL’s latest cold open, which cast Davison, 32, as border czar Tom Homan, 64.\n\n“For over a decade, not only hasn’t SNL been funny but it’s been voice of woke corporate leftists and the elite - that’s why these skits have devolved into drivel not comedy,” the MAGA podcaster fumed on X on Sunday.\n\nKatie, who is pregnant with her fourth child with Miller, highlighted a clip from the cold open in which an ICE agent complains about protesters in Minneapolis carrying guns.\n\nDavidson’s Homan responds: “Well, let’s flip it around. How many of you went to a Stop the Steal protest with a loaded automatic weapon?”—prompting the entire room of ICE agents to raise their hands.\n\n“You gotta do better,” Davidson says, briefly breaking character. “I’m Tom Homan, OK? I am the separating-families-at-the-border guy. I’m the on-film-taking-a-$50,000-bribe guy. And y’all are making me look like the upstanding, reasonable adult in the room. That’s crazy!”\n\nIn her post, Katie implored her followers to imagine if SNL “actually mocked their globalist overlords instead of bowing to their groupthink,” before adding, “ICE are heroes.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to NBC for comment.\n\nKatie went to war on X for her husband last week as Miller, 40, faced a firestorm in the wake of the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti, whom he initially smeared as an “assassin.”\n\nDonald Trump’s deputy chief of staff and the architect of his harshest immigration policies was effectively sidelined alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when the president sent Homan to “de-escalate” Minneapolis.\n\nNoem, 54, who had smeared Pretti herself, tried to pass the blame onto Miller, reportedly saying that she had acted “at the direction of the president and Stephen.”\n\nKatie rushed to Miller’s defense, circulating his statement that pinned the blame on Customs and Border Protection, which falls under Noem’s Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe Millers’ united damage control was widely ridiculed.\n\nKatie, who regularly derides things that rub her the wrong way as “woke,” blew up last week after finding out that first lady Melania Trump’s widely-panned film was getting pulled from South Africa.\n\n“Of course—since they are biased against white people,” Miller wrote, referring to a country that was governed under a racist white-minority apartheid regime for decades.",

    "fullText": "The blueberry and strawberry fields at Southern Hill Farms were buried in chunks of ice.\n\nWhile it can look picturesque amid the morning sun, it can also be catastrophic to the plants – and the farmers' business.\n\nThe plants were sprayed with light water overnight to create a thin ice layer, which helps to protect the plants. Too much ice, however, can cause the plants to break and topple over.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nCLERMONT, Fla. - In the light of day, it looks like a glass forest. Every leaf, every branch, and every fruit in this Lake County field is encased in a thick, translucent armor.\n\nBut for the farmers here, this isn’t a winter wonderland.\n\nThe owners and staff at Southern Hill Farms in Clermont, Florida, did not sleep – staying awake throughout the night to monitor their plants and fields as freezing temperatures hit the area.\n\n\"We knew it was gonna be a terrible night. When you make ice at eight o'clock, it's gonna be bad, bad night,\" said David Hill, one of the owners.\n\n\"We've done this a million times when it was a cold event. We run overhead irrigation to either to wash frost off or to freeze, put a protective layer of water, ice around the berry and the plant. Normally, it's 30 degrees, 32 degrees, wind's not real high. The event we had last night was catastrophic.\"\n\nThe ice got too heavy for some of the sprinklers that hover above the fields. So, when the plants became to heavy and fell, the sprinkler systems go with it.\n\n\"We've got overhead irrigation pipes in field and they were, you know, the the plants are all around there and they were solid ice, they would take down the pipes with it,\" the owners said.\n\nSunday night brings more freezing temperatures to the area. The farm closed Saturday and Sunday due to the ice.\n\nWhat's next is to get through the night, evaluate the damage, and then figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"During a freeze event, farmers use overhead irrigation to protect crops by continuously applying water. As that water freezes, it releases heat, creating a protective layer of ice that helps keep plants at a survivable temperature. It’s a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring, long hours, and a whole lot of experience,\" the farm wrote on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nFOX 35's Jessica Dobson was at Southern Hill Farms on Sunday morning, Feb. 1, 2026. She talked to the owners and gave viewers a first-hand look at the ice. Southern Hill also posted about the ice and freezing temperatures on its Facebook page.",

    "description": "When cosmetics meets corporate finance, JPMorgan's Fei-Fei Zhang is often at the intersection. Here's what she predicts for the business of beauty.",
    "fullText": "The cosmetics industry's glamour has caught Wall Street's eye — and investors are recognizing that beauty is more than skin deep.\n\nBeauty has become a booming sector, driven by a wave of savvy social media creators and startups that are shaping trends and fueling spending. The consulting firm McKinsey predicts that, by 2030, the industry could be worth nearly $600 billion. At JPMorgan, Fei-Fei Zhang is shaping how the bank is approaching the opportunity.\n\nInvestment banker Zhang, JPMorgan's head of beauty for North America, has advised on a string of blockbuster deals asector hasctor's gained momentum. Zhang was a senior leader on the team behind the $1 billion sale of Rhode, the skincare brand cofounded by Hailey Bieber, to e.l.f. Beauty, announced last May.\n\nWithin weeks, British skincare brand Medik8 was sold to cosmetics giant L'Oreal for more than $1 billion, which Zhang advised on. She also helped Mammoth Brands — founded by the team behind grooming brand Harry's — on its October purchase of the diaper brand Coterie, marking a foray into the vast baby care market.\n\nIn April 2025, the bank promoted Zhang to its most powerful rank — managing director — the culmination of the professional rise for a self-proclaimed beauty industry aficionado who started working at JPMorgan as an intern in 2011. By the time she'd made VP, she was pushing her higher-ups to expand in the sector, becoming an architect of its burgeoning cosmetics industry strategy.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with Zhang about her predictions for dealmaking in 2026, what makes brands stand out in the boardroom, and how it felt to be a part of the sale of Rhode. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are you getting excited about in 2026?\n\nSpecific to beauty, acquisitions have always been central to the industry. One theme we saw last year that will likely carry through is what I'd call corporate clarity. We started to see an uptick in corporate carve-outs, with strategics reorienting their portfolios toward growth platforms and greater margin accretion.\n\nThe other driver remains core to the industry: acquisitions of high-growth independent brands that fill portfolio gaps — whether immediately for strategics or through a multi-step path that may involve private equity first.\n\nHow do private equity firms and corporate buyers approach beauty differently? Do you expect the PE firms to step up their activity this year?\n\nBeauty has very attractive qualities for private equity. It's a highly replenishable category, it has stable growth characteristics, and it has proven resilient through economic cycles. When you look at the financials, you often see strong margins and high free-cash-flow generation.\n\nWhat has shifted is discipline. Buyers are more discerning and are evaluating opportunities with elevated expectations around scale, growth, profitability, and brand history. That reflects lessons learned from prior cycles, including the very high level of M&A activity in 2021.\n\nHow are influencer trends shaping the industry in the boardroom?\n\nOn social media, the impact has been transformative. It has fundamentally reshaped the beauty industry, enabling an explosion of new entrants and accelerating how quickly a product or brand can gain traction.\n\nThe same forces that propel rapid growth can create challenging expectations to sustain it. Brands are scaling faster than ever, but a key question becomes whether they have the resonance and infrastructure to deliver durable, long-term growth. That question directly affects M&A prospects.\n\nHow do buyers evaluate the role of social media engagement when they're thinking about buying a cosmetics company?\n\nSocial engagement is incredibly important, but it's only one part of the picture. Buyers are ultimately looking for a powerful identity. They ask: How differentiated is the brand voice? How defensible is it? Does it engender consumer loyalty and advocacy?\n\nYou then want to see that translate into the business itself — a financial profile that delivers consistent growth and demonstrates durability. What we see buyers really looking for in today's crowded market is longevity. You can build momentum quickly, but the question is whether that growth is sustainable over the long term.\n\nTell me a little bit about the Rhode deal. How did it come together?\n\nWe have a platform that's really designed to support companies through every stage of their lifecycle — from that early growth stage to the ultimate exit. The Rhode transaction is a reflection of that.\n\nWe were able to support the company earlier through our commercial banking capabilities and act as a thought partner. Being able to work with a client over time and ultimately help navigate a strategic transaction is what makes the job so exciting and dynamic.\n\nWhat drew you to the beauty sector in the first place?\n\nI grew up going with my mom to the department store counters and got my first skincare regimen when I was probably too young to say — a preteen. It's always been a personal interest of mine.\n\nEarly in my career, it became increasingly clear that there was a huge opportunity in beauty given the rapid pace of deal activity happening across the category. Emerging brands in particular are an incredibly important part of the beauty ecosystem. Those founders need partners and advisors to help them navigate growth and assess opportunities in a sector that moves very quickly.\n\nWhen I was a vice president, I saw an opportunity to form a sector specialty in beauty. My pitch to senior leadership was to invest early, and leverage our full platform to support these founders, leaders, and investors; be their thought partner; and earn their trust as they navigated those important strategic decisions, up to and including a potential sale process. Fortunately, this approach has proven successful.\n\nFor me, being able to work with companies over time and help them navigate those decisions is incredibly rewarding.",

    "fullText": "There's no sugarcoating last week's layoffs.\n\nAmazon is cutting 16,000 corporate jobs, pushing thousands of workers into a job market already crowded with tech talent. Business Insider was all over the news, with scoop after scoop, including internal messages revealing which teams and jobs were affected.\n\nThe layoffs followed the 14,000 job cuts Amazon announced back in October.\n\nUPS expects to eliminate 30,000 roles, on top of the 48,000 cuts it announced last year. Home Depot is laying off 800 corporate employees. Pinterest said it's cutting 15% of its staff.\n\nMy colleague Jacob Zinkula, who covers the economy, has spoken with dozens of laid-off workers over the past year, many from Big Tech companies, including Amazon.\n\nA clear theme has emerged. Many built careers years ago when opportunities felt endless. Now, even strong résumés and big-name employers don't guarantee a quick bounce-back.\n\nPart of the reason is simple math. US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nAnd the early impact of AI is starting to show up, too. Companies are finding ways to run leaner. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said AI can now let one employee do the work of entire teams — a shift that's shaping how companies think about hiring.\n\nStill, it's not all doom and gloom.\n\nJacob recently spoke with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old former Amazon employee in New Jersey, who was laid off in October. She explained how she landed a new job just two weeks later.\n\nHer advice for other laid-off tech workers:\n\n\"Looking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role,\" she said. \"It was still difficult, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.\"",

    "description": "Two Business Insider reporters attended Starbucks' Investor Day and got a firsthand look at how the brand plans to build momentum with its turnaround.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks' new \"Ristretto\" concept, as the company called it — named after the short-pulled espresso shot — aims to reduce average build costs by about 20% while optimizing overall footprint, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said.\n\nThe walk-thru mockup featured cushy furniture, digital menus, merch displays, and a callback to Starbucks' 1971 founding above the door.\n\nSmith forecast 600 to 650 new stores opening globally in the current fiscal year, rising to over 2,000 in fiscal year 2028. Roughly 400 of the new US coffeehouses coming by 2028 are expected to be company-owned.\n\nWalking through the coffeehouse setup, with Simple Plan's \"I'm Just a Kid\" playing on the speakers, it was hard not to think back to our teenage years when Starbucks was the hangout spot, which perhaps was the point.\n\nExecs stressed Starbucks' desire to become a \"third place.\"\n\n\"We have a unique opportunity to connect people over coffee during a time when loneliness is pervasive,\" Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said.\n\nThe furniture, including the \"Starbucks lounge icon,\" as the display next to the chair pictured above read, was designed to get people to sit and hang out for a while.\n\nNiccol said the company plans to add 25,000 additional seats to its US company-operated stores by the end of its fiscal year and replace thousands more with \"more comfortable options.\"\n\n\"Customers are already responding with longer dwell times and, frankly, improved customer satisfaction and connections,\" he added.\n\nStarbucks plans to introduce digital menu boards in all of its US company-operated stores over the next 18 months, separating its morning and afternoon menus to better target customer preferences.\n\n\"The morning is very much a ritual,\" Niccol said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. \"The afternoon is really a reset — and depending on where you are in that reset, you sometimes want a blended drink, you sometimes want an energy drink, you sometimes want a sparkling drink, and you sometimes want protein.\"\n\nStarbucks plans to expand its wellness offerings to meet that demand.\n\nStarbucks offered samples of global flavors like an ube macchiatto, a reformulated Chai latte with mango cold foam, and a strawberry açaí refresher, available three ways: decaffeinated, caffeinated, or with an energy boost.\n\nWe also sampled some bakery items, including a croissant-like uzu citrus blossom with a tasty uzu filling.\n\nStarbucks is rolling out new front and back-end technologies to make baristas' jobs easier — and help you get your order faster.\n\nThe company's mobile app has gotten a facelift, and a new loyalty program is rolling out in March. Its new point-of-sale system, also coming this year, aims to reduce staff training time and the time it takes to place an order.\n\nThe Mastrena III espresso machine, rolling out in 2027, halves the time it takes to brew espresso while maintaining the quality, Starbucks says.\n\nStarbucks also showed off Green Dot Assist, an AI-powered assistant that gives baristas recipes and other information about an order on a tablet to speed up production.\n\nThe Q&A session lasted nearly an hour, during which analysts pressed the executives for more specifics on their plan.\n\nDespite the optimism onstage, investors pressed executives on the company's long-term plan. Shares slid about 1% during the presentations, after a brief pop earlier in the week before earnings.\n\nThe execs responded to several questions about Starbucks' operating margins and its recent deal with Boyu Capital to sell off 60% of its China business. Investors also wanted more details on how Starbucks will navigate ongoing supply chain snarls and encourage employees to have an \"ownership mentality\" to grow with the brand.\n\nAbout five hours after it began, Rodriguez left investor day buzzing with caffeine and headed back to Business Insider's New York headquarters.\n\nOn the West Coast, Business Insider's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert — equally caffeinated after a 3 a.m. wake-up — was already on the phone with analysts. Their verdict: Starbucks has gone on offense, laying out growth plans that are credible, if not exactly blockbuster.\n\nTogether, the two reporters walked away with a sharper view of where Starbucks' strategy is headed next.\n\nThe company hopes it can reignite momentum by making its cafés more inviting and pushing harder on menu innovation. There's still work to do — but Starbucks believes its comeback is no longer theoretical.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Starbucks?

Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitor\n\nA little more than one week ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.\n\nThe day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.\n\nSimultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedian Meg Stalter – accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, tweeted that TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.\n\nAfter days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued a statement blaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.\n\nOracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.\n\nThe most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.\n\nThe late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolled press release now claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.\n\nTikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.\n\nTikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.",

Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China\n\n Zhuang Liu, \n\n Wenwei Peng \n\n & Shaoda Wang \n\n Working Paper 34747\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34747\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nHonesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe thank Ying Bai, Yiming Cao, Yunchien Chang, Chiman Cheung, Ruben Durante, Ray Fisman, Edward Glaeser, Guojun He, Andrew Kao, Muhammad Yasir Khan, Jonathan Klick, James Kung, Bingjing Li, Vincent Pons, Jesse Shapiro, Uta Schoenberg, Michael Song, Yongxiang Wang, Jaya Wen, Yanhui Wu, David Y.

    "fullText": "After covering the Grammy Awards for nearly two decades, there are a few moments I know will happen on music's biggest night: Someone will go home happy, and someone will go home sad.\n\nEither way, we'll get Trevor Noah as the host for his sixth and final time, performances you'll text about, and candid moments between our favorite singers seated inside LA's Crypto.com Arena on Sunday. It'll all air on CBS.\n\nKendrick Lamar leads with nine nominations, including in the major categories such as Record, Album, and Song of the Year, followed by Lady Gaga and producers Cirkut and Jack Antonoff with seven. We'll also be watching Super Bowl performer Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter, and my personal favorite, Leon Thomas, to see if they go home with trophies after nabbing six nods.\n\nI asked Business Insider's entertainment team who they thought would go home with a small, 24K gold-plated gramophone. Here's what they're betting on:\n\nJason Guerrasio, Entertainment correspondent: Tucked away in the midst of the 90-plus Grammy categories is Best Album Cover. I hope it goes to Perfume Genius' \"Glory\" cover. Google it. It's instantly eye-catching.\n\nSamantha Rollins, deputy editor of Entertainment: When \"Mayhem\" single \"Abracadabra\" debuted during a commercial break at last year's Grammys, many posited that Lady Gaga's newest album would take a back-to-basics approach to the edgy electropop that made her famous. What emerged instead was far more interesting. Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" is an invigorating return to form that proves one of pop's most famous shape-shifters can still keep us guessing. She'll take it for Album of the Year.\n\nCallie Ahlgrim, senior pop culture writer: Record of the Year is supposed to honor the most superb blend of production and performance, but since it tends to favor ubiquity, I have to give the edge to the global pop smash \"APT.\" Bruno Mars has the cross-generational appeal that Grammy voters can't resist, and Rosé would make history as the first K-pop star to win in a competitive category.",

    "description": "Business Insider visited NATO soldiers training above the Arctic Circle. They said they put newspaper in their boots to keep them dry.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Deep snow. Fleeting daylight. Wet clothes. Frozen weapons. Sub-zero temperatures.\n\nNATO soldiers training in Arctic warfare are learning that in a future conflict, fighting the enemy may be only half the battle. The other would be surviving the region's harsh winters.\n\n\"The environment can be hard for someone who is not used to it,\" said Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, bundled up and dressed in camouflage to blend in with the snow.\n\nLähdekorpi is among roughly 20 NATO soldiers participating in an Arctic warfare training and cold-weather survival course led by the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which specializes in winter combat.\n\nThe monthlong course is conducted far above the Arctic Circle, in Finland's snow-covered Lapland region, where soldiers see just a few hours of sunlight each day and experience temperatures that regularly drop well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWith growing Russian and Chinese activity across the Arctic, NATO officials are stressing the need for greater readiness in the region. The training course helps Western soldiers sharpen their ability to fight on frozen battlefields, where the military alliance could find itself at war next amid rising competition.\n\n\"The Arctic, overall, is changing,\" Canadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, another soldier participating in the course, told Business Insider during a visit to Lapland this week. \"So we need to know much more expertise to be able to face these changes.\"\n\nThe first of the Arctic warfare training course's three phases focuses on how to move and survive in winter conditions, teaching soldiers skills such as drying wet clothes, crossing the forest on skis, and preventing their weapons from freezing.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Jaeger Brigade who oversees the course, said some of the biggest challenges soldiers face in this environment are maintaining combat readiness in extreme temperatures (below -14 degrees Fahrenheit) and moving around in the deep, soft snow that blankets Lapland this time of year.\n\nCold temperatures can make it hard to keep equipment functioning properly and strain soldiers' physical and mental well-being. After a long day of exertion, even simple tasks like eating and drinking, which are critical in these conditions to replenish calories and stay hydrated, may feel daunting.\n\nThe unforgiving Arctic environment can be as dangerous as the enemy, especially for soldiers who aren't trained for such conditions, Aikio told Business Insider, warning that unfamiliar terrain and extreme cold can have a huge impact. Even well-trained units aren't immune, he added. In severe cold, the environment still takes a heavy toll.\n\nLähdekorpi, the Finn, said the cold weather could distract soldiers in combat, leaving them more focused on getting warm than on fighting the enemy.\n\nThe persistent deep snow in the winter creates significant mobility challenges for soldiers. In the course, they learn to traverse the forest on skis and snowmobiles, even using these tools to conduct an assault against a simulated enemy force during the second phase of the training.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian, said survival in the Arctic is directly linked to movement. Mobility is far slower and more physically demanding than in other places, he said. Snow is constant and effectively part of the enemy.\n\nThat slower pace isn't a drawback. Sweating in extreme cold can be dangerous, as moisture can freeze, so soldiers are trained to move deliberately, take frequent breaks, and wear layers they can remove as conditions change.\n\nWhen soldiers start moving, they should be a little cold, Aikio said. After roughly 15 minutes on skis, units typically stop to shed layers.\n\nKeeping clothes and gear dry is another challenge soldiers face in the Arctic. Getting wet — a frequent occurrence in this region with all the snow and hidden sources of water — forces them to expend more energy to warm up.\n\nSoldiers wear fishnet fabric and wool as their layers and carry extra clothing in their backpacks. They dry clothing by hanging it on makeshift wooden tripods or placing it near the fire or in warm tents.\n\nFor wet boots, which Lähdekorpi said are the hardest to dry, soldiers crumple up newspaper and shove it inside to absorb moisture.\n\nWhile the harsh environment poses a different threat to soldiers than enemy artillery fire, it's still treacherous because cold-weather casualties before the fight even starts can put one side at a significant disadvantage, Lemelin said.\n\nConsidering the substantial challenges of operating in the Arctic, soldiers and course leadership view the training as a critical means of preparing them for the frozen battlefields NATO forces could one day face. The cold is an obstacle, but not an insurmountable wall; the aim is to learn to adapt and ultimately thrive in these brutal conditions.\n\n\"Embrace the cold,\" Lemelin said, \"and then warm up when there's the opportunity.\"",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "The best way to beat the line for a job is to show up before there is one.\n\nTalking with an employer before the company ever posts a job — not after — could help you land a role there, veteran career coach Laura Labovich told Business Insider.\n\nShe recommends that job seekers identify where they want to work, examine their network for any ties to the organization, and start building relationships inside well before a job post even goes up.\n\n\"The way to win is to not apply. Get in before they have the opening. Make connections. Become an insider,\" Labovich said.\n\nIf you wait until you see a job post before contacting an employer, she said, you might already be too late. That's because once a role is posted, recruiters or HR will often feel compelled to tell you to apply online — even if they already know you — in order to ensure all candidates get equal consideration, Labovich said.\n\nGetting in line with everybody else can make the process seem \"more like a cattle call,\" she said.\n\nAside from generally feeling lousy, the take-a-number approach is also rarely the best path to landing a role, as almost anyone seeking a desk job can attest.\n\nThe average corporate job posting draws 250 applicants, Glassdoor reported in 2025. Among those, only four to six candidates typically advance to the interview round. And, of course, only one person ultimately gets the offer letter.\n\nHaving someone who can show your résumé to a recruiter or hiring manager and help you stand out is \"worth its weight in gold\" when there are so many people looking for jobs, said Rick Wargo, managing partner of the global technology practice at the recruitment firm Boyden.\n\n\"A warm introduction is always the best way to go about a job search,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nOf course, if you don't know about a forthcoming job, you can't make a pitch for it. Yet that doesn't mean you're powerless. What you can do is consider whether the employer has hired for the kinds of roles you might want — and use that insight to guide early outreach.\n\nThat's why, Wargo said, it's smart to start networking and making connections inside key companies long before you need a job.\n\n\"You don't go to fix the roof when it's raining,\" he said.\n\nTo beat the rush that often occurs when an employer lists an opening, you can contact people who might be at your level within an organization and ask questions such as, \"How do you like your job?\" \"How do you like the organization?\" and \"How did you get to where you did?\" said Labovich, who runs Career Strategy Group, an outplacement firm in the Washington, DC, area.\n\nIf it's someone higher up the food chain — potentially someone who might be the hiring manager for a future job — the ask should be smaller, she said.\n\n\"You don't want to say, 'I want a job,' because if you're getting to them early, there's no job yet,\" Labovich said. Instead, she recommends that job seekers seek advice, insight, recommendations, and referrals.\n\nThat contact can pay off: Messaging a hiring manager nearly triples your chance of getting hired, LinkedIn reports.\n\nUltimately, Labovich said, making connections inside an organization is one of the best ways to navigate a hiring process that often feels \"totally broken.\"\n\nThat's left many job seekers applying to as many roles as they can, even though many career coaches, including Labovich, urge that people prioritize networking instead.\n\n\"The way to apply for a job these days is to not apply for a job,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "A small business owner near Minneapolis said both staff and customers fear ICE activity in the area.\n\nHe's concerned about the safety of his employees, who sometimes miss shifts to avoid immigration officers.\n\nNational activists are encouraging another economic blackout to protest ICE activity.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee affected by ICE in your area? Reach out to this reporter at allisonkelly@businessinsider.com or via Signal at alliekelly.10. Here's our guide to sharing information securely.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "fullText": "Suits are an easy choice when the dress code calls for formal attire, but they can be overkill in business-casual settings. You need wardrobe staples that'll cover your bases for when the stakes aren't quite as high, and that's where the best chinos for men come in.\n\nInvesting in the best business casual work clothes for men will inevitably include a reliable pair of chinos, so we've listed the top pairs, including those we've tested ourselves, to help you find what are sure to be your next favorite pants to live in. A tried-and-true favorite is the Bonobos Chinos 2.0, and for a more affordable option, we recommend the Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino.\n\nBonobos' trued and true chinos have a luxe feel that adds instant polish to your wardrobe.\n\nThe lightweight performance fabric has the subtle texture of a wool dress pant, but feels like your favorite yoga pant. Designed to look clean on the leg in a fit that tapers at the hem and sits neatly on the shoe.\n\nThis pair is made-to-measure and can be customized with interchangeable pockets, pleats, and button details.\n\nThe Bonobos Chinos 2.0 are highly regarded as among the best chinos for men for their super-luxe feel. The Italian milled cotton is soft and retains a vibrant hue, even after several rounds through the washing machine. A major perk is the option to choose from a wide range of colors, shapes and sizes. These range from 28 to 46 for waist, and from 28 to 36 for inseam lengths. You can choose between a tailored, slim, slim tapered, or athletic fit. Then, you can take your pick of 16 colors. These are more polished-looking chinos with crisp lines, but are worth having for a variety of occasions between business-casual and formal events.\n\nThe Quince direct-to-consumer business model makes their prices competitive, despite the quality of its apparel exceeding our expectations for basic wardrobe essentials. The Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino's value will become apparent the more you wear them, with a four-way stretch twill that provides the same flexibility as you'd expect from joggers. Plus, they're wrinkle-resistant, so you can pull them out as needed. Chinos that are this deceptively comfortable mean you can get the most use out of them anywhere along the spectrum of casual to semi-formal. \n\nRead our full Quince review.\n\nAs you may be able to guess from the brand's name, Indochino makes some of the best chinos for men. A fitting expert from one of their many showrooms can tell you your precise size in the Houndslow chinos, but if you can't make it to a storefront, their site has an in-depth tutorial on home measuring. Once you've found your perfect fit, you can further personalize them with custom pleats, hems, pockets, buttons, and belt loops. At $99, the Houndslows are also a great value for the high-quality, perfectly sized chinos you're guaranteed by going through their detailed fit screening. \n\nRead our full Indochino chinos review.\n\nPublic Rec is known for making menswear that's polished enough for the office, but comfortable enough for everyday life, and the Dealmaker Chinos do exactly that.\n\nSimilar to the wildly popular Gamechanger Rec Pant, the Dealmaker Chinos are incredibly stretchy, wrinkle-resistant, and thanks to its The Workday 2.0 Fabric, they're also wind- and water-resistant for all-season wear.\n\nThe Public Rec Dealmaker Chinos have a classic dressy look about them, yet can move with you in all directions of daily life.\n\nWoodies Clothing took off with their high-tech dress shirts, but their super comfortable chinos have thrived in the men's workwear space, too. They can be personalized with different combinations of custom pleats, pockets, and hems. The Woodies Premium Performance Stretch Pants are amid the best chinos for people unwilling to return to stiff slacks after living in work-from-home attire. What feels almost like joggers are really formal-presenting pants that are easy to style through every season. Their soft, two-way stretch, quick drying fabric is remarkably stain repellent — just the right chinos for the accident prone.\n\nRead our full Woodies performance chinos and dress shirt review.\n\nFor many men who shop big and tall sizes, finding comfortable formal wear can pose a serious challenge. But dressing up with an athletic build doesn't have to mean feeling squeezed into a suit all day — Dockers' Ultimate Chinos will assure you that. These come in extended waist sizes with extra room in the seat and thighs so as to not constrict you, even when you're sitting for long periods of time. The four-way Smart 360 Flex™ material allows for more mobility, and the extended inseam lengths position the knee correctly before tapering off towards the hem.\n\nAs one of the undeniable symbols of Americana, Polo Ralph Lauren offers the best men's chinos, high-quality and ultimately timeless. The heritage brand offers its Stretch Slim Fit Chinos in a trim silhouette that sits low on the waist. Despite being slim from top to bottom, the cotton and elastane blend makes them soft and lightweight instead of too compressed, the way other slim fits can feel. A bonus of the slim fit is how well they factor into a high-low outfit — sleek dressy pants paired with an oversized sweater is a simple way to create a balanced contrast.\n\nMany designs from Alex Mill are uniform and minimalistic, with nuances only shown in the details. Their unisex cropped chinos are standard at first glance, but their prominent pleats, neatly cropped hems, and \"X\" belt loops give them a subtle edge on the average pair of dress pants. These have a relaxed fit that allows for slight stretching, and each pair comes in unique color variations according to their natural dye process.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "description": "SpaceX is gearing up for a massive IPO this year, and multiple reports suggested the rocket giant is considering mergers with Tesla or xAI.",
    "fullText": "The \"Muskonomy\" might be about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for a potential $1.5 trillion IPO this year, and multiple reports on Thursday night suggested the rocket company is considering blockbuster mergers with Tesla, Elon Musk's carmaker, or his AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe three companies have already been moving closer together in recent months. Tesla said on Wednesday that it had invested $2 billion in xAI, after SpaceX reportedly made a similar investment last year.\n\nThe electric carmaker also told investors it would evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with xAI, following its addition of the startup's Grok chatbot to its vehicles last July.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Musk has combined parts of his sprawling business empire. Last March, he announced that xAI had purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMerging xAI with one of Tesla or SpaceX would mark a dramatic escalation of the so-called \"Muskonomy,\" however. Here's what it could mean for the future of Elon Musk's business empire.\n\nAt first glance, bringing social media site X, the controversial chatbot Grok, and the reusable rocket Starship under one roof seems like a strange mix. But merging SpaceX and xAI does fit with Musk's long-term vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nThe world's richest man has suggested that the logical conclusion of the AI infrastructure boom is to build data centres in the freezing vacuum of space, where they can access plentiful solar power and operate without the huge amounts of water needed to cool them on Earth.\n\nSpeaking at Davos last week, Musk suggested that space will become the \"lowest cost\" place to train AI, and said that SpaceX will launch solar-powered AI satellites in the next few years that will ultimately scale up to \"hundreds of terawatts\" of energy consumption a year.\n\nMusk has also said that SpaceX's Starship rocket and growing network of Starlink satellites could form the basis of a massive network of orbital AI compute.\n\nAccess to this infrastructure could give xAI an advantage over rivals OpenAI and Google, who are scrambling for computing power and exploring space-based data centers themselves as they look to build ever more powerful AI models.\n\nAnother consideration is funding. Training AI is notoriously expensive, with xAI reportedly burning through billions of dollars in cash and regularly taking on new funding. SpaceX, meanwhile, has seen revenue grow in recent years and is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion.\n\nMerging SpaceX with Tesla, which has been a public company since 2010, would be more complicated — and the payoff less obvious.\n\nThe two companies already enjoy close links, having shared board members and executives in the past. And, in 2018, Musk used SpaceX for some out-of-this-world marketing by blasting his Tesla Roadster into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nTheir current businesses, however, have less obvious areas of overlap.\n\nTesla is shifting from a carmaker to an AI and robotics company, with Musk saying on Wednesday that Tesla would scrap the Model X and S and use their production lines to build its Optimus robot.\n\nThe company also has a thriving energy storage business, and at Davos last week, Musk said that both Tesla and SpaceX were separately working to build up to \"a hundred gigawatts a year\" of solar power in the US.\n\nCombining the two could be a step toward Musk's more grandiose dreams of massively expanding humanity's energy production.\n\nMusk also reiterated on Wednesday that he believes Tesla needs to build a \"terafab\" to build advanced AI chips, and in an X post in November suggested that Tesla's terafab could produce chips for SpaceX's solar-powered AI satellites.\n\nOne throughline that connects all of Musk's enterprises is his obsession with settling Mars, which the billionaire has described as critical to humanity's long-term survival.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up to use Starship to launch uncrewed missions to Mars in the coming years, and the billionaire has previously said that these missions would carry Tesla's Optimus to the red planet.\n\nOne thing that's clear is that combining his various companies has been on Musk's mind for a while. Way back in 2020, he responded to a Twitter post suggesting he merge SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company.",

    "description": "Reactions are already pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders about President Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.\"\n\nKrugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had \"argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.\"\n\n\"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "description": "Manchester United's interim head coach Michael Carrick is not ruling out the possibility of the club doing business on transfer deadline day",
    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has not ruled out Manchester United adding to their squad before Monday's transfer deadline.\n\nFormer United head coach Ruben Amorim said last month he expected to bring someone in during the window.\n\nHowever, the club's refusal to divert the £65m they had been willing to spend on long-term target Antoine Semenyo – who opted to join Manchester City from Bournemouth – was a source of frustration for the Portuguese.\n\nUnited have been linked with a number of central midfield players, including former Wolves skipper Ruben Neves who now plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Hilal.\n\nAfter Carrick confirmed left-sided utility man Patrick Dorgu would be out for \"a number of weeks\" through injury, there have been suggestions the club might look to cover the Denmark international's absence.\n\nInterim head coach Carrick was coy when asked specifically about the club's position as he spoke in a news conference to preview Sunday's Premier League encounter with Fulham.\n\nBut he did leave the door open for business being done.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Carrick said. \"A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.\n\n\"Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.\"\n\nJoshua Zirkzee remains at the centre of interest as it remains to be seen if he returns to Italy, with Juventus considering whether to make a move for the former Bologna forward who cost United £36.5m 18 months ago.\n\nZirkzee has recovered from a minor injury and is available for the Fulham game.\n\n\"Josh has just been trying to work to get fit,\" said Carrick. \"It was great to have him training with the group the first time and I am just looking forward to working with him.\"\n\nCarrick accepts the issue of Bruno Fernandes' future is \"on the agenda a little bit\", with the United captain due to assess his plans at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, Carrick said that situation would be dealt with \"further down the line\".",
