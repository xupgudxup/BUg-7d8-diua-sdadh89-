    "description": "An AI/ML Success Architect helps companies decide when to use AI, when not to, and how to design and build systems for real business impact.",
    "fullText": "I did some AI consulting for computer vision. A lot of times, the value that I brought to the company was telling them not to use AI. I was the AI expert, and they described the problem, and I said, “Don’t use AI.” This is my value add.\n\nLast year, I went through some exercises to clarify what I do for clients. I ended up with descriptions of various lengths, but still felt like I needed something shorter and more generic. Then it hit me – I’m an AI/ML Success Architect!\n\nTo my surprise, a Google search for the exact term yielded zero results, so I quickly changed my website title to claim it. Now, it’s time to define the title in more detail.\n\nMy commitment to AI/ML success and to serving people and causes I care about is a large part of why I work independently rather than as an employee. It makes it easier to say no to unnecessary projects, and avoid going down the path of reluctant data engineering.\n\nMy current LinkedIn tagline is “helping climate tech founders ship AI/ML solutions that support multi-million dollar growth goals”. This means my typical leads have a low chance of success, as more than 90% of startups and 80% of AI/ML projects fail. By working with founders who are a good fit – and by helping them avoid overinvestment in AI/ML – my aim is to help them beat the odds and successfully ascend the AI/ML maturity curve.

    "fullText": "As kids, there was always that one place we begged our parents to take us to, or got excited about visiting for a birthday party or a school field trip.\n\nAfter all, kids' fixations are simple: Give them pizza and entertainment, and they'll happily stay occupied for hours. When a business offers both, it often becomes a welcome break for parents as well.\n\nEveryone has their own version of that place, whether it's Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster's, or Main Event. Over the years, these spots have become go-to destinations for families across the country. In Texas, however, one chain has long stood apart as a source of Lone Star pride.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza began in 1964 as a small restaurant called \"The Pizza Place\" in Stephenville, Texas. Five years later, it relocated to Austin and was renamed Mr Gatti's, in honor of the founder's wife's maiden name.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Mr Gatti's brand expanded into a chain and introduced buffet-style dining, an innovation that helped distinguish it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the Austin restaurant predated the first Chuck E. Cheese location (which opened in San Jose, California, in 1977), Mr Gatti's didn't really jump onto the entertainment-plus-pizza trend until the 1980s. The concept quickly won over families, and today Mr Gatti's Pizza operates more than 200 locations across Texas and the southeastern U.S.\n\nIndustry experts say this hybrid model has become increasingly valuable as traditional casual dining struggles to compete for consumers. According to a 2025 McKinsey & Company survey, 45% of surveyed consumers have reduced their spending at pizza restaurants.\n\n\"When there's good entertainment and good experiences, check averages go up,\" Downtown Restaurant Investments President and BYOD CEO Dave Dittenber told Restaurant Dive.\n\nDittenber added that entertainment only works when paired with strong service and quality food.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza has sold a majority stake in its business to OneRyan Global LLC, the family office of businessman and philanthropist G. Brint Ryan, according to a press release. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nOneRyan has been a franchisee of Mr Gatti's Pizza since 2022, but its involvement with the brand has steadily expanded.\n\nIn September 2025, OneRyan acquired a minority stake in the company and, a month later, purchased a corporate-owned restaurant at South Park Meadows in Austin. That transaction completed Mr Gatti's Pizza's transition to a fully franchised system and concluded the re-franchising of all company-owned locations.",

    "title": "How business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis",
    "description": "The killing of Alex Pretti, a US citizen, by ICE in Minneapolis on Saturday has drawn sharp responses from many Americans, including business leaders.",
    "fullText": "Federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a US citizen in Minneapolis — the second fatal shooting involving ICE officers this month — adding more fuel to an already explosive national debate over immigration enforcement.\n\nThe killing sparked an outcry on Minneapolis streets, as well as online, eliciting sharp responses from all sides, including leaders in the business and tech communities.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, for instance, wrote in a post on X that it was \"time to take the temperature down before more lives are lost.\"\n\nMinnesota officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, criticized the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for what they said were overly aggressive tactics. The DHS, meanwhile, defended its agents, arguing that they are being provoked by unruly protesters and an uncooperative city government and police.\n\nThousands of ICE officers began descending on Minnesota on December 1 as part of Operation Metro Surge. The DHS says it is targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state and has deployed over 2,000 ICE agents across Minnesota.\n\nResidents of Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been protesting since the federal immigration agents arrived. Those demonstrations grew more intense after the first fatal shooting on January 7. In that incident, ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good, 37, as she tried to drive away in a car.\n\nHere's how business and tech leaders are reacting to the latest violence.\n\nThe hedge-fund billionaire called for calm in an X post on Saturday, lamenting that the United States had reached a point where \"there are only two sides to every issue and every incident.\"\n\n\"Individuals are 'convicted' of serious crimes in the headlines, by politicians appealing to their base, and ultimately in the minds of the public, or they are exonerated, before all of the facts are in and a detailed investigation has been completed,\" He wrote. \"This is not good for America.\"\n\nJust two hours later, in another post on X, Ackman laid the blame on Minnesota's state government.\n\n\"It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner,\" he said, tagging Walz. \"Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences.\"\n\nLike Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. He has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE \"out of control.\"\n\nIn another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out \"chronically online tech leaders\" for suddenly falling quiet. Another X user called on business and tech leaders to use their platform to stand up to the Trump administration and its immigration enforcement tactics, to which Hoffman replied, \"It's time for all Americans to do so.\"\n\nJeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: \"This is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nMinneapolis police confirmed that Pretti, who was filming ICE agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun.\n\nBorder Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot.\n\nJason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular \"All-In\" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday.\n\n\"Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,\" he wrote. \"True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.\"\n\nHe later posted that \"all of this violence\" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally.\n\nCristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident \"indefensible\" in a post on X.\n\n\"The victim's legally owned handgun was removed from the scene, and then ICE agents shot him multiple times. It's far from law enforcement — it's just murder,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Those who defend this don't care about law or order. It's about money, power, and protecting an executive branch that's already been bought and paid for.\"",

    "title": "5 acquisitions, winning over skeptical engineers, and spending tens of millions: Inside a public company's 'AI native' push",
    "description": "Amplitude gave Business Insider the inside look at its AI overhaul, from acquisitions to efforts to increase staff adoption of AI coding assistants.",
    "fullText": "There's a long banner hanging in Amplitude's San Francisco office. It reads: \"NO MAGICAL THINKING.\"\n\nNo, it's not some rag on Joan Didion. It's a reminder, CEO Spenser Skates told Business Insider, that technology can never replace deep thinking and hard work. In the AI age, that reminder is more important than ever — so much so that employees must look up at it every day.\n\nAmplitude, an 800-person, publicly traded analytics company, is undergoing an AI transformation — with the goal of reinvigorating its business.\n\nAmplitude went public in September 2021 at the height of the pandemic, climbing to an all-time closing high of $84.80 per share several weeks later before dropping significantly and largely plateauing in in recent years around $10. It closed at $10.25 on Friday.\n\nSince October 2024, the company has acquired five AI startups. Amplitude hired an AI-savvy engineering head and appointed one of its acquired founders to a new AI leadership position. It got Cursor and GitHub Copilot licenses for employees, and ran a heads-down AI week.\n\nIt's a change many companies are making: Rapidly moving from little-to-no AI to trying to become \"AI native,\" a term that's curiously hard to pin down. Large language models are popping up everywhere in white-collar work as companies chase the promise of efficiency gains.\n\nAmplitude's case may be especially informative, given just how skeptical of AI its CEO was. In 2023 and some of 2024, Skates said he viewed the AI industry as full of \"grifters,\" the visionaries promising to end world hunger and salesmen promising to automate everything.\n\n\"It had all sorts of problems,\" Skates said. By mid-2024, he realized \"there's probably going to be a breakthrough in the analytics space in the next two or three years.\"\n\n\"We've got to go make that ourselves,\" he said. \"So, we went all in.\"\n\nSkates had two opening moves for his AI overhaul.\n\nThe first: hiring a new chief engineering officer with a history in AI. Wade Chambers had advised the company since 2016, while holding leadership roles at Twitter and Included Health.\n\nWhen Chambers joined in October 2024, only 1% of the engineering, product, and design teams at Amplitude were using AI.\n\nThe second was the acquisition of Command AI, a chatbot startup. It was the first of a string of acquisitions, including June, Kraftful, and Inari. Amplitude announced its most recent acquisition, InfiniGrow, on January 14.\n\nYana Welinder was CEO of Kraftful, one of Amplitude's acquisition targets. Kraftful could spot power users of its product, one of whom was Amplitude's then-CPO. She reached out, and they chatted in February. The deal closed in July, and Welinder was named Amplitude's head of AI. A company blog post with an introductory Q&A referred to her as \"AI maven.\"\n\nWelinder's first order of business: speeding the company up. Kraftful shipped new product every week. Amplitude was shipping less than monthly.\n\n\"If you have this cadence of shipping infrequently, then the team slows down, which isn't appropriate in the age of AI,\" she said.\n\n\"Analytics will look very different 6 months from now,\" Skates wrote in his email. \"We have the opportunity to be the AI native company in Analytics and we are going to pull every piece of firepower we have.\"\n\nHe also asked employees to share a coming launch on X, as opposed to LinkedIn, because that's \"where the AI natives are.\"\n\nHow much has Amplitude spent on AI, from tools to acquisitions? \"Tens of millions, for sure,\" Skates said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it got past $100 million.\"\n\nThen comes the harder part: convincing employees to really use the tools.\n\nWhile some engineers are excited about AI's promise, others are skeptical about its helpfulness, or worried about possible job losses. Not every engineer is as gung ho about AI as their management is.\n\nSkates said that engineers were especially sensitive to the \"grifting\" that went on in AI, making many of them skeptical. With a bottoms-up approach, that skepticism dissipates, he said.\n\nSoon after joining, Chambers began planning an \"AI week\" for the first week of June. It took six months of prep and borrowed heavily from Facebook's mobile push. He took the entire engineering, product, and design team offline for the week. To kick off, Chambers required that leaders get onstage and vibe-code something in front of the entire company.\n\n\"It didn't go well,\" Chambers said of the live vibe-coding demonstration. \"They had to work through it. They had to re-prompt a couple of different ways.\"\n\nBut the message stuck, he said. Leaders who weren't coding all day were able to build something \"pretty cool\" within the hourlong session, save a few hiccups.\n\nAdditional momentum came from the \"zealots,\" engineers passionate about exploring the new tech (some of whom Chambers brought over from his prior job). These engineers lead by example, he said.\n\nAmplitude shared its internal data tracking how many employees use its AI tools. In the final week of March, 14 employees were actively using Cursor. That figure peaked in the first week of December — after AI week but before the holiday vacation cycle — at 174 employees.\n\nAnd what of the thorny question about AI implementation in the enterprise: ROI? After all, a 2025 MIT study indicated 95% of firms publicly disclosing use of AI pilots reported no measurable ROI.\n\nAfter implementing these tools, developer productivity shot up 40% and stayed there, Chambers said. On some specific engineering teams, those gains looks more like 300-400%, he said.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people who are thinking they're the world's best expert at something,\" Chambers said. \"Increasingly, even the most cynical team members have come around.\"",

    "description": "80-year-old Robin Blair runs his family's greengrocer's, founded in 1875. He started helping in the business at age 5 and says he will never retire.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with greengrocer Robin Blair, 80, the owner of JJ Blair & Sons in Darlington, in the North-East of England. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWe have an old saying in our family: \"There are two chairs that will kill you in life — the electric chair and the armchair.\"\n\nCapital punishment won't apply to me, or at least I hope not! And there's no way I'll retire to put my feet up and sit in front of the TV.\n\nIt's not in my nature, or my blood. My father, Joe, worked in our greengrocery, founded in 1875, until he was in his nineties.\n\nYou could say I joined the trade when I was a few months old in 1940. We're based at an indoor market, and my mother would tuck me under the counter while she served the customers.\n\nYou were expected to help at the nursery almost as soon as you could walk. By the time I was 5, I'd be sowing seeds, planting cabbage, and looking after tomatoes.\n\nMy siblings and I — including my younger brother, Keith, my business partner until he died in 2013 — were given our own plot of land to work.\n\nWe were allowed to keep the proceeds. I used to grow vegetables with an easy return, like lettuce, because they matured quickly. There was a friendly rivalry among us kids over who made the biggest profit.\n\nI couldn't wait to leave school at 15 and work full-time, even though it was physically demanding at times. We grew everything ourselves until we began moving toward wholesale.\n\nYou spent the morning harvesting and washing the produce. Then you'd load up the wooden cart and our trusty horse, Bobby, would pull it three-and-a-half miles to the market.\n\nMy grandfather, Jack, who established JJ Blair & Sons 150 years ago, was a proud man and wouldn't let Bobby leave without polishing his harness. Neither he nor my dad would dream of having a mechanical vehicle. Everything was horse-drawn.\n\nBack then, the market ran from 3 p.m. to midnight. The manager would ring a bell at 9 p.m., signaling that you could start auctioning the stuff you had left over.\n\nIt was fun shouting out your wares to attract the highest bidder. There was no refrigeration in those days, and you'd take the leftovers back to the nursery to compost.\n\nOur motto was \"More flash, more cash,\" meaning that the better the produce appeared, the more money you made. I still live by that rule.\n\nThe apples gleam on our stand, and the bananas are at the right stage of ripeness. We grow our own soft fruits in our greenhouses, including strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. They always look delicious.\n\nI also pride myself on writing the signs that show the prices, both in pounds, ounces, and kilograms. The letters are spelled out nicely. It's a bit like doing calligraphy.\n\nThe glory days were the 1960s, 70s, and much of the 80s. The indoor and outdoor markets were bustling with nearly 200 stands. They were right in the center of town, a hub of activity.\n\nThen the big supermarkets came along. It changed everything. They're fighting among themselves over pricing, undercutting us, and it's hard to compete. People like the ease of going to them, especially with the free parking.\n\nStill, we have many loyal customers. Sadly, we're the only greengrocers left in the market today. Shoppers come for the fresh produce, the personal service, and the lively conversation.\n\nA strong work ethic was instilled in me as a child, and I have no problem getting up at 4:30 a.m. daily to prepare for the market, which opens at 8 a.m.\n\nI usually get back to the nursery around 3 p.m., where we also grow bedding plants. My working day can last until 8 or even 10 p.m. in the summer, to take advantage of the lighter nights.\n\nThis trade has given me a better life than I could have hoped for. I wish Keith were still here, but I'm delighted to be running the business at 80.\n\nIt makes me sad to think what might happen after I'm gone. When I ask my daughter, Alyson, if she'll continue in the family tradition, she'll laugh and say, \"Never say never.\"\n\nMeanwhile, my long-suffering wife, Alwyn, keeps me happy and healthy, and I keep a positive outlook. It's my 81st birthday in May, and I plan to keep going for years after then.\n\nDo you have a story about working a job longer than most? Please email Jane Ridley at jridley@businessinsider.com",

    "description": "Kyle Elliott, a career coach for tech employees, told Business Insider clients can vent to the wrong people when they're dealing with a difficult boss.",
    "fullText": "Kyle Elliott, who's been a full-time career coach since 2017, spends his days helping tech employees solve their most challenging work issues.\n\nHe's noticed a common problem among clients: difficult bosses, including micromanagers.\n\nOne key mistake employees make when they're trying to fix a problem, Elliot told Business Insider, is venting to the wrong person — particularly your boss.\n\nIt makes sense to push back against a difficult boss when their behaviour or expectations are disrupting your work, said Elliot, who is based in California. But venting to them will rarely make the situation better, but nearly always damage trust, he added.\n\nEven if you have a good relationship, it would be more appropriate to vent to a friend, family member, or career coach. They can also help you brainstorm solutions.\n\n\"Your boss is not your therapist. You want to come to them with solutions, or at least a clear sense of how they can help you improve the situation or the working relationship,\" he said. \"If you want a promotion, you want your boss to view you as someone who is thoughtful and solution-oriented, not someone who complains.\"\n\nWhen you organize the feedback session with a difficult boss, choose a private setting, such as in a 1-1 meeting, and interlace constructive feedback with positive remarks about things they do that you like.\n\nAnother common issue Elliott encounters is clients misusing their time with him by ranting about their struggles with their boss and what's frustrating them, he said.\n\n\"They often believe they must provide extensive context in order to receive effective coaching, but this isn't true,\" he said.\n\n\"You can vent,\" Elliot added, but \"it's a very expensive venting session.\" While it may feel cathartic, you're better off airing your frustrations to a friend and using your paid coaching session to outline what you can change, such as what battles with your boss to choose, or how to communicate better with them.\n\n\"Coaching is about empowering you, not venting about your manager. Your boss isn't in the coaching session. You are,\" he said.\n\nRead more of Elliott's tips for dealing with a difficult boss.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're reflecting on BI's week at the World Economic Forum in Davos.",
    "fullText": "The global elite of Davos probably isn't what you think of when you think about spunky Business Insider. But we sent a small editorial team to bring you the best of it — BI-style — and I want to tell you about it.\n\nAki Ito is our chief correspondent on careers, a huge topic for Davos — and for us. She asked people across business tough questions about the future of work (believe me, I was in the room) to help bring insights for your success. She also moderated a conversation with chief people officers from companies across the business world. You'll see her takeaways from that soon.\n\nBen Bergman on tech, same thing. Ben is a leading scoop-getter and thinker on our crackerjack tech team. We know you care about tech from every angle — innovation, work, investments, culture, productivity hacks, fun. Ben was all over town meeting with people and moderating panels so that we can be in-the-know on what's in and what's out for you. You might have caught Ben on CNN twice last week!\n\nDan DeFrancesco is the lead writer on this newsletter every weekday. As you know, it's a smart, witty read across tech, markets, and business — the opposite of aggregation that's common in newsletters. So it's important for us to make sure Dan has the widest view of what's going on in the world. As he hustled around, Dan also wrote our new pop-up Davos Diary newsletter every day last week. We hope to do more special editions to meet these moments!\n\nKim Last leads our live journalism — events like panels and conferences IRL, and live conversations online. We put on three events at Davos, convening some of the most interesting and in-the-flow people on the mountain. We'll keep you informed of what's on our calendar, as conversing with the audience we're serving is a top priority at BI right now. (Kim also got a now-famous hair blowout at the start of the week — Davos hack!)\n\nWe know not everyone can make it across the world. That's why, in addition to the special newsletter, we did a daily live blog, bringing you everything from the serious to the wacky. Across last week, we did 180 posts, not just from the five of us, but from reporters and editors who did an excellent job following the chatter from around the world. Those blogs, and our wrap post, are available here.\n\nWhat about me? I was there doing the Davos thing — meetings, moderations. But I also made a point to snap some photos of the fabulous fashion. You can find all that we gathered on that fun front here.\n\nAll of which is to say, we dive into the biggest things happening in the world, in our style, for you.\n\nPlease stay in touch at eic@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "I recently launched Trivet, and I've enjoyed seeing people install it on websites ranging from personal homepages to business blogs.\n\nBefore AI, Trivet would have taken me a few weeks to build. Now, Codex wrote the first version in 40 minutes.\n\nIn the past, building software was so difficult that launching something was impressive in and of itself. But as things get easier to build, it's harder to stand out. Code has become content - abundant, disposable, something you produce rather than labor over. We've transitioned from \"make something people want\" to \"make anything you want\".\n\nFor example, I'll open-source the theme powering this site. A few years ago, this would have represented a lot of work. There would have been utility for people making their own templates. Instead, today it's a footnote - a curiosity for those who want to \"view source\" on this website and see how it works.\n\nAs a maker, AI enables me to build more and faster than I ever could have dreamed. But projects are no longer the investment they used to be. I find myself with decision fatigue - I ask \"what should I build next?\" every few days, instead of every few months. In the age of AI, it's harder to think of a \"big project\" to work on slowly in my free time.\n\nWith code getting easier, I find myself thinking more about data. My old coworker Jason posted a video about using Claude Code to organize his notes. There's so much useful knowledge spread out across many sources. People know Claude for writing code, but its superpower is searching and understanding thousands of files.\n\nWhen I went to Japan last year, I wanted to ask \"what is every Tokyo coffee shop and jazz kissa mentioned on craigmod.com,\" but I couldn't. That desire led me to build Contraption MCP - so I could have a research agent over my writing. The first time I used it and got a real answer synthesized from years of posts, it felt like a new kind of utility - a digital proprioception enabling me to fluidly navigate and explore my writing.\n\nExploring information is still a hard problem in the age of AI. MCP is useful, but more of a technical protocol. \"RSS for AI,\" as Stan summarized to me.\n\nThe next project I'm contemplating is codenamed \"Bell\" — a search agent for this blog, built on top of the Contraption MCP. I want it to be more accessible than raw MCP: something you can use in a browser, drawing on a variety of sources. It could answer questions like \"which craft-focused books are mentioned on this blog,\" but also \"how does subscriber export work on Postcard.\" Part of the motivation for Bell is building software for myself. But, the other part is continuing to explore the future of digital tools through making projects.\n\nSo, what should I build next? Two things feel true: we should default to building for ourselves, and understanding our own data is where some hard problems now live.\n\nI think the widespread impulse to take a photo of everything is in fact, at root, a creative one. It reflects a desire to not just receive life passively, but to intervene in it creatively: To frame the shot, to find the most compelling angle, to draw out the emotion, to honor the light… to participate.\n\n- This life gives you nothing, Blackbird Spyplane",

    "title": "Should I Form an LLC or Register a Domain First?",
    "description": "Not sure if you should claim a domain or form your LLC first? Use our guide to prioritize these goals for your unique business needs.",
    "fullText": "Starting a business—and not sure if you should get a domain or form your LLC first? Dive into our guide to learn how these steps are connected, and which to prioritize first for your unique business needs.\n\nDeciding whether to register a domain or form an LLC first can feel like a chicken-and-egg situation. In reality, it’s just a matter of balancing competing priorities. You need to secure a legal business name with the state (where options may be limited) and snag a domain name that’s short, easy to remember, and on brand for your business (also no small feat). Should your business name and domain name match? And which name should you prioritize at the beginning stages of starting a business?\n\nWe have answers. In this guide, we’ll help you vanquish indecision and get on the track to starting a business with a great website.\n\nYour business name is what appears on official paperwork you file with the state. The state usually has specific requirements about words that must be included in your name based on the type of business you’re running. For example, many states require LLCs to include an abbreviation like “LLC” or even the phrase “Limited Liability Company.” This is considered the legal name of your business.\n\nYour domain name is what people type into their browser’s address bar when they want to visit your website. It does not have to include identifying words like “LLC.” In fact, there’s no requirement for it to match your business name at all. Domain names can only use letters, numbers, and hyphens.\n\nThere’s no requirement—legal or otherwise—for your business name and your domain name to match. That’s because your business name and your domain name serve two very different purposes.\n\nYour business name is your entity’s legal name. You’ll use it to do legal stuff, like enter into contracts, open business bank accounts, and pay taxes.\n\nYour domain name, on the other hand, serves as the web address for your company. It’s what people who come across your business online—on social media or via search engines—will associate with your business.\n\nBoth names are key parts of your business’s brand—a fancy marketing term that really just means the personality or identity of your business. You’ll want to choose the business name and a domain name that best serve these two functions. This means your domain name and business name may or may not match.\n\nThis is a slightly different question, and the answer is complicated. In some cases, it’s best for your domain name and business name to match—or at least get as close as possible. But many businesses use a completely different domain name than company name. Here, we’ll break down a few scenarios.\n\nWhen your business name and domain name shouldn’t match:\n\nWhen your business name and domain name should match (or get close):\n\nIf you’ve determined your business name and your domain name should more or less match, but your the domain name that matches your business name isn’t for sale, you have a few options. You can:\n\nSuppose you buy a domain name that doesn’t match your business name. After some time, you find that you actually like your domain name more than your business name. In fact, you’d like to do all your business—not just the online side—under your domain name.\n\nIn that case, you don’t have to form a whole new LLC or change your LLC’s name. You just need to register a DBA (doing business as) name with the state. A DBA is like a nickname for your business, and filing one is usually pretty inexpensive (depending on where you live).\n\nRemember that registering a DBA is not the same as registering a legal entity—a DBA affords you no liability protection.\n\nSo should you register a domain or form an LLC first? Like other aspects of your business, there’s no single answer that applies to all businesses and situations. Here’s a list of questions and considerations worth keeping in mind as you work through your decision.\n\nLet’s say you’re starting a business that only sells items or services online and does not have a brick-and-mortar location. In this case, the success of your business depends on your online presence and branding, and a solid domain name is a key part of that. You should secure a domain name first and worry about naming your business second.\n\nHow do you find out if a domain name is available? Go to any domain registrar – like domainregistry.com – and type in the domain name you’re seeking. You’ll get an answer in seconds.\n\nA brick-and-mortar business may find that deciding on a business name and forming an LLC first makes the most sense. To find out if your desired LLC name is available, visit your state’s secretary of state’s website. There, you’ll find a database of all the businesses registered in your state, and you can search to see if your desired name is available.\n\nIf someone’s already claimed your name, you’ll need to find an alternate one. The good news is that when you do form an LLC, you’ll prevent anyone else in your state from coming along and using the exact same business entity name.\n\nAn LLC is a type of business entity. When you form an LLC you gain liability protection in the separation of your business assets from your personal assets. That keeps someone from claiming personal assets (like your home) in a lawsuit they file against your LLC.\n\nThere are some businesses that will need liability protection sooner than others. For instance, any establishment that serves food has to worry about customers getting food poisoning or having allergic reactions. A gym has to worry about people getting hurt while doing deadlifts. A miniature golf course has to worry about golfers getting boinked in the head by a runaway golf ball. However, a freelance writer may find that they’re willing to put off getting liability protection until after their website goes live.\n\nDon’t wait. You can buy a domain name, then park it for a while before you turn it into a professional website for your business. Buying a domain and holding off on developing it fully is a common practice known as domain parking. Because you’ll be competing for a good domain name with people around the world and not just in your home state, you don’t want to snooze on an opportunity you might not have again.",

    "fullText": "We recently published 10 Stocks Delivering Double-Digit Gains Effortlessly; 4 Hit Highs. Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) was one of the best performers on Thursday.\n\nPlug Power snapped a two-day losing streak on Thursday, jumping 16.67 percent to close at $2.59 apiece, as investors loaded portfolios ahead a special shareholders’ meeting next week.\n\nIn a notice to its investors, Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said that it would hold a special meeting at 10 AM on Thursday, January 29, to vote on two company proposals, including increasing its authorized capital stock to 3 billion from 1.5 billion at present.\n\nPlug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said the capital stock increase was necessary to meet its financial obligations, maintain operating flexibility, and continue executing its business plan.\n\nShould shareholders reject the said initiative, Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) said that it would implement a reverse stock split in order to create sufficient share availability to meet its financial obligations and maintain business flexibility.\n\nIt would also seek approval of the shareholders to modernize voting standards by aligning the company’s charter with current Delaware corporate law. If approved, such an amendment would allow certain future charter amendments to be approved by a majority of votes cast, where permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL).\n\n“This change ensures that outcomes are determined by the stockholders who actively participate in the voting process, rather than by shares that are not voted at all. Under the Company’s current charter, shares that are not voted effectively have the same impact as votes cast against a proposal, which can prevent proposals from passing even when a clear majority of voting stockholders support them,” it said.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of PLUG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

    "fullText": "Most people dream about winning the lottery. But for one 29-year-old man, his $15 million windfall came with a side of guilt, entitlement, and a family-sized headache.\n\nIn a post shared on Reddit, the anonymous winner explained that his financial plans were anything but reckless. He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "description": "The Austin push is planned for February, insiders told Business Insider. Tesla has been training Optimus in its Fremont factory for more than a year.",
    "fullText": "Tesla appears to be getting closer to deploying Optimus in its factories — and Austin is the next training ground.\n\nTesla told workers during a town hall last week that it plans to begin collecting data to train its humanoid robot at its Austin Gigafactory, insiders told Business Insider.\n\nThe company is looking to train Optimus how to operate in the Texas facility, it said, adding that it was targeting a February start date.\n\nTesla has been collecting data and training Optimus prototypes in its Fremont, California, factory for more than a year.\n\nThe Optimus data collectors in Fremont are typically kept separate from the general factory workers to avoid interfering with output, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nThere, data collectors have recorded themselves organizing vehicle parts and working on conveyor belts, Business Insider previously reported. The videos are then used to teach Optimus how to mimic the same movements.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said during an interview at Davos on Thursday that Tesla has the humanoid robot doing \"simple tasks\" in its factory, though he didn't specify which.\n\n\"By the end of this year I think they'll be doing more complex tasks but still deployed in an industrial environment,\" he said. \"By the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public.\"\n\nHe warned earlier this week in a post on X that production of Optimus — and the company's Cybercab, which will be produced in Austin — will be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla has been sharing sneak peeks of Optimus' capabilities since the product was first announced in 2021. In 2024, the automaker posted a video that showed the robot arranging batteries while tied to an overhead support structure at the company's lab in Palo Alto. The company said that it deployed two autonomous Optimus robots in one of its factories in 2024.\n\nTesla employs several dozen Optimus trainers. The company's factory workers, who number in the thousands, could be an ideal group to help train the robot due to their expertise and workforce size.\n\nLast year, Tesla moved from primarily training the robot using teleoperation to collecting video data — a strategy that could help the carmaker rapidly collect larger amounts of data without the constraints of motion capture suits, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTesla's Optimus trainers are outfitted with large helmets with cameras that point in several directions. The helmet is attached to a heavy backpack, which can be unwieldy at times. Tesla has experimented with a lighter fanny pack setup, but it's unclear if the company plans to use it in factory data collection, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nMusk has pitched Optimus as the \"biggest product of all time.\" He's said the humanoid robot could be the solution to everything from housework and factory work to operating data centers in outer space.\n\nThe town hall also covered non-Optimus developments. The company is working on updating several production lines and construction will continue to be ongoing at the factory.\n\nOver the past year, the carmaker has repeatedly slashed production hours for its Cybertruck line and moved workers to the Model Y line amid lackluster sales numbers for the electric pickup truck.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "title": "10 Shows Like 'Landman' You Should Should Watch Next",
    "description": "More slick dramas filled with family feuds and shady business dealings.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Sheridan and Billy Bob Thornton are such a natural pairing that it's not at all surprising that Landman has been yet another hit for the creator behind Yellowstone and it's many spin-offs. Thornton plays Billy Norris, a crackerjack consultant, fixer, and general hired gun for a major oil conglomerate in present-day West Texas. Beyond the complicated economics and politics of the oil industry, the poor guy's also dealing with extremely complicated family drama, debt, criminal ties, and substance-abuse issues. Call it Dallas for a new generation.\n\nYou can stream Landman on Paramount+, and check out these similar shows after your binge is complete.\n\nAnother Taylor Sheridan creation, this one stars Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky, head of a family that’s been keeping the peace, more or less, in the title's company town for decades. The \"business\" of the corrupt burg just happens to be incarceration, and the McLuskys thrive when business is up, even if Mike himself has slightly different ideas about how to run things. The show deals, at least broadly, with systemic racism and inequality in the prison system, but mostly it's a modern day western about bringing justice to a corrupt town. Stream Mayor of Kingstown on Paramount+.\n\nIt's tempting to direct you back to the original series' 14-season run, but that one's a harder to stream—and besides, this direct continuation is still pretty fun. Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and Larry Hagman (as the original's J.R.) are all back, joined by a new generation lead by Josh Henderson, Jesse Metcalf, and Jordana Brewster. They're every bit as scheming, conniving, horny, and oil obsessed as their parents. Stream Dallas on Tubi.\n\nThe Taylor Sheridan drama that launched an empire, as well as a thousand spin-offs (well, seven, including those in development). The Dutton family of Montana, owners of the largest cattle ranch in the state, deal with family and political drama—a bit like a modern Dallas, but with the vibes of HBO’s Succession. Though the main series ended after five seasons, mostly to accommodate the departure of Kevin Costner, there's plenty more to explore in the past and future of the Yellowstone universe. Stream Yellowstone on Peacock.\n\nTerrence Howard leads a truly impressive cast (among them Taraji P. Henson, Gabourey Sidibe, and Vivica A. Fox) in this juicy, glossy, hip-hop infused soap opera. Howard plays Lucious Jackson (neé drug dealer Dwight Walker), who changed his own fortunes by building Empire Entertainment from the ground up. As the series begins, the music mogul is diagnosed with ALS and given a life expectancy of only a few more years. Refusing to watch his life's work die, he sets his three sons at odds to determine who’ll be the one to control things when he’s gone. His schemes are complicated by the release from prison of Cookie Lyon (Henson), the co-founder of the company and Jackson’s ex-wife. As the kids say: drama! There's a little bit of Dallas and a little bit of Succession (which Empire predates) here, sharing with those shows and Landman the whole family dynasty thing, but with hip-hop rather than black gold. Stream Empire on Hulu and Tubi.\n\nIf the pull of Landman is Billy Bob Thornton as a complicated anti-hero with substance abuse issues, this David E. Kelley legal drama will work just fine as a streamalike, even in the absence of oil wells. Here, Thornton plays Billy McBride, a once-successful lawyer who left the firm he built after a murder suspect he'd gotten acquitted went on to kill his family. After a long run of doing not much other than drinking, he's drawn back into the fray when a dead man's sister asks for his help on a case involving his old firm, a major corporation, and some very crooked cops. Stream Goliath on Prime Video.\n\nAmerican TV shows tend to view the wealthy with nuance, even when they're engaged in overtly criminal behavior. South Korean creators, on the other hand, have no problem criticizing the 1% (Parasite and Squid Game are hardly outliers), particularly the plutocratic chaebol families who control huge portions of the country’s economy. The minseries Mine centers the women who are jockeying for control of the massive, fictional Hyowon Group from within their family’s outrageously opulent (and extremely photogenic) residential compound. The plans of two increasingly powerful women who married into the family, Hi-soo and Seo-hyun, are thrown into disarray when the new housemaid begins a romantic relationship with one of the male heirs, while a new tutor seems ready to expose old family secrets. It’s very much a Dynasty-style soap opera, with various family members crawling over each other seeking control and a sense of identity. Stream Mine on Netflix.\n\nSwapping big-time oil for a family fishing business may seem like a big leap, but we've still got plenty of crime and drugs in this Netflix series. Holt McCallany plays Harlan Buckley, returning to manage the family business, one which is tied up with multiple dueling drug cartels, as well as unreliable family members and at least one (Supergirl's Melissa Benoist) who's looking to escape her own legal problems by working with the FBI against her father and brother. Stream The Waterfront on Netflix.\n\nA vibe match that, while it doesn't replicate Landman's family and business drama, still runs with the neo-western feel that defines a Taylor Sheridan show. Michael Dorman stars as Joe Pickett, a Wyoming game warden with a violent past and, well, a violent present too. Dorman's Pickett is less of a tough action hero type, and more of a likable, everyday guy who just happens to be wrapped up in a murder via his day job. It’s not a comedy, but is definitely a bit weirder and more surreal than the more literal style of something like Landman, which lacks flourishes like Pickett's memorable emu wrestling scene. Stream Joe Pickett on Paramount+.\n\nAnother intense family business drama with a dash of a succession crisis: In Queen Sugar, three largely estranged siblings in distant cities are brought together by the death of their father, who has left them each an equal share in an 800-acre sugarcane farm in rural Louisiana. The Ava DuVernay-produced (and sometimes directed) series offers plenty of scandal and soapy drama, but ultimately, it’s a show about a family coming back together to preserve its legacy. The siblings (Rutina Wesley, Dawn-Lyen Gardner, and Kofi Siriboe) are a bit less gritty and troubled than the Norris family (they're mostly trying to do the right thing), but they still generate enough drama to fuel seven successful seasons. Stream Queen Sugar on Hulu.\n\nThe popularity of Taylor Sheridan-esque neo-westerns leads us, inevitably, to something closer to an actual western. In this series, adapting Philipp Meyer's 2013 Pulitzer Prize-finalist novel of the same name, Pierce Brosnan plays Eli McCullough, a ruthless cattle baron making moves to get in on the burgeoning oil industry in the Rio Grande Valley of 1915. A parallel narrative sees Eli as a young man, kidnapped and raised among a Nʉmʉnʉʉ family. While his backstory lends the character welcome complexity, in the present, he's as determined to build his empire as he is to prepare his son and grandson to take over when he's gone. Stream The Son on Prime Video and AMC+.",

    "fullText": "Jan 23 (Reuters) - Netflix (NFLX) co-chief executive Greg Peters said the company is on track to win the ​backing of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) shareholders for its $82.7 ‌billion offer for the company's film and television studios, adding that Paramount's (PSKY) rival ‌bid \"doesn't pass the sniff test\", the Financial Times reported on Friday.\n\nIn an interview with the FT, Peters said only a \"very small\" number of WBD shares had been tendered in support ⁠of Paramount's hostile $108 ‌billion offer for the entire company.\n\nNetflix, Warner Brothers and Paramount Skydance didn't immediately respond to Reuters ‍requests for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nPeters said the revised offer had \"greater deal certainty\" than Paramount's bid, partly financed with $55 billion in ​debt, and underscored the strength of Netflix's balance sheet, ‌the newspaper added.\n\nThe Warner Bros board earlier this month rejected an amended Paramount bid that included a $40 billion in equity, personally guaranteed by Oracle's co-founder and Paramount CEO David Ellison's father, Larry Ellison.\n\n\"Without Larry Ellison independently financing this thing, ⁠there's no chance in hell ​Paramount would ever be able to ​pull this off,\" Peters told FT.\n\nParamount Skydance on Thursday extended the deadline on its hostile tender offer ‍for Warner ⁠Bros Discovery to February 20, soon after Netflix revised its $82.7 billion offer to go all-cash in hopes of ⁠expediting the deal closure and providing greater financial certainty to investors worried ‌about its previous stock-and-cash deal.",

    "fullText": "US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over private share sale that values business at $800bn\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly lining up four Wall Street banks to help the company list on the stock market as investors prepare for an expected rush of US tech listings.\n\nSpaceX is considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in an initial public offering, according to the Financial Times and Reuters.\n\nThe US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over a private share sale that values the business at $800bn (£591bn), months after it was valued at $400bn. Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.\n\nLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.\n\nReports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. The potential IPOs have been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms and datacentres into orbit.\n\nReferring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AI IPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?\n\n“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and SpaceX were approached for comment.",

    "description": "TikTok CEO Shou Chew sent a memo to staff celebrating the \"good news\" that the company had finalized a deal to keep its business operating in the US.",
    "fullText": "The TikTok divestment deal is done, and the company's CEO is jubilant.\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok's top boss, Shou Chew, sent a message to US staffers, toasting the \"great news\" and thanking them for their \"resilience.\"\n\nHe also announced that \"more than 200 million Americans now come to TikTok to be entertained, learn, and grow their business with a broader global community.\"\n\nChew has good reason to take a victory lap.\n\nAfter battling for the company's survival for over a year and a half, TikTok now has confidence it will avoid a US ban after its owner ByteDance sold off enough of its business to meet the demands of a 2024 sell-or-ban law.\n\nThe deal is a major win for TikTok and ByteDance, which will be able to continue operating in the US without having to disconnect US users from the rest of the world. The arrangement is also a victory for TikTok's new US investors, a hodgepodge of investment firms and individuals like Michael Dell, who get a stake in a fast-growing business.\n\nThe deal involved setting up a joint venture with an investor consortium that now owns just over 80% of the new US entity. The group, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX, is tasked with securing US user data, content moderation, and trust and safety.\n\nByteDance, meanwhile, gets around 20% ownership in the new venture. It will also maintain control of key TikTok business lines, such as e-commerce, marketing, and advertising. The company is splitting up its US employees into different entities based on whether they'll stay under ByteDance's wing or work for the new joint venture, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.\n\nThe closing of the joint venture agreement is the culmination of a half-decade saga for TikTok, which initially faced the prospect of a ban in 2020 under President Donald Trump's first administration. The court blocked Trump's efforts to ban TikTok, but the app was targeted again in a 2024 law known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nTikTok lost its legal challenge to the law in the Supreme Court a year ago, and it was only able to continue operating in 2025 due to a series of executive orders from Trump, who chose to preserve TikTok rather than destroy it.\n\nMoving forward, Chew will continue to run TikTok globally, while trust and safety executive Adam Presser will oversee the US joint venture. TikTok staffers will need to \"continue to follow data privacy, content assurance, code compliance, and trust and safety protocols\" that were already in place, Chew wrote in his memo.\n\nI am pleased to update you with some great news.\n\nToday, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC has been established in compliance with the Executive Order signed by President Trump on September 25, 2025, enabling our US users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok's vibrant global community and experience.\n\nAs we take this significant step forward, I am proud to share that today more than 200 million Americans now come to TikTok to be entertained, learn, and grow their business with a broader global community. We are grateful for the incredible support of our user base, and the unwavering dedication and resilience of our employees that has allowed us to continue delivering at a high level.\n\nTikTok's growth in the US nicely sets up the Joint Venture for strong future success. The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users. It will be led by Adam Presser who, today, has been chosen by the Joint Venture's Board of Directors for his impressive track record with the company leading large-scale teams in the areas of Trust & Safety and Operations. Please find more details on today's news here.\n\nInteroperability will be critical in enabling users and creators to have the same global experience that they know and love, and for the 7.5 million US businesses to continue to thrive on TikTok by reaching customers around the world. To ensure this continuity for our users, new subsidiaries including \"TT Commerce & Global Services LLC,\" have been created to manage global product interoperability as well as commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\n\nTo date, we have provided compliance training for all TikTok employees. Going forward when working with the newly created USDS JV, I expect everyone to continue to follow data privacy, content assurance, code compliance, and trust and safety protocols.\n\nI thank you all for the tireless work you do every single day in fulfilling our mission to inspire creativity and bring joy.",

    "title": "7 mistakes you should never make during a job interview, according to a business-etiquette expert",
    "description": "The etiquette expert advises against leaving your camera off during virtual interviews, dressing too casually, and using filler words or slang.",
    "fullText": "For many, job interviews can be a nerve-racking experience. Even with proper preparation, it's common to struggle with this important step in the hiring process.\n\nTo help you avoid common mistakes, Business Insider asked business-etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore about the things candidates should avoid doing during an interview. Here's what she said.\n\nWhitmore told BI that a simple but common mistake candidates make is arriving to the interview unprepared.\n\n\"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media,\" she said. \"There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"\n\nWhitmore also said it's important to ask the interviewer questions tailored specifically to the company.\n\nAccording to Whitmore, dressing too casually is another common mistake she sees interviewees make.\n\n\"Very rarely do we see someone overdressed for a job interview,\" she said. \"They oftentimes don't put a lot of thought into the details, like the color of their belt or that their shoes are matching their outfit.\"\n\nWhitmore told BI that even when candidates do wear office-friendly attire, they may overlook other key details, like forgetting to cut off the tags or not cutting open the vents in the back.\n\n\"Why would an employer want to hire someone who doesn't pay attention to the details?\" Whitmore asked.\n\nBefore stepping into a job interview, it's important to consider how you're presenting yourself online, especially since Whitmore said the first thing an employer will likely do is Google you.\n\n\"They'll look at all your social media pages. They'll look at what you eat, what you drink, what you wear, who you hang out with, what your lifestyle is — and they make judgments,\" she told BI.\n\nFor that reason, Whitmore suggested adjusting your privacy settings and cleaning up your social media presence to eliminate anything that could be used against you.\n\nWhen in a job interview, Whitmore told BI that candidates should never use inappropriate language, such as profanity, slang, or terminology the employer might not understand.\n\nShe also said to be cautious of filler words and phrases such as \"like\" or \"um\" to avoid muddling the conversation.\n\nWhitmore suggested recording yourself before the interview or practicing ahead of time to ensure you're speaking clearly and precisely.\n\nOne mistake to avoid in virtual interviews is refusing to turn your camera on.\n\nCandidates may choose to keep their cameras off for a number of reasons, such as being worried about making eye contact or feeling uncomfortable with face-to-face interaction. However, Whitmore said keeping the camera on is a good idea so the employer can see your facial expressions.\n\nShe added that candidates should be wary of what their background looks like and make sure their room appears tidy.\n\n\"If you just have to have a blank wall, that's better than a huge distraction. But I definitely recommend that you put a little thought into your background,\" she said.\n\n\"Showing up late for an interview is a huge no-no,\" Whitmore said. \"I've always said when you're on time, you're still late. You should show up early.\"\n\nArriving early ensures you have enough time to find parking or the meeting room. Whitmore added that doing so also allows you to use the restroom and gain your composure before the interview starts.\n\nSending a thank you note is an important step in the interview process.\n\n\"I go overboard. I send a thank you email and a thank you note because this is an opportunity for you to get into the employer's eyes at least twice,\" Whitmore told BI.\n\nBe sure to follow up within 24 hours of the interview and personalize the note.\n\n\"Address the person by name. Tell them why you enjoyed the interview and why you would be a good candidate,\" Whitmore said.\n\nIf you're feeling stuck, she suggested writing out a note and using an AI tool like ChatGPT to polish it.\n\nThis story was originally published on January 14, 2025, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "description": "Business Insider tested Tesla's Full Self-Driving system and found it a highly capable driver assistance feature. Full autonomy will be a game changer.",
    "fullText": "Two things can be true of Tesla's Full Self-Driving: It's an impressive piece of technology, and it still doesn't go far enough.\n\nFSD is Tesla's big bet. CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights.\n\nToday, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. The promise is to advance FSD enough to make the system unsupervised — meaning the driver behind the wheel can take their eyes off the road or even fall asleep. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle.\n\nThe gap between what the tech can do and what it can't is where my experience landed.\n\nI recently demoed a 2025 Tesla Model 3 that came installed with FSD v14.2.1, the latest software version available at the time.\n\nWith my friend riding shotgun, I drove around the East Bay Area, taking the Model 3 through various road environments, including a university campus, parking lots, and the highway, on a clear Saturday afternoon.\n\nFSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system.\n\nI drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway.\n\nOne was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.\n\nThe system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.\n\nFSD's \"Mad Max\" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. Calling it \"Mad Max\" feels a little gratuitous, but I appreciate that a more urgent driving mode is available.\n\nAt no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.\n\nMy friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a \"spaceship.\" That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be.\n\nI gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley.\n\nThe car kept driving for a bit, but I was inevitably warned to pay attention to the road.\n\nAs good as FSD is, the technology doesn't allow you to completely disengage mentally. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. The technology is — or at least feels — so, so close.\n\nPeople who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders.\n\nI agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic.\n\nThe problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The drive is mostly a straight shot. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway.\n\nI obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS?\n\nFSD feels like the burden of driving was just shifted away from my hands and feet to my attention.\n\nMusk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system.\n\nThat would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nI'm likely spoiled because I know what full autonomy feels like.\n\nI have constant access to Waymo. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking.\n\nThat's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised.\n\nI'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.\n\nTesla's decision to remove the safety monitor from some of its robotaxis suggests the company could be close.",

    "description": "Business Insider spoke with Spanish pilots who are deployed to Lithuania to contribute to NATO air policing missions.",
    "fullText": "ŠIAULIAI AIR BASE, Lithuania — Lt. Col. Fernando Allen has logged over 1,000 hours flying the EF-18, an American-made fighter jet designed specifically for the Spanish air forces. He firmly believes it's the \"best machine ever made.\"\n\nAllen, the detachment commander of a Spanish Air Force wing deployed to Šiauliai Air Base to support NATO air policing operations, says the EF-18 fighter is perfect for intercepting fast-moving jets — or slow-flying drones.\n\n\"I think it's the best multi-role asset because it's very easy for the pilot to get all the info in the cockpit,\" he told Business Insider during a visit to the air base this week. The jet's screen layout, he explained, is what makes it simple.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing deployed to Šiauliai in Lithuania at the start of December for a four-month rotation to contribute to NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission, designed to protect the airspace above and around Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia — the Baltic nations on the front lines of the alliance.\n\nFighter jets are routinely scrambled on short notice from the Šiauliai base and other bases in the region to intercept Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea that aren't using their transponders, haven't filed official flight plans, or aren't communicating appropriately with air traffic control.\n\nLast year, NATO's Air Command recorded more than 500 scrambles across allied airspace as part of its air policing missions and other defensive operations.\n\nThe 200-member Spanish detachment arrived at Šiauliai with 11 EF-18M fighter jets, upgraded versions of the twin-engine F/A-18 Hornet, designed by former American defense contractor McDonnell Douglas (which later merged with Boeing).\n\nThe fourth-generation F/A-18 made its first flight in the late 1970s and entered service with the US military in the early 1980s. The fighter jet has seen extensive combat experience across the Middle East and southeastern Europe and is flown by roughly half a dozen countries today.\n\nSpain operates its own specialized version of the F/A-18 Hornet. The airframe of the EF-18 (\"E\" for España) is made in America, but Madrid has been responsible for upgrading and modifying the jets in the decades since it first purchased them, modernizing features such as the software.\n\nThe jet's exterior may look the same as those flown by Finland or Canada, but the interior is completely different, with \"all the latest technology,\" said Allen, the detachment commander.\n\n\"It's very easy to fly an F-18,\" he said. \"The most difficult part is to manage everything you have inside.\"\n\nWhen the EF-18s deployed to Šiauliai are scrambled, it is usually in response to a nearby aircraft flying without identification or failing to follow — intentional or not — international rules. While most interceptions occur without incident, the fighters are armed, ready for a threat scenario.\n\nThe Spanish EF-18s are armed with an M61A1 Vulcan 20mm cannon and can be equipped with IRIS-T short-range air-to-air missiles and AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles. The two missiles use infrared and radar homing technology, respectively.\n\nThe utility of combat-proven air-to-air weapons such as these was underscored in September when NATO fighter jets shot down Russian drones that crossed into Polish airspace during an attack against Ukraine.\n\nThe troubling incident sparked discussions among Western officials and military leaders about finding more cost-effective ways to shoot down cheap drones without relying solely on expensive jet-fired missiles.\n\n\"We can carry many air-to-air weapons, air-to-ground weapons,\" Allen said. He praised the EF-18 fighter's thrust, saying that the fighter can travel at both high and low speeds, the latter coming into play for a growing area of concern affecting alliance air policing missions.\n\n\"You can fly very, very slow,\" Allen said. \"For us, to intercept drones or small aircraft, it's not easy, but it's easier for us than any other aircraft.\"\n\nThe EF-18 is the only fighter Allen has ever flown, but others under his command have had the opportunity to experience the capabilities of other airframes firsthand.\n\nLt. Arturo Guitán, an EF-18 pilot with the 15th Wing, told Business Insider he prefers his jet to the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon, developed by a consortium of European defense firms, even though the latter is a more technologically advanced aircraft.\n\n\"We love it,\" Guitán said of the EF-18, adding that the fighter is capable of performing all the mission requirements.\n\nCountries contribute to the Baltic Air Policing mission on four-month rotations; the 15th Wing will be replaced in March by Romania and France. The Spanish fighter pilots began training for the job long before they deployed to Lithuania, routinely practicing for scrambles.\n\n\"We are honored to be here, and we are very proud to be part of this kind of mission,\" said Lt. Jesus Ortín, another EF-18 pilot. \"It's a peacetime mission, so we are highly trained for this.\"\n\nDespite praise from pilots, Spain has gradually moved in recent years to replace its EF-18 fleet with orders for dozens of new Eurofighter jets. The country has also pivoted away from buying the stealth fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II, made by the US defense giant Lockheed Martin, opting instead for a European aircraft.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "fullText": "Bill Gross says the stock market's record rally is at risk of stalling, and fresh support is needed to keep it going.\n\nThere's been a \"little wobbling\" to start the year, signaling the market's in \"need of a cane to steady its momentum,\" the billionaire investor known as the \"Bond King\" wrote in an investment outlook on Wednesday.\n\nThe AI boom has propelled Big Tech stocks to historic highs, fueling a nearly 80% rise in the S&P 500 over the last three years. But the benchmark index has whipsawed this month between a 2.1% gain at its peak and a 0.8% decline at its trough.\n\n\"Lower interest rates would help, as would continued news that AI actually results in higher productivity, and continuing 15% plus earnings gains,\" Gross told Business Insider by email.\n\nGross, who cofounded PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly 30 years, wrote in his outlook that stocks are being shored up by rosy earnings forecasts, which are underpinned by fiscal and monetary stimulus.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that US markets could falter as \"political unrest\" threatens to undermine core capitalist principles such as \"competition and survival of the fittest.\"\n\nGross said that even in the AI space, \"tariffs and government aid\" could lead to the \"unfittest\" surviving in future marketplaces.\n\nA major trend of President Donald Trump's second term has been greater executive intervention in the business world. The federal government has taken equity stakes in corporations such as Intel, imposed sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and thrown its full weight behind AI companies' infrastructure buildout.\n\nGross also warned in his outlook that high valuations are a concern, noting a version of the Buffett Indicator that compares the S&P 500's price to nominal US GDP is at a \"historic high.\"\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite gauge shows \"froth is visible\" in the market as stock prices are rising faster than GDP, Gross told BI.\n\nThe Wall Street veteran wrote in his outlook that \"productivity, tax rates and geopolitical influences can suggest no need for a cane.\" He noted that some market bulls believe AI has changed the game, so they expect \"no wobbling — just sprinting.\"\n\n\"But I throw my hat in with the old wizard Warren Buffett,\" Gross wrote. \"Valuation casts a shadow over markets in 2026. No crash, just a forward weave requiring a cane, unlike 2025.\"\n\nOther high-profile investors have flagged lofty valuations as a headwind.\n\n\"Just your daily reminder that stocks are expensive,\" Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said in a X post last week, adding that high prices depress returns.\n\nGMO cofounder Jeremy Grantham echoed Burry on a recent podcast: \"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward.\"",

    "fullText": "AI evangelist Peter Kyle wants to scale up businesses, attract overseas investors and look out for UK’s poorer regions\n\nThe UK business secretary, Peter Kyle, has said he is “betting big” and “picking winners” as the government takes direct stakes in growing businesses to boost economic growth.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been talking up Britain’s prospects, Kyle said ministers were taking an “activist” approach to industrial policy.\n\nThe idea of “picking winners” is closely associated with the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s attacks on Labour’s 1970s strategy and her argument that it should be the private sector that decides which companies thrive.\n\nKyle was unabashed about invoking the phrase, arguing a muscular approach could accelerate economic growth. “I want to make sure that the benefits of growth are felt quicker than is currently the case. We’re predicted to grow 1.5% this year. That is not enough.”\n\nHe highlighted the recent decision to allow the £26bn state-owned British Business Bank to buy equity stakes in companies, including the announcement last week of a £25m investment in the energy supplier Octopus’s software spin-off, Kraken.\n\n“The most potential in our economy, in the short and medium term, is scale-up companies,” Kyle said. “I was at Octopus yesterday. They’re now employing 1,500 people in their head office in London alone.\n\n“We can find other companies that are on that kind of trajectory and we can expedite their growth. Then it will create thousands of new jobs, and it will create enormous amounts of wealth, which will recycle through the economy in a really fast way.”\n\n“I am betting big. And I am picking winners,” he added. “It’s more activist. And there will be things that don’t work out, sure. But to have a healthy economy, failure leads to success.”\n\nThis week’s summit in the Swiss ski resort has been overshadowed by Donald Trump’s threat to slap tariffs on eight European countries if they stood in the way of his hopes of annexing Greenland.\n\nThe president backed away from the idea of punitive import taxes on Wednesday evening, after discussions with the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, but several leaders in the Swiss ski resort have said the global economic order has irrevocably changed.\n\nKyle insisted international uncertainty was no reason not to press ahead with Labour’s agenda, highlighting the prospects of a “wave of opportunity that technology and life sciences and all these huge, huge, positive waves of innovation are going to present to us”.\n\nHe said: “If we are too intimidated by the global challenges, if we are too distracted by domestic political to and fro, then we will take our eye off the ball, and we will miss the opportunity of a lifetime, and that means real things to real people.\n\n“There will be kids growing up like me that will not end up becoming successful like I have. It’ll be communities that, at the moment, are poor, and they will never have a hope of becoming prosperous. And I won’t stand for it. I would literally do anything. And if that means betting [on] winners, and getting it wrong from time to time, I’ll take it.”\n\nAnnouncing the beefing up of the government’s “global talent taskforce” in his department, the business secretary suggested that the UK hoped to capitalise on the instability unleashed by Trump’s policies to help it attract jobs and investment.\n\n“I will suck the best talent in from wherever it exists, and talent goes both ways across the Atlantic. And I want to make sure that we have a good balance in that because for too long it’s been in one direction,” he said.\n\nHighlighting the need to attract innovators in particular, Kyle added: “America is being disruptive with tariffs, but America isn’t the most friendly place for scientific endeavour in any case at the moment. Do the maths and add up where we’re going with this. We are going out there and we’re saying: ‘Actually, we have one of the best regulatory environments in the world for life sciences, and across the board.’”\n\nKeir Starmer has taken a tough line on migration – despite pushback from some quarters in the party – promising to reduce it and condemning Boris Johnson’s administration for what the prime minister has called an “open borders experiment”.\n\nBut Kyle said he did not think public scepticism about migration extended to wealthy entrepreneurs. “People are deeply concerned about the immigration system we inherited, and the asylum system, which was overwhelmed, and was poorly administered by the Tories, and therefore broken,” he said.\n\n“I’ve never had anybody that says that people with a lot of money to invest in our country, who want to come here and create jobs, create businesses, shouldn’t be coming to do so.”\n\nHe added: “I have a taskforce that’s doing this, embedded in our global network. We can offer the world’s most talented a bespoke package to come to the UK swiftly, to embed, and then, of course, be part of a funding landscape that is bountiful.”\n\nThe 55-year-old MP for Hove and Portslade has been business secretary since Starmer’s September reshuffle, replacing Jonathan Reynolds, who had done the job for several years in opposition.\n\nKyle is politically close to the health secretary, Wes Streeting – who has been repeatedly mooted as a potential challenger to Starmer – but has been scrupulously loyal to the prime minister in public.\n\nEarlier this week, the business secretary rejected the suggestion that the UK try to negotiate a customs union with the EU, for which Streeting has signalled his support, telling the FT: “I think at the moment it would be foolish to slip towards what would be simple solutions.”\n\nKyle has dyslexia and left his state school “without any usable” qualifications, as he has put it. He made his way to university aged 25, and went on to secure a PhD, then worked in the charity sector before entering politics.\n\nIn his previous job of technology secretary, he was forced to defend his closeness to powerful tech companies. He is a regular user of the chatbot ChatGPT and an evangelist for the opportunities offered by the technology – and is often seen in the casual garb favoured by “tech bros”.\n\nSoon after taking on his current role, Kyle struck a deal with business groups and trade unions to water down the implementation of Labour’s Employment Rights Act, introducing a six-month probation period before the promised “day-tone rights” come into force.\n\nHe has continued to work closely with his successor and friend, Liz Kendall, and said he has insisted the connecting door that blocked the corridor between their two offices be opened up.\n\nAsked whether AI would cause mass layoffs as companies decide they can manage without entry-level staff – a hot topic at Davos – Kyle said: “People are anxious and it’s going to be painful and difficult because change is always painful and difficult.”\n\nKyle said Labour was ready to intervene to ensure the adoption of AI was less painful for poorer communities than the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, which cast a long shadow.\n\nHe said: “Waves of industrial change have always gone badly when governments stand on the sidelines and are not participants. And I will not allow that to happen.\n\n“As tech secretary I was negotiating deals for investment in digital infrastructure, insisting it happened in poorer parts of the country. I’m the gatekeeper into our country for a lot of investors. And if they want to come and benefit from our country, then they can contribute to it as well.”",

    "fullText": "OpenAI has pulled in a billion-dollar month from something other than ChatGPT.\n\nSam Altman said in a post on X on Thursday that OpenAI added more than $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the past month \"just from our API business.\"\n\n\"People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!\" the OpenAI CEO wrote.\n\nOpenAI's API enables other companies and developers to embed its models into their own products, from internal productivity software to coding tools.\n\nMany of Silicon Valley's high-profile startups rely on OpenAI's models as core infrastructure. Perplexity uses OpenAI's models to power parts of its AI search and answer engine. Harvey, one of the fastest-growing legal tech startups, is built on OpenAI's models to assist lawyers with research and drafting.\n\nAltman's comments underscore how OpenAI's infrastructure business is emerging as a key growth engine, even as the company faces massive costs for computing power and data centers.\n\nThose pressures have pushed OpenAI to look beyond consumer subscriptions.\n\nLast week, the company said it is gearing up to test ads inside ChatGPT as it faces about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments over the coming years.\n\nIt's a notable shift for a company that once treated ads as taboo. Less than two years ago, Altman said advertising was a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nSince then, Altman has struck a more open tone. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't \"totally against\" ads, though he stressed it would need to be approached carefully.\n\nEarlier this week, OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised the idea of \"licensing models\" that would let the company share in downstream sales if a customer's product succeeds.\n\n\"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,\" Friar said in an episode of \"The OpenAI Podcast\" published Monday.",

Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.\n\nTikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.\n\nWhile Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.\n\nThe company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.\n\nFollowing the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok.\"\n\nHe said the deal had reached a \"very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.\"\n\nThe deal has been in the works for a year. At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.\n\nSince then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.",

    "description": "Integrated energy giant Chevron has a strong business, an attractive yield, and a rock-solid balance sheet.",
    "fullText": "Energy is integral to the world, and every investor should probably have some exposure to the sector.\n\nChevron is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, providing diversification across the energy sector.\n\nChevron offers an attractive combination of yield and financial strength, relative to its closest peers.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›\n\nThe world is trying to shift away from dirtier energy sources, such as coal and oil. However, it's likely to be a long transition. Oil and natural gas will both be needed for decades to come, as the most likely energy strategy is an \"all of the above\" approach.\n\nEvery investor should probably have some exposure to the energy sector. That's the foundational reason why you should consider adding Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to your portfolio. Here are three company-specific reasons why.\n\nThe energy sector is volatile by nature, with oil and natural gas prices rising and falling regularly. You could focus on a narrow niche of the industry, but most investors will be best served by a company with a diversified portfolio of assets that provide exposure to the entire energy value chain. That's what integrated energy companies like Chevron do.\n\nChevron is best known for its oil and natural gas production, which falls into the upstream segment of the industry. However, it also owns energy infrastructure assets, such as pipelines, which help move oil and natural gas around the world.\n\nThat's the midstream. It also owns chemical and refining businesses that operate in the downstream segment of the industry. These businesses process energy into the products that actually get used, like gasoline.\n\nEach segment of the industry operates a little differently through the energy cycle. The best example of the benefit is that low oil prices put pressure on upstream producers but reduce costs in the downstream segment, where oil is a key input into the production of other products. From a foundational perspective, integrated Chevron has an attractive business model.\n\nChevron's dividend yield is currently 4.1%. That's well above the S&P 500 index's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.1% yield and the 3.3% yield of the average energy stock. Chevron clearly has an attractive yield on an absolute level.\n\nChevron, however, doesn't have the highest yield among its closest integrated energy peers. That title goes to TotalEnergies at around 5.9%. However, Chevron does have an over 30-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it. That's second in the sector to ExxonMobil's over-40-year streak, but Exxon's yield is only around 3.1%. All in, Chevron is a reliable dividend stock with an attractive yield that stands out from its peers.",

    "description": "In a World Economic Forum panel moderated by Business Insider, robotics experts dove into how bots are going to change the world.",
    "fullText": "In a world of AI chatbots and agents, we're not talking enough about physical AI.\n\nAt a Thursday morning Davos panel moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, robotics experts dived into ways bots are going to change the world — and their key limitations.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the World Economic Forum panel, which featured robotics and automation experts and a trade minister:\n\nOne phrase dominated the conversation: digital twins.\n\nExecutives from Siemens, Agility Robotics, and Automation Anywhere agreed that what once sounded like a distant possibility is now delivering real productivity gains for companies.\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a physical object, person, or process. They can help organizations simulate real situations and their outcomes, allowing them to make better decisions.\n\n\"Digital twins have been around, but the technology has exponentially improved, and the computing power has exponentially improved,\" said Automation Anywhere CEO Mihir Shukla.\n\nHe added, \"Let's say digital twins tell you that there is going to be a problem in manufacturing. You can proactively act on it. It has implications on your inventory. It has implications on your shipping planning.\"\n\nSiemens' CEO Roland Busch said that the productivity boost is showing up in numbers.\n\nHe said that the company's output is 20% higher and that energy costs are 20% lower.\n\n\"You have much, much faster and ramping up, you don't make mistakes,\" if you use a digital twin, he said.\n\nRobots can do work that humans are unable to — or don't want to — do, said Peggy Johnson, the CEO of Agility Robotics.\n\n\"It's very hard to hire for these manual jobs,\" she said. \"They're dull and dirty, and they're dangerous at times because you're lifting over and over again, very repetitive. It's kind of mind-numbing work.\"\n\nFaster progress in robotics means a better quality of life for the humans who are doing such jobs.\n\n\"The injuries are also another thing,\" she said about jobs that require a lot of heavy lifting. \"We have an aging workforce. A lot of young kids don't want to go into environments like this. So the older employees are also getting hurt more.\"\n\nThani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the Minister of Foreign Trade for the United Arab Emirates, echoed that robotics was the future of \"non-skilled\" labor.\n\n\"It's too difficult to attract new young people to start working on the construction,\" he said. \"Robotics is the main solution.\"\n\nBut building robots that are safe to use in human environments is also key, Johnson said.\n\nAl Zeyoudi added that financing AI is only the first step toward AI integration.\n\n\"Sometimes you have the money, but you haven't diagnosed the right solution to the problem that you're having,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the UAE's push for AI includes government appointments, policy development, and research and development, which was the \"main game changer.\"\n\n\"Many, many stakeholders are avoiding that because they say someone else will do it,\" he said, referring to R&D. \"I'll just copy and paste it.\"\n\n\"But when it comes to AI, it's too late,\" Al Zeyoudi added. \"You have to start working on R&D because you ensure to customize things to your own ecosystem, your own environments, your own conditions.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider is tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.",
    "fullText": "From Davos to Washington to America's high school classrooms, people are questioning the foundations of our economic system — and we at Business Insider are tracking what the fight over the future of capitalism means for your work, your wealth, and your world.\n\nPolls show Americans' trust in capitalism is falling fast, as daily life has grown more expensive and less secure. Our own recent survey of readers found that people are worried their wages aren't keeping up with their expenses, that housing feels out of reach, and that the whole system seems shaky. Many employers are leaning even more heavily into a capitalistic approach, deemphasizing loyalty and tenure in favor of ruthless meritocracy. Meanwhile, the US government has taken a more hands-on role in the economy, becoming a shareholder in several companies and upending its place in the capitalist system.\n\nAs questions about the state of capitalism grow, leaders are pitching competing visions of the economy's future. President Trump told a room full of CEOs, executives, and media figures at Davos this week that the US is reshaping the rules to make sure the country comes out of this period of transition \"bigger and better than before.\" Some are pushing for reform, like California governor Gavin Newsom, who called for a \"rules-based, competitive\" model at Davos. Others, like New York City's self-described socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani, want to rethink the system from the ground up — and have a lot of voters on board.\n\nWhile capitalism's future hangs in the balance, Business Insider is digging in. We're exploring how and why the system is being reshaped — by government policy, by companies, and by you.\n\nTell us what you think about the future of capitalism. Test your own understanding. And stick with us as we track how this system is evolving in real time, and what it will look like next.",

    "title": "Trump called Greenland a 'piece of ice.' To Greenlanders, it's so much more.",
    "description": "President Donald Trump repeatedly called Greenland a \"piece of ice\" while speaking at Davos. Three Greenlanders gave Business Insider their responses.",
    "fullText": "For over 56,000 people, Greenland is far more than a \"piece of ice\" — it's home.\n\nThat's what three residents of Greenland told Business Insider on Wednesday after President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the island as a \"piece of ice\" and called it \"Iceland\" on several occasions during a speech to World Economic Forum attendees at the Davos Conference.\n\nOn one occasion, Trump took a more complimentary tone and referred to the autonomous territory of Denmark as a \"big, beautiful piece of ice.\" He added that the US \"alone can defend this giant piece of ice,\" calling it a \"core national security interest.\"\n\nTrump isn't the first US president to want to acquire Greenland. In fact, the US has been discussing it since the 19th century. However, residents across Greenland — in the south, the north, and the capital — told Business Insider they don't appreciate Trump's rhetoric.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Just calling Greenland a 'piece of ice' is so inaccurate,\" 32-year-old Ole Olsvig told Business Insider. Olsvig, an entrepreneur and tourist guide in Qaarsut in North Greenland, called the rhetoric \"outrageous,\" \"disrespectful,\" and \"commoditizing.\"\n\nTechnically, about 80% of Greenland is covered by a giant ice sheet. That's not what concerns Olsvig, though; it's what the remarks imply.\n\nIt erases people and implies disposability, he said. \"Greenland is like being treated as an asset, not a society of people.\"\n\nTrump has spoken of acquiring Greenland since his first presidential term. In his Davos speech on Wednesday, he called for \"immediate negotiations\" about the US taking control of Greenland, saying, \"We need it for strategic, national security, and international security.\"\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer who lives in Qassiarsuk in South Greenland, told Business Insider.\n\nShe added that she thinks Trump wants Greenland for more than just national security reasons — he also wants access to Greenland's trove of natural resources.\n\n\"We have very strict rules in the mining industry, which is good. So even though he really wants to buy Greenland, it's not just like a place he can just buy and then make a mine,\" she said.\n\nAnother point of contention among Greenlanders is that Trump's portrayal of Greenland as a \"piece of ice\" ignores the territory's rich and distinct culture.\n\nGreenland has its own official language, self-governance, and cultural practices, including hunting, fishing, and sled dogs, Olsvig said. \"Greenland isn't just a blank map.\"\n\nKleist added, \"We're not becoming part of America,\" despite Trump's wishes.\n\nThe attention Greenland has gotten on the world stage has had some positive effects, said 28-year-old Casper Frank Møller, the CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, which is based in Nuuk.\n\nFor example, his company saw a surge in interest from tourists at the start of 2025 when Trump re-raised the topic of acquiring Greenland.\n\nHowever, Møller said that the US's raid on Venezuela has caused further concerns among people in Greenland because \"there was just way more power behind the words.\" He estimates that 20 to 30 customers have postponed travel plans to Greenland as they wait out the situation.\n\nHe added that Trump's aggressive approach toward Greenland has actually made the country a little less polarized and more united toward potential independence.\n\n\"We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?\" he said.\n\n\"We as Greenlandic people, we are democratic, we aim for diplomacy, and we don't want any warfare to be happening here in Greenland. We're looking for diplomatic solutions,\" he added.\n\nMøller, for one, seemed to see some truth in the description of Greenland as a \"piece of ice.\"\n\n\"Greenland for sure has an immense, abnormally big piece of ice in the ice sheet,\" he said. \"It's true.\"\n\nThat said, \"we have some of the most beautiful places on Earth. Some of the most remote, untouched areas that you can imagine,\" he added. \"And I would say, for that big chunk of ice, that's what we call home.\"",

    "description": "Michael Rumph and Darlene Person, siblings in Atlanta, built a profitable 13-car Turo fleet that started with their mother's car in 2022.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Michael Rumph, 60, and Darlene Person, 61, siblings in metro Atlanta who run JDM Whipz, a 13-car Turo fleet. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDarlene: For several years, my brother, Mike, and I talked about wanting to go into business together. We considered a few ideas but hadn't settled on one.\n\nIn February 2022, we rented an Escalade from Turo for a family trip. Almost exactly a year later, we launched our own Turo business, JDM Whipz.\n\nDarlene: Mike dove into research, sending me videos and websites every week. We began meeting on Sundays to discuss launching a Turo business.\n\nI'm a federal government employee, and I still work full-time. Most of my Turo work takes place in the evenings, when I prep cars after my day job. When we started, both of us were balancing full-time jobs.\n\nMike: I'm an IT nerd with 37 years of experience in desktop support, server support, and project management. Now, I'm a full-time Turo project manager.\n\nMike: The Corolla belonged to our mom, who died in June 2022. It's still on the platform; I just had the front end repainted and protective film added.\n\nFrom there, we purchased a 2017 Mazda, a 2017 Chevy Malibu, a 2017 Equinox, and a 2018 Equinox. By the end of our first year, we had 10 cars. We purchased eight with cash and used \"creative financing\" for the other two, purchasing them with 0% credit cards\n\nToday, we have 13 vehicles — we own 12 outright and have one payment on a 2019 Chrysler Pacifica. We've had five cars totaled in the past year, but because I hold a dealer's license and buy vehicles wholesale at auctions, we've been able to replace them and even come out ahead on insurance payouts.\n\nMike: Enterprise once quoted me $805 for an SUV from Friday to Sunday. Turo cost us $360 for four days and 600 miles when we rented that Escalade.\n\nDarlene: We listed mom's Corolla as a trial, but the first renter kept extending her trip week after week, and it ended up being 2.5 months total. The car was gone, and we had nothing to do, so we said, \"Let's add another.\"\n\nFrom the start, we reinvested every dollar back into the business. That's how we grew to 10 cars in a year.\n\nWe choose Turo's 60% protection plan: we keep 60%, Turo takes 40%, but our deductible is lower. Hosts can take up to 90% but risk a much higher deductible. Understanding that trade-off is important.\n\nMike: Day-to-day, I'm checking cars in and out, cleaning, handling inspections, and keeping up with competition in the Atlanta market.\n\nI left my IT job last April after paying off all my debts. I was breathing and dreaming of Turo at work. Now it's my focus.\n\nDarlene: Atlanta is huge, so Mike covers the north side, and I handle the south. We've never had all 13 cars sitting at our homes at once, where we store them.\n\nUsually they're rented out, coming back for a day or two before heading out again. I've learned more about cars in these two and a half years than I ever imagined.\n\nDarlene: We're obsessed with customer service. Over the years, we've both complained about poor service elsewhere. When we started JDM Whipz, I told Mike, \"I want people to feel valued.\" Our reviews consistently mention exceptional service, which is the most rewarding feedback we receive.\n\nMike: I built JDMWhipz.com because Turo's search doesn't show business names. Our site lets visitors view our entire fleet in one place without having to search. When ready to book, they tap a link that takes them directly to Turo to complete the reservation process.\n\nThe biggest challenge for new hosts is capital. Ideally, buy or own your first car outright. Read Turo's Terms of Service carefully to understand the responsibilities of both the host and the guest.\n\nDarlene: Most people start Turo while working full-time. You need excellent planning and time management. We learned the hard way: clean a car as soon as it returns.\n\nEarly on, we'd say, \"I'll do it in the morning,\" and then get a 7 a.m. booking. At 5 a.m., with car washes closed, you're in the driveway scrubbing, photographing, and prepping the car. Now it's a habit: the car comes in, and it gets cleaned.\n\nMike: Revenue now depends on the season and the vehicle. Our Corolla rents for $42 to $46 per day. Some cars earn $800 a month, while others earn $1,200 during peak season in Atlanta, which typically spans from March to September.\n\nWe're still making six figures in profit a year.\n\nDarlene: Check Turo's website for rules, like no cars older than 12 years or with more than 130,000 miles when listed.\n\nWatch videos from Turo hosts on YouTube, but vet their advice. Don't be afraid to ask experienced hosts for guidance. Mike and I mentor people all the time; we love helping new hosts succeed.\n\nOur long-term goal is to become Atlanta's go-to personal car rental company. We're proud of what we've built — and even prouder to do it together as siblings.",

    "description": "Business Insider visited an air base in Lithuania where Spanish jets are deployed to support NATO air policing operations.",
    "fullText": "ŠIAULIAI AIR BASE, Lithuania — The fighter pilots quickly grabbed their gear and stormed out the door of the small command building as alarm bells wailed from a loudspeaker. The countdown had started.\n\nThe Spanish pilots and the support crew piled into two vans, which swiftly shuttled them down snow-covered roads to the hangars. The powerful EF-18 jet engines roared to life, and with pre-flight checks complete, the fighters taxiied out onto the runway.\n\nAs the planes took off into the frigid January sky, the air base fell silent.\n\nFighter pilots from the 15th Wing of the Spanish Air Force deployed to NATO's forward edge have just 15 minutes to get airborne once a quick reaction alert mission is activated, usually in response to a nearby aircraft flying without identification or purposefully dodging international regulations.\n\nFighter jets are frequently sent out on very short notice to intercept Russian military aircraft over the Baltic Sea. NATO’s Air Command recorded more than 500 such rapid-response launches, known as scrambles, across allied airspace last year as part of air policing missions and other operations.\n\nAt Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania, Business Insider observed Spanish fighter jets taking off for what began as a training sortie. Once they were airborne, though, the flight became an \"alpha scramble,\" meaning they were tasked with responding to something suspicious — potentially a real threat.\n\nLt. Col. Fernando Allen, the commander of the Spanish detachment, could only say that the target was an unidentified aircraft. Recent NATO scrambles have intercepted Russian aircraft, including fighter jets and surveillance planes.\n\nAllen said that he and his fellow airmen are deployed to Lithuania \"to make safe skies for partner nations and allies.\"\n\nNATO launched the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2004 following the accession of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the alliance. Member states take turns deploying fighter jets to Šiauliai and two other bases in the region on a four-month rotational basis.\n\nThe mission is to protect the airspace above and around the three Baltic states — often referred to as NATO's front lines — amid anxiety over Russian activities in and near allied skies.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing deployed at the start of December to Šiauliai Air Base, where it is contributing to the air policing mission and the Eastern Sentry operation that NATO launched in September after Russian drones violated Polish airspace.\n\nThe Spanish detachment arrived with just over 200 personnel and 11 EF-18M fighters, upgraded versions of the American-made F/A-18 Hornet that only Madrid operates. The jets are armed with air-to-air missiles and equipped for round-the-clock operations, including night flights, with pilots using night-vision goggles.\n\nAlpha scrambles follow a step-by-step procedure. Control centers are monitoring the airspace 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If crews detect an unidentified radar track or an aircraft failing to follow international rules, they relay the information to one of NATO's combined air operations centers.\n\nWhen commanders decide to launch an alpha scramble, the pilots receive an order to take off and must be airborne within 15 minutes. They normally complete the task well ahead of time.\n\nThe scramble alert can come in at any moment, so pilots and support crews are always on standby. Some might be resting or even sleeping, but when the alarm bells ring, airmen are ready to get moving.\n\n\"You don't have time to think about what's happening. You only think about getting dressed and running to the airplane,\" Lt. Jesus Ortín, one of the Spanish EF-18 pilots, told Business Insider during a visit to Šiauliai this week. \"We are not waiting for it. We are on alert.\" There is an expectation that even at rest, they're ready.\n\nLt. Arturo Guitán, another EF-18 pilot, said his reaction to a scramble order is automatic in his brain, drilled in through extensive preparation before the deployment. \"I think it's quite easy to scramble,\" he said, \"because we train every day.\"\n\nFor identification and intercept missions, NATO fighter jets — regularly scrambled in pairs or fours — fly alongside aircraft until they move farther out into international airspace. Intercepts commonly occur over the Baltic Sea, a busy route linking mainland Russia with its heavily militarized Kaliningrad exclave between allied countries Poland and Lithuania.\n\nNATO has said that Russian aircraft often approach or fly near allied airspace without using transponders, having filed an official flight plan, or communicating with air traffic control. However, the culprit behind a scramble alert isn't always Moscow; civilian planes can trigger an alpha scramble as well.\n\nMembers of the 15th Wing couldn't disclose exactly how many alpha scrambles they have carried out since their deployment began. Allen, the detachment commander, said there were lots in December, but 2026 started off relatively quiet.\n\nSome weeks may trigger five scrambles, while others may see only two, the 15th Wing said. They appear random, and while intelligence officers are trying to map out any patterns, they've been unable to do so.\n\n\"We are proud to be here, and it's an honor to help our allied partner countries,\" Allen said. \"I know we're farther in the east, but we are doing the same mission that we were performing in our own country.\"",

    "description": "Fisayo Che is the founder of Elisamama, a brand that's sold at Saks. She's finding a path forward as the department store goes through bankruptcy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Fisayo Che, the founder of women's wear brand Elisamama. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Che's statements, including the amount Saks owes, with documentation she provided.\n\nSaks Global filed in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows it to continue operating while undergoing a court-supervised reorganization of its debt. In a statement, Saks said it is committed to \"trusted relationships with brand partners,\" and that funding it secured through the bankruptcy will \"facilitate go-forward payments to brand partners.\"\n\nBecoming a fashion designer was never a part of my vision board. When I founded Elisamama, I was still working a corporate job.\n\nI felt like I wanted to live a life of more meaning and purpose. My family is from Nigeria, and I spent time there growing up. I got the idea to start a brand that supports women artisans in the country.\n\nElisamama is a women's wear and children's brand inspired by African artistry and prints. At first, I sold the clothing at flea markets; later, I listed on Etsy and promoted it on social media.\n\nSaks really gave my business a platform to grow. Now, it's going through bankruptcy and hasn't paid me for some of my inventory. I'm not sure how to trust the company going forward.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, someone found us on Instagram and, unbeknownst to me, dropped our name with a Saks buyer. When the department store initially reached out, I thought it was a scam, and I didn't respond. Then, a vice president from the company DM'd me on Instagram.\n\nI freaked out and was very scared. I thought: How are we going to do this? I even told them I needed time to figure it out because I didn't want to mess up this opportunity.\n\nSaks really walked alongside us, gave us guidance, and helped us dip our toes slowly into its world. It was rapid-fire learning, trying to understand all the vendor requirements, including shipping and routing guidelines.\n\nWe hired more artisans in Nigeria. We beefed up our production. We worked on our supply situation. Everybody was winning; it helped us help other people grow their own businesses.\n\nIn 2023, Saks selected us to join its New Wave program for emerging designers. We came to New York, connected with industry experts and the press, and the company gave us a grant.\n\nAt the end, we had our products placed in the window at Saks' flagship store in New York. That was a remarkable moment for me and my team in Nigeria, who are so proud of this work. It was nothing that I could even have imagined for Elisamama.\n\nThe exposure it gave us was significant and gave us confidence.\n\nWe signed with a showroom and started selling in retailers like Shopbop, Tuckernuck, and several specialty boutiques. Things were ramping up, and the more I did this work, the more joy I found in it. In 2024, I left my corporate job.\n\nSaks has been a great partner to us. It has placed orders with us every season since 2020. It's 50% or 60% of our business.\n\nThe problems started in February of last year, when Saks sent vendors a memo about paying in installments. Prior to that, we were consistently paid on the agreed-upon payment terms.\n\nI thought: We can wait a few months to get paid. They're important partners.\n\nWe got a check for a couple of hundred dollars in July, and in August, we were paid a more substantial amount. I thought we were back on track and kept sending inventory. Then, no other payments came in.\n\nWe fulfilled two additional orders after that, operating on faith that things would shake out properly. The company kept saying it would get back to us with updates.\n\nNow, Saks owes us six figures. I'm considering cutting half of our team to stay viable.\n\nI employ 20 people full time in Nigeria; we have some consultants and contractors, as well. The amount Saks owes us means a lot.\n\nWhen Saks' bankruptcy was announced in January, the ax dropped. Because of the proceedings, Saks said it'd prioritize debts incurred after January 13 and get back to us on other payments owed.\n\nI have been trying to expand my partnerships and sales channels to protect my business, as we've been hearing about Saks' struggles for a long time.\n\nI want to see Saks win, but I don't believe the company anymore. We're sitting on Saks' most recent order, given the situation.\n\nI've told the buyers that any future shipments would have to be paid for before we ship. I'm also considering asking them to send back the inventory they have on hand, so at least we can cut our losses.\n\nSaks is so powerful and significant in the fashion space that partnering with it is valuable. What's happened is a disappointment, but it's also grief and sadness.\n\nSaks needs to restore trust with its suppliers by putting money behind its orders. If it did that, brands would continue to send goods because it's that important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Saks? Email Madeline Berg at mberg@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The Big Four firm is giving its US employees a new job title, according to an internal presentation seen by Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "In the consulting industry's era of AI upheaval, even job titles aren't safe.\n\nThe Big Four firm Deloitte is rolling out a sweeping overhaul of how it refers to its US workforce and introducing a new class of leader.\n\n\"All professionals will receive a new title that we will start to use internally and externally on June 1, 2026,\" said a presentation shared with employees during a meeting on Wednesday morning, which Business Insider has seen.\n\nDeloitte plans to tell employees their new job titles on January 29, before they take effect at the start of the firm's next financial year in June.\n\nThe meeting, hosted by Mo Reynolds, Deloitte US's chief people officer, was held for the consulting division, but the changes apply to all Deloitte's US divisions, the presentation said. Deloitte had 181,500 employees in the US as of May 31, 2025.\n\nThe firm also announced a new leadership role during Wednesday's meeting.\n\nCurrently, the most senior titles at the firm are partners, principals, and managing directors — known as PPMD. Starting in June, a role titled \"leaders\" will join the group, according to the presentation.\n\n\"We are modernizing our talent architecture to provide a more tailored experience reflective of our professionals' broad range of skills and the work they do,\" a Deloitte spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe overhaul of titles comes as Deloitte and its peers face existential questions posed by AI in the consulting industry. The technology is changing what it means to be a consultant, affecting long-held talent structures, pricing models, and the work that clients want from their consultants.\n\nIn the internal presentation, Deloitte frames the changes as a necessary modernization for a changing market.\n\nAfter a slide titled \"why now?\" the firm explains that its current talent architecture is \"outdated\" and unable to \"support our business of tomorrow.\"\n\nThe current structure was designed for \"a more homogenous workforce of 'traditional' consulting profiles,\" according to the presentation. \"But so much has changed.\"\n\nDeloitte's workforce and business have grown, employees are seeking more tailored talent experiences, and \"our clients are demanding new skills and capabilities,\" the presentation said.\n\nDay-to-day work, leadership, and the firm's \"compensation philosophy\" will all stay the same, according to the presentation.\n\nConsultants at Deloitte have traditionally followed a progression path of analyst, senior analyst, consultant, senior consultant, manager, and senior manager, before promotion to the top echelons of the firm.\n\nUnder the new system, these titles will become more specific and include reference to a \"job family\" and \"sub-family,\" which are another new feature introduced in the talent overhaul.\n\nIn an example from the presentation, an employee with the current job title of \"senior consultant\" could become \"senior consultant, functional transformation,\" \"software engineer III,\" or \"project management senior consultant\" on June 1.\n\nInternally, employees will also be assigned an alphanumeric reference to indicate their job level, such as L45 for what is currently a senior consultant and L55 for current managers.\n\nThese more specific titles will \"drive greater clarity and market relevancy,\" according to the presentation.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aliett Buttelman, cofounder of Fazit. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen people hear that my company took off after Taylor Swift wore our product, they might assume it was a matter of luck. But really, it was the result of a 360-degree strategy we'd developed to get the product into Taylor Swift's hands.\n\nI started Fazit with Nina LaBruna about three years ago. Nina had been a marketing client of mine, and she had pitched me on the idea of entering the skincare patch market. From there, we expanded into cosmetics, which was a truly revolutionary move. We launched glitter freckles — a makeup patch to put glittery spots on the cheekbones — in April 2024, and the product immediately went viral online, selling 100,000 units in its first week.\n\nWe felt Taylor Swift embodied the essence of the glitter freckles. There would be no one better in the world to wear it. So, we started sending the product to the wives and girlfriends of Kansas City Chiefs players, to Taylor's make-up artists, and to Sabrina Carpenter, who was opening for her at the time, hoping to catch her attention.\n\nThe night Taylor wore the freckles, in October 2024, I had just come home from hot yoga, and the Monday night football game was already on. The Chiefs were playing, and a content creator noticed the freckles on Taylor and messaged me. When I saw the product on her face, I just started bawling.\n\nA part of me just couldn't believe it. The biggest celebrity in the world was wearing our makeup patches, validating all the hard work Nina and I had put in. But really, I was crying because I knew this moment counted: it was about to open the door to so many possibilities. It was our chance, despite the brand being so young.\n\nWe immediately got to work. People noticed the freckles, but didn't know Fazit was the brand behind them. I started reaching out to as many media contacts as I could and hired a publicist. The next day, I was on CBS and Peacock.\n\nNina handles the back end of the business, and she was just as busy. She had to double the size of our warehouse overnight. Shipping labels were printing nonstop. We generated seven figures in sales within the first 48 hours after Taylor wore the freckles, and our web traffic increased by 4,800%.\n\nThe first two months were primarily about staying afloat and avoiding too many cracks in the business. Before the Taylor effect, Fazit only had one employee in addition to Nina and me. After that, we called any friends and family we could, asking for help with fulfilling orders.\n\nThe influx of sales significantly changed the company's financials. Nina and I initially bootstrapped the company with $13,000 of our own savings. After some success, we raised $200,000 from friends and family. But in the fall of 2024, we only had enough cash on hand to run the business for about five more months.\n\nTaylor changed that. We had private equity and venture capital firms reach out, but we haven't needed to fundraise. For the first time, Nina and I were able to take a distribution. Now, we have a business that is so profitable and healthy that we can really focus on the next stage of growth.\n\nA year after Taylor wore the freckles, she donned them again, which gave us another sales boost. This time, we were better prepared. Yet, a lot of the past year and a half has still felt like a fight or flight response. We're just trying so hard to take advantage of opportunities and make all the right decisions.\n\nNina and I weren't friends when we started the company together. Now, she's my life partner. We're closer than friends — we're family. No one, with the possible exception of our husbands, can truly understand what it's like to go through this hyper growth.\n\nThe highs are so high, the lows are so low, and there are many unexplainable emotions.",

    "description": "Business Insider looked at Census Bureau data to see the top US imports from Germany, Denmark, and the other countries that could face new tariffs.",
    "fullText": "A trade war between the US and Europe is heating up as President Donald Trump demands American control over Greenland.\n\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, and France are four of the eight European countries that could face new tariffs once February kicks off. Trump made the tariff threats after those countries sent troops to Greenland earlier in January.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said he will levy a new 10% tariff in February on imports from those countries, set to jump to 25% in June \"to protect Global Peace and Security\" because these countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown\" and \"have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" Trump added that the tariffs will be in effect until a deal to buy Greenland is reached.\n\nThat new round of tariffs could affect a slew of goods, with medicine and cars leading the way. The US imported a total of $365 billion in goods from the eight targeted countries in 2024. That included about $44 billion in pharmaceutical preparations and nearly $40 billion in new or used passenger cars. Some other main imports included aircraft, industrial engines, and toiletries and cosmetics.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response.\"\n\nTrump continues to insist the US acquire Greenland, but said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that he won't use force to do so.\n\n\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that,\" he said.",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "Jason Myers plays bass in the heavy metal band Icarus Witch and still works full-time as a senior vice president for a boutique marketing firm.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Myers, a marketing-firm executive and professional bass player in the band Icarus Witch. He is based in Pittsburgh. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started playing bass in heavy metal bands in junior high. I wanted to become a professional musician, but as soon as I got out of college in 1993, I started a side hustle doing publicity for concert promoters and record labels for in case my rock-and-roll dreams didn't pan out.\n\nThe side hustle was really a full-time day job, which made managing a serious band challenging. I'd have to book studio time at night and work until the sun came up, and I could only book shows on weekends unless I took time off from my job.\n\nIn 2003, the band I'm still in today, Icarus Witch, got signed to a label. We put out our first record in 2005 and started getting radio play. As our popularity grew, I wanted to accept longer tours. But the money you earn from touring is essentially a loan against your royalties, so I had to keep working to sustain myself.\n\nOut of a 24-hour day, the band is only on stage for maybe an hour. The rest is spent traveling, waiting, and sleeping. There was a lot of wasted time I knew I could fill, and we were entering an era of greater WiFi capabilities.\n\nAs the years passed, I started to recognize that the music industry was shrinking. People were downloading songs instead of buying CDs, and there were fewer opportunities to make money. Even though my band was successful, it felt more like a personal victory, and I realized it was time to make some adult decisions about how I would protect myself in the future.\n\nIn 2010, I was asked to join a marketing and PR startup called The Content Factory that was early into the remote work thing. I had previously worked with the owner and founder, Kari DePhillips, at another startup. Though I'd only ever done publicity and marketing for bands, Kari said that didn't matter.\n\nSoon after, my band went on tour with the veteran group Y&T, and they were gracious enough to let me work from their bus since we were following them around in a small van. When we'd stay at a hotel, I'd sit in our room after shows working, while my bandmates would check out the local bar scene and meet up with fans.\n\nThese days, my band is more selective about the shows we play because going on tour doesn't make as much financial sense as it once did. That's why you see exorbitant ticket prices when a band does decide to go out.\n\nI'm still with The Content Factory. I worked my way up from account rep to senior vice president of PR and social media marketing. I still enjoy the hell out of playing music, but the company's well-being is on my mind all the time now.\n\nWhen you're in a band on the rise, it's easy to feel invincible, like this is going to last forever. But you have to look out for yourself. No one is going to save you.\n\nI used to have this mindset that if I allowed myself to think about a Plan B, I'd somehow jinx my chances of making it big. In hindsight, I realize that's foolish. You can plan for your future and live the wild life at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.",

    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of Senegal football fans lined the streets of Dakar on Tuesday as the Lions of Teranga held a victory parade to celebrate their triumph in the Africa Cup of Nations final against Morocco.\n\nThe players and coaches brandished their trophy from an open-top bus which inched its way through immense crowds across the capital, winding towards the country's presidential palace.\n\nAs the players travelled the final stretch of their journey along the city's oceanside highway, the Corniche, fans walked and sometimes ran alongside the bus, with throngs of people lining the sidewalks.\n\nDowntown was overcome by a fever pitch of almost deafening noise -- revving engines, horns, vuvuzelas and shouting -- as the players neared the palace, where they will be officially received.\n\nIn the morning, thousands had gathered at the parade's starting point in Patte d'Oie, a working-class neighbourhood across town, wearing team jerseys, chanting, whistling and blowing vuvuzelas.\n\nAll along the route old and young, men and women turned out decked in the country's green, yellow and red colours, sometimes watching on from buildings and bridges, or even climbing on top of cars and billboards.\n\nSecurity forces were also present in large numbers, including anti-riot police.\n\nThe Senegal team made its way across the capital after arriving on a special flight from Morocco shortly before midnight on Monday, where they were greeted by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and other members of the government.\n\nSenegal won the Africa Cup of Nations when they beat hosts Morocco 1-0 in a chaotic final in Rabat on Sunday that saw the eventual champions storm off the pitch late in the game.\n\n\"I wouldn't have missed this moment for the world,\" 26-year-old fan Doudou Thiam told AFP from the parade's sidelines in the Bourguiba neighbourhood, wearing a Senegal jersey.\n\n\"The Lions are our pride and they deserve all the honours. Even if it meant staying here all day, I would have done it\", he said.\n\nA ruckus of whistles and horns has been almost constant since Senegal's victory on Sunday night, when fans flooded the streets, filling the air with honking, fireworks and the deafening roar of vuvuzelas.\n\nThe win marked Senegal's second title, after their 2022 victory over Egypt in Cameroon. It was the team's third final in just the last four editions.\n\nHortense Kenny brought her five-year-old child to Patte d'Oie to watch the parade.\n\n\"The Lions made an entire nation proud, beating the host country in those circumstances,\" she told AFP, referring to the end of the match.\n\n\"Now, all that's left is to win the World Cup. With Sadio Mane, anything is possible,\" she said, referencing the team's biggest star.\n\nHis role as peacemaker during the final -- he was the one who stayed on the pitch and persuaded his teammates to return -- has been widely praised.\n\nNearby Abdulai Sy, a 49-year-old, told AFP he felt personally touched by the victory which gave him a \"big sense of pride to also be Senegalese\".\n\nTuesday's crowd seemed unphased by a cloud of controversy surrounding their team's decision to storm off the pitch late in normal time in protest at a penalty awarded to Morocco.\n\nPrompted by Mane, they returned to the pitch and an attempted 'Panenka' penalty from Morocco's Brahim Diaz was easily saved by Senegal's goalkeeper before Pape Gueye won the game with a superb shot in extra time that stunned the Moroccan crowd.\n\nThe Moroccan FA said it had referred the incidents, including protests from Senegal players and fans, to the Confederation of African Football and FIFA.\n\nFar from Morocco, football's lucrative business side had trickled down even to the streets of Dakar on Tuesday.\n\nAmath Ndiaye, a 36-year-old street vendor who usually sells tissues, told AFP he has switched to hawking jerseys, flags, vuvuzelas and whistles for the duration of AFCON and the celebratory aftermath.\n\nOn Tuesday, he was basking in the wisdom of his decision.\n\n\"I'm doing well,\" he told AFP from Patte d'Oie, near the joyous crowd decked out in patriotic Senegalese gear and waving flags.",

    "fullText": "Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools.\n\nMore than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland.\n\nThey included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nJetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThe most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider.\n\nBuying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower.\n\nThe world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August.\n\nAt 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours.\n\nOther major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay.\n\nPrivate jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro.\n\nLondon was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose.\n\n10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai.\n\nDozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week.\n\nTuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy.",

    "description": "\"The Diary of a CEO\" host said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that using AI to translate podcasts into Spanish broadened its reach.",
    "fullText": "Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,\" Bartlett said during the \"What it Takes to Build\" panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nThe British entrepreneur and host of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast was in conversation with Jessica Lessin, the CEO of The Information, alongside Bret Taylor, formerly the co-CEO of Salesforce and CTO of Meta.\n\nBartlett said using AI tools to translate the podcasts was initially an \"expensive experiment.\" The problem he was trying to solve, he said, was reaching the untapped market of non-English speakers.\n\n\"If we're just in English, we're reaching like 10% of the world,\" Bartlett added.\n\nThere were technical challenges, too. Some languages use longer words, Bartlett said, meaning three-hour English-language conversations could become significantly longer when translated, risking the audio and video falling out of sync.\n\nTwo years ago, Bartlett announced on LinkedIn that \"The Diary of a CEO\" had hired a full-time data scientist who helped the company achieve a technological breakthrough, enabling them to use AI to translate the podcast into \"EVERY language.\"\n\nAt Davos and in the LinkedIn post, Bartlett did not elaborate on exactly how the AI translations work. Today, however, the videos show Bartlett speaking Spanish in a voice similar to his own, a shift he said had significantly expanded the podcast's reach.\n\n\"This month, 28% of my audience is Spanish,\" he said, adding that Spanish speakers now have access to interviews with some of the world's most high-profile podcast guests, citing his own interview with former first lady Michelle Obama as an example.\n\nOther guests on the podcast include former vice President Kamala Harris, Simon Cowell, and the psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nSpotify said in its \"2025 Wrapped\" press release in December 2025 that \"The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett\" was the platform's second-most-listened-to podcast globally, behind \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" On YouTube, Bartlett's podcast channel has 14.5 million subscribers.",

    "title": "Citi has quietly built a 4,000-person internal AI workforce",
    "description": "Around 4,000 employees globally have volunteered to fan out across their business units as \"AI accelerators.\"",
    "fullText": "At Citi, some of the people leading the Wall Street bank's AI push aren't part of a specialized tech team. They're colleagues a few desks over.\n\nThose employees are part of the bank's AI Champions and Accelerators program, which got off the ground in early 2024 and now counts around 4,000 people among its ranks of voluntary AI helpers. At its most basic level, the program aims to have the designated \"accelerators\" help colleagues within their business units leverage and understand AI tools. The program's approximately 25-30 \"champions\" help lead the accelerators in their line of business.\n\nCiti's program is one of many ways banks are racing to adopt AI, from offering engineers capstone-style courses to luring top tech talent by promising a seat at powerful managerial tables. To date, Citi's AI tools are available in 84 countries for 182,000 employees. Adoption of the firm's proprietary tools is above 70%, Citi CEO Jane Fraser told analysts during the bank's earnings call last week.\n\nAnd it's clear that she has high expectations for all employees, including accelerators. In a January memo, she told staff she expected \"a more disciplined, more confident\" workforce in 2026, and that AI will likely \"reshape how work gets done.\"\n\nAmong the bank's range of initiatives to encourage AI uptake, the accelerators and champions model is uniquely embedded throughout teams and based on peer-to-peer interactions, said Carey Ryan, one of the initiative's leaders and the chief of staff for the technology organization.\n\n\"A small central team would never be able to reach where we are now,\" Ryan said.\n\nTech leaders at Citi came up with the program when brainstorming how to engage a wider swath of its population with AI, Ryan said. Originally, her team only planned to have 2,500 accelerators, but they saw more interest than expected and still maintain a waitlist for the program.\n\nWhile colleagues nominate champions for the position, anyone can volunteer to be an accelerator. The only requirement is being excited about AI, Ryan said.\n\nJosh Goldsmith is the AI champion for internal audit, where he's also the head of digital solutions and innovation. He's been a part of the program since its inception, and said that \"demystifying AI\" is among its greatest successes so far.\n\n\"It's a lot different when you hear from a colleague as to how you can leverage these tools, as opposed to having someone who's, let's say, a technologist trying to push this,\" he said. \"To be able to see someone put it in action: 'Hey, they can do it! I'm just like them, I can do it as well.'\"\n\nRyan also said that the peer-to-peer approach is part of what makes the initiative work, since a more general team couldn't understand all of the job-specific AI use cases across the bank. She added that accelerators have helped host more than 100 Citi AI Days, where they hold demonstrations and answer questions.\n\nAccelerators meet with their cohorts two times each month to participate in demos, learn about new tools, get training, or talk about their recent work. Goldsmith oversees around 50 participants; between attending their meetings and his own bi-monthly champion meetings, he said he devotes between three and five hours to the program each week, on top of his usual job.\n\nThe program members can also opt into trainings on topics including agentic AI to earn visual \"AI badges,\" which they can include in their email signatures. There are no specific engagement metrics, though, and people can drop out of the program if it becomes too demanding a time commitment.\n\n\"One accelerator might have five interactions, and maybe they're five small interactions,\" Ryan said. \"Another accelerator might have one really big interaction, where they're doing something with hundreds of people.\"\n\nAmong the AI peer coaches in internal audit, between 70% and 80% have stayed in the program, Goldsmith said. He added that, despite the extra hours, participating has given him a broader perspective on AI across Citi, and \"a clear vision in terms of what's coming next.\"\n\nFor Carey, there's something of a symbiotic relationship between program leads, participants, and the rest of the bank. Accelerators will explain what they're hearing from their lines of business — where people are struggling, what they might need — as Citi continues to fine-tune its approach to AI. They have, for example, helped Citi tweak AI tools, suggesting enhancements like adding notifications and allowing employees to upload larger files.\n\n\"It's an important conduit for feedback back in,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "DoorDash, one of the biggest names in delivery, is trying to deliver even more.\n\nThe company's couriers, known internally as \"dashers,\" are a common sight as they zip around the US delivering food, groceries, and other goods to customers.\n\nNow, DoorDash is investing in new tech, including autonomous vehicles, as it looks to the future. CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call in November that DoorDash would invest hundreds of millions of dollars this year in key initiatives, including a global tech platform for all its brands and autonomous tech.\n\nDoorDash employees don't just work on big problems, though. The company requires its corporate workforce to periodically make deliveries themselves through a program called WeDash.\n\nSome of the people making all of that happen at DoorDash corporate have joined the company from outside the US, and the company has sponsored H-1B visas.\n\nEmployers include salary information when submitting applications to the US Department of Labor for H-1B work visas. The publicly available data includes ranges for base pay, but excludes equity or other benefits that companies often offer employees. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers in similar roles.\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2025, DoorDash submitted roughly 540 H-1B visa applications, which can offer insight into what the delivery company pays for certain jobs.\n\nThe H-1B visa application process is changing under President Donald Trump.\n\nIn September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which DoorDash has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.

    "title": "I flew to Bali for a surf camp. A conversation I had there about failure inspired me to launch a small business.",
    "description": "Gina Jaguttis shared how two solo trips to Bali led her to start her slow fashion business as a side hustle.",
    "fullText": "On a Monday morning in early December, I met Gina Jaguttis as we loaded our surfboards into the camp van just before sunrise. We only got to talking on a choppy boat ride that took us a mile off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe 26-year-old real estate project manager from Munich came to the surf camp to improve her skills on the water. I came to talk with adventurous travelers about their big ideas, from new businesses to life after layoffs.\n\nAt our camp's bonfire that night, she began to tell me why she made a second solo expedition to the tropical island. As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",

    "description": "Hady Kfoury, founder of Naya, said working in fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants made him realize some common misconceptions about the business.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Hady Kfoury, the founder of Naya, a fast-casual Lebanese-inspired food chain with more than 40 locations on the East Coast. Naya plans to have 200 locations nationwide by 2030. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI studied hospitality in Switzerland and then came to New York to work under celebrity chefs, Daniel Boulud and François Payard, so I had experience in fine dining. When I decided to open the first Naya in 2008, that was more or less my comfort zone.\n\nA week after we launched, we got an amazing article in the New York Times and then we were packed for lunch and dinner. It definitely helped prevent us from shutting down after a few months.\n\nA couple of years in, we realized the food worked incredibly well in a faster and more accessible format. If you go to a Lebanese restaurant, you have all these mezze in the middle of the table, like a plate with a variety of dips and vegetables, and you're putting scoops on your plate. That's how we eat usually. So that's why I shifted my focus into a fast-casual model.\n\nToday, we have 44 restaurants and we are riding the wave of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine in general. It's definitely become mainstream, which is totally different than almost 20 years ago when I started the business.\n\nAs we scale, I've found there are four major misconceptions about the restaurant business.\n\nA lot of people think fast-casual restaurants are easy. It is not easy. Serving more guests at a faster pace doesn't mean it's a simple effort; it means you should master your systems and consistency at scale, possibly even more rigor than in fine dining.\n\nThe biggest challenge we have is that you're on an assembly line. You're not cooking per order. It's a problem for any restaurant with a service line. How do you plan to rotate food in a certain way, and to cook it a certain amount, so the food remains fresh and not overcooked?\n\nMy R&D doesn't stop. It keeps me up at night thinking about how we can keep improving what we do. And any change you make to improve something, you're rolling it out at 44 restaurants, so you have to be very mindful and careful.\n\nGrowing only works when the business fundamentals — training, supply chain, quality control — are built to handle it repeatedly. Growing without readiness is chaotic.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2020, I grew Naya to seven restaurants without any partners because all I cared about was being profitable and having a great team in place. Growth only works when you have those fundamentals. In 2020, I partnered with a private-equity firm, which was initially scary, but the rules were clear from day one that we would prioritize those fundamentals.\n\nSome people think cutting corners gets you a more profitable bottom line, but that is not the case. Cutting costs often undermines guest trust. You lose the customer trust, and the brands that endure are the ones that deliver authenticity, quality, and transparency every time.\n\nWe're trying to be very affordable, and we fall somewhere in the middle of the category, but I will never drop quality. I recently partnered with Pat LaFrieda, one of the best high-end butchers in the tristate. Even with our vegetables, we try to get deliveries three to four times per week rather than two times where you could get cheaper products.\n\nPeople think that it's all about the food, but people matter so much too. What keeps guests coming back and what keeps your team thriving is a culture of service, training, and retention.\n\nI take extremely good care of my team. Most of our general managers are grown within the company and we have very low staff turnover.\n\nGreat food is really important, but there's a people component to it that you can't avoid.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luisa Zhou. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy parents raised me to get good grades, go to a good college, and get a good job. They were entirely focused on security because they didn't want my sister and me to experience the hardships that they had as immigrants. They encouraged me not to take risks — just keep my head down, work hard, and appreciate what I had.\n\nThe day I got into Princeton, I thought, \"Thank goodness. I'm going to be OK.\" I graduated with an engineering degree and started working in analytics at a financial services company.\n\nIt was what I'd been raised to do, but from the beginning, it wasn't a good fit. I hated that my boss wouldn't let me leave before 5, even if I'd finished all my work. Still, I thought that if I climbed the corporate ladder, the work might become more challenging and fulfilling.\n\nIn my early 20s, I met a man who was launching a startup. He brought me on as cofounder because of my engineering background. Raising money for the startup opened my eyes to a whole new world of career options. That venture failed, but it gave me a different skill set and worldview.\n\nAfter that, I started working at a digital ad startup. I had a six-figure salary and a cool job, but I still wanted more.\n\nThen, my family had a difficult year: my dad had heart surgery, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my little sister experienced an eye injury that required her to sit in the dark for weeks on end. My sister was staying with me, and as I shut the door on the way to work one day, she quietly said \"Bye.\" It broke my heart that I had to leave her.\n\nThat's the moment I vowed to do something that would let me spend more time with the people I loved.\n\nI'm fairly risk-averse, so I didn't do anything sudden. Instead, I spent the next two years building my side business, offering coaching, ad consulting, and other services. I was working on my lunch break and at night, so I had even less time for family than before.\n\nThat's where my background really helped me. My parents and grandparents raised me on a Chinese proverb: \"First bitter, then sweet.\" I knew I was working hard then, so I could enjoy the fruits later.\n\nThose early years were challenging because I'm not naturally confident. It seemed like no one believed in me. I was seen as nice, but not necessarily smart or business-minded. That gave me a chip on my shoulder, and I was determined to prove myself. The year I was 26, the business did more than $1 million in revenue. Last year, I did more than $1.5 million in revenue, while working fewer hours.\n\nAt first, I didn't understand that $1 million doesn't mean you're a millionaire, especially when you factor in costs and taxes. I still needed to learn about managing money and work on my own mindset about spending. As I did that, my wealth really accumulated: by the time I was 30, I had $1 million in investable assets.\n\nToday, I'm 36. Although I'm a millionaire, my parents still nervously ask me if work is going OK every time we speak. They don't understand this alternative path, and that's OK. We just don't talk about it much.\n\nHaving financial security was worth the non-stop work in those earlier years. These days, I typically work about four hours a day. I limit my screen time and only book phone calls two weeks out of the month. I spend about two hours each day walking my German Shepherd, and I have the flexibility to spend time with my husband — he's a doctor, so his schedule is much more demanding. I can easily travel to visit my parents.\n\nIt took a lot to get here, but I'm so glad that I've been able to step away from the time-money trade-off.",

    "description": "Most organizations try to change workplace behavior through education, communication campaigns, and training, but these efforts are costly and rarely translate into measurable shifts in how people actually act on the job. A new four-step model can help. The process starts with rigorously targeting a single, high-impact behavior or decision; then building a data-driven theory of change; then embedding timely interventions into the specific moments when people make choices; and finally testing impact. By trading broad, one-off initiatives for focused, well-timed, and empirically tested changes, organizations can assemble portfolios of small interventions that add up to large, demonstrable improvements in employee experience and business outcomes.",

But how should organizations go about influencing behavior? Most HR and leadership teams follow an intuitive model—they inform and inspire with education and communication campaigns, and they build capability with training and development programs. On the face of it, that seems like a watertight strategy. After all, if people are informed that a change is good for them and are given the capabilities to make that change, then surely change will happen.",

But their decision to go public could serve as a stamp of approval for smaller companies to dive in as well.\n\n\"Having a mindset change is really important,\" Taylor told me, and those larger companies will give the public markets a stamp of approval, he added.\n\nSo which ones will IPO this year? Taylor declined to speculate on that — I asked — but he did say he could see a domino effect among the big players once one makes the leap.\n\nWhile there's no official confirmation of what Trump plans to talk about, it's likely that the ongoing saga of his desire to make Greenland part of the US will feature heavily.\n\nWhile there's no official confirmation of what Trump plans to talk about, it's likely that the ongoing saga of his desire to make Greenland part of the US will feature heavily.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump said that from February 1, he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, which controls Greenland, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, unless they agree to a deal to hand over Greenland to the United States.\n\nEuropean leaders have been unequivocal in their opposition to Trump's plan, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday morning giving a nationwide address to condemn the new tariffs and defend Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland.\n\nWhile Greenland seems most likely, Trump's speech may focus on something completely different, with rumors swirling in the rarified air of the Swiss Alps that he could make a major announcement during the speech.\n\n\"All we are hearing is that it's going to be BIG BIG BIG and to clear our schedules,\" veteran journalist Steve Clemons wrote in his \"Washington Note\" newsletter late on Sunday.\n\nDavos kicks off in earnest this evening at around 6 p.m. local time (midday ET), with a curtain-raising concert from Grammy winner Jon Batiste, French violinist Renaud Capuçon, and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.

    "fullText": "Sen. Bernie Sanders wants a nationwide pause on AI data center construction. Few of his colleagues are willing to go there yet.\n\n\"In terms of the actual policy prescription, it's something that I haven't made a determination yet on,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told Business Insider.\n\nThe Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate first made the call in December, saying in a video posted to X that a national moratorium would \"give democracy a chance to catch up with the transformative changes\" that the technology is bringing.\n\nSanders told Business Insider last week that he plans to introduce legislation to back up his call soon.\n\n\"There's enormous issues for our economy and for our democracy that have got to be dealt with,\" Sanders said. \"And I feel we're not ready to do that.\"\n\nBut his proposal is unlikely to become reality, given GOP control of Washington.\n\n\"I mean, this Congress isn't going to do that,\" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin told Business Insider. \"He's pointing out the right problems.\"\n\nRepublicans have been generally dismissive of Sanders's idea. Even Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a major critic of the AI industry, signaled he wouldn't go as far.\n\n\"If these AI companies want to build these data centers and local folks want to give them permits for it, I mean, that's up to local voters,\" Hawley told Business Insider.\n\nA handful of Sanders's progressive allies are backing him up. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told Business Insider that a moratorium \"would be a good idea,\" while Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan issued a full-throated endorsement in a post on X.\n\n\"I fully support the call for a national AI data center moratorium,\" Tlaib wrote.\n\nAnd while few Democrats have fully endorsed the idea, it's spurring a conversation within the party about the impact of data centers and AI.\n\n\"I don't want a moratorium on data centers but Bernie is right that we are sleepwalking past risks which alarm even the optimists,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii wrote on X last month.\n\n\"What we do know is that these AI data centers are just uncontrollably jacking up people's energy costs,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider. \"There are a lot of problems that arise from these data centers, and I think that they certainly should not be getting the blank check from Congress.\"\n\n\"Bernie makes clear that the debate over AI is not about states rights or affordability,\" White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks wrote on X in December. \"He would block new data centers even if states want them & they generate their own power. It's about stopping progress completely so China wins the AI race.\"\n\nYet even the administration has come to recognize that data centers are engendering local resistance, in large part due to rising electricity costs.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump declared that he wanted Big Tech firms to \"pay their own way\" on data centers, with AI companies footing more of the bill for the electricity their facilities consume.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAnd on Friday, the administration and a group of governors called on a major power grid operator to hold a new emergency power auction amid rising costs driven by AI data centers.",

    "description": "Times journalists got a rare look inside one of the compounds where the online fraud industry makes its billions. Inspirational slogans (“Keep going”) were just the start.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from Min Let Pan, Myanmar\n\nIn a Southeast Asian war zone, cloaked in dense rainforest, the Chinese settlement dedicated to scamming people from Kentucky to Kazakhstan grew fast on fertile ground.\n\nOver just a few months, a sprawling office park materialized and metastasized in the chaotic borderlands of Myanmar, with cavernous rooms holding rows of computer monitors and walls decorated with inspirational work slogans: “Dream chaser,” “Keep going,” “Making money matters the most.” In video conference suites, bookshelves stocked with fake business tomes and ersatz modern art simulated the kind of boardroom a successful crypto investor might inhabit.\n\nThe scam center, Shunda Park, opened for business in 2024 with more than 3,500 workers from nearly 30 nations, including Namibia, Russia, Zimbabwe and France. Some had been kidnapped and enslaved, but all had become skilled in the art of the online grift. When the scammers bilked $5,000 out of someone, they struck a Chinese gong. A $50,000 shakedown earned a celebratory pounding of a giant drum, then an offering to a Chinese deity resplendent in his golden altar.\n\nWhile each nationality required a different approach — for Americans, one scammer told me, the preferred mark was “white old men” — the general approach was the same: an online foray by a sympathetic and attractive person, followed by an invitation to participate in a select investment opportunity.\n\nVictims were not just lonely hearts or technologically timid retirees. Using generative intelligence and deepfake videos, as well as fraudulent businesses, websites and financial apps, the scammers at Shunda embraced the long con and reeled in people from almost every demographic.\n\nBut in late November, Shunda Park was unexpectedly captured by a rebel force long at odds with the Myanmar military, whose coup nearly five years ago catapulted this Southeast Asian nation into civil war and created a chaotic space for criminality to thrive. The photographer Jes Aznar and I were granted rare access to the scam compound to document the inner sanctum of this secretive, highly fortified industry. Shunda Park had been closed for business by the rebel militia, but we were able to meet some of its scammers, both those who were trying to return home and others who wanted to find another job in the fraud business.\n\nWith millions of people falling victim to online shakedowns every year, the cyberscamming industry has quickly grown into one of the planet’s most lucrative criminal enterprises, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nIn the United States alone, in 2024, at least $10 billion was stolen through cyberscams run out of Southeast Asia, the U.S. Treasury Department said. That figure is likely only a fraction of the true toll because victims are often too embarrassed to admit they have been fooled. Late last year, the United States formed its first ever federal task force to combat scam centers and the Chinese transnational crime networks that American investigators say run them.\n\nThe Myanmar junta, which has imprisoned members of an elected government and killed thousands of civilians, recently vowed to tackle the scam networks. But its current crackdown feels like a Potemkin exercise. The global profits from online cons rival the gross domestic products of the countries where the fraud factories have proliferated, including Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.\n\nThese illicit proceeds do not just line the pockets of the gangs, most of which are originally from China; dirty money also flows to powerful elites across the region — most of all, crime-watchers say, to powerful people in the conflict-ridden, failed state of Myanmar.\n\nOur journey to Shunda Park occurred during what was supposed to be a lull in the fighting between the Myanmar military and the opposition militia, known as the Karen National Liberation Army. (The Karen, pronounced Kuh-REN, are one of Myanmar’s many ethnic groups that have been persecuted by the military for generations.)\n\nWhat we discovered inside Shunda Park’s thick walls ringed by razor wire resembled a set for an apocalyptic film. Amid white office blocks, Chinese restaurants and luxury villas reserved for the compound’s Chinese bosses, bonfires burned, consuming the tools of the illicit economy. Piles of electronic equipment — keyboards, tangles of cables and thousands of cellphones — littered the site. In some buildings, with nearly every step I took, I crunched on SIM cards, scattered like snow in the tropical heat.\n\nWhile members of the Karen militia handed over armfuls of evidence to the police in Thailand, along with a man identified as the compound’s Chinese boss, no representatives of foreign governments or intelligence agencies have come to Shunda Park to investigate. Now, the fighting has intensified, and all of Shunda Park’s workers have scattered. Other proof of scamming has gone up in flames.\n\n“We are trying our best, but we are not scam experts,” said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the spokesman for the K.N.L.A.’s political wing, as he leafed through a notebook with instructions on how to cheat middle-aged women in Taiwan. “We do not like that our land is known as the place where criminals cheat people.”\n\nThe layers of victimhood at a place like Shunda Park are complex. Many of the scammers who worked here say they were duped, too. They arrived in neighboring Thailand, thinking they had been hired for well-paying tech or marketing jobs. Others thought they were checking out merchandise for online sales businesses. Instead, they were hustled at gunpoint across the river that demarcates the border with Myanmar.\n\nI spoke with several scammers whose bodies bore scars from beatings or tight shackles. They never received payment for their 12-hour shifts, they said. Life was a Sisyphean loop: sleep, eat, scam, eat, sleep, scam.\n\nKason, a 22-year-old from Malaysia who is being identified only by his first name, said he suffered only two “hard” beatings. But his legs and torso were crisscrossed with traces of lacerations from what he called “many, many” smaller beatings.\n\nHis job for more than a year was to send endless “hellos” into the social media ether. If he did not receive responses from at least 5 percent of the greetings, then he would be punished physically, he said.\n\nIvan, a Malaysian who once worked as a member of the ground staff at the Singapore airport, said he was chained in a crucifixion position and denied food for days.\n\n“You think you know hell,” he said, “and it’s actually even worse.”\n\nIn one of the Shunda Park workrooms, bobblehead dolls and fake gold bars enlivened the space. At the front, near a statue of a Chinese god worshiped by the gangsters, were three port-a-potty style boxes that scammers said were used as punishment chambers, in clear sight of the rest of the room. Elsewhere in the compound, behind a barbecue restaurant, a row of cement torture cells was outfitted with bars and shackles.\n\nNot all the workers at Shunda landed there unwillingly. Many of the Chinese employees at Shunda Park received salaries, a review of records in one finance office shows. A company called Huisheng International, for instance, had stacks of wage receipts, sick-leave forms and medical tests for H.I.V. and syphilis, among other diseases, all written in Chinese. Employees were identified by nicknames like “Eastern Dragon” or “Little Li.” Contracts in the office specified that workers would be bound by Myanmar labor law.\n\nWhile most of the workers at Shunda Park were transported to safety via Thailand, about 900 Chinese workers refused to leave for more than two weeks, despite the compound being in the middle of an active conflict zone. The Chinese government has periodically cracked down on the scamming industry, arresting Chinese workers who are repatriated. So tense was the situation that days before our visit, some Chinese workers had tried unsuccessfully to wrestle weapons away from the Karen soldiers, according to members of the militia and other scammers who witnessed the melee.\n\nAll but one Chinese man at the compound refused to speak with me. The scammers shielded their faces with their hands or with masks. The one worker who agreed to talk said he had been promised a salary of 30,000 yuan a month, or $4,250. But upon arriving, he said, he only received 30,000 Thai baht a month, or $940. Records in the finance office showed base salaries of that amount.\n\n“They tricked me,” he said of his employers. The boom of shelling punctuated our conversation.\n\nAround him, rotten food festered. On the basketball court and by a nightclub, fires smoldered. A French bulldog that used to be cared for by one of the compound’s Chinese managers padded by, before collapsing in the shade provided by a luxury sedan. The cars on site came from all over Myanmar, including a fire department vehicle from halfway across the country. There was also an oil tanker truck with Chinese license plates.\n\nThe Myanmar military appears determined to reclaim Shunda Park, even as it dynamites buildings in other scam centers to show it is tough on crime. Workers at those raided sites, also run by Chinese criminal networks, however, say the crackdowns are just for show. In fact, some of the workers at Shunda said they had just arrived from these cleared out compounds. With international sanctions biting, Myanmar’s generals, supported by business allies and sympathetic militias, have embraced various illicit economies, making the country a global crime capital.\n\nOutside the scam compounds, life is impoverished and insecure. The Myanmar military regularly launches airstrikes around Shunda Park, and across the rest of the country, targeting civilians. More than 3.5 million people nationwide are now displaced.\n\nAs the shelling intensified, we climbed into pickup trucks and sped away. Our driver, the commander of the K.N.L.A.’s special forces, varied his speed to ward off the suicide drones that terrorize the area’s roads. A few days before, an armed drone detonated a bus length away from one of the trucks.\n\nIn the next village, in an area where an ethnic armed group aligned with the junta had held sway, I spotted more neat rows of scam centers being built, Chinese red lanterns hanging from the eaves. Chinese workers wandered through the construction site, shirts off in the heat.\n\nA few days later, the 900 or so Chinese workers left Shunda. Some went over the border to Thailand. But most headed to other Chinese compounds in the wilds of Myanmar, where scammers are busy finding their next victims.\n\nBerry Wang contributed research.",

    "fullText": "My wife and I met nearly two decades ago in the same newsroom. We were cub reporters, then friends, and then started dating. Eventually, we got married. Now we have two kids.\n\nI'd say it's a sweet story — and an increasingly antiquated one.\n\nDating in 2026 looks quite different. Dating apps have gone from taboo to mainstream to played out. Now, a white-collar job apocalypse and a cutthroat AI arms race have people working harder than ever, and that's put dating on the back burner for plenty of folks.\n\nMy colleague Henry Chandonnet reports on a new phenomenon taking hold in Silicon Valley. He says tech's dating scene, which was never particularly hot, has frozen over.\n\nHenry spoke with more than two dozen young tech professionals in the Bay Area who described a dating culture shaped by anxiety and exhaustion. There's a large cohort who have sworn off dating entirely, with many \"locked in\" on building their careers.\n\nIt all shows how the rules of romance are changing.\n\nTake LinkedIn. What appears to be a strictly career-focused platform has quietly morphed into a shadow dating app. In the age of remote work, users are sending banal LinkedIn requests under the guise of networking. In reality, they're screening potential love interests.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional dating apps are turning to AI to bring back lapsed users. Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble are pouring millions into generative AI matchmaking tools that promise fewer swipes and deeper connections. A new crop of AI-first dating startups is making the same promise: Let the bots do the work of sifting through people and finding your perfect match. AI wingmen are a thing now.\n\nThere's stuff IRL, too. Partiful, the social event invite app, recently launched \"Crush,\" a feature that lets users discreetly signal interest in people they've met at real-world events.\n\nIf the crush is mutual, you'll get a notification affirming that the person \"has a crush on you too!\" Think Tinder without the swiping — dating layered onto genuine social overlap.\n\nWe're optimizing everything these days, dating included. But at the end of the day, maybe we all just want to ditch the algorithms and find connections that feel human again.\n\nOr maybe we're all destined for AI spouses instead.\n\nWhat do you think of the dating landscape?

    "description": "Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter spoke to Business Insider on how humanoid robots will take over the factory and when they'll come to our homes.",
    "fullText": "In a few years, factory employees at Hyundai's massive Georgia plant could be getting a new coworker.\n\nIt's about 200 pounds, six-feet, two-inches tall, has a four-hour battery life, and a face inspired by Disney's Pixar lamp, Luxor Jr.\n\nIts name is Atlas, an all-electric humanoid robot from Boston Dynamics, the Massachusetts-based company and maker of the four-legged inspection robot, Spot, and the mobile warehouse robot, Stretch.\n\nHyundai, which owns Boston Dynamics, unveiled the latest version of Atlas at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5. During live demonstrations, Atlas was seen waving hello to its audience before moving car parts from one rack to another.\n\nThis is how the humanoid robot revolution starts, according to Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter.\n\n\"We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing,\" Playter said in an interview with Business Insider. Eventually, the tasks get more complex, and Atlas will be on the assembly line. Then, the CEO said, perhaps in five to 10 years' time, the robots will enter our homes.\n\nPlayter, an MIT alumn and aerospace engineer by training, has been at Boston Dynamics for more than 30 years and has seen the company change hands multiple times — first to Google, then to SoftBank, and now to Hyundai after the South Korean automaker acquired a majority stake in the robotics company five years ago.\n\nPlayter was appointed CEO in 2019. Since then, he has steered the company through its commercial launch of Spot, Atlas' transition from a hydraulics platform to an all-electric platform, and more recently, Boston Dynamics' partnership with Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research lab, to help build Atlas' \"brain.\"\n\nThe CEO spoke to Business Insider on the Atlas demonstration floor about how humanoid robots will transform the workplace before they take over our homes, the problems still to be solved before humanoids can work, and why Atlas looks like a Disney-inspired character.\n\nThe interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nIs there a story behind Atlas' face?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of the humanoid producers create what I would call scary, dystopian robot faces. It's like, oh my god, there's this black face. Is that a human shape? Why can't I see it? It's just scary.\n\nSo we tried to go the other way, and the shape is really driven from the Pixar lamp, the original friendly mechanism. We wanted to forecast that this is not a human. It is a machine — it's a friendly machine.\n\nIs this what you imagined the robot takeover looking like when you were at MIT about 40 years ago?\n\nI think it's what we dreamed about. But we've been doing humanoids since 2008. We've been doing this for a long time. But for us to be approaching a point where we're really thinking about commercializing the humanoid, I don't know that we expected that years ago. The turning point has been AI. It's really the enabler that lets a robot like this do a huge variety of tasks, which is what's needed to really make these generalizable.\n\nIs AI the main technological advancement that's transformed the robot?\n\nThere's a lot of hardware advancements as well. The early robots were hydraulic. These are all electric. This is our newest version that is going to be mass-produced. And it's designed for simplicity and cost. If you notice, there's a lot of similar joints and shapes on this robot — it's really built to be modular. There's only three different types of motors, which means we're going to be able to mass-produce them at scale and get the cost down. The joints all have 360-degree rotation, which is why you see these crazy inside-out yoga motion. And it's strong. This robot's going to be able to pick up 110 pounds.\n\nA few years ago, Aaron Saunders, the former CTO, talked about the bipedal form factor and how it's not the best for every task. That's why you have Stretch, for example, to carry boxes. Has that mentality shifted at Boston?\n\nI think we're still going to see lots of different morphologies for different applications. But one of the great things about humanoids is people are just fascinated by them, and they could be truly general-purpose. With two manipulators, you could basically pick up and put down almost anything that a person could do. You can go to almost any place that a person can go to.\n\nIs the tradeoff of tackling the technical challenges of doing a humanoid worth it compared to sticking with a robot like Stretch that can perform limited tasks but is already deployed?\n\nDefinitely, there's more complexity. This has 56 degrees of freedom. Stretch is going to work in warehouses. Humanoids could potentially work anywhere and eventually in our homes. So the generality of this shape is really what lends it power. It's the best robot we've ever built. It's the one we've built to be mass-producible right out of the gate. But there's still complexity that has to get solved. Part of that's in the AI. We've solved a lot of the hardware parts; now we need to go solve the AI problems.\n\nSo there's still something to solve between now and 2028 deployment.\n\nAbsolutely. What we've seen is that AI techniques allow us to get an unprecedented diversity of skills onto the robots quickly, but we really need to generalize that. If you're going to have a robot that's actually useful in the factory, it's got to do a hundred different tasks, not just one or two. And it's really the AI that's going to enable that. We also have to make that unprecedented reliability — 99.9% reliable. The AI is not quite there yet, but it's very promising.\n\nIs there a specific number of tasks Atlas needs to achieve that will make it ready to be shipped out?\n\nWe need to be able to bring a new task to bear in a day or two. And that's because, I think in a factory, there's literally hundreds of tasks, and the tasks evolve. So yeah, every 24 or 48 hours to get a new task onto a robot.\n\nHow do you imagine Atlas transforming the workplace, starting with the factory?\n\nThere's a lot of logistics work that has to be done in an automotive factory — a huge variety of pick-and-place tasks to get all the pieces of the car to the line. Atlas is going to start in that sequencing — it's called parts sequencing. It's really a logistics task. And as the capabilities get more sophisticated, we're going to eventually start entering assembly tasks. We're going to deal with heavy lifting, repeatable tasks that tend to wear people out. That's kind of what we're doing with Stretch, which is unloading trailing. The people who used to unload trailers now operate the robot. We see the same thing happening in factories. Factory workers are going to be the trainers of these new technologies.\n\nCan the workers interact with the robots and talk to them?\n\nYes. We have demonstrations of some of these behaviors where we just tell the robot, \"Empty out this bin of parts,\" and it'll go do that. That is all part of the package, and we really want to just make it a seamless interaction.\n\nIs there a list of tasks you believe Atlas will be best for and ones that Atlas will avoid?\n\nWe've analyzed all the jobs that have to occur in an automotive factory. We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing. And then above that, you have gradations of complexity. Do you have to get inside the car to fit something? Do you have to do a close-tolerant fit? Do you have to deal with flexible wiring harness? Those things are more complex, and it's going to take more time to bring to bear. So, we're starting with the simple stuff, and then it'll grow over time.\n\nThere's a lot of ambivalence around robots taking over our jobs. Has Boston Dynamics done an analysis of how many jobs one Atlas can actually replace or take on?\n\nLet me get to the ambivalence. There's a feeling of a little anxiety around robots in general. What we're actually finding when we bring robots into the workplace is that people end up enjoying interacting with the robots.\n\nSome of the people who used to unload trailers now operate Stretch. They just got upskilled. They like their job more now that Stretch is doing the heavy-lifting. And I think there's a great potential with AI-powered robots that anybody can interact with them and train them. It will not require an advanced engineering degree, and that essentially opens up the productivity enhancements to regular workers. I think it's going to be a symbiosis.\n\nSo, less about human replacement?\n\nI think so. We're going to build a whole new industry. There's going to be a lot of jobs created just building, maintaining, deploying, and training robots.\n\nAnd if you've paid attention to demographic trends worldwide, population has decreased everywhere. If we're going to bring manufacturing back to the United States, we have to increase productivity. And I think robotics is a way to increase the productivity of our workforce.\n\nSo Boston Dynamics doesn't have a metric or ratio — like, one Atlas robot can do the job of five humans?\n\nI think it depends totally on the task. And so we don't have that metric yet. The way we measure that in the Stretch is it's all about case pick rate: How many boxes can you pick per hour, and how does that compare to the humans that did that job? And we pretty much have to at least match that. In some cases, we can exceed it, but in some cases, people are still better because the robots aren't quite smarter.\n\nHow do you pitch companies on Atlas? Do you tell them they can save X amount of money?\n\nWe have experience doing this with Spot. Companies typically want to see a return on investment in around two to three years.\n\nWe talk a lot about AI talent wars. Is it competitive for Boston Dynamics?\n\nHoly, it's crazy. We need the same AI talent that Meta and Google and Nvidia are all hiring, so it's extremely competitive. The thing we have that nobody else has, which is important for the top talent, is really exciting robots.\n\nDo you have Atlas running around in your home right now for testing?\n\nNo, we have it in the lab. We had Spots at home. During COVID, everybody had to go home, and our developers just took the robots home with them. We probably paid for the damage to the house when they ran into the walls.\n\nHa, the real test case. Well, the goal with Atlas is to bring them home, too, right?\n\nEventually. We see industrial as the first stepping stone for three reasons.\n\nCost. These first robots are going to be a little bit too expensive for consumer level. Safety. Factories are a safer environment. You can control it a little bit more than the home. And then capabilities.\n\nAt home, you've got the worst of all worlds. It has to be the cheapest, it has to be the most safe, and it's the most complex environment.\n\nWe're going to get to home, I'd say, in five to 10 years. The next five years we're really focusing on industrial applications.\n\nIs there something your competitors don't understand about deploying humanoid robots?\n\nI think they understand it just fine. They're just playing a slightly different game.\n\nThis is a very expensive business to be in. It takes billions of dollars of investment to sort of get this technology to where it needs to be. If you're going to play that game, you got to have the largest possible market. So, of course, they're saying they're going to go home. It's the large end market, but I just think that's a mistake.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shiyao Tang, a 34-year-old business owner based in New York City and Paris. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was on a very strong upward trajectory in my manager role at DoorDash when I quit in 2025. I was making $390,000 and felt that I still had room to grow, but when I was honest with myself, my heart wasn't in it.\n\nLeaving to start my own silk womenswear brand wasn't an instantaneous decision; it was a long-term calling inside of me. It took a lot of courage to quit and choose the unknown.\n\nI still constantly ask myself if I made a huge mistake. I think to myself, \"How could I just leave a job that most people would dream of?\" It was high-paying, the benefits were great, and there was room for learning. But I don't want to look back and think I climbed the wrong mountain.\n\nIn 2022, I was hired as a strategy and operations manager on the homepage team at DoorDash. My job was challenging, and I got to wear a lot of hats. I also developed deep friendships with some truly talented people.\n\nHowever, I realized I missed the feeling of being close to the people I was building for.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a small entrepreneurial chapter where I worked on a fashion wholesale startup. I built my own customers from the ground up and interacted with them every day.\n\nWhen I was 16, I moved from China to the US and later spent a year studying abroad in Paris. I've always lived between cultures and felt super energized by working with people from distinct backgrounds and creative disciplines. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted my career to reflect that part of me, too.\n\nTech created a structure for me to learn and expand my horizon, but I was ready to try entrepreneurship again. I spent a lot of time journaling and reflecting on what business I really wanted to make.\n\nEvery weekend was dedicated to foundational discovery work and even talking to potential customers or friends to get some early feedback on different ideas. I even started connecting with other young, inspiring entrepreneurs at founder events, which expanded my horizons regarding what life might look like as an entrepreneur.\n\nFrankly, I was extremely scared every day, but seeing people thrive gave me more confidence to envision what it might look like for me. I decided on my business, Soir Si, where I make simple, minimal sculptural silk pieces. The mission is to make luxury accessible.\n\nEven though I was sure of my decision, walking away was scary, and honestly, it was really sad for me. However, the thought of not pushing to the edge of my potential was scarier than quitting.\n\nI have my own apartment in NYC, and I spend half my time in Paris, typically staying with friends or family, to fuel my creative inspiration during the design process.\n\nThe first month after quitting, I focused on building a strong visual and emotional identity for Soir Si by enrolling in online courses and even partnering with a freelancer. The next stages were developing my website, connecting directly with customers, and using my branding and website to open up my supply chain.\n\nNow I'm focused on securing and strengthening those relationships while sprinting toward product development.\n\nRight after quitting, I was so focused on transitioning into entrepreneurship that I didn't have time for self-doubt. I felt a mix of grief and sadness about leaving, but I also felt excitement about what was ahead of me. The doubts didn't start bubbling up until several weeks later, when I hit a steep learning curve. I realized I had no idea what went into manufacturing or production, or even how to find a pattern-maker.\n\nI remember the first time I visited some manufacturers in New York, they treated me like I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I didn't speak their \"language,\" and it felt alienating. However, those moments of self-doubt were always counterbalanced by the highs, such as building relationships with potential partners. For example, my branding designer is based in Italy, and my manufacturers are based in Portugal. Establishing those relationships from scratch without any experience gave me the assurance that I can really do this.\n\nEvery day, I wake up knowing I need to work really hard and give it my all to make this dream a reality. The gradual, positive feedback from peers or my audience feeds me every day, and it's fulfilling to work with people from around the world and get to talk about silk and the region it comes from.\n\nThere are still moments when I'm super scared about the path I chose. The self-doubt bubbles up, and it all feels overwhelming, but underneath it all is a steady sense that I'm building something that aligns with who I am, not just the perception of success or stability. I'm finally excited about life again.\n\nPeople might say this is a risky move, but everyone starts from nothing. I just had to be willing to take the first step.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting your six-figure job for a riskier path? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Industry experts told Business Insider that 2021-2022 was probably the top of the market, and luxury watch prices won't see a similar boom anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "The luxury watch market is coming off a wild sugar high.\n\nAfter what looked like an unstoppable rally in watch prices at the tail end of the pandemic, the market for high-end timepieces has cooled. The corner of the luxury consumer space could also be sluggish for years, with low single-digit growth that pales in comparison to the pandemic era, industry analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThat relative decline has been triggered by a few factors. While people have less time and money on their hands, less flashy, more austere fashion trends rooted in \"Quiet Luxury\" are also having an impact, watch industry insiders said.\n\nSecondhand prices in the luxury watch market have dropped sharply from their highs during the pandemic. The WatchCharts Overall Market Index, a gauge of secondhand luxury watch prices, is down 33% from its peak just after the pandemic, though it is up about 5% over the past year.\n\nHigh-end watches were the worst-performing luxury category last year, according to Claudia D'Arpizio, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Company.\n\nWhile a few dominant brands are seeing some growth — kingmakers like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet — virtually all high-end watchmakers in the business are struggling or stagnating at the moment, she said, even those with a \"great heritage\" name.\n\n\"The rest are all facing difficult times,\" she said, speculating that the watch market could continue to normalize and remain broadly weak for several years until the global economy enters a fresh growth cycle.\n\n\"Probably we are near the bottom, but it's really difficult to say,\" she said.\n\nRevenue growth in the broader online jewelry and watch business has collapsed from its 2020 peak. Growth is also expected to remain near zero through the end of the decade, even lower than the average growth rate in the years leading up to the pandemic, according to an estimate from IBISWorld.\n\nOliver Müller, a longtime consultant in the luxury watch business and the founder of LuxeConsult, said he believed 2021 and 2022 were likely the best-ever years for the watch market, with the industry unlikely to achieve a similar growth rate in the foreseeable future.\n\nHe attributed the post-COVID bubble to a unique cocktail of circumstances that pushed newcomers into the watch market — mainly, people having extra time on their hands to get into new hobbies, and the fact that crypto markets and meme stocks were delivering big gains in very little time for many traders.\n\n\"The crypto boys, as they call them, all of a sudden discovered that there was something called watches on which they could flip a lot of money,\" he said, referring to the practice of traders buying high-end watches to quickly resell them at a profit on the secondhand market.\n\n\"I don't think we will get back anytime soon to those crazy high prices that we have seen,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Morgan, another watch consultant, said he believed the market reached its zenith in 2022.\n\n\"I think to get to those prices, again, we're talking decades,\" he said, speculating that the market would only see \"shallow\" growth from here on out.\n\nThe pandemic-era watch vibe was marked by \"flashy\" styles and special edition models that flew off the shelves, D'Arpizio said. The buying spree was largely driven by ultrawealthy clients who were sitting on big gains on their investments and were willing to splurge.\n\nMany speculators in the market at the time also seemed to be interested in integrated or stainless steel sports watches, styles that tend to be associated with \"over wealth.\"\n\n\"Luxury watches got swept up as part of this whole affluent luxury, Instagram lifestyle,\" Morgan said.\n\nFor luxury watches, it seems to have kicked off a new era: one defined less by excess and more by refinement, D'Arpizio and Morgan said.\n\nThough there are exceptions, the worst-performing models on the market tend to be integrated and stainless-steel sports watches, Morgan said. While models from leading brands are still reaping a \"mild\" return on the secondary market, models from most other brands face a \"significant depreciation\" the minute they're sold, he said.\n\n\"Some of those really spiky hype watches have calmed down, and are continuing to calm down,\" Morgan said of watches that contributed to the pandemic spike. \"Collectors of classy reserve time pieces will still purchase those, but the reasoning for purchasing them has become more about a personal self-reflecting sense of achievement, rather than a publicly broadcast sense of self-achievement, if that makes sense.\"\n\nIt's difficult to equate \"quiet luxury\" with the watch market, since watches are by definition a status symbol, D'Arpizio. But she agrees a more \"conservative\" style has proliferated, with most consumers now focusing on classic pieces from timeless brands — something that can be worn again and again.\n\n\"These SKUs are superstars and very recognizable, so they are not really quiet, but for sure the model stays, and the value stays,\" she said of the more understated vibe among shoppers. \"They don't want to make a mistake, so they choose the safe side.\"",

    "description": "Tommy Bahama's restaurant is popular for a business lunch. We ate there to see why — and left simultaneously underwhelmed and somewhat sold.",
    "fullText": "The Tommy Bahama on 45th Street and 5th Avenue bills itself on its website as \"an oasis in the big city,\" a \"refuge\" that's \"ideal for business lunches.\" Geographically, it makes total sense — on foot, Tommy Bahama is six minutes from JPMorgan's new tower, nine minutes from Bank of America Tower, five minutes from a PWC building, and 12 minutes from the main Morgan Stanley office.\n\nWe'll spare you the full list of adjacent corporate headquarters.\n\nWe had a 12:30 p.m. reservation, and the restaurant kept filling up throughout our meal. Diners eventually sat at the bar, and when I, Alice, went to the bathroom around 1:20 p.m., a gaggle of waiters was congregating by the kitchen, discussing table numbers over a window crammed with burgers and salads.\n\nApart from the kitchen, though, the crowded restaurant didn't feel cramped. Tables were far enough apart that we couldn't hear others' conversations, yet the background din of conversation made the room feel lively. The only deal talk we overheard came from a woman on her way out, who mentioned her interest in bringing ESRT, the company that owns the Empire State Building, on as a client.\n\nSo when it comes to layout, it's not a bad spot for a semi-private, relatively casual business lunch.\n\nFor a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, the price point wasn't too surprising, but it seemed more suited to dinner than lunch. The cheapest item in the entrée section was $31.\n\nOne table of four almost entirely ordered the macadamia-nut-crusted fresh catch, and our waitress said the ahi tuna poke bowl was also a popular lunch choice. There were also a number of salad orders around the restaurant, which seemed fitting for lunch.\n\nThe $23 \"world-famous\" coconut shrimp appetizer arrived at our table fairly quickly — it was the only item we knew we had to try during our visit.\n\nThe shrimp sat atop a papaya and mango chutney, adding another layer of sweetness to the coconut coating. The cabbage salad that sat on top was our favorite part of the plate. The coleslaw was dressed with a light vinaigrette, and the cilantro added a nice freshness.\n\nUltimately, though, the overall dish was too sweet for our liking, and we left some lonely shrimp on the plate.\n\nI, Jordan, admit that I'm a newbie to ordering French dip sandwiches. I was expecting mine to come with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese. For $33, the Tommy Bahama wagyu French dip came with neither, despite the description listing sweet-and-sour onions as an ingredient.\n\nThe missing onions aside, I found myself taking some of the sliced beef off to make the sandwich a little easier to bite into. I felt kind of silly picking the valuable wagyu out of my sandwich, but I wanted to be able to close it properly. The broth was good for dipping, but I was left wanting more thinly sliced beef and additional ingredients.\n\nOur waitress surprised us with two free desserts: the piña colada cake and malted chocolate pie.\n\nThe cake was incredibly sweet, and we initially didn't realize it had any pineapple, but the whipped cream was, unsurprisingly, fantastic. Jordan said the chocolate pie was the only dish that tasted exactly as it looked. An Oreo crust is rarely a bad thing, but we agreed we wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor $145, we were sufficiently underwhelmed by the food. Then again, everyone else around us seemed pretty pleased, and the service is efficient without feeling rushed.\n\nAs a Wall Street go-to, Tommy Bahama presents a funny inverse. Many firms are setting up outposts in the south, namely in Texas, but the beachy restaurant is trying to bring southern, Floridian charm to 45th Street. And it is, at times, easy to forget that you're in the middle of Manhattan while sitting in the palm-filled dining room, until you look out the window, or at the guys in Charles Tyrwhitt vests sitting next to you.\n\nThe noise level and layout are conducive to a genuinely productive, laid-back business meal, and it's an easy escape from Manhattan's chaos. Provided you like the food, we see how it could become an unlikely power lunch staple.\n\nThe price is comparable to that of a steakhouse dinner, but it's nothing the corporate card can't handle, right?",

    "title": "I founded a wellness startup after leaving McKinsey. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.",
    "description": "Cesar Carvalho founded Wellhub, a corporate wellness platform. This is how he thinks companies should approach employee wellbeing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cesar Carvalho, the CEO and cofounder of Wellhub, a global corporate wellness platform. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI became interested in consulting through some older friends while studying at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Their stories about how fast you could learn and grow in the career made me want to pursue it.\n\nI applied to all the top firms and accepted McKinsey's offer to be a business analyst in 2010 as soon as I received it. It was the best thing I could imagine as a long-term career.\n\nI was at McKinsey for about two years before they encouraged me to pursue an MBA. At that time in Brazil, you could only become an associate or a manager if you had one.\n\nI applied to Harvard Business School with the intention of returning to McKinsey and continuing the consulting journey. But the summer of my first year in Boston, I had the idea of starting WellHub.\n\nThe working environment at McKinsey was super intense. I would do an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, and when there was a crunch, it could be more.\n\nAs a consultant, I often traveled to different cities or juggled between a client's office and McKinsey's office. There were no gym memberships that provided access to facilities in different locations.\n\nIf I were at a client site and had two hours before my next meeting, I would have nothing to do but extra work. I had three gym memberships that were going unused, and I wanted to feel less stressed and improve my well-being.\n\nMy experience showed me there was a need for busy workers to get convenient access to health and well-being. And I quickly realized that was true not just for CEOs, bankers, and consultants, but also for FedEx drivers and grocery store workers.\n\nIt's now been 14 years since I started Wellhub.\n\nWe're now in 18 countries, and partner with 40,000 companies to offer wellness to their employees, including many McKinsey offices. 5 million employees engage with Wellhub every month.\n\nWith Wellhub, employees can book a class regardless of the country or city they are in, without needing a membership for a specific gym or studio. Companies pay a fixed monthly fee based on their employee count, and employees also contribute.\n\nI grew a lot at McKinsey, and that was especially thanks to one thing — in two years, I worked under seven different partners, all with their own managing style.\n\nIt could change everything: the team culture, the hours you're putting in, and the work you prioritize. I quickly learned what worked well for me, and what didn't.\n\nThe best experiences I had were when we were given flexibility. Some leaders used a process I always use today: a kickoff meeting in which every single employee is given the opportunity to talk about their own boundaries and how they operate.\n\nManagers with families would say their ideal schedule was to go home early, eat with their families, and then log back on if needed. My own boundary at McKinsey was that I was willing to work as much as needed during the week, but my weekends were sacred. During my two years at the company, I worked only four or five weekends.\n\nI learned that when expectations are clear and leaders are good enough to ask and respect the boundaries of employees, you can get everything done and still have great morale.\n\nI also made a ton of friends, and those connections became really important. My Wellhub cofounder and several colleagues worked at McKinsey with me, and two of my seven angel investors were my previous bosses.\n\nCompanies benefit from having employees who are active and in a great state of well-being.\n\nIf companies don't support well-being, they won't just be less productive — they'll also have higher costs than peers who do invest in it.\n\nIt impacts the amount of sick leave and PTO people take, and plays into retention and attraction.\n\nThe trend some corporate companies have taken towards hardcore culture is completely insane. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.\n\nMany CEOs are missing the mark, and the consequences will show up as companies underperform those that take a more balanced approach. Hustle culture leads to burnout, and it pushes great people out before they would otherwise leave.\n\nAs a CEO, I believe in treating every employee like an adult and trusting them. My focus is always on getting the work done — not how many hours it takes or whether someone is showing up to the office.\n\nWhen I meet coworkers, we typically do a yoga session or a workout, instead of going to bars or restaurants. If you switch a happy hour for a wellness hour, and build healthy habits into everyday routines, you can improve well-being across a company.\n\nTo me, well-being means being productive, healthy, and happy. I put productive there because it means that happiness and health are being put to good use.\n\nI want to be a great CEO to my employees, want to inspire our clients and partners to join the movement, but more importantly, I want to be a great dad to my three kids, and a great husband to my wife.\n\nMy solution is integrating life and work. You don't need to be sacrificing your marriage or family for success.\n\nWhen people ask me, \"What are your hours?\" I say, \"I'm working all the time. I'm thinking about work when I'm exercising.\"\n\nI have also built rituals in my well-being journey that I almost never break.\n\nWhenever I'm traveling, I call my kids at 7:30 p.m. no matter what — even if that means setting an alarm for 2 a.m. It's a way for me to be close to them, no matter where I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career as a consultant?

    "title": "Trump's first year back in office was a mixed bag for the business world",
    "description": "Here are the businesses that Trump's first year back in office have greatly benefitted, and industries that have been hit hard.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's year in office was a mixed bag of blessings and woes for the business world.\n\nLast year began with a lineup of billionaires at Trump's inauguration, all of whom soon saw their net worth diminish after Trump enacted sweeping tariffs aimed at reshoring manufacturing jobs.\n\nTheir fortunes soon rebounded, and Trump has been a booster of the tech industry, which continued to grow in 2025.\n\nBusinesses were also often caught in Trump's crosshairs, including Intel, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nFrom the retail sector to the AI industry, here's how different industries fared in Trump's first year of his second term.\n\nThe AI industry continued to soar during the first year of Trump's second term.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, the company's AI basket of 34 stocks, which includes Amazon, Cisco, and Apple, saw a 50.8% in share value in 2025, while the overall stock market gained 17.3% and the broader tech sector rose 21.4%, based on the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nWithin the first month of his presidency, Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate, to be led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, which he said would be \"the largest AI infrastructure project in history.\"\n\nTrump has also been a booster of the tech industry at large — while receiving donations, gifts, pledges for more American manufacturing, and praise from leaders.\n\nHe's had notable visits with CEOs, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The US eventually allowed Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China, under the condition that the government gets a cut of the profit.\n\nTrump also rescinded an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden that established a federal framework for AI safety and risk mitigation, and he signed a new order intended to override state-level AI regulations.\n\nAnd after publicly calling for the resignation of Intel's CEO, Trump made a deal for the US to take a nearly 10% equity in the company, which has since seen its stock rise.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump's second year in office in his second term will bring.\n\nConcerns are bubbling under the industry boom. Industry experts fear that an AI bubble burst will bring about a market crash similar to the dot-com crash.\n\nTrump is also warning tech companies that data centers cannot contribute to the affordability crisis by driving up energy bills. Some tech bulls, such as Dan Ives, said that the focus on costs could derail the AI boom.\n\nRetail businesses, large and small, have been hit hard by Trump's first year back.\n\nThe Trump presidency kicked off with a flurry of tariffs, sometimes on some of the country's closest trade partners. Businesses in retail have been struggling to keep up with the pace of change, and some have responded by hiking prices.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that the tariffs had disproportionately affected Main Street and entrepreneurs who make physical products. Several small businesses sued Trump over the tariffs enacted using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nEven if businesses were able to handle tariffs, they were competing for skittish consumers after sentiment sank to a new low in November, based on the Consumer Index by the University of Chicago. Economists have also found that while the wealthy have continued to spend, others have cut back.\n\nNot everything was down. Trump did backtrack on some of his tariffs, and the retail sector did see some growth compared to 2024, according to the ‌Commerce Department's Census Bureau.\n\nDespite Trump's promise to bring blue-collar jobs back to the US and some high-profile plans, like Apple's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically and Nvidia's plans for a US-based supercomputer plant, the manufacturing sector has still not taken off.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, factory employment has dropped by more than 70,000 since April, to 12.69 million as of December, the lowest point since March 2022. The Bureau also estimated that the manufacturing sector lost 8,000 jobs in December alone.\n\nIn May 2025, a month after Trump enacted the bulk of his tariffs, Wells Fargo economists predicted that the duties would not be effective in reshoring manufacturing jobs and that the administration would face an \"uphill battle.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that some small and medium-sized businesses have canceled domestic investment plans due to economic uncertainty stemming from the constantly changing tariffs. The loss of manufacturing jobs also reflects a broader trend of a low-hire, low-fire environment, where businesses freeze in the face of an uncertain environment.\n\nTrump has shown a recent interest in policy around the sector.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump floated the idea of a 50-year fixed-rate mortgage, arguing it could make monthly payments more affordable for buyers shut out of homeownership.\n\nHe also recently said that he wants to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes in order to increase the supply of homes. He also announced that he would instruct his \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, without further clarification.\n\nHome prices rose in 77% of metro markets during the third quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors' latest report. Business Insider also previously reported that the median age of a first-time homebuyer hit 40 in 2025, up from 31 a decade earlier.\n\nEconomists have thus far commented that neither idea would address the root of the problem, which is a shortage of homes. Trump's tariffs on raw materials may have also contributed to the cost of constructing homes.",

    "fullText": "As you may have noticed, I wasn't at work last week. (Thanks, Paige, for filling in!) I decided to ease into the year sans meetings, emails, or circling back.\n\nMy intention for taking the first full week of the year off was simple: to be intentional about rest so that I can spend the next two quarters running at full speed. I had planned to do only one joyous activity per day.\n\nI started the week by taking my son to a pottery painting class and then a massage on Tuesday. Wednesday was spent decluttering the garage, followed by doing absolutely nothing but catching up on Netflix series on Thursday. I capped the week off with a Friday facial.\n\nDespite sticking to my one activity per day, I still had to get the kids off to school. I had more time, so I also offered to pick them up, too. I cooked all of my meals (because have you seen this economy?!) and I finally joined Costco. I felt very productive, but also very tired.\n\n\"There is a win. You set good intentions, and you set a plan,\" Bryant, who's also the author of \"Homecoming: Overcome Fear and Trauma to Reclaim Your Whole Authentic Self,\" told me. \"Intention doesn't equal impact.\"\n\nBryant said my mistake was clear. \"You traded labor. You did less of one job and replaced it with more of another job,\" she explained. \"The reason the exhaustion surprises you is because you're like, 'but I didn't do any work this week.' But the driving, the cooking, the baths, these things are work.\"\n\nFor you, it may not be your home life, but the incessant accumulation of small tasks or tiny decisions — whether it's text message triage, planning meet-ups with friends, or caretaking your parents — can eat up ease while on vacation.\n\nIn the future, Bryant suggested that I remember that childcare and home labor are still work, even if they are labors of love. She added that instead of taking on more at home, outsource as much as I can afford.\n\nBryant also left me with this reminder: \"Embrace the truth that 'I'm worthy of rest from it all.'\"",

    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith says Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen won’t get past the Denver Broncos — despite calling him one of the best in the business.\n\nSpeaking on ESPN’s ‘First Take’, Stephen A. Smith broke down why he believes the Buffalo Bills face an uphill battle on the road in Denver.\n\nJosh Allen, who is battling both knee and finger injuries, will lead a depleted Buffalo team into one of the most challenging environments in the league, as the Denver Broncos prepare for their first playoff home game in a decade.\n\nStephen A. Smith argued that while Josh Allen remains an elite quarterback, the Denver Broncos’ defensive front and secondary present too many problems.\n\nHe highlighted the Broncos’ relentless pass rush and all-around balance, along with the Bills’ health, as the deciding factors.\n\n“No, nonsense. This is ridiculous. Josh Allen’s got the knee injury, got the finger injury, but he’ll overcome that. They got 14 dudes on IR — 14! Okay, you got Shakir out, you got Davis out.\n\n“I’m just looking at Denver — 68 sacks on the season. You got seven different guys with at least seven sacks, led by Bonito with 14. They’re going to get to the quarterback. You got Patrick Surtain shutting down half the field. It’s just too much to overcome.”\n\nHe added that while Allen is one of the most gifted players in the NFL, this matchup heavily favours Denver. “I get it, we love Josh Allen. He’s one of the best in the business. But he’s going home.”\n\nThe Buffalo Bills enter the game with one of the longest injury lists in the league, missing several key starters on both sides of the ball.\n\nAllen’s determination is unquestioned, but the loss of top targets has forced Buffalo to adjust its offensive approach.\n\nThe Broncos, meanwhile, are rested and healthy after their bye week. With a top-tier defensive front and Patrick Surtain leading the secondary, Denver will look to capitalise on Buffalo’s thin depth to strengthen their own postseason push.\n\nSmith concluded that while Allen’s talent and leadership are undeniable, this game may simply prove too difficult given the circumstances surrounding the Bills’ roster.",

    "description": "When you're in a calorie deficit, which is essential for weight loss, you risk of losing muscle. Two personal trainers explained how to avoid this.",
    "fullText": "If you want to lose fat without losing muscle, there are three things you need to know.\n\nThat's according to Magnus Lygdback, a Hollywood personal trainer who helped Alexander Skarsgård prepare to play a Viking warrior in \"The Northman,\" and Harry Cox, a personal trainer to busy C-suite execs based in London.\n\nTo lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you use, but if that number drops too low, you'll start losing muscle along with fat.\n\n\"Because your body is in an energy deficit, it's going to try and find energy wherever it can, and sometimes that ends up being muscle,\" Cox told Business Insider.\n\nYou may look slimmer, but it could backfire in the long run, because muscle mass is essential for overall health, he said. It plays a key role in regulating metabolism, including glucose levels, and increases the number of calories your body uses at rest. All this impacts body composition.\n\nWe also naturally start to lose muscle with age, and building and maintaining it allows us to move around freely, lift things, and prevent injury longterm.\n\nBoth trainers endorsed establishing long-term healthy habits like eating a balanced diet and getting enough sleep over quick fixes, which can be structured around the following three tips.\n\nStrength training regularly, particularly if you're trying to lose fat, will help you preserve muscle mass, Cox said. It signals to the body that we need it and must keep it, he said.\n\nThe most effective and evidence-backed way to build muscle is to train with progressive overload. This is where you work your muscles to the point of failure — where you could barely do even one more rep— and continually add more weight or reps as your body adapts over time.\n\nCox said the same principle applies to maintaining muscle. \"If you're just going to the gym and lifting some of the lightest dumbbells and hope that's going to help you preserve muscle, that's not the case. The training needs to be somewhat intense,\" he said.\n\nHe said to aim for a minimum of two strength training sessions a week, but that you'll likely get better results from three or four.\n\nEach workout should include at least one pulling exercise — such as a chin-up, pull-up, or lat pull-down — a push exercise — such as a push-up, bench press, or shoulder press — and some kind of leg exercise — such as a lunge, squat, or deadlift.\n\n\"If you start putting in place those healthier habits of eating more protein, exercising more frequently, a lot of the time, the fat loss happens as a byproduct without even focusing on it,\" Cox said.\n\nProtein is the building block of muscle, so eating enough is crucial for maintaining muscle while losing fat, Lygdback said.\n\nWhether or not you're trying to lose weight, you should aim to eat the same quantity of protein  to maintain your muscles , he said.\n\n\"You don't really want to adjust that too much if you ask me. And I never do,\" he said.\n\nThe scientific literature recommends eating between 1.6 and 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight a day to support recovery and maintain or build muscle mass, Cox said.\n\nA person who weighs 60 kilograms would aim to eat 120 grams of protein each day, for example.\n\nIf you're struggling to eat enough protein, the trainers recommended educating yourself on which foods are high in protein, using protein powder if necessary, and not being afraid to order double protein in a restaurant.\n\nTo lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat, known as a calorie deficit. But building muscle requires being in a calorie surplus. That's why it can be hard to lose weight without shedding muscle instead of fat.\n\nYou can achieve it though by tracking macronutrients (protein, fats, and carbohydrates), Lygdback said . You don't have to weigh out your food at every meal, but it might be helpful to track your meals for a few days to get a sense of what 30 grams or protein, or 500 calories of rice looks like, for example, he said.\n\nChicken, rice, and broccoli is the staple gym bro diet. But you don't need to eat that to reach your goals, he said. Just make sure you have enough protein, while eating in an overall calorie deficit. \"You want to make sure to keep the protein high enough, and the carbs and fat low enough,\" he said.\n\nLygdback recommended cutting your daily calories by 10 to 20%. \"You don't want to go too extreme,\" he said.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported on how to calculate your macros depending on your weight and activity levels.",

    "title": "I'm delivering for Uber Eats after decades in corporate marketing. It's helped me make money — and stay humble.",
    "description": "Jay Mandel spent decades in the corporate world in marketing roles before turning to Uber Eats last fall. It pays the bills and is humbling, he said.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jay Mandel, a 48-year-old marketing professional who also works for Uber Eats in the New York City area. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI worked most of my career in corporate America in digital marketing.\n\nThe highlight of my career was my eight years at MasterCard, where I worked my way up to lead global social media as a vice president. I've also worked at IBM. More recently, I've worked as a marketing consultant and an adjunct professor, but this hasn't generated enough income. Right now, I'm raising money to build my own company.\n\nThe idea of starting gig work came from my therapist, who said it would do wonders for me to see how others live.\n\nI avoided it for several months. I went to Columbia University. I have a master's degree. I talked to people that I love, and they were like, \"You shouldn't have to resort to this.\"\n\nEventually, in October, I delivered my first Uber Eats order.\n\nEarly on, I got the feeling that I was invisible to most people. For one order, I had to go pick up a cake. It turned out the bakery didn't have the cake the customer wanted, so I spent 20 minutes on the phone with the customer while I spoke with the bakery to find something else that would work.\n\nWhen I finally made the delivery, the woman who ordered the cake had a blank look on her face — no \"thank you,\" no extra tip, or anything. In my past jobs, putting in extra effort usually resulted in some sort of recognition. With delivery work, I haven't felt that a lot of times.\n\nThen I realized that these companies charge so much money for these deliveries. It shouldn't be the customer's responsibility to tip.\n\nI also don't always feel like I have a choice about which orders I can take. Sometimes, it doesn't work for me to pick up or drop off in the Bronx, and I usually don't want to pick up McDonald's orders.\n\nI've done deliveries for Uber Courier, which involves delivering items between regular people. In one case, it was a backpack. Another time, it was a charger. It's a really valuable service, and I wish that Uber leaned into more of those deliveries.\n\nI use the money I earn from Uber — often a few hundred dollars a week — to make sure that my kids have a great weekend, like going out to dinner.\n\nOverall, my experience working for Uber Eats has been humbling. I don't see myself as any better than other delivery people. I try my best to smile and be the bright moment in someone else's day. I also have fun, get to visit new restaurants, and see neighborhoods I would never go to otherwise.\n\nIt's so tough to figure out how common my experience is as someone turning to gig work to pay the bills while still nurturing professional ambitions. The unemployment numbers don't capture people like me who do gig work. I never thought I'd struggle as much as I have financially, and it feels like more of my friends than not are in my situation.\n\nI don't view my employment situation as a result of my actions. Whether it's Uber Eats or teaching as an adjunct, this is part of a large system over which I have no control.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Lloyd Fisher shared what his career change, from corporate marketing to starting his own small landscaping business, has been like.",
    "fullText": "Lloyd Fisher was ready for a career change — leaving behind about a decade doing marketing in the corporate world to become his own boss.\n\nJob cuts and decisions beyond his control helped ignite the pivot, and in December 2023, the Georgia resident launched Oak Avenue Landscaping.\n\nFisher, who is in his 30s, enjoys working for himself without being tied down to one employer. He doesn't think he will apply for a full-time corporate role again since it wouldn't be fulfilling anymore, as his views of career success have shifted.\n\nHis net income in the first two years of business was less than what he made at his last job, but he enjoys the control he now has and doing something he's passionate about.\n\n\"It's not a paycheck, it's not a means to an end. It's something that has just given me a different type of satisfaction and just purpose,\" he said.\n\nFisher said he had his severance to fall back on while he got his new career off the ground.\n\nHe said his first year in business involved a lot of investing in vehicles and equipment, affecting his overall profit. He said startups typically invest most of their profits back into their businesses in the first few years of operating. He also had to figure out the ins and outs of being a business owner, including pricing.\n\n\"There were things that I had definitely underbid in my first year, where I learned this is exactly how you need to be pricing these things and accounting for different variables,\" he said.\n\nHis offered services range in price, from a couple of hundred dollars for landscape design to thousands for new lawns or garden bed makeovers. Some of the services could cost six figures.\n\nAs of December 22, Fisher made about $52,000 in net income in 2025, nearly six figures in gross profit, and had about $37,000 in expenses.\n\nHis net income exceeded his 2024 earnings, but was less than the six-figure salary at his last job. He doubled his revenue to about $430,000 as of December 22, 2025. A large amount of that has gone toward subcontractors. He's hoping to lessen that cost one day, aiming to build out his own team as he expands.\n\n\"It's definitely given me enough to sustain the family and also just put back into the business as much as I want,\" he said.\n\nHis business uses fully electric equipment and focuses on sustainability. Fisher, who moved to the US from South Africa in 2013, said his passion for people caring about their outdoor space in an environmentally friendly manner started when he moved to Atlanta from New York in 2017. \"It's a city in a forest; there is just so much natural beauty here,\" he said.\n\nFisher said he already had \"a feeling of restlessness just to get it started\" before the last job cut. He took on a \"passion project\" of landscaping on the side, where he could leverage his marketing skills and try to help generate more leads.\n\nHe watched videos on YouTube to learn about how to create a self-charging trailer for his equipment, and researched plants, hardscaping, and masonry online. Beyond studying, he said he went through trial and error in his garden. He said he dove headfirst into running the business, using what he learned during the passion project, and as time went on.\n\nFisher wished he had known before making the career pivot just how much patience is needed to start a business. He suggested that anyone else looking to run their own business learn how to be uncomfortable because it comes with a lot of variables that you can't always plan for.\n\nHe said starting a business idea as a side hustle could be beneficial because people would still have another stream of income to fall back on and support this goal. He suggested having at least a few months of financial stability before pivoting to doing your business full time.\n\nHowever, he finds the downside of a side gig is that it can slow down the process of building up a new venture.\n\n\"Looking back on it now, I feel like I would've got started sooner and up to speed a lot faster if I'd just gone all in on the one thing,\" Fisher said.\n\nHe said he enjoys developing relationships with clients, which helps him feel like he's part of the community in Georgia.\n\nHe said operating a small business can be lonely, particularly with all the obstacles that can come with it. \"No one really understands the different challenges that you're going through every single day and all those different ways that you need to overcome those challenges,\" he said.\n\nHe said his wife helps him see the positive side when things are stressful, is helpful in navigating issues, and has been supportive of making the career pivot.\n\nFisher doesn't work alone. He has one full-time employee, his lead crew member, and used to have a laborer. He also works with an installation team for large projects. He said he's still using his marketing background to help with leads and sales.\n\nFisher has enjoyed spending time with family or taking time away without feeling guilty about it. He said his family from South Africa was able to visit in the summer.\n\n\"Even though it was a very busy season, I've got such a great team that I was able to lean on them, and they were here for over a month,\" he said.\n\nFisher said he also took his kids to visit Disney in Florida for the first time. He said he didn't feel guilty about spending that time away \"because I wasn't looking over my shoulder to see if my manager was approving the vacation days.\"\n\nBeing a business owner allows him to have some flexibility and feel more liberated with his schedule.\n\n\"If there's some days where I'm feeling stressed out and want to go play a round of golf, I can do that,\" he said. \"I know what work I need to be doing that day, and if I'm taking care of my responsibilities, then there's no specific timeframe that needs to happen with them.\"\n\nFisher also now has more time to develop another venture focused on marketing. He said he has made some money and is planning to focus more on the agency, which he started last year, \"now that more systems are in place for the landscaping business.\"\n\nIn 2026, he hopes to generate more profit, add more kinds of services, educate more people in the Atlanta area about the pros of all-electric landscaping, and work with more commercial clients so larger entities can leverage sustainable landscaping practices.",

    "title": "Why Democrats are gearing up to oppose a bill to curtail stock trading in Congress",
    "description": "\"This bill is a scam. It is not a congressional stock trading ban,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The House is set to vote on a bill to significantly curtail congressional stock trading in the coming weeks. Democrats say it's a scam.\n\n\"This bill is a scam. It is not a congressional stock trading ban,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told Business Insider. \"It is written precisely for the wealthiest members of Congress.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Committee on House Administration passed a bill called the \"Stop Insider Trading Act.\" Backed by House GOP leadership, the bill would ban sitting members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children from buying new stocks in publicly traded companies.\n\nIt would be the most significant change to stock trading rules in over a decade. Yet the bill falls far short of other long-standing proposals on the issue.\n\nMost significantly, it allows lawmakers to hold onto their existing stock holdings, a provision that Republicans have insisted on in the name of ensuring that financially successful people aren't deterred from serving.\n\n\"The focus of the bill is not to make elected officials poor,\" Republican Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the committee, said at the bill's markup on Wednesday. \"The focus is to prevent them from benefiting off their insider information.\"\n\nThe bill also allows lawmakers to sell their existing stocks, as long as they disclose the sale at least seven days before.\n\nDemocrats have also taken issue with several other provisions in the bill, including one that allows lawmakers' family members to trade stocks on behalf of another person.\n\nSteil said on Wednesday that the provision was intended to allow family members whose jobs involve stock trading to continue doing so.\n\nBut Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York dubbed the provision the \"grandma loophole,\" because family members can \"freely trade stocks on behalf of their parents or grandparents with a member of Congress in line to inherit the estate.\"\n\n\"This is a loophole so big, you could fly a Qatari jet right through it,\" Morelle said.\n\nAt the Wednesday markup, Democrats offered a slew of amendments to fix what they saw as problems with the bill, including broadening the scope of who's prohibited from trading, adding a divestiture requirement, striking a provision that allows lawmakers to reinvest stock dividends, and even replacing the bill wholesale with a separate Democratic-backed stock trading ban.\n\nAll of them were voted down, and the bill ultimately cleared the committee without Democratic support.\n\nSteil contended that Democrats were making a \"Goldilocks argument\" in their opposition to his bill, and that it represented the best chance at passing any new restrictions this Congress.\n\n\"The porridge is too hot, the porridge is too cold,\" Steil said. \"They may try to allow perfection to be the enemy of the good.\"\n\nDemocrats countered that the bill simply does not meet the definition of a stock trading ban.\n\n\"There's no porridge in the bowl,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, a Texas Democrat who's moved to divest from her own significant stock holdings since coming to Congress last year. \"It doesn't have any real teeth. There's not a meal to be had here.\"\n\nDespite the years-long efforts by a bipartisan coalition to bring a stock trading ban to the floor, the issue appears likely now to be fracturing along party lines.\n\nMorelle told reporters that he plans to file a \"discharge petition,\" a legislative maneuver to force a vote on a bill if it garners signatures from a majority of the chamber, for a separate bill that would include stronger stock trading restrictions and also apply those restrictions to the president and vice president.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate bipartisan discharge petition on a bill that does not include the executive branch is languishing, with Democratic leadership opposing that effort.\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas, one of the Republicans who had been part of the bipartisan group, told Business Insider that he was satisfied with Steil's bill, even if it wasn't as strong as the bill he's long pushed for.\n\n\"It's a really good bill,\" Roy said. \"If you'd asked me when I set out down this road five years ago that we'd get that? It's a good bill.\"\n\nAnd at least one Democrat — Rep. Josh Riley of New York — said that he plans to support the GOP-backed proposal.\n\n\"I would love to see a bill that completely drains the swamp, and gets everybody to divest investments, and the whole thing,\" Riley told Business Insider. \"I also came here to get stuff done, and this bill is something we can get done, and it's going to make really meaningful progress.\"",

We propose a novel mechanism whereby banks use portfolio opacity to meet this objective. Specifically, banks choose opaque portfolios to secure cheap long-term funding while trading off insolvency and illiquidity. We show that while opacity lowers deposit rates, it also leaves depositors with only noisy information about the bank’s solvency, making them cautious about keeping their funds in the bank—particularly when interest rates are high. We show that opacity raises bank profits, sometimes at the cost of exposure to high probability of illiquidity. In particular, in high-rate environments, banks adopt excessive opacity to further reduce deposit rates—at the cost of more frequent early failures.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to Philip Bond, Mike Burkart, Leonardo D’Amico, Douglas Diamond, Thierry Foucault, Todd Keister, Martin Oehmke, Guillermo Ordonez, Cecilia Parlatore, Anatoli Segura, Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi, Victoria Vanasco, Ernst-Ludwig von Thadden and Zhen Zhou for useful comments.

    "description": "Netflix made streaming movies at home a big part of its pitch. Now, as it tries to buy Warner Bros. and its giant movie business, things are changing.",
    "fullText": "Netflix spent a lot of time arguing that the future of movies was watching them at home, not in theaters.\n\nNow Netflix wants to buy a movie studio that puts movies into theaters. So it's started saying that watching movies in theaters is good, sometimes.\n\nThat's the messaging Netflix has been trying to make ever since it announced plans to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in December. But that messaging hasn't been satisfying to some people who care a lot about the future of movies in theaters.\n\nWhich is why Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared in The New York Times on Friday, talking about how much he likes the business of putting movies into theaters. Again, it's an idea he's been talking about since he announced the (proposed) Netflix/WBD deal on December 5.\n\nSarandos did say one thing he thinks is new and important: A commitment to keep all future Warner Bros. movies in theaters for at least 45 days:\n\nThat 45-day commitment won't mean much to most people. But Sarandos definitely thinks it matters — \"I'm giving you a hard number.\"\n\nThe very abbreviated backstory: Sarandos and Netflix have spent years fighting the idea of a theatrical \"window\" — the amount of time movies spend exclusively in theaters before they move to platforms like streaming services, rentals, and purchases. Their general argument: If people want to watch movies at home — that is, on Netflix — they should get to do that.\n\nNetflix has periodically had to soften that stance to accommodate high-profile movies and talent, which is why you could see Martin Scorcese's \"The Irishman\" in theaters for a few weeks before it came to Netfix in 2019, and why \"Barbie\" director Gretg Gerwig's \"Narnia\" will be in Imax theaters for a couple weeks this fall before it comes to Netflix. Netflix has also periodically debated its streaming-only/mostly stance internally.\n\nBut externally, Sarandos has been a huge promoter of the idea that the future of movies is at home — which happens to align with the fact that moviegoing has been in decline for years. That's not just because of Netflix, but because the internet gives people lots of other things to do besides going to theaters.\n\nNow, as he prepares to buy WBD, Sarandos has had to change his tune. The shortest version of his new one: We weren't in the business of putting movies into theaters, but if we buy WBD, we will be, so we'll do that.\n\nBut that hasn't convinced lots of people that a business built on streaming is going to become one that cares about theaters.\n\nIn part, that's because Sarandos also said things like \"our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members because that's what they're looking for,\" when announcing the deal. He's also said he hopes \"windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker\" — which reasonable people believe means he intends for movies to spend less time in theaters.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount, the Hollywood studio that would like to buy WBD instead, has made a commitment to putting movies in theaters, and honoring \"healthy traditional windows\" as part of its talking points.\n\nSo now, Sarandos has planted a 45-day flag. Whether that mollifies Hollywood or anyone else is an open question.",

    "description": "Zoox's robotaxis do not have a steering wheel and are bi-directional. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee described the experience as like a theme park ride.",
    "fullText": "Of all the robotaxis I've tried, Amazon's Zoox feels different.\n\nZoox — founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon four years later — is a robotaxi company that has limited operations in Las Vegas and San Francisco with about 50 vehicles between the two major cities. The company has said Austin and Miami are next on the map.\n\nThe service is considerably smaller than its competitor, Waymo, and that limitation was acutely felt in my experience hailing a Zoox on a Thursday night in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nHowever, the rider experience itself felt more akin to an amusement-park-ride-slash-party-bus than an average ride-hail service in an everyday car, which makes Zoox a true differentiator against the emerging players in the robotaxi race.\n\nThe company doesn't bulk order vehicles from automakers to retrofit them with sensors the same way Waymo or Uber does. Instead, Zoox designed a vehicle solely for robotaxi operations and builds the cars out of a factory in Hayward, California.\n\nThe robotaxi doesn't have a steering wheel or brake pedal — only seats inside the vehicle. The car is also bi-directional, meaning the Zoox's \"front\" goes both ways.\n\nThis helps the vehicle navigate tight spaces and avoid the need to execute U-turns or three-point turns.\n\nHowever, riders will mainly feel the difference once they step inside the Zoox.\n\nA chime plays as the robotaxi's doors slide open — almost like a grand entrance to the Zoox experience.\n\nThe interior reminded me of one of those immersive Disneyland rides or even a party-themed Gondola lift.\n\nInside, there are four seats — two on each side of the car, facing each other. I found that it encourages a social experience if you're bringing along multiple riders.\n\nThe headliner — or the roof — of the robotaxi has starlights which reminded me of the inside a Rolls-Royce or limousine. That touch felt especially appropriate for the Vegas scene, but it also seemed to add to the overall social experience Zoox is going for. It feels like a party inside the car.\n\nSurprisingly, the seats were comfortable. The photos and videos I've seen of the Zoox made me think the seats would feel like a bus or subway seat, but they have a plush touch to them.\n\nI don't see myself falling asleep inside the vehicle, simply because you're forced to sit upright and can't lie back in the seats, but they're comfortable enough for a 30- to 45-minute ride.\n\nAnother surprise: There's plenty of leg room that provides enough space between you and another rider in front of you. I went on a Zoox ride with a company spokesperson facing me, and space was not an issue.\n\nI tried a Zoox facing forward and backward inside the car.\n\nThere have been some reports of riders feeling nauseous when they face backward. I didn't experience that, but that could just be unique to me.\n\nThe Zoox app tells riders which way to face if they are prone to motion sickness.\n\nOutside the flashy headliner, there's little else inside the car. There are four wireless phone chargers, two small armrests, and four touchscreens by each of the seats, which allow riders to control the cabin temperature, change the music, and call for rider support.\n\nZoox is in a pilot stage of its operation in Las Vegas, working with fewer than 50 robotaxis inside the city. The service is free for now and limited to a handful of preset destinations.\n\nI hailed a Zoox from one of the stops, the Luxor Hotel, and was given a 25-minute wait time. The real wait-time was 37 minutes.\n\nThose two factors alone — limited destinations and long wait times — make Zoox less of a serious choice for day-to-day travel and more like a novelty experience to try once.\n\nThe rider experience also has room for improvement.\n\nFor all the effort Zoox put into creating a social in-car experience, the company has yet to provide riders with the option to connect to their Spotify or Apple Music. For now, passengers hear a curated music service from Stingray Music — similar to an iHeartRadio program.\n\nThe ride itself was mostly smooth. There was one moment that stuck out while the Zoox was going down the Strip.\n\nTraffic was heavy at night, and the Zoox attempted to make a lane change while it was stopped behind a line of cars waiting at a red light.\n\nThe robotaxi began to move into the right lane, possibly to navigate around the traffic and transition to a less-congested lane. As it began to enter the right lane, with the body of the car now at a diagonal, the Zoox suddenly stopped. The car hesitated, lurched a little bit forward, and paused again. About 10 seconds later, the car straightened out and remained in the current lane.\n\nZoox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter a nearly 35-minute ride, I was dropped off at AREA15, a Vegas entertainment hub that was one of the closest stops to my hotel.\n\nA couple who had just taken a ride before me was trying to hail another Zoox to get back to their hotel at Excalibur.\n\nThe outside temperature was around 40 degrees.\n\nWe both resorted to calling an Uber.",

    "description": "Justine Tello shares the lessons she learned from leaving public relations for teaching, then pivoting to running a small business with her spouse.",
    "fullText": "In July 2024, five years into my career, I made a drastic job switch that I would soon come to regret.\n\nFollowing about a year of disenchantment at my workplace, I left my job at a public relations agency to become a high school English teacher. I took a nearly 36% pay cut.\n\nI wasn't concerned about my paycheck because I desired a more meaningful and impactful role. I soon found myself underprepared and overwhelmed by the switch, and I left my teaching role after my first semester.\n\nAt first, I relied on my savings, my family's support, and my meager earnings as a part-time yoga teacher. My then-boyfriend and I got engaged and were married six months later.\n\nNow, we co-own a small HVAC and electrical company, where I lead the communications and marketing strategy.\n\nI loved getting to know the students and having the opportunity to mentor some of them. I learned many new skills while preparing lessons and grading papers.\n\nWhen it came to my career and my goals, the position didn't align with what I had historically wanted, and I didn't accept the job with a strategy in mind — I accepted it to pursue something new, whether I was prepared for it or not.\n\nTruthfully, I switched careers because I was dissatisfied with my original place of work, feeling stagnant in my personal growth, and lacking interest in my clients' missions. Instead of reframing my perspective or setting a new career goal, I sought a quick escape.\n\nAfter a year of reflection, I've identified three crucial mistakes that led to my unsatisfying career change.\n\nIn my final year at my PR agency, I found myself more easily discouraged by problems that were smaller than I initially perceived, or by those that had been resolved yet still lingered in my mind, like a delayed promotion, company layoffs, and a dissonant relationship with a supervisor.\n\nThese were challenging, but for the most part, I believe that the company and my managers handled problems well, and things began to smooth out over time.\n\nUnfortunately, my attitude toward my workplace remained negative after a handful of poor, back-to-back experiences. Although I was working with several amazing team members and continued to take on tasks I enjoyed, my dissatisfaction with my workplace persisted.\n\nI was burned out and a little lonely. I had been working remotely for over four years, which takes a toll on an extrovert like me, despite spending many evenings and weekends with friends and family. I longed for a position that included in-person connections, and I latched onto the idea that I could only solve my issues by switching to a new workplace.\n\nI halfheartedly applied to new PR jobs, but nothing panned out. I applied for a position as a high school English teacher on the recommendation of a family member, not because teaching was my ultimate passion, but because people are, and it felt like a way to contribute something meaningful.\n\nThe offer letter was framed as a call to something greater, and it felt like I would be filling a role that desperately needed someone. While I longed to have a positive impact on their lives, I also felt an obligation to accept the position.\n\nIf I could step back in time to the middle of my discontent in my PR role, I would try to reframe my perspective and approach my job with a different attitude. Every job can be impactful and meaningful if approached with the perspective of doing your best for yourself and for others.\n\nIf I still found my PR job no longer a fit and longed to have a greater impact on the world, the next step shouldn't have been to bail, but rather to determine clear career goals that aligned with my personal values and mission.\n\nI tried to pursue a shiny, new calling rather than develop a solid career plan. It didn't work out because I gave significant weight to one over the other, but the two can fit hand in hand.\n\nIt's better to approach a career change intentionally and with an overarching goal, rather than latching onto a new idea and pursuing it blindly. Oftentimes, it's frightening to define our goals and a solid plan, because we feel that once we decide on a direction, we can never change our path. That's inaccurate.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would've drawn up a clear plan — perhaps including multiple potential pathways — before switching fields. If the desire to teach high school English was lying dormant somewhere inside my heart, it surely would've made itself known in a new-career-ideas brainstorm.\n\nI would recommend that anyone looking to discover their true passion or calling jot down a mix of their skills and interests, and then research which jobs align with both. If a new career of interest arises, pursue it intentionally by identifying existing or gaining new relevant experience and by connecting with people in the field.\n\nI quit my teaching role because of long work hours, emotional exhaustion, and a sense that I was operating in a silo. A few other teachers occasionally offered me encouragement or advice, but I was still required to create curricula from scratch and develop my lessons on my own.\n\nWhile I would like to change some of my past career choices, I don't regret the lessons I learned and the students and coworkers I met.\n\nI'm grateful to have had the opportunity to discover more about myself through this process — to see where I can change my attitude, set new goals, and achieve greater things in the future. Every failure is a learning experience, and I'll try to make this one count.",

    "description": "Hope...",
    "fullText": "The spectacle of Nicolás Maduro’s capture has drawn attention away from the quieter imposition of systems and power networks that constitute colonial rule.\n\nAccusations of neocolonialism against the United States following Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela are not wrong—but they are focused on the wrong thing. The spectacle of Nicolás Maduro’s capture has drawn attention away from the quieter installation of systems and power networks that constitute colonial rule. If we ignore those systems now, Venezuela could slide into a colonial state that US policymakers and citizens will hardly be able to see, let alone contest.\n\nColonialism is not defined by spectacle but by the imposition of infrastructures of power, and history shows that private companies have been at the forefront of constructing this influence. The imperial 19th century offers a warning: Some of the most exploitative power imbalances of the colonial world began not with conquest but with private corporate investment.\n\nThe abduction of Maduro was a blatant violation of a globally recognized norm: territorial sovereignty. Governments around the world have condemned the operation as illegal. That condemnation, however, is largely rhetorical. There is no global litigator of international law. International law relies on collective enforcement, and Venezuela is demonstrating how thin that protection can be when confronted with overwhelming power.\n\nThe Trump administration is acting as if the postwar international order never existed. Actions in Venezuela, alongside Donald Trump’s broader hegemonic declarations about the Americas and Greenland, suggest a return to a world before international law—a world governed by imperial prerogative. This isn’t even neocolonialism; it’s simply colonialism. The danger of the “neo” qualifier is that it risks distancing the present from a past that is reasserting itself with unsettling familiarity.\n\nThe difference between war and colonialism lies in durability: the establishment of long-term control through structures of governance. This control can appear limited or indirect. Colonialism announces itself not only through occupation but also through legal, economic, and administrative rule. At its height, the British Empire ruled vast territory without blanket military occupation. Control was typically exercised indirectly through trade monopolies, legal authority, and administrative influence, with force deployed selectively rather than continuously.\n\nUnderstanding colonialism this way clarifies what to look for in Venezuela—and, crucially, where our outrage should be directed.\n\nHistory suggests several warning signs of durable colonial control. First is the injection of the colonizer’s legal systems. This can occur at a high level, through the enforcement of norms surrounding human rights or transnational crime (such as the illicit drug trade), or at a lower level, through the restructuring of domestic legal regimes governing contracts, property, or due process. Second is control over key economic sectors. In the 19th century, Britain repeatedly reshaped colonial economies by redirecting trade, reorganizing labor, and privileging extractive industries, which entrenched imperial authority while appearing commercially neutral. These economic transformations did more to stabilize empire than any military campaign.\n\nThird, empire was also administered from within. British officials embedded themselves in local courts and political systems, exercising authority through advisory roles and indirect oversight rather than overt annexation, echoing the advisory role the administration has hinted at for Venezuela.\n\nWhile colonialism and empire are often treated as the remit of the state, chartered companies typically led the way. This wasn’t just because they were convenient; profit-seeking institutions were structurally aligned with the economic logic of empire. Private corporations, granted monopolies of trade, were often the first imperial actors on the ground. They signed treaties, raised military forces, and enforced their own law—initially over employees and then eventually over entire populations. For overstretched empires, particularly Britain during its near-constant wars with France, this was a cost-effective means of expansion.\n\nThe first warning sign of colonialism, then, is not invasion but corporate entry. The most important place to look for colonialism in Venezuela is not, for instance, the placement of naval vessels but the decisions of oil companies. President Trump’s declaration that the US oil industry will “rebuild” Venezuela’s oil infrastructure, alongside his support for Delcy Rodríguez—a long-standing oil industry ally—as interim president, positions US companies for deep incursion into not just Venezuela’s oil economy but also its governance writ large. It would place a dominant industry tightly linked to political authority under US corporate direction.\n\nAlready, the response to Trump’s push for oil company investment in Venezuela, the warning signs are appearing. While CEO of ExxonMobil Darren Woods said Venezuela was “uninvestable,” he followed up with the assertion that “significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system, there has to be durable investment protections.” ExxonMobil’s involvement is conditional on, among other factors, the Trump administration’s ability to pressure Venezuela to rewrite laws governing its oil industry. In terms of promises Trump can make to the oil executives, changes to Venezuela’s legal governance of the industry is much cheaper and easier than promising security or subsidizing infrastructure construction. The leverage on offer is not tanks or troops, but the law.\n\nFor the left, this distinction matters. Focusing outrage on the spectacle of intervention or the legality of Maduro’s kidnapping risks missing the more durable threat: the embedding of private commercial actors in governance itself. Historically, it was these arrangements, not dramatic seizures of power, that stabilized colonial rule and rendered it difficult to reverse.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nThe risk is compounded by a lack of transparency. Despite the long relationship between the US oil industry and American grand strategy, shifting Venezuelan diplomacy to private companies alters what information is available to the public. The privatization of diplomacy makes intervention harder to see and harder to contest. Even policymakers may find themselves excluded from decisions that shape long-term commitments.\n\nHistory also shows where this path leads. Governance is expensive. The protection of trade is costly if done both independently or dependent on state support. Chartered companies were frequently insolvent. One of the earliest corporate bailouts occurred in the 17th century, when the British East India Company required parliamentary support to continue operating. Despite their aptitude for profit-seeking, companies could not finance the administrative and infrastructural burdens they assumed on behalf of empire.\n\nAllowing companies such as the US oil industry to lead the reconstruction of a strategically vital sector is therefore likely to fail in one of two ways. Either the state will provide substantial financial support, or it will intervene directly to protect and administer corporate interests. Both outcomes deepen colonial power and redirect profit and agency away from the Venezuelan people. Early indications suggest the administration is prepared to pursue the former, with reports circulating that Trump may subsidize oil companies’ efforts in Venezuela. The robust naval activity of the past several weeks, however, also does not rule out the latter.\n\nThe stakes for the US public are huge. Financially, the United States risks committing itself to a multibillion-dollar investment in another nation’s industrial infrastructure. Politically, it risks escalating adversarial competition. Morally, it risks becoming like the empire it claimed to leave behind in 1776.\n\nThe danger is not that Americans will choose colonialism but that it will be built inconspicuously, through contracts and corporate governance, before anyone is asked to consent.",

    "fullText": "(Corrects to make clear document was issued last November, not on Tuesday, in first three paragraphs)\n\nTAIPEI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan prosecutors ​have issued an arrest warrant for the chief executive officer ‌of Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus, alleging he was involved in illegal business and recruitment activities ‌in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s Shilin District Prosecutors Office said in a document it had indicted two Taiwanese citizens for helping OnePlus CEO Pete Lau illegally operate a business and recruit more than 70 employees in Taiwan. The allegations fall ⁠under Taiwanese law governing ‌relations with China.\n\nThe document, dated November 2025, was first reported by Taiwan local media on Tuesday.\n\nOver 70 employees were ‍hired in Taiwan to conduct smartphone software application research and development, verification and testing for the Chinese smartphone maker, prosecutors said.\n\nOnePlus is headquartered in the southern Chinese ​city of Shenzhen. It became an independent sub-brand under Oppo in ‌2021, according to its website.\n\nOppo and OnePlus did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Reuters could not reach Lau for comment.\n\nBeijing claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan ⁠rejects China’s sovereignty claims and says only ​the island’s people can decide their future.\n\nBut ​Taiwan's tech expertise has made it a magnet for Chinese companies seeking talent, prompting Taiwanese authorities to block such efforts, ‍which they say have ⁠included using shell companies registered in Hong Kong or foreign entities, or dispatching staff through hiring agencies to conceal their identities.\n\nIn August ⁠2025, Taiwan authorities said they were investigating 16 Chinese companies for allegedly poaching semiconductor and ‌other high-tech talent, amid growing concerns over technology outflows.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes you need a little assistance when making a big business decision. Fortunately, the best consulting firms in the country are here to help.\n\nBusiness Insider teamed up with Plant-A Insights, a leading insights and technology company that publishes business rankings in cooperation with world-class media brands, to find the 300 top management consulting firms in America. The list includes giants of the industry as well as a slew of more specialized and boutique firms.\n\nThe list is based on a large-scale survey of around 25,000 professionals who have worked with consulting firms, who evaluated them on factors like industry and practice area expertise, as well as client satisfaction. Other reputational measures, like the firms' placement in other industry rankings, were also factored in. The full methodology can be found at the bottom of this article.\n\nAmerica's Top Management Consulting Firms 2026, a collaboration between Business Insider and Plant-A Insights Group, recognizes the best management consultancies in the United States. The ranking highlights companies that excel in providing their expertise across multiple industries and practice areas. The results are based on a comprehensive study combining extensive desk research with a large-scale survey of over 25,000 U.S. working professionals with direct experience working with management consulting firms.\n\nTo be eligible for consideration, a firm had to provide consulting and advisory services to companies located within the United States. An initial list of over 15,000 firms was screened and validated, resulting in a final list of 2,200 firms for evaluation, categorized across 15 industries and 14 practice areas. This list was further validated with support from data analytics company Aniline.\n\nEligible firms were evaluated in a nationwide survey of over 25,000 respondents that took place between August 2025 and October 2025. This included more than 18,000 respondents who recently worked with the firms on a project and over 7,000 individuals who were a part of the selection committees that hired them.\n\nRespondents evaluated their experience working with consulting firms across three areas: Industry Expertise, Practice Area Expertise, and Client Satisfaction\n\nAn overall score for each consultancy was calculated by combining the Industry Score, Practice Area Score, and the Client Satisfaction Score using a proprietary scoring model. Firms also received bonus points for being featured in other credible industry rankings, serving as a proxy for sustained industry recognition. The 300 highest-scoring management consulting firms were recognized by Business Insider and Plant-A Insights Group as America's Top Management Consulting Firms 2026.\n\nThe exclusion of a company from this ranking is not a reflection on its quality or performance and is not disputed.\n\nCritical Mention media monitoring platform Onclusive was utilized to investigate whether management consulting firms were implicated in a wide range of significant issues within the past two years (Dec 1, 2023 — Dec 1, 2025). This included a review of financial misconduct (such as fraud, accounting scandals), legal and regulatory actions (like major lawsuits, settlements, or investigations by the SEC or DOJ), and workplace and labor violations (including discrimination or harassment lawsuits). Any management consultancy found engaging in such practices was subsequently excluded from the final ranking list. Plant-A Insights conducted multiple iterations of the media monitoring process to validate exclusions and ensure the accuracy of the results.\n\nPlacement in the Rankings (defined below) is a positive recognition based on research of publicly available data sources from the time period in question.\n\nAll list content within the rankings (\"Rankings\") is the exclusive property of Plant-A Insights Group LLC (\"Plant-A\").

    "fullText": "OpenAI is crushing it with business users and is far ahead of rivals such as Anthropic and Google in the enterprise AI market, according to new data this week.\n\nThat's a contrast to some of the hand-ringing that's gone on since Google's Gemini chatbot began gaining on ChatGPT a few months ago.\n\nThe new data comes from Ramp, a startup that helps companies pay their bills. Ramp analyzes corporate card and bill-paying activity on its platform from more than 50,000 US businesses to track billions of dollars spent on AI services each month.\n\nThe latest numbers cover December 2025. The report shows that OpenAI regained momentum among US businesses, posting its strongest growth in months as overall corporate adoption of AI continued to accelerate.\n\nThe share of US businesses paying for AI products and services rose to 46.6% in December, up 1.6 percentage points from November. That was the largest month-over-month increase since mid-2025, Ramp data shows.\n\nMuch of that growth was driven by OpenAI. Business adoption of OpenAI products climbed two percentage points to 36.8%, reversing a short-lived slowdown in the fall and reaching a new record high. Ramp's line-item data shows gains in both enterprise chat subscriptions and API spending, suggesting broader OpenAI usage across office workers and technical teams.\n\nIt's unclear how many current paid users OpenAI has, but the company said in November 2025 that it had 1 million business customers.\n\nThe rebound underscores OpenAI's continued dominance in the enterprise AI market at a time when companies are moving beyond experimentation. Rather than trial use, December's growth reflects recurring spend tied to everyday business functions, including software development, research, finance, sales, and customer support.\n\nCompetitors continued to gain ground, though at a slower pace. Anthropic's adoption rose to 16.7%, with growth concentrated among technology companies making heavy use of APIs.\n\nGoogle's AI adoption increased to 4.3%, a figure Ramp notes likely understates usage because many businesses access Gemini for free through Google Workspace plans.\n\nThese Ramp numbers also exclude business use of free AI tools, in which no paid transaction occurs, and when employees use personal accounts with AI companies to complete work tasks. This means the data likely underestimates actual AI adoption rates.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",
