    "description": "The rivaling AI companies pushed GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, and had back-to-back appearances on a tech and business podcast.",
    "fullText": "The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic intensified this week.\n\nThe two companies released dueling new AI models on Thursday and had back-to-back podcast appearances on \"TBPN.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model that the company says would improve performance on office productivity and coding tasks, with an expanded \"context window\" that allows it to work through longer documents and more complex projects in a single session.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI punched back with its own new coding-focused model called GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company says runs faster, uses fewer computing resources, and can generate and manage complex software from English instructions. The new version also comes alongside a stand-alone Codex desktop app.\n\nBoth Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and Sholto Douglas, one of Anthropic's leading researchers, appeared on the \"TBPN\" podcast in back-to-back chats with show host John Coogan and Jordi Hays.\n\n\"I think we will be heading towards a workflow where a lot of people just feel like they're managing a team of agents,\" said Altman. \"And as the agents get better, they'll keep operating at a higher and higher level of abstraction.\"\n\nDouglas, who appeared in the subsequent timeslot, told Coogan and Hays that users have been comparing previous Anthropic and OpenAI models, and they have noticed some key differences.\n\n\"The OpenAI models were a bit better at trying really, really, really hard on tough problems, but the Anthropic models were much faster and so forth,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"And so they worked on speed while we worked on making the models much, much better at really, really tough problems,\" Douglas added of the Opus 4.6.\n\nThe latest release is part of a long-running competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, dating back to 2021, when a group of OpenAI researchers left to form Anthropic, aiming to develop safer and more controlled AI systems.\n\nThis week, Anthropic's launch of industry-specific plugins triggered a stock market sell-off as Wall Street worried about AI's impact on software.\n\nAnthropic also took a subtle shot at OpenAI with a series of ads released this week, including one that will air during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ads feature unnamed humanized AIs dropping ads in the middle of their advice, alongside the promise that its model, Claude, will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI announced in January that ads are coming to ChatGPT for users of the free version.\n\nAltman subsequently hit back, calling Anthropic \"dishonest\" and defending ChatGPT as a product that brings AI \"to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.\" He also clarified that the ads will be \"clearly labeled\" to differentiate themselves from the chatbot's answers to queries.\n\n\"We are not stupid. We respect our users. We understand that if we did something like what those ads depict, people would rightfully stop using the product,\" Altman told the \"TBPN\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Our first principle with ads is that we're not going to put stuff into the LLM stream,\" Altman added. \"That would feel crazy dystopic, like a bad sci-fi movie.\"",

    "description": "Taiwan's Starlux is one of the few aviation startups to tackle the full-service air travel market, and is introducing the A350-1000 to its fleet.",
    "fullText": "Taiwanese airline Starlux is set to fly a new Airbus A350 variant that will expand its number of business-class seats by over 50%.\n\nThe seven-year-old startup is introducing 18 new A350-1000s to its fleet, with the first delivered in January.\n\nIts A350-1000 configuration offers 40 business-class seats, up from 26 on Starlux's current A350-900s.\n\nThe new aircraft adds 30 economy-class seats, bringing the total to 270 in coach. The rest of its A350-1000 offerings are unchanged from the A350-900, with 36 premium economy seats and four first-class suites.\n\nStarlux showcased its new plane at the Singapore Airshow this week, and Business Insider went aboard for a look.\n\nIt's known regionally for selling business-class tickets on short and medium-haul flights at roughly $1,500.\n\nSome of its longer routes, such as San Francisco to Taipei, can offer regular round-trip business-class fares as low as $2,600.\n\nSince launching flights in 2020, the Taiwanese airline has increasingly leaned on premium seat offerings, a trend among full-service carriers as market prices for economy seats have generally fallen.\n\nThe light under the passenger seat number changes from green to red when do-not-disturb mode is activated.\n\nCabin crew typically open and close the doors for passengers, but an emergency latch on the inside also allows the sliding panel to come loose.\n\nEssentially, that means the seat elevates the head and feet over the rear for better posture, so the passenger's body resembles a \"W.\"\n\nIf a passenger has two windows next to their seat, they can dim the second with a remote.\n\nThese seats have no overhead luggage compartments; instead, they feature a personal closet for each passenger. They're lined with leather, while business class seats are made of fabric.\n\nThere is no curtain or wall separating Starlux's business and first-class areas.\n\nIn-flight entertainment is available for every seat, with an extendable screen for those sitting in the front rows.\n\nChatting with a passenger across the aisle may prove more difficult on the A350-1000.\n\nThe new plane is also scheduled to begin flying Starlux's Phoenix route this summer. Starlux flies to 31 destinations, with five routes to the US.",

Since then, the chain has grown to seven locations in Northern California, according to the company website.\n\nThe chain specializes in fresh ice cream sandwiches and houses 15 flavors of ice cream, 13 types of cookies, ice cream sundaes, cakes, milkshakes, and ice cream pints to carry out.",

    "description": "Bosch's North America president told Business Insider the Super Bowl ad is part of a strategy to grow awareness and sales in the US.",
    "fullText": "Bosch has been in the US for more than a century, yet it remains a surprisingly fuzzy brand for many American consumers. The German industrial heavyweight is betting that the \"Mayor of Flavortown,\" Guy Fieri, can help change that as it pours billions of dollars into the region.\n\nOn Thursday, Bosch released the ad it intends to air during the Super Bowl this weekend. It stars a remarkably different clean-shaven, conservatively dressed Fieri, who returns to his normal spiky-haired, brightly colored look when he uses Bosch products — from a circular saw to a cooktop. His French Bulldog, Cash, also has a cameo in the ad, which carries the tagline, \"Like a Bosch.\"\n\nBosch joins a crop of Super Bowl LX advertisers leaning on comedy and recognizable faces this year, as they look to grab attention and avoid controversy during a politically charged year. Major brands are spending more than ever on A-list celebrity talent in their marketing, with CMOs under pressure to produce ads that cut through and deliver meaningful results.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, Paul Thomas, president of Bosch North America, said the company hopes the big game ad will help improve its brand recognition. Through Fieri and the lighthearted, comedic tone of this year's spot, Bosch also wants to foster a stronger emotional connection between customers and the brand, he added. It marks a shift from Bosch's more traditional marketing, which typically focused on technical features.\n\n\"There are a lot of things we're trying to accomplish with the campaign, but primarily to show that the Bosch brand is something you can rely on and helps you improve your life,\" Thomas said.\n\nFieri was a \"no-brainer\" to help achieve these goals because he cooks and does his own construction, often using Bosch products.\n\n\"He represents the confidence, too,\" Thomas said.\n\nSuch was Fieri's transformation for this campaign that some social media users lambasted the celebrity chef's early teaser posts as \"AI slop.\" Bosch said it didn't use AI and instead relied on a makeup artist and some visual effects editing.\n\nA post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri)\n\nBosch is working toward a goal of North America contributing 20% of the company's global sales by 2030, up from around 18% in 2024. It's doubling down on certain categories — such as cordless power tools and home appliances — where Bosch lags rivals in market share. The company has announced more than $6 billion in US-based acquisitions since 2023.\n\nIts big push in the US comes as the company cuts costs elsewhere. Bosch recently confirmed it is cutting 20,000 jobs in Germany after its profits nearly halved last year. The industrial giant is facing competition from Chinese companies in its automotive business, as well as pressures from US tariffs and a decline in demand for household appliances.\n\nThe average price of a 30-second spot during this year's Super Bowl reached $8 million, with some slots fetching up to $10 million, per NBCUniversal, which is broadcasting the game. Thomas said the expenditure on the Super Bowl amid cost-cutting within its home business reflected the balance many companies need to make as they focus on growth.\n\n\"If you don't have a brand campaign, do the problems get even worse in the future?\" Thomas said.\n\nBosch made its Super Bowl ad debut last year and saw \"tangible lifts\" in consumer engagement, such as people entering hardware and appliance stores to specifically ask for Bosch products, he said.\n\n\"It would really be a pity if you did it once and didn't continue on with it because then you lose all the momentum that you could gain,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant has a simple explanation for why his brand keeps winning while much of the fast-food industry is struggling: it's doing more than one thing well at once.\n\n\"When you look at being a buzzy brand, you look at value, you look at digital, you look at category entry points and innovation, and all those things are working in concert with each other,\" Tresvant told Business Insider. \"Other brands can do one or two. When we do it, we get all four right, and we're very good in each part of that magic formula.\"\n\nYum! Brands, Taco Bell's parent company, announced during its earnings report on Wednesday that the Mexican-inspired chain delivered 7% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter, far outpacing the rest of the segment as consumers continue to pull back on dining out.\n\nWhile much of the fast-food industry is grappling with slowing traffic as customers watch their wallets, Taco Bell's growth was driven by bigger-ticket transactions, especially among younger diners, even as competitors relied heavily on discounting.\n\nFoot-traffic data backs that up. A Placer.ai analysis of Yum Brands' fourth-quarter performance found that Taco Bell locations held up better than many quick-service competitors during key value-driven periods, even as broader fast-food visits softened amid inflation fatigue.\n\nTresvant says Taco Bell's advantage comes from combining the things competitors often struggle to balance: offering consistently good value rather than short-term deals, rapid-fire menu innovation, and a growing loyalty program that's actually driving incremental visits. That formula, he told Business Insider, has allowed Taco Bell to keep growing traffic and relevance \"in any environment,\" even as other fast-food brands fight simply to stay flat.\n\nTaco Bell's numbers reflect its loyalty push. Tresvant said active loyalty members climbed 31% in the fourth quarter, while digital channels grew 29%, as app-exclusive drops and rewards nudged customers to visit more often. Tresvant said the goal isn't just engagement, but turning loyalty into repeat traffic — which keeps the brand resilient.\n\nAlthough value-focused options now make up 17% of Taco Bell's menu, like its $5, $7, and $9 bundle offerings, what especially appeals to Taco Bell consumers is its pace of menu innovation — even when they're full price. From the return of its Quesarito and recent launch of its sauce collaboration with Frank's RedHot, to limited-time beverage offerings at its Live Más Café locations, every new rollout, Tresvant said, is \"determined on consumer needs and wants.\"\n\nAcross the restaurant industry, traditional quick-service strategies aren't working as they once did because of the uneven pressure of the K-shaped economy, where lower-income consumers have pulled back on dining out while higher-income spending remains stable.\n\nMany chains have leaned hard into deep discounting and short-term deals to lure customers back, but analysts and industry executives warn that constant promotions can erode pricing power and fail to drive meaningful traffic growth.\n\nAt the same time, competitors like Chipotle are recalibrating for smaller, wealthier consumer segments, underscoring how uneven the recovery has been across the sector.\n\nThat's not the strategy for Taco Bell. Instead of narrowing its focus, the chain has leaned on loyalty perks and app-exclusive offers to keep a broad range of customers coming back — particularly younger diners who are more likely to engage digitally even as they cut costs elsewhere.\n\n\"We continue to innovate on the menu, but not only on the menu,\" Tresvant added. \"We're going to make sure we're innovating from a guest hospitality standpoint, we're going to innovate in operations and innovate around the brand, not just in food.\"\n\nThat means continued exploration of voice AI ordering systems, which are being tested at 600 Taco Bell locations, as well as other efficiency-optimizing technologies to streamline back-of-house operations and improve the guest experience.\n\nIt also means giving consumers new ways to stay connected to the Taco Bell brand, like its Y2K-era cross-brand collaboration with Hollister, which sold out late last year.\n\nFor Tresvant, that momentum has created rare room to experiment at a time when much of the fast-food industry is still focused on defense.\n\n\"The things we're doing are working, and that just gives us a little bit of permission to take big swings in 2026,\" Tresvant said.",

    "title": "Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software.",
    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "A Louisville business is facing criticism after the owner told employees to \"leave religion and politics at the door” when she received a note from a customer who said he was treated disrespectfully because he was a member of law enforcement.\n\nPlease & Thank You owner Brooke Vaughn told The Courier Journal that she sent the message to her management team Feb. 3 after receiving an email from a man, who identified himself as a police officer, saying he had been treated disrespectfully. In the email, the man said he was “greeted by a rude person” and got “evil looks from all of the employees.”\n\n“REMINDER to leave your religion and politics at the door when you come to work for PLEASE & THANK YOU,” the message reads. “If you discriminate against anyone inside our shops, you are not meant to be a DAY MAKER and should consider a career elsewhere.”\n\nA screenshot of the message was posted to Reddit around 1:30 p.m. Feb. 3, with the post saying it was sent after Vaughn received an email from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Vaughn said the officer who complained to her wrote that he was in uniform during his visit, but did not confirm if the man was an ICE agent.\n\nWithin hours of the message being posted to social media, Vaughn said she and other staff members started receiving several complaints, adding that she was forced to turn off the comment feature on the business' Instagram page due to ongoing arguments.\n\n“People are showing up at shops and calling our employees ‘fascists,’” she said.\n\nVaughn added that the store's media accounts have also gained followers since the message was posted, but she was unsure if they were following to support the business or to \"see [them] fail.\"\n\nThe criticism comes after two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests. Thousands of federal immigration officers were previously sent to Minnesota in December, and President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan announced Feb. 4 that 700 immigration enforcement personnel would be leaving the state.\n\nMetro columnist Joe Gerth contributed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Please & Thank You owner facing backlash after memo posted online",

    "description": "\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" said Selkirk Sport co-founder Mike Barnes.",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes started selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement when they were teenagers. It was part of a homeschool project and evolved into a profitable business.\n\nA few years later, they launched a pickleball equipment company at ages 19 and 22. They had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball would ever take off.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down,'\" Rob told Business Insider. \"And we were like, let's double down, see what happens.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, that bet has paid off. Selkirk is now one of the leading pickleball equipment brands, known for its premium paddles, and the family-run company expects to generate nine-figure revenue in 2026.\n\nThe Barnes brothers say that while they skipped traditional higher education, learning has always been central to how they run their business. They've learned from other successful founders and executives by reading a lot of business books.\n\nThey shared six of their top recs.\n\nBoth brothers say they gravitate toward biographies and autobiographies because they show how decisions actually play out in the real world.\n\n\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" Rob said. \"You have people literally talking about how they made a decision and why, and then showing how it played out, good or bad.\"\n\nSome of their favorite autobiographies and memoirs include:\n\nOne business book the brothers said influenced them early on was \"The E-Myth\" by Michael E. Gerber, which dispels myths about starting a business.\n\nThey also recommend \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" which tells the story of RJR Nabisco's fall.\n\n\"It was interesting — more of a warning about how corporate governance can get out of hand,\" they said of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's bestseller.\n\nFinally, one of Mike's favorites is \"The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.\"\n\nThe book profiles eight relatively unknown CEOs who delivered extraordinary results by ignoring convention.\n\n\"They weren't very big on public perception,\" Mike said. \"But they ran their companies really well in unconventional ways. And it worked.\"\n\nThe brothers are very willing to question conventional wisdom.\n\nThey don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business, and said they try to avoid a \"best practices\" mindset.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nRob added, \"No one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does. Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "description": "Business Insider was on the scene at a WSJ conference that brought together leaders from Blackstone, Lazard, and Citi.",
    "fullText": "Most people flock to Palm Beach for sunshine and an escape. But on Tuesday, Wall Street's elite got 40-degree weather and nonstop talk about one company: Anthropic.\n\nAs the morning session of The Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event kicked off, the AI startup announced its new \"Claude Cowork\" legal plugins, a tool designed to automate contract triage and NDAs. The news unnerved investors, dragging down indexes like the Nasdaq and tech stocks from Palantir to Oracle. Thomson Reuters had dipped 20% by mid-afternoon, experiencing one of its worst single-day drops as investors panicked that software investments deemed cutting-edge a few years ago could soon be rendered passé.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of the investment bank Lazard and a former Obama administration official, offered a sobering macro view. \"The US economy and the equity market at this point are highly levered bets with regard to AI taking off,\" he said. \"What I think you're seeing is when people get nervous about whether that'll happen.\"\n\nThat said, he didn't contest the tech's future — just that some key players might not be around in a few years. \"You can bet on the technology paying off,\" he said, \"but that the firms making the investments today are not necessarily the ones that benefit.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, which manages over $1.3 trillion, emphasized the lucrative effects of the mini-economy that's sprung up to meet the physical and infrastructural demands of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"To us, you don't necessarily have to know who the winners and losers are going to be,\" Gray said. \"You know that the data centers, the autonomous vehicles, the robots, they're all going to plug into the wall, and there's going to be a lot of need for digital infrastructure.\"\n\nSeveral attendees had recently returned from last month's World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps and were likely hoping to leave the chill behind. But alas, one woman I spotted was bundled up in fur, and I personally had to fish out a 10-year-old coat from the back of my closet to make it from my Uber to the event's entrance.\n\nAt lunchtime, we decamped to the courtyard for a salmon salad and sweet iced tea, and the conversation drifted between the rise of South Florida in the post-pandemic era and the outlook for financial sponsors' spending this year. But as we shuffled back to our seats for the afternoon's lineup of speakers, the chill returned as we caught up with the market's increasingly dour reaction to Anthropic's news.\n\nSteven Tananbaum, founder of GoldenTree Asset Management, saw an opportunity in the rout. For a credit specialist, \"indiscriminate selling\" is a chance to find value where others see only collapse. \"The idea that all software is the same is what's exciting,\" he said about the broad sell-off. \"There's just indiscriminate selling regardless of what the prospects are.\"\n\nThe day ended with a reminder that while the markets might be sweating over incremental news, the C-suite is playing a longer game.\n\nAs it happened, I got to ask the final question of the day's concluding speaker, Mark Mason, Citi's chief financial officer, who's stepping down from his role this spring. He pointed to the cost-saving potential of AI, which would free up more money for Citi to devote to advancing CEO Jane Fraser's mission: putting the bank's multiyear overhaul behind it. The bank is applying the tech to its most critical processes, he said.\n\n\"What will it take to actually drive greater efficiency in that process? And I think that's a much better approach than the way others have thought about use cases,\" he added, referring to other banks.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hemant Taneja, the CEO of General Catalyst, a major VC backer of Anthropic, conceded that the economy will shed jobs due to AI, urging attendees to focus on education to retrain workers. \"Never ever was there a case that every skill in any job can be better done by AI and robotics,\" he said, \"which is, I think, where we are headed in the next, not five, but 20 to 30 years.\"\n\nStill, some speakers, like billionaire activist Nelson Peltz, brought some levity to the proceedings. Peltz — famous for his high-profile corporate showdowns with executives like Disney's Bob Iger — expressed enthusiasm for technology that could pump out faster, simpler answers to his legal questions.\n\n\"Not being a lawyer, I'm sort of happy,\" he said, as anxious laughter coursed through the room.",

    "description": "As Google's earnings report looms, its AI strategy and ad business with Gemini 3 put it at the forefront of a volatile AI market.",
    "fullText": "Google has had a great run since its last earnings report. Can it last?\n\nThat's the big question ahead of the tech giant's earnings report this afternoon. BI's Hugh Langley, our resident Google expert, breaks down what you need to look out for in the numbers and on the call.\n\nGoogle has been on a three-month tear since its last check-in, launching Gemini 3 to much fanfare and joining the $4 trillion market-cap club. The string of successes put it at the front of the highly competitive AI race.\n\n(A quick aside on these arbitrary rankings. You could argue Nvidia's the biggest winner of the AI race, but it's really in its own bucket. I'm talking about companies with competing chatbots. No further questions at this time.)\n\nBut here's the thing about the AI race. It's highly volatile. One quarter, you're the belle of the ball; the next, you can't even get your texts returned. Just ask Meta and Microsoft.\n\nInvestors are expecting a big swing one way or another. Google's implied one-day share move following earnings is 4.9%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nYou don't have to search too far to find the key to Google's earnings.\n\nGoogle Search (get it) and the ad business built around it are still the company's crown jewel. It's also an area many have speculated AI would upend. (Why \"Google it\" if you can \"ChatGPT it\"?)\n\nGoogle has managed to incorporate AI features without cannibalizing its cash cow. But it's a tricky balancing act, and Google is already blurring the line between Search and Gemini.\n\nThe real tipping point will be ads. Google executives have been adamant that there are no immediate plans to bring them to Gemini anytime soon. However, if Search's massive traffic ultimately gets passed to the chatbots, advertising's arrival feels inevitable.\n\nIt also might not have a choice.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to roll out ads to some ChatGPT users despite Sam Altman previously calling them a \"last resort.\" In such a highly competitive race, and with so much money on the line, giving your rivals any type of headstart is a risk.",

    "fullText": "Digital pinboard business cutting 15% of workforce as it invests heavily in AI\n\nPinterest has fired two engineers who created a software tool to identify which workers had lost their jobs in a recent round of cuts and then shared the information, according to reports.\n\nThe digital pinboard business announced significant job cuts earlier this month, with the chief executive, Bill Ready, telling staff he was “doubling down on an AI-forward approach”, according to a LinkedIn post by a former employee.\n\nPinterest, which is based in San Francisco and has an office in London, said the cuts would affect about 15% of its workforce, or about 700 people, but did not specify which teams or staff members would be affected.\n\nTwo engineers at the company then wrote code to identify sacked staff.\n\nA spokesperson for Pinterest said: “Two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly. This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues’ privacy.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the engineers, who have not been named, shared the information with colleagues, or with people outside Pinterest.\n\nThe script – a set of commands written to automate a task within existing software or change its function – was aimed at internal tools for workers to communicate, the BBC reported, citing an anonymous source.\n\nThe source, whom the BBC said was “familiar with the firings”, said the code created an alert as to which employee names were being removed or deactivated.\n\nPinterest has been investing heavily in AI to create more personalised content for its users and automated tools for marketers. But shares in the company have dropped by more than 20% this year as investors assess the threat from more advanced AI platforms.\n\nReady said in a company-wide meeting that while “healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions”, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.\n\nThe chief executive said Pinterest was facing a “critical moment” and that staff should consider a job elsewhere if they were “working against the direction of the company” and disagreed with its mission, CNBC reported.\n\nIt comes amid a wave of job cuts in the techy sector, as businesses increasingly rely on AI. Last week, Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 roles worldwide, its second round of redundancies in three months.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs division to redirect resources to AI wearables and phone features. Meanwhile, Autodesk, a design software maker, announced plans this month to cut about 1,000 jobs.",

    "description": "A senior software engineer at Google took 40 Coursera courses and got multiple grad degrees to shift from business to AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Max Buckley, a 38-year-old senior software engineer at Google, based in Zurich, Switzerland. His identity and employment has been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a senior software engineer at Google in Zurich, where I've worked since 2013.\n\nMost people don't go from business to a more technical background, but my bachelor's degree was in business studies, and I joined Google out of undergrad as a financial analyst intern.\n\nOver several years, I pivoted from financial analysis to business analysis, then to trust and safety, and onto an engineering team in 2016. I joined several other software engineering teams, and then eventually joined Google Cloud AI, where I worked on one of the cloud AI products for a few years.\n\nThen I joined an internal LLM innovation team within Google's core infrastructure group, which we later turned into an LLM information retrieval applied research team, where I am today, leading the team.\n\nTo make multiple shifts like this, you need to upskill and explore other areas. Here's how I did it:\n\nAs soon as I joined Google, I decided my North Star was to become a data scientist. Initially, I had a lot of success broadening my skillset with online courses like Coursera, edX, or Stanford. I used them to explore finance, then statistics, then spent most of my time in the computer science and data science space.\n\nAll in all, I completed roughly 40 online open courses, most of them through Coursera.\n\nSome of the courses I took include:\n\nThe courses were spread out from 2013 to 2021, and I took them on evenings and weekends. I didn't have much time for video games, but I still made time to go to the gym, eat, sleep, and spend time with my girlfriend.\n\nI wasn't super structured in my approach to taking courses. I didn't say \"I must do five hours a day,\" or anything like that. I took them as I felt the need to do one or to learn more about a particular topic. I didn't burn out from it.\n\nThe most measurably impactful courses I completed were the first two Coursera courses: Data Analysis and Computing for Data Analysis. I did them right before I interviewed for my internship at Google and the interviewer happened to have done the same course, so we had this instant rapport.\n\nI also did more formal part-time study.\n\nI finished my Bachelor of Business Studies in 2013. Then at Google, I got a part-time postgraduate certificate in statistics, which took a year. Then I did a part-time master's degree in Business Analytics, which took two years. Then I pursued a part-time master's degree in software engineering, which took close to five years. Most recently, I did a diploma in Advanced Studies In Data Science, which took another two years.\n\nI did a bunch of summer school certificates, which is when you spend a week doing PhD-level courses.\n\nMy message to others who want to transition is don't be discouraged. When I first wanted to join Google, several hiring managers weren't interested because I didn't have a computer science undergraduate degree. Similarly, when I applied for a Master's in Business Analytics, I was initially declined because I didn't have a technical undergraduate degree and two semesters of programming experience, even though I was programming at Google. There were hurdles that I had to work around.\n\nI always wanted to study computer science, but my dad told me it's better to learn something different because I'll probably end up in it anyway. In hindsight, he was right.\n\nStudying computer science would have certainly expedited my career track, but I'm in a place where it's no longer a hindrance, and I'm familiar with a bunch of business theories, like Porter's Five Forces. They're not always useful, but every once in a while, it comes up in conversation.\n\nThe constant here is that my background includes continuous learning. When recruiters or hiring managers see my profile, they see that I'm not someone who gets complacent.\n\nDid you make a career pivot? We want to hear from you.

    "description": "After 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard, Andrew Miller landed a corporate role at Amazon — but with 6 kids, it didn't leave him enough time to be a dad.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

    "fullText": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that CEOs are scared of talking about politics — and sick of yo-yoing between politicians to stay successful.\n\nGriffin said that the US government's new style of direct engagement with corporate America is causing some business leaders to question whether their fortunes will change from one administration to the next, depending on their level of public support.\n\n\"When the US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin said at the Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event on Tuesday.\n\nLeaders, he said, would rather focus on creating value for customers and shareholders than catering to an administration.\n\n\"Most CEOs just don't want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,\" he said.\n\nGriffin criticized current and past administrations for their involvement in corporate America, citing green energy investments under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\n\"We don't need the US government to pretend to be venture capitalists,\" he said.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration took a nearly 10% stake in Intel, a few weeks after the president had called on Intel's CEO to resign, but changed his tune after a White House meeting.\n\nWhen asked why fewer CEOs are speaking out about hot-button political issues, Griffin said they're still reeling from prior years, when companies that involved themselves in what he called the \"woke movement\" were either \"embraced or ostracized\" as a result.\n\n\"That's created a level of fear and apprehension among the corporate CEO class to insert themselves in any publicly facing issues these days,\" Griffin said.\n\nSocial media has, he added, taken apprehension to a fever pitch, since sentiment about a company or its product can catch like wildfire.\n\n\"The power of social media to persuade millions or tens of millions of consumers to make a product choice is really terrifying to corporate executives,\" Griffin said. Recent deadly shootings by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Minnesota have pushed some CEOs, from big names in tech to small business owners, to comment publicly on politics again.\n\nGriffin, one of the GOP's biggest donors, was also asked about whether he has plans to run for public office, Griffin said that he hasn't ruled it out. \n\n\"I'd like to believe at a future point in my life I will be involved in public service,\" adding that it was unlikely in the next few years.\n\nIn terms of others' public service, Griffin praised Trump's pick for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, calling the nomination a \"powerful assertion that the Fed will maintain needed independence in policy decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "description": "Finnish military personnel told Business Insider that temperature variation is a huge threat to their weapons in the Arctic.",
    "fullText": "Frozen weapons are among the many challenges NATO soldiers would face in an Arctic conflict.\n\nSoldiers have to be careful not to let the harsh elements cause their guns to malfunction.\n\nBut they also can't let the guns get too warm, as that creates new problems.\n\nSODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "title": "NATO soldiers say they can't let their guns get too warm if they want them to work on frozen battlefields",
    "description": "Finnish military personnel told Business Insider that temperature variation is a huge threat to their weapons in the Arctic.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "description": "A Business for Good-Harris poll found that 75% of Americans agree \"hands-on skills and practice experience\" matter more than formal degrees.",
    "fullText": "Americans think the future of work is in their hands.\n\nA poll commissioned by the Business for Good Foundation, a nonprofit focused on reducing the wealth gap, found that 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\n\"You've got a lot of people that have historically didn't think the American dream was for them,\" Ed Mitzen, cofounder of the Business for Good Foundation, told Business Insider ahead of the poll's release. \"I would argue that it isn't broken, it's just moved, and it's moved to places we stop looking.\"\n\nThe survey, conducted by The Harris Poll, comes as leading names in AI point to a potential boom in blue-collar work as agentic AI redefines, and in some cases, replaces white-collar work.\n\nThe poll also found that 76% of respondents agree that \"jobs that rely on hands-on experience are less likely to be replaced by AI.\"\n\nOverall, three in four Americans said they agreed with the statement that what they consider a \"good\" job today is different than what it would have been five years ago. And 78% agreed with the statement \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" as society puts a greater emphasis on hands-on skills.\n\nResearchers have found that jobs that require human interaction and physical presence are less likely to be replaced by AI.\n\nIndeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index recently examined how generative AI could perform jobs that require problem-solving ability and physical labor. Their findings were that nursing, childcare, and construction were the least likely to be affected by AI.\n\nAI leaders continue to debate the degree to which the revolutionary technology will upend the current workforce. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has stood by his prediction that AI could eliminate roughly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs over the next 1 to 5 years. Others, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned the extent of Amodei's dour prediction.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said at the World Economic Forum that now is the perfect time to go into the trades. In part because the AI industry itself will need an influx of workers to help build the massive data centers it wants to build.\n\n\"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" Huang said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk previously said that any job that involves manual labor is likely to survive much longer amid the \"supersonic tsunami\" that is AI.\n\n\"Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,\" Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan in November. \"But anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning.\"\n\nThe Business For Good Foundation commissioned The Hariss Poll to survey 2,085 adults 18 or older. Harris Poll conducted the survey online in the US from January 13th through January 15th. The overall margin or error is ±2.5 percentage points.",

Will they make a surprise move on deadline day?\n\nChelsea have had a bid for Nigeria midfielder Jennifer Echegini turned down by Paris St-Germain but might make another attempt.

The Blues are yet to make any signings in this window and manager Sonia Bompastor has hinted at frustration over a lack of squad depth.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester City defender Codie Thomas, 19, has a loan deal in principle agreed with Glasgow City.\n\nLondon City Lionesses are hoping to add one more before the deadline but still have work to do, while Aston Villa have looked at attacking options all winter.\n\nEverton might still do some business, with Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar on the verge of joining on loan with an obligation-to-buy clause.

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "title": "Disney's latest earnings show why Josh D'Amaro is widely viewed as the CEO frontrunner",
    "description": "Under Josh D'Amaro, Disney's experiences business has carried the company's profits. It shows why he's considered a top CEO contender.",
    "fullText": "Josh D'Amaro appears to be the frontrunner in the race to be Disney's next CEO, and the Mouse House's latest quarterly earnings showed why.\n\nDisney's experiences business, which D'Amaro oversees, is the backbone of a company that's being weighed down by the struggling pay-TV business and isn't yet lifted up by its streaming profits. And when that part of the business sneezes, the stock catches a cold.\n\nAlthough the unit generated record profits, and Disney overall slightly beat Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings, the stock fell about 5% in early trading.\n\nInvestors seemed worried about Disney's reference to \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks. Other possible factors driving down the stock were Disney's year-over-year decline in earnings per share and its lukewarm second-quarter guidance.\n\nBoth the record experiences profits and the investor concerns underscore just how important D'Amaro and his fiefdom are to the company.\n\nBloomberg reported on Monday that Disney's board of directors \"is aligning on promoting\" D'Amaro to replace longtime CEO Bob Iger, who's planning to retire later this year. Business Insider could not independently confirm the reporting. Disney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUsers on the prediction market Kalshi assigned Josh D'Amaro a 92% chance of becoming the next CEO as of Monday morning.\n\nDana Walden, who runs Disney's entertainment and TV businesses, is widely seen to be the other top contender for the coveted CEO job. Walden has grown the streaming unit, which also turned in record profits in the last quarter. It's crucial to Disney's future, since traditional TV networks are losing their value due to continued cord-cutting.\n\nStill, D'Amaro's division is the profit-generating machine. Disney's parks, cruises, and products accounted for more than 70% of its operating income, despite making up a relatively small slice of its revenue at under 39%. Jason Bazinet, a media analyst at Citi, said Monday on CNBC that almost all of Disney's earnings underperformance last quarter came from the entertainment segment.\n\nBazinet added that \"virtually everyone\" on the buy side that he's spoken to \"would prefer that Mr. D'Amaro is named the new CEO.\"\n\n\"Nothing against Ms. Walden, but people just like Mr. D'Amaro a bit more,\" he said.\n\nD'Amaro's experiences segment has pulled off an impressive feat: consistently reeling in record revenue and hefty profits by making more money from each visitor, without alienating its biggest fans. The Mouse House has raised ticket prices for its US parks in each of the past four years.\n\nDisney said per-person spending at its US parks rose 4% last quarter, though attendance only increased by 1%, due in part to a dip in visits from international guests. That means the company is making more per customer, in part by upselling through Lightning Lane fast passes. While Disney could risk losing lower-income or middle-class visitors if it keeps hiking prices, its results suggest that's not an issue yet.\n\nOn Disney's earnings call, one analyst remarked on how the parks business had gone from the worst part of the company's portfolio to its profit engine.\n\nIger responded that he's \"very, very bullish\" on the parks business, which has \"never been more broad or more diverse.\"\n\n\"We have a healthy competition now at our company, in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the No. 1 driver of profitability for the company,\" Iger said, in reference to the experiences and entertainment businesses — though he could also have been slyly nodding at the race between Walden and D'Amaro.",

    "description": "While many companies try to foster an “ownership culture” to boost engagement and performance, true success comes when employees are given actual equity stakes. However, financial ownership alone is insufficient; the most effective organizations combine broad-based equity with three key management practices: financial transparency, empathetic leadership, and rigorous measurement and management of culture. These practices—clear communication about how individual actions impact business outcomes, leaders who listen and build trust, and data-driven approaches to people and culture—drive higher engagement, retention, and operational improvements. Importantly, even companies without equity programs can replicate these results by applying the same principles to bonuses, profit sharing, or career development, making ownership behaviors accessible and impactful for all.",

WeissFebruary 2, 2026PostPostShareSavePrintSummary.   Leer en españolLer em portuguêsPostPostShareSavePrintU.S. worker engagement has stagnated for decades, with more than two-thirds of workers feeling detached or disengaged from work. To reverse the trend, many executives have strived to build an “ownership culture,” hoping personal responsibility will drive productivity. Yet most omit the most vital ingredient, actual ownership. We spent the past four years studying companies that committed to this missing piece, extending equity to all employees. While broad-based ownership isn’t new, a recent surge led by private equity has made it a potent economic force. Since 2022, more than $1.3 billion has been distributed to 41,000 non-executive employees, with projections exceeding $20 billion in the coming decade.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin miners globally are facing increasing challenges to stay afloat in their business.\n\nThe whole Bitcoin-halving gambit and the volatility of crypto as a whole, thanks to geopolitical tensions, are making many miners move away from the business to something more sustainable, like artificial intelligence.\n\nThey have the machines, they have the power, so why not pivot?\n\nOne Bitcoin miner is facing an even bigger trouble, like a double-edged sword: bankruptcy and leadership turmoil.\n\nA Russian court has placed the parent company of BitRiver, the country’s largest Bitcoin mining firm, under official bankruptcy supervision.\n\nBitRiver was once a symbol of Russia’s industrial-scale crypto ambitions. At one point, it oversaw 15 data centers with a combined capacity of 533 megawatts and controlled over 50% of the domestic Bitcoin mining market, according to HSE Center for Electric Power Research. The company reported more than 10 billion rubles ($131.6 million) in revenue in 2024, before its power lines began to dim.\n\nOn Jan. 27, the Sverdlovsk Regional Arbitration Court initiated monitoring procedures for Fox Group of Companies LLC, which owns 98% of BitRiver Management Company, according to a report by Kommersant.\n\nInfrastructure of Siberia, part of energy conglomerate En+ Group, filed the bankruptcy petition over a canceled equipment supply deal. The firm paid more than 700 million rubles (approx. $9.1 million) in advance for mining hardware that never arrived.\n\nAfter the contract was terminated, courts sided with En+ in April 2025, but enforcement efforts found no recoverable assets, prompting the bankruptcy filing. BitRiver’s accounts were later frozen, a move legal experts warned could “paralyze operations,” Kommersant reported.\n\nLeading miner walks away from Bitcoin\n\nNasdaq sends delisting threat to another crypto firm\n\nAbundant Mines CEO says post-halving Bitcoin mining will look different\n\nThe En+ dispute is just one part of BitRiver’s broader financial unraveling. The company faces mounting electricity debts and multiple lawsuits from energy suppliers.\n\nCourts are reviewing claims totaling more than 940 million rubles ($12.2 million), including 133 million from En+ Sbyt, 640 million from the Irkutsk Electric Grid Company, and 168.7 million already awarded to NTEK. Regional utilities under Rosseti have also filed collection suits.\n\nBitRiver’s internal structure has deteriorated in parallel. Layoffs began in early 2025, followed by salary delays and executive resignations.",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

How many of you went to a Stop the Steal protest with a loaded automatic weapon?”—prompting the entire room of ICE agents to raise their hands.\n\n“You gotta do better,” Davidson says, briefly breaking character. “I’m Tom Homan, OK? I am the separating-families-at-the-border guy. I’m the on-film-taking-a-$50,000-bribe guy. And y’all are making me look like the upstanding, reasonable adult in the room.

    "fullText": "The blueberry and strawberry fields at Southern Hill Farms were buried in chunks of ice.\n\nWhile it can look picturesque amid the morning sun, it can also be catastrophic to the plants – and the farmers' business.\n\nThe plants were sprayed with light water overnight to create a thin ice layer, which helps to protect the plants. Too much ice, however, can cause the plants to break and topple over.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nCLERMONT, Fla. - In the light of day, it looks like a glass forest. Every leaf, every branch, and every fruit in this Lake County field is encased in a thick, translucent armor.\n\nBut for the farmers here, this isn’t a winter wonderland.\n\nThe owners and staff at Southern Hill Farms in Clermont, Florida, did not sleep – staying awake throughout the night to monitor their plants and fields as freezing temperatures hit the area.\n\n\"We knew it was gonna be a terrible night. When you make ice at eight o'clock, it's gonna be bad, bad night,\" said David Hill, one of the owners.\n\n\"We've done this a million times when it was a cold event. We run overhead irrigation to either to wash frost off or to freeze, put a protective layer of water, ice around the berry and the plant. Normally, it's 30 degrees, 32 degrees, wind's not real high. The event we had last night was catastrophic.\"\n\nThe ice got too heavy for some of the sprinklers that hover above the fields. So, when the plants became to heavy and fell, the sprinkler systems go with it.\n\n\"We've got overhead irrigation pipes in field and they were, you know, the the plants are all around there and they were solid ice, they would take down the pipes with it,\" the owners said.\n\nSunday night brings more freezing temperatures to the area. The farm closed Saturday and Sunday due to the ice.\n\nWhat's next is to get through the night, evaluate the damage, and then figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"During a freeze event, farmers use overhead irrigation to protect crops by continuously applying water. As that water freezes, it releases heat, creating a protective layer of ice that helps keep plants at a survivable temperature. It’s a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring, long hours, and a whole lot of experience,\" the farm wrote on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nFOX 35's Jessica Dobson was at Southern Hill Farms on Sunday morning, Feb. 1, 2026. She talked to the owners and gave viewers a first-hand look at the ice. Southern Hill also posted about the ice and freezing temperatures on its Facebook page.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised and lightly cajoled his major Taiwanese suppliers to produce more to help power strong demand for AI, capping a visit ​to the island of his birth, where he has been mobbed by adoring fans at ‌every step.\n\nSpeaking at an impromptu press conference in the rain outside a Taipei restaurant late on Saturday, where he had hosted suppliers ‌for a \"trillion-dollar dinner\", named after the market capitalisation of those firms attending, Huang said this would be another good year for business.\n\n\"TSMC needs to work very hard this year because I need a lot of wafers,\" he said, laughing, referring to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest producer of advanced chips used in artificial-intelligence applications.\n\n\"TSMC is ⁠doing an incredible job and they're working ‌very, very hard. We have a lot of demand this year,\" he added after taking pictures with a beaming TSMC CEO C.C. Wei.\n\n\"Over the next 10 years, TSMC ‍will likely increase their capacity by much more than 100%, and so this is a very substantial scale-up in the next decade.\"\n\nWei did not answer questions from reporters.\n\nLast month, TSMC said capital spending could jump as much as 37% this ​year to $56 billion, and would increase \"significantly\" in 2028 and 2029 given AI demand.\n\nHuang, who emigrated to the ‌United States as a child, is met by a throng of adoring fans wherever he returns to Taiwan. Local media, who refer to him as \"the people's dad\", breathlessly report on his every move.\n\nHuang co-founded California-based Nvidia in 1993. Last year, it became the first company to breach $5 trillion in market value, continuing a meteoric rise that has firmly positioned it at the heart of the global AI revolution.\n\nIn Taipei, he expressed concern about ⁠supplies of memory chips, which support AI workloads, amid a ​production crunch.\n\n\"We need a lot of memory this year,\" he said. \"I ​think that the entire supply chain is challenging this year because demand is so much more.\"\n\nHuang periodically stepped out of the dinner, attended by two dozen executives, including Young ‍Liu, chairman of contract-electronics maker ⁠Foxconn, Nvidia's biggest server maker, to greet his fans and sign autographs.\n\n\"We have so many partners here in Taiwan. Nvidia won't be possible without Taiwan. There's magic in this island. The companies here ⁠have extraordinary technology, they've incredible culture,\" he said, when asked about how he felt about his movie star-like fame whenever he visits.",

    "description": "When cosmetics meets corporate finance, JPMorgan's Fei-Fei Zhang is often at the intersection. Here's what she predicts for the business of beauty.",
    "fullText": "The cosmetics industry's glamour has caught Wall Street's eye — and investors are recognizing that beauty is more than skin deep.\n\nBeauty has become a booming sector, driven by a wave of savvy social media creators and startups that are shaping trends and fueling spending. The consulting firm McKinsey predicts that, by 2030, the industry could be worth nearly $600 billion. At JPMorgan, Fei-Fei Zhang is shaping how the bank is approaching the opportunity.\n\nInvestment banker Zhang, JPMorgan's head of beauty for North America, has advised on a string of blockbuster deals asector hasctor's gained momentum. Zhang was a senior leader on the team behind the $1 billion sale of Rhode, the skincare brand cofounded by Hailey Bieber, to e.l.f. Beauty, announced last May.\n\nWithin weeks, British skincare brand Medik8 was sold to cosmetics giant L'Oreal for more than $1 billion, which Zhang advised on. She also helped Mammoth Brands — founded by the team behind grooming brand Harry's — on its October purchase of the diaper brand Coterie, marking a foray into the vast baby care market.\n\nIn April 2025, the bank promoted Zhang to its most powerful rank — managing director — the culmination of the professional rise for a self-proclaimed beauty industry aficionado who started working at JPMorgan as an intern in 2011. By the time she'd made VP, she was pushing her higher-ups to expand in the sector, becoming an architect of its burgeoning cosmetics industry strategy.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with Zhang about her predictions for dealmaking in 2026, what makes brands stand out in the boardroom, and how it felt to be a part of the sale of Rhode. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are you getting excited about in 2026?\n\nSpecific to beauty, acquisitions have always been central to the industry. One theme we saw last year that will likely carry through is what I'd call corporate clarity. We started to see an uptick in corporate carve-outs, with strategics reorienting their portfolios toward growth platforms and greater margin accretion.\n\nThe other driver remains core to the industry: acquisitions of high-growth independent brands that fill portfolio gaps — whether immediately for strategics or through a multi-step path that may involve private equity first.\n\nHow do private equity firms and corporate buyers approach beauty differently? Do you expect the PE firms to step up their activity this year?\n\nBeauty has very attractive qualities for private equity. It's a highly replenishable category, it has stable growth characteristics, and it has proven resilient through economic cycles. When you look at the financials, you often see strong margins and high free-cash-flow generation.\n\nWhat has shifted is discipline. Buyers are more discerning and are evaluating opportunities with elevated expectations around scale, growth, profitability, and brand history. That reflects lessons learned from prior cycles, including the very high level of M&A activity in 2021.\n\nHow are influencer trends shaping the industry in the boardroom?\n\nOn social media, the impact has been transformative. It has fundamentally reshaped the beauty industry, enabling an explosion of new entrants and accelerating how quickly a product or brand can gain traction.\n\nThe same forces that propel rapid growth can create challenging expectations to sustain it. Brands are scaling faster than ever, but a key question becomes whether they have the resonance and infrastructure to deliver durable, long-term growth. That question directly affects M&A prospects.\n\nHow do buyers evaluate the role of social media engagement when they're thinking about buying a cosmetics company?\n\nSocial engagement is incredibly important, but it's only one part of the picture. Buyers are ultimately looking for a powerful identity. They ask: How differentiated is the brand voice? How defensible is it? Does it engender consumer loyalty and advocacy?\n\nYou then want to see that translate into the business itself — a financial profile that delivers consistent growth and demonstrates durability. What we see buyers really looking for in today's crowded market is longevity. You can build momentum quickly, but the question is whether that growth is sustainable over the long term.\n\nTell me a little bit about the Rhode deal. How did it come together?\n\nWe have a platform that's really designed to support companies through every stage of their lifecycle — from that early growth stage to the ultimate exit. The Rhode transaction is a reflection of that.\n\nWe were able to support the company earlier through our commercial banking capabilities and act as a thought partner. Being able to work with a client over time and ultimately help navigate a strategic transaction is what makes the job so exciting and dynamic.\n\nWhat drew you to the beauty sector in the first place?\n\nI grew up going with my mom to the department store counters and got my first skincare regimen when I was probably too young to say — a preteen. It's always been a personal interest of mine.\n\nEarly in my career, it became increasingly clear that there was a huge opportunity in beauty given the rapid pace of deal activity happening across the category. Emerging brands in particular are an incredibly important part of the beauty ecosystem. Those founders need partners and advisors to help them navigate growth and assess opportunities in a sector that moves very quickly.\n\nWhen I was a vice president, I saw an opportunity to form a sector specialty in beauty. My pitch to senior leadership was to invest early, and leverage our full platform to support these founders, leaders, and investors; be their thought partner; and earn their trust as they navigated those important strategic decisions, up to and including a potential sale process. Fortunately, this approach has proven successful.\n\nFor me, being able to work with companies over time and help them navigate those decisions is incredibly rewarding.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about workers who were laid off in a job market where résumé doesn't take them as far.",
    "fullText": "There's no sugarcoating last week's layoffs.\n\nAmazon is cutting 16,000 corporate jobs, pushing thousands of workers into a job market already crowded with tech talent. Business Insider was all over the news, with scoop after scoop, including internal messages revealing which teams and jobs were affected.\n\nThe layoffs followed the 14,000 job cuts Amazon announced back in October.\n\nUPS expects to eliminate 30,000 roles, on top of the 48,000 cuts it announced last year. Home Depot is laying off 800 corporate employees. Pinterest said it's cutting 15% of its staff.\n\nMy colleague Jacob Zinkula, who covers the economy, has spoken with dozens of laid-off workers over the past year, many from Big Tech companies, including Amazon.\n\nA clear theme has emerged. Many built careers years ago when opportunities felt endless. Now, even strong résumés and big-name employers don't guarantee a quick bounce-back.\n\nPart of the reason is simple math. US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nAnd the early impact of AI is starting to show up, too. Companies are finding ways to run leaner. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said AI can now let one employee do the work of entire teams — a shift that's shaping how companies think about hiring.\n\nStill, it's not all doom and gloom.\n\nJacob recently spoke with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old former Amazon employee in New Jersey, who was laid off in October. She explained how she landed a new job just two weeks later.\n\nHer advice for other laid-off tech workers:\n\n\"Looking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role,\" she said. \"It was still difficult, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.\"",

    "description": "Two Business Insider reporters attended Starbucks' Investor Day and got a firsthand look at how the brand plans to build momentum with its turnaround.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks' new \"Ristretto\" concept, as the company called it — named after the short-pulled espresso shot — aims to reduce average build costs by about 20% while optimizing overall footprint, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said.\n\nThe walk-thru mockup featured cushy furniture, digital menus, merch displays, and a callback to Starbucks' 1971 founding above the door.\n\nSmith forecast 600 to 650 new stores opening globally in the current fiscal year, rising to over 2,000 in fiscal year 2028. Roughly 400 of the new US coffeehouses coming by 2028 are expected to be company-owned.\n\nWalking through the coffeehouse setup, with Simple Plan's \"I'm Just a Kid\" playing on the speakers, it was hard not to think back to our teenage years when Starbucks was the hangout spot, which perhaps was the point.\n\nExecs stressed Starbucks' desire to become a \"third place.\"\n\n\"We have a unique opportunity to connect people over coffee during a time when loneliness is pervasive,\" Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said.\n\nThe furniture, including the \"Starbucks lounge icon,\" as the display next to the chair pictured above read, was designed to get people to sit and hang out for a while.\n\nNiccol said the company plans to add 25,000 additional seats to its US company-operated stores by the end of its fiscal year and replace thousands more with \"more comfortable options.\"\n\n\"Customers are already responding with longer dwell times and, frankly, improved customer satisfaction and connections,\" he added.\n\nStarbucks plans to introduce digital menu boards in all of its US company-operated stores over the next 18 months, separating its morning and afternoon menus to better target customer preferences.\n\n\"The morning is very much a ritual,\" Niccol said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. \"The afternoon is really a reset — and depending on where you are in that reset, you sometimes want a blended drink, you sometimes want an energy drink, you sometimes want a sparkling drink, and you sometimes want protein.\"\n\nStarbucks plans to expand its wellness offerings to meet that demand.\n\nStarbucks offered samples of global flavors like an ube macchiatto, a reformulated Chai latte with mango cold foam, and a strawberry açaí refresher, available three ways: decaffeinated, caffeinated, or with an energy boost.\n\nWe also sampled some bakery items, including a croissant-like uzu citrus blossom with a tasty uzu filling.\n\nStarbucks is rolling out new front and back-end technologies to make baristas' jobs easier — and help you get your order faster.\n\nThe company's mobile app has gotten a facelift, and a new loyalty program is rolling out in March. Its new point-of-sale system, also coming this year, aims to reduce staff training time and the time it takes to place an order.\n\nThe Mastrena III espresso machine, rolling out in 2027, halves the time it takes to brew espresso while maintaining the quality, Starbucks says.\n\nStarbucks also showed off Green Dot Assist, an AI-powered assistant that gives baristas recipes and other information about an order on a tablet to speed up production.\n\nThe Q&A session lasted nearly an hour, during which analysts pressed the executives for more specifics on their plan.\n\nDespite the optimism onstage, investors pressed executives on the company's long-term plan. Shares slid about 1% during the presentations, after a brief pop earlier in the week before earnings.\n\nThe execs responded to several questions about Starbucks' operating margins and its recent deal with Boyu Capital to sell off 60% of its China business. Investors also wanted more details on how Starbucks will navigate ongoing supply chain snarls and encourage employees to have an \"ownership mentality\" to grow with the brand.\n\nAbout five hours after it began, Rodriguez left investor day buzzing with caffeine and headed back to Business Insider's New York headquarters.\n\nOn the West Coast, Business Insider's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert — equally caffeinated after a 3 a.m. wake-up — was already on the phone with analysts. Their verdict: Starbucks has gone on offense, laying out growth plans that are credible, if not exactly blockbuster.\n\nTogether, the two reporters walked away with a sharper view of where Starbucks' strategy is headed next.\n\nThe company hopes it can reignite momentum by making its cafés more inviting and pushing harder on menu innovation. There's still work to do — but Starbucks believes its comeback is no longer theoretical.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Starbucks?

    "fullText": "App endured a major outage and user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitor\n\nA little more than one week ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.\n\nThe day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.\n\nSimultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedian Meg Stalter – accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, tweeted that TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.\n\nAfter days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued a statement blaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.\n\nOracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.\n\nThe most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.\n\nThe late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolled press release now claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.\n\nTikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.\n\nTikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.",

Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe thank Ying Bai, Yiming Cao, Yunchien Chang, Chiman Cheung, Ruben Durante, Ray Fisman, Edward Glaeser, Guojun He, Andrew Kao, Muhammad Yasir Khan, Jonathan Klick, James Kung, Bingjing Li, Vincent Pons, Jesse Shapiro, Uta Schoenberg, Michael Song, Yongxiang Wang, Jaya Wen, Yanhui Wu, David Y.

    "fullText": "After covering the Grammy Awards for nearly two decades, there are a few moments I know will happen on music's biggest night: Someone will go home happy, and someone will go home sad.\n\nEither way, we'll get Trevor Noah as the host for his sixth and final time, performances you'll text about, and candid moments between our favorite singers seated inside LA's Crypto.com Arena on Sunday. It'll all air on CBS.\n\nKendrick Lamar leads with nine nominations, including in the major categories such as Record, Album, and Song of the Year, followed by Lady Gaga and producers Cirkut and Jack Antonoff with seven. We'll also be watching Super Bowl performer Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter, and my personal favorite, Leon Thomas, to see if they go home with trophies after nabbing six nods.\n\nI asked Business Insider's entertainment team who they thought would go home with a small, 24K gold-plated gramophone. Here's what they're betting on:\n\nJason Guerrasio, Entertainment correspondent: Tucked away in the midst of the 90-plus Grammy categories is Best Album Cover. I hope it goes to Perfume Genius' \"Glory\" cover. Google it. It's instantly eye-catching.\n\nSamantha Rollins, deputy editor of Entertainment: When \"Mayhem\" single \"Abracadabra\" debuted during a commercial break at last year's Grammys, many posited that Lady Gaga's newest album would take a back-to-basics approach to the edgy electropop that made her famous. What emerged instead was far more interesting. Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" is an invigorating return to form that proves one of pop's most famous shape-shifters can still keep us guessing. She'll take it for Album of the Year.\n\nCallie Ahlgrim, senior pop culture writer: Record of the Year is supposed to honor the most superb blend of production and performance, but since it tends to favor ubiquity, I have to give the edge to the global pop smash \"APT.\" Bruno Mars has the cross-generational appeal that Grammy voters can't resist, and Rosé would make history as the first K-pop star to win in a competitive category.",

    "title": "For Western forces in the Arctic, the cold itself is one of their toughest enemies",
    "description": "Business Insider visited NATO soldiers training above the Arctic Circle. They said they put newspaper in their boots to keep them dry.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Deep snow. Fleeting daylight. Wet clothes. Frozen weapons. Sub-zero temperatures.\n\nNATO soldiers training in Arctic warfare are learning that in a future conflict, fighting the enemy may be only half the battle. The other would be surviving the region's harsh winters.\n\n\"The environment can be hard for someone who is not used to it,\" said Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, bundled up and dressed in camouflage to blend in with the snow.\n\nLähdekorpi is among roughly 20 NATO soldiers participating in an Arctic warfare training and cold-weather survival course led by the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which specializes in winter combat.\n\nThe monthlong course is conducted far above the Arctic Circle, in Finland's snow-covered Lapland region, where soldiers see just a few hours of sunlight each day and experience temperatures that regularly drop well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWith growing Russian and Chinese activity across the Arctic, NATO officials are stressing the need for greater readiness in the region. The training course helps Western soldiers sharpen their ability to fight on frozen battlefields, where the military alliance could find itself at war next amid rising competition.\n\n\"The Arctic, overall, is changing,\" Canadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, another soldier participating in the course, told Business Insider during a visit to Lapland this week. \"So we need to know much more expertise to be able to face these changes.\"\n\nThe first of the Arctic warfare training course's three phases focuses on how to move and survive in winter conditions, teaching soldiers skills such as drying wet clothes, crossing the forest on skis, and preventing their weapons from freezing.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Jaeger Brigade who oversees the course, said some of the biggest challenges soldiers face in this environment are maintaining combat readiness in extreme temperatures (below -14 degrees Fahrenheit) and moving around in the deep, soft snow that blankets Lapland this time of year.\n\nCold temperatures can make it hard to keep equipment functioning properly and strain soldiers' physical and mental well-being. After a long day of exertion, even simple tasks like eating and drinking, which are critical in these conditions to replenish calories and stay hydrated, may feel daunting.\n\nThe unforgiving Arctic environment can be as dangerous as the enemy, especially for soldiers who aren't trained for such conditions, Aikio told Business Insider, warning that unfamiliar terrain and extreme cold can have a huge impact. Even well-trained units aren't immune, he added. In severe cold, the environment still takes a heavy toll.\n\nLähdekorpi, the Finn, said the cold weather could distract soldiers in combat, leaving them more focused on getting warm than on fighting the enemy.\n\nThe persistent deep snow in the winter creates significant mobility challenges for soldiers. In the course, they learn to traverse the forest on skis and snowmobiles, even using these tools to conduct an assault against a simulated enemy force during the second phase of the training.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian, said survival in the Arctic is directly linked to movement. Mobility is far slower and more physically demanding than in other places, he said. Snow is constant and effectively part of the enemy.\n\nThat slower pace isn't a drawback. Sweating in extreme cold can be dangerous, as moisture can freeze, so soldiers are trained to move deliberately, take frequent breaks, and wear layers they can remove as conditions change.\n\nWhen soldiers start moving, they should be a little cold, Aikio said. After roughly 15 minutes on skis, units typically stop to shed layers.\n\nKeeping clothes and gear dry is another challenge soldiers face in the Arctic. Getting wet — a frequent occurrence in this region with all the snow and hidden sources of water — forces them to expend more energy to warm up.\n\nSoldiers wear fishnet fabric and wool as their layers and carry extra clothing in their backpacks. They dry clothing by hanging it on makeshift wooden tripods or placing it near the fire or in warm tents.\n\nFor wet boots, which Lähdekorpi said are the hardest to dry, soldiers crumple up newspaper and shove it inside to absorb moisture.\n\nWhile the harsh environment poses a different threat to soldiers than enemy artillery fire, it's still treacherous because cold-weather casualties before the fight even starts can put one side at a significant disadvantage, Lemelin said.\n\nConsidering the substantial challenges of operating in the Arctic, soldiers and course leadership view the training as a critical means of preparing them for the frozen battlefields NATO forces could one day face. The cold is an obstacle, but not an insurmountable wall; the aim is to learn to adapt and ultimately thrive in these brutal conditions.\n\n\"Embrace the cold,\" Lemelin said, \"and then warm up when there's the opportunity.\"",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "description": "Job seekers can stand out by contacting employers before roles are posted, a veteran career coach told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The best way to beat the line for a job is to show up before there is one.\n\nTalking with an employer before the company ever posts a job — not after — could help you land a role there, veteran career coach Laura Labovich told Business Insider.\n\nShe recommends that job seekers identify where they want to work, examine their network for any ties to the organization, and start building relationships inside well before a job post even goes up.\n\n\"The way to win is to not apply. Get in before they have the opening. Make connections. Become an insider,\" Labovich said.\n\nIf you wait until you see a job post before contacting an employer, she said, you might already be too late. That's because once a role is posted, recruiters or HR will often feel compelled to tell you to apply online — even if they already know you — in order to ensure all candidates get equal consideration, Labovich said.\n\nGetting in line with everybody else can make the process seem \"more like a cattle call,\" she said.\n\nAside from generally feeling lousy, the take-a-number approach is also rarely the best path to landing a role, as almost anyone seeking a desk job can attest.\n\nThe average corporate job posting draws 250 applicants, Glassdoor reported in 2025. Among those, only four to six candidates typically advance to the interview round. And, of course, only one person ultimately gets the offer letter.\n\nHaving someone who can show your résumé to a recruiter or hiring manager and help you stand out is \"worth its weight in gold\" when there are so many people looking for jobs, said Rick Wargo, managing partner of the global technology practice at the recruitment firm Boyden.\n\n\"A warm introduction is always the best way to go about a job search,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nOf course, if you don't know about a forthcoming job, you can't make a pitch for it. Yet that doesn't mean you're powerless. What you can do is consider whether the employer has hired for the kinds of roles you might want — and use that insight to guide early outreach.\n\nThat's why, Wargo said, it's smart to start networking and making connections inside key companies long before you need a job.\n\n\"You don't go to fix the roof when it's raining,\" he said.\n\nTo beat the rush that often occurs when an employer lists an opening, you can contact people who might be at your level within an organization and ask questions such as, \"How do you like your job?\" \"How do you like the organization?\" and \"How did you get to where you did?\" said Labovich, who runs Career Strategy Group, an outplacement firm in the Washington, DC, area.\n\nIf it's someone higher up the food chain — potentially someone who might be the hiring manager for a future job — the ask should be smaller, she said.\n\n\"You don't want to say, 'I want a job,' because if you're getting to them early, there's no job yet,\" Labovich said. Instead, she recommends that job seekers seek advice, insight, recommendations, and referrals.\n\nThat contact can pay off: Messaging a hiring manager nearly triples your chance of getting hired, LinkedIn reports.\n\nUltimately, Labovich said, making connections inside an organization is one of the best ways to navigate a hiring process that often feels \"totally broken.\"\n\nThat's left many job seekers applying to as many roles as they can, even though many career coaches, including Labovich, urge that people prioritize networking instead.\n\n\"The way to apply for a job these days is to not apply for a job,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "A small business owner near Minneapolis said both staff and customers fear ICE activity in the area.\n\nHe's concerned about the safety of his employees, who sometimes miss shifts to avoid immigration officers.\n\nNational activists are encouraging another economic blackout to protest ICE activity.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee affected by ICE in your area? Reach out to this reporter at allisonkelly@businessinsider.com or via Signal at alliekelly.10. Here's our guide to sharing information securely.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "description": "Chinos walk the fine line between formal and casual, making them ideal for the office. Here are our top-tested pairs for business casual men's styling.",
    "fullText": "Suits are an easy choice when the dress code calls for formal attire, but they can be overkill in business-casual settings. You need wardrobe staples that'll cover your bases for when the stakes aren't quite as high, and that's where the best chinos for men come in.\n\nInvesting in the best business casual work clothes for men will inevitably include a reliable pair of chinos, so we've listed the top pairs, including those we've tested ourselves, to help you find what are sure to be your next favorite pants to live in. A tried-and-true favorite is the Bonobos Chinos 2.0, and for a more affordable option, we recommend the Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino.\n\nBonobos' trued and true chinos have a luxe feel that adds instant polish to your wardrobe.\n\nThe lightweight performance fabric has the subtle texture of a wool dress pant, but feels like your favorite yoga pant. Designed to look clean on the leg in a fit that tapers at the hem and sits neatly on the shoe.\n\nThis pair is made-to-measure and can be customized with interchangeable pockets, pleats, and button details.\n\nThe Bonobos Chinos 2.0 are highly regarded as among the best chinos for men for their super-luxe feel. The Italian milled cotton is soft and retains a vibrant hue, even after several rounds through the washing machine. A major perk is the option to choose from a wide range of colors, shapes and sizes. These range from 28 to 46 for waist, and from 28 to 36 for inseam lengths. You can choose between a tailored, slim, slim tapered, or athletic fit. Then, you can take your pick of 16 colors. These are more polished-looking chinos with crisp lines, but are worth having for a variety of occasions between business-casual and formal events.\n\nThe Quince direct-to-consumer business model makes their prices competitive, despite the quality of its apparel exceeding our expectations for basic wardrobe essentials. The Quince Ultra-Stretch 24/7 Smart Chino's value will become apparent the more you wear them, with a four-way stretch twill that provides the same flexibility as you'd expect from joggers. Plus, they're wrinkle-resistant, so you can pull them out as needed. Chinos that are this deceptively comfortable mean you can get the most use out of them anywhere along the spectrum of casual to semi-formal. \n\nRead our full Quince review.\n\nAs you may be able to guess from the brand's name, Indochino makes some of the best chinos for men. A fitting expert from one of their many showrooms can tell you your precise size in the Houndslow chinos, but if you can't make it to a storefront, their site has an in-depth tutorial on home measuring. Once you've found your perfect fit, you can further personalize them with custom pleats, hems, pockets, buttons, and belt loops. At $99, the Houndslows are also a great value for the high-quality, perfectly sized chinos you're guaranteed by going through their detailed fit screening. \n\nRead our full Indochino chinos review.\n\nPublic Rec is known for making menswear that's polished enough for the office, but comfortable enough for everyday life, and the Dealmaker Chinos do exactly that.\n\nSimilar to the wildly popular Gamechanger Rec Pant, the Dealmaker Chinos are incredibly stretchy, wrinkle-resistant, and thanks to its The Workday 2.0 Fabric, they're also wind- and water-resistant for all-season wear.\n\nThe Public Rec Dealmaker Chinos have a classic dressy look about them, yet can move with you in all directions of daily life.\n\nWoodies Clothing took off with their high-tech dress shirts, but their super comfortable chinos have thrived in the men's workwear space, too. They can be personalized with different combinations of custom pleats, pockets, and hems. The Woodies Premium Performance Stretch Pants are amid the best chinos for people unwilling to return to stiff slacks after living in work-from-home attire. What feels almost like joggers are really formal-presenting pants that are easy to style through every season. Their soft, two-way stretch, quick drying fabric is remarkably stain repellent — just the right chinos for the accident prone.\n\nRead our full Woodies performance chinos and dress shirt review.\n\nFor many men who shop big and tall sizes, finding comfortable formal wear can pose a serious challenge. But dressing up with an athletic build doesn't have to mean feeling squeezed into a suit all day — Dockers' Ultimate Chinos will assure you that. These come in extended waist sizes with extra room in the seat and thighs so as to not constrict you, even when you're sitting for long periods of time. The four-way Smart 360 Flex™ material allows for more mobility, and the extended inseam lengths position the knee correctly before tapering off towards the hem.\n\nAs one of the undeniable symbols of Americana, Polo Ralph Lauren offers the best men's chinos, high-quality and ultimately timeless. The heritage brand offers its Stretch Slim Fit Chinos in a trim silhouette that sits low on the waist. Despite being slim from top to bottom, the cotton and elastane blend makes them soft and lightweight instead of too compressed, the way other slim fits can feel. A bonus of the slim fit is how well they factor into a high-low outfit — sleek dressy pants paired with an oversized sweater is a simple way to create a balanced contrast.\n\nMany designs from Alex Mill are uniform and minimalistic, with nuances only shown in the details. Their unisex cropped chinos are standard at first glance, but their prominent pleats, neatly cropped hems, and \"X\" belt loops give them a subtle edge on the average pair of dress pants. These have a relaxed fit that allows for slight stretching, and each pair comes in unique color variations according to their natural dye process.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "title": "Here's what a potential SpaceX mega-merger could mean for Elon Musk's business empire",
    "description": "SpaceX is gearing up for a massive IPO this year, and multiple reports suggested the rocket giant is considering mergers with Tesla or xAI.",
    "fullText": "The \"Muskonomy\" might be about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for a potential $1.5 trillion IPO this year, and multiple reports on Thursday night suggested the rocket company is considering blockbuster mergers with Tesla, Elon Musk's carmaker, or his AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe three companies have already been moving closer together in recent months. Tesla said on Wednesday that it had invested $2 billion in xAI, after SpaceX reportedly made a similar investment last year.\n\nThe electric carmaker also told investors it would evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with xAI, following its addition of the startup's Grok chatbot to its vehicles last July.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Musk has combined parts of his sprawling business empire. Last March, he announced that xAI had purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMerging xAI with one of Tesla or SpaceX would mark a dramatic escalation of the so-called \"Muskonomy,\" however. Here's what it could mean for the future of Elon Musk's business empire.\n\nAt first glance, bringing social media site X, the controversial chatbot Grok, and the reusable rocket Starship under one roof seems like a strange mix. But merging SpaceX and xAI does fit with Musk's long-term vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nThe world's richest man has suggested that the logical conclusion of the AI infrastructure boom is to build data centres in the freezing vacuum of space, where they can access plentiful solar power and operate without the huge amounts of water needed to cool them on Earth.\n\nSpeaking at Davos last week, Musk suggested that space will become the \"lowest cost\" place to train AI, and said that SpaceX will launch solar-powered AI satellites in the next few years that will ultimately scale up to \"hundreds of terawatts\" of energy consumption a year.\n\nMusk has also said that SpaceX's Starship rocket and growing network of Starlink satellites could form the basis of a massive network of orbital AI compute.\n\nAccess to this infrastructure could give xAI an advantage over rivals OpenAI and Google, who are scrambling for computing power and exploring space-based data centers themselves as they look to build ever more powerful AI models.\n\nAnother consideration is funding. Training AI is notoriously expensive, with xAI reportedly burning through billions of dollars in cash and regularly taking on new funding. SpaceX, meanwhile, has seen revenue grow in recent years and is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion.\n\nMerging SpaceX with Tesla, which has been a public company since 2010, would be more complicated — and the payoff less obvious.\n\nThe two companies already enjoy close links, having shared board members and executives in the past. And, in 2018, Musk used SpaceX for some out-of-this-world marketing by blasting his Tesla Roadster into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nTheir current businesses, however, have less obvious areas of overlap.\n\nTesla is shifting from a carmaker to an AI and robotics company, with Musk saying on Wednesday that Tesla would scrap the Model X and S and use their production lines to build its Optimus robot.\n\nThe company also has a thriving energy storage business, and at Davos last week, Musk said that both Tesla and SpaceX were separately working to build up to \"a hundred gigawatts a year\" of solar power in the US.\n\nCombining the two could be a step toward Musk's more grandiose dreams of massively expanding humanity's energy production.\n\nMusk also reiterated on Wednesday that he believes Tesla needs to build a \"terafab\" to build advanced AI chips, and in an X post in November suggested that Tesla's terafab could produce chips for SpaceX's solar-powered AI satellites.\n\nOne throughline that connects all of Musk's enterprises is his obsession with settling Mars, which the billionaire has described as critical to humanity's long-term survival.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up to use Starship to launch uncrewed missions to Mars in the coming years, and the billionaire has previously said that these missions would carry Tesla's Optimus to the red planet.\n\nOne thing that's clear is that combining his various companies has been on Musk's mind for a while. Way back in 2020, he responded to a Twitter post suggesting he merge SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company.",

    "description": "Reactions are already pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders about President Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.\"\n\nKrugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had \"argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.\"\n\n\"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick has not ruled out Manchester United adding to their squad before Monday's transfer deadline.\n\nFormer United head coach Ruben Amorim said last month he expected to bring someone in during the window.\n\nHowever, the club's refusal to divert the £65m they had been willing to spend on long-term target Antoine Semenyo – who opted to join Manchester City from Bournemouth – was a source of frustration for the Portuguese.\n\nUnited have been linked with a number of central midfield players, including former Wolves skipper Ruben Neves who now plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Hilal.\n\nAfter Carrick confirmed left-sided utility man Patrick Dorgu would be out for \"a number of weeks\" through injury, there have been suggestions the club might look to cover the Denmark international's absence.\n\nInterim head coach Carrick was coy when asked specifically about the club's position as he spoke in a news conference to preview Sunday's Premier League encounter with Fulham.\n\nBut he did leave the door open for business being done.\n\n\"Never say never,\" Carrick said. \"A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.\n\n\"Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.\"\n\nJoshua Zirkzee remains at the centre of interest as it remains to be seen if he returns to Italy, with Juventus considering whether to make a move for the former Bologna forward who cost United £36.5m 18 months ago.\n\nZirkzee has recovered from a minor injury and is available for the Fulham game.\n\n\"Josh has just been trying to work to get fit,\" said Carrick. \"It was great to have him training with the group the first time and I am just looking forward to working with him.\"\n\nCarrick accepts the issue of Bruno Fernandes' future is \"on the agenda a little bit\", with the United captain due to assess his plans at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, Carrick said that situation would be dealt with \"further down the line\".",

    "description": "An X post about rejecting a candidate over their \"olive oil\" interest went viral. Four recruiters shared their reactions with Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Some people like reading or long walks. Others like olive oil.\n\nBut would you list olive oil as an interest on your résumé? That's the latest internet debate after a post about the interests section on résumés went viral on X.\n\nThe person, who said they were reviewing résumés for a banking role, wrote that applicants needed to be \"normal\" and \"well adjusted.\"\n\n\"I reviewed a resume that listed 'olive oil' as an interest. That is not an interest,\" they wrote. \"It's been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\"\n\nThe identity of the X user, @90daysliquidity, isn't clear, but they list \"Tech Analyst\" in their bio. They did not respond to a direct message from Business Insider.\n\nCannot stress how much of an advantage it is to be a normal, well adjusted, applicant for banking roles. \n\nI reviewed a resume that listed “olive oil” as an interest. That is not an interest. It’s been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\n\nThe post caused a stir online. Memes abound, both celebrating and scoffing at the supposed olive oil-enjoyer.\n\nAn employee at Elon Musk's xAI commented that they would hire a \"cracked finance professional\" who is interested in olive oil.\n\n\"If you have olive oil as an interest on your resume, we want to talk to you,\" the official Coinbase account posted.\n\nIs it really so bad to list \"olive oil\" — or any offbeat hobby — on your résumé? Business Insider asked five recruiters what they thought.\n\nPaula Mathias Fryer would want to see just one more word added.\n\nThe SLO Partners senior director from California has been a technical recruiter for 15 years. She would have preferred olive oil \"taster\" or \"grower,\" she told Business Insider.\n\n\"It would have explained it a bit more,\" she said. \"Just those two words is a bit odd.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a New York-based director at Selby Jennings who leads investment banking recruitment, also wants more information. Are they just eating olive oil all day long?\n\n\"Do you make your own olive oil?\" Sterling said. \"If someone made their own olive oil, I would find that really interesting, and I might want to speak to them.\"\n\nSterling is a fan of chocolate, but doesn't plan on putting it on her résumé anytime soon.\n\nHobbies offer a common interest between the applicant and the hirer, Sterling said. She listed some popular ones in investment banking: football, basketball, travel, and World War II history.\n\nIt poses a question: what makes a good résumé hobby?\n\nThe off-limits topics are more obvious: politics, religion, anything you wouldn't talk about at the dinner table. Picking the best hobby, on the other hand, depends on the recruiter.\n\nMargaret Buj, a London-based principal recruiter at Mixmax, wants candidates to be interesting. Olive oil was \"weird\" to her — but better than the answers that are \"cliché and vague.\"\n\n\"Traveling, socializing, reading,\" Buj said. \"Who cares? We all do that.\"\n\nSpace on a one-page résumé is a precious resource. Hobbies don't display relevant work experience, and they don't directly show what your contribution to the team would be. Is it even worth listing them?\n\nMathias-Fryer used to vote no. She saw hobbies as \"less professional,\" an unnecessary waste of space. Then came AI, which has upended recruitment and filled hiring managers' inboxes with identical, ChatGPT-generated CVs.\n\nApplicants now need to do \"whatever they can do to stand out,\" she said. \"If that's a hobby, so be it.\"\n\nMatt Stevenson disagrees. The New York-based managing director of executive search agency 33eleven loves to see a quirky hobby. It's another thing to connect about, he said. But, on the candidate side, Stevenson thought that hobbies were too risky.\n\n\"You don't know who is going to be reviewing that résumé, what their hobbies are, and what their personality is like,\" he said.\n\nAs for that X user, endlessly thinking about the olive oil-loving applicant?\n\n\"I would pick up the phone and call the guy,\" he said. \"Scratch that itch.\"",

    "description": "Dan Priest, PwC's chief AI officer, told Business Insider that companies should focus on quality not quantity when it comes to AI agents.",
    "fullText": "The AI race can sometimes feel like a numbers game.\n\nEarlier this month, Bob Sternfels, the CEO of McKinsey & Company, made a surprising announcement. The firm, he said, had a workforce of over 60,000 people — 40,000 human employees and 25,000 AI agents.\n\nFor Sternfels, it was an example of McKinsey's all-in approach to AI. Others in the industry, however, say the eye-popping number actually says little about the company's successful adoption of artificial intelligence.\n\nDan Priest, the chief AI officer at PwC, told Business Insider that evaluating a firm's AI use by the number of agents it has is not the best metric.\n\n\"There was this emerging bragging right around the number of agents I had or I have in production,\" he said. \"I think that's probably the wrong measure.\"\n\nThe value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nHe said one way to do that is to look at the number of agents that are authorities on a given task, which will encourage humans to use them, Priest said. The other is to evaluate the number of humans using those agents to execute tasks to achieve a prioritized outcome for a company. An example could be a better customer experience by transforming a call center.\n\nOver the past two years, agents have come to dominate how companies talk about AI adoption. Priest said that focus on agents is the right approach. \"Agents are at a place now where they're the best way to unlock value from AI,\" he said.\n\nHumans still drive the workforce, however, and a better way to measure an agent's value is by how effectively people use them — not just by how much work the agents have the potential to automate.\n\nAt PwC, about 82% of its employees were actively using the firm's AI tools. Priest said that AI agents are embedded across teams at PwC, and the firm tracks how agents interact, how accurately they complete tasks, whether they are making processes faster, higher quality, or higher performing. Humans have a role in reviewing agents' output and providing feedback.\n\n\"The human is still accountable,\" he said. \"The humans are the ones who get certified. The humans are the ones who get licensed. The humans are the ones who get empowered.\"\n\nPriest said that PwC and its clients first took a bottom-up approach to AI adoption. Many business leaders, he said, tried to \"crowdsource\" approaches to adoption from employees because they themselves didn't have the answers.\n\nThat led to a \"fairly disappointing\" return on investment, he said.\n\nPriest said a shift to a \"top-down\" approach has been more effective, allowing them to focus on fewer agents with a deeper mastery of a smaller set of tasks.\n\n\"That agent, I've given them permission to access certain data sets,\" he said. \"I've given them permission to perform certain tasks. I've given them permission to produce certain outcomes. Those permissions are monitored, they expire, they're managed.\"",

    "description": "Michael Knox runs a restaurant near Minneapolis. He said employees are afraid to come in, and even his regular customers have been absent.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "title": "Major private student-loan companies are 'excited' about Trump's repayment overhaul",
    "description": "Leaders at Navient and Sallie Mae said that Trump's sweeping student-loan repayment changes will be a boon to their private lending business.",
    "fullText": "Private student-loan companies are gearing up for a big year ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is preparing to roll out its sweeping student-loan repayment changes beginning in July. Those changes include new repayment plans and caps on federal borrowing for advanced degrees.\n\nSome companies see those changes as an opportunity for the private lending industry. During an earnings call last week, Jonathan Witter, the CEO of lender Sallie Mae, said that the company is \"excited about the opportunity created by the recent federal student lending reforms.\"\n\n\"These changes should reduce the likelihood of students and families taking on unsustainable levels of student debt,\" Witter said. \"These reforms also create the opportunity for us to help more students and families.\"\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminates the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. The legislation also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professionals, such as those in medical or law school.\n\nWitter said the company expects those changes to bring in an estimated $5 billion in annual loan originations. Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed similar sentiment during the company's earnings call this month. He said that the changes to Grad PLUS are an \"opportunity\" for the company to expand, saying that \"there's a lot of room for growth\" this year.\n\nPrivate lenders have been anticipating these repayment changes for months. Yowan said during an August 2025 earnings call that eliminating the Grad PLUS program is \"a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\" SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto said at the time that the repayment changes could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\"\n\nWhile private lenders anticipate boosts to their businesses from Trump's repayment overhaul, some critics and borrowers are concerned. Borrowers could choose to forgo their programs entirely due to more limited federal financing, and if they turn to private lenders, they would lose out on federal debt relief and forgiveness.\n\nSara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, previously told Business Insider that private student loans could also have higher interest rates than federal loans, leaving borrowers with more unaffordable debt.\n\n\"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,\" Partridge said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration said the reforms are intended to curb excessive borrowing and increase accountability in the federal system.\n\n\"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a January statement.",

    "title": "Snowmobiles, skis, and laser tag: How NATO soldiers train for Arctic assaults",
    "description": "Business Insider traveled north of the Arctic Circle to watch Finland's Jaeger Brigade train NATO forces on winter warfare and cold-weather survival.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Two soldiers moved cautiously through the snow-covered forest, their camouflage blending into the trees as their skis glided silently over the ground.\n\nSpotting an unaware enemy, they knelt and lined up a shot. Rifle fire erupted through the woods, the metallic smell of spent casings hanging in the cold air.\n\nA firefight kicked off, and a battle was underway.\n\nThe encounter took place during a recent winter combat exercise involving roughly 20 NATO troops, beginning with an assault on skis and snowmobiles before shifting into a simulated firefight using blanks and lasers instead of live ammo. The drill was part of a monthlong course led by Finland's Jaeger Brigade that trains allied forces in Arctic warfare and cold-weather survival.\n\nBusiness Insider observed the battle's start at a training site 75 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Finland's snow-blanketed Lapland region. It pitted a small platoon of NATO soldiers against an \"enemy\" force that was three times larger and composed of conscripts from the Jaeger Brigade.\n\nAs the strategic Arctic region becomes increasingly important to both NATO and its adversaries, exercises like this are designed to sharpen allied troops' abilities to fight on frozen battlefields. The environment is harsh and unforgiving, with sub-zero temperatures routine. And while fighting is simulated, it reflects real-world threats.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic section leader overseeing the course, told Business Insider that using lasers makes the training feel more realistic. \"At least there is some kind of fear of getting hit,\" he said.\n\nArctic security has become a focal point for NATO in recent years as Russia and China grow more active in the region, seeking to project power, establish new trade routes, and expand their access to natural resources.\n\nNATO leadership, concerned by certain Russian and Chinese behavior, has stressed the need for greater investment in collective Arctic defense to prevent Moscow and Beijing from gaining more military and economic influence in this strategic area.\n\nFinland — roughly a third of which sits above the Arctic Circle and has a long history of cold-weather combat — is well positioned to train Western forces in Arctic warfare and has led annual courses for more than a decade. That training has taken on new urgency for NATO.\n\nThe training Business Insider observed this week is ongoing, with participants hailing from Finland, the US, the UK, France, Italy, and Canada. The idea is that they can take what they learn in Lapland and use it to instruct or advise their units back home.\n\nThe course is divided into three phases over four weeks, starting with cold-weather survival and winter movement training, then teaching maneuvers such as attacking on skis and building snow foxholes, and ending with low-mountain activity above the tree line.\n\nThe second phase includes the combat exercise Business Insider had the opportunity to observe. The NATO platoon, known as the Blue force, began by crossing several kilometers of forest on snowmobiles before dismounting and skiing to the top of a small hill. Their objective was to effectively assault and capture territory defended by the Red force, the Finnish conscripts.\n\nManeuver in these environments used to be limited to skis, still a crucial tool for soldiers needing to traverse deep snow that otherwise would make ground assaults impossible. Modern snowmobiles lighten the load, allowing soldiers to travel farther faster with less overall effort, preserving energy for the fight.\n\n\"You can't get anywhere,\" said Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade major, said of the snow's effect on traditional assault elements. The Arctic demands some unique warfighting skills that aren't really used anywhere else.\n\nLearning to ski in these conditions can be challenging for soldiers, especially if they have no prior experience. They're also weighed down by cumbersome gear, such as packs, helmets, vests, and guns, making it more difficult.\n\n\"It's hard to move with the skis,\" said Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, one of the soldiers in the winter warfare course. She told Business Insider that recreational downhill skiing has helped her to improve balance.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, another soldier in the course, said he grew up skiing; however, the ones he's been using in Finland — long and designed to act as snowshoes — are very different from what he's used to.\n\n\"The fact that the skis are this long requires some adaptation, but it does give an advantage to already have the skills,\" Lemelin said.\n\n\"In this operating condition, even a good skier, at some point, especially at night, will start struggling because you're getting tired,\" he said. \"When you get tired, you're also less confident.\"\n\nThe assault began as daylight faded away. The Blue force used drones to collect targeting data, which it relayed to a nearby control van that then simulated artillery strikes against the Red force. Then the NATO troops advanced toward the Finns.\n\nSoldiers carried rifles loaded with blanks and equipped with transmitters that fire laser tracks when they pull the triggers. They wore vests and helmet straps able to detect any incoming laser signals.\n\nIf a shot found its mark, the vest on the opposing soldier announced to them that they had been \"killed\" or \"wounded,\" depending on where on the body they got hit by the laser. Then they took off their helmets to signal that they were out.\n\nThough the system resembles laser tag, troops take it seriously. It reflects the consequences of armed conflict, forcing soldiers to respond to simulated injuries and sudden losses, much like they would in real combat.\n\n\"If we fight without this, everyone can just walk straight into the woods,\" Lähdekorpi said. There'd be no way to tell if someone was hit or killed. This tech pushes soldiers to hide, move discreetly, and communicate more effectively.\n\nThe laser system isn't a perfect match for combat, Aikio acknowledged. \"If you have snow, or branches, or anything that's blocking the laser, it will not work. And that's not realistic, but it's much better than nothing.\"\n\nFor some NATO soldiers who come to these training exercises, it might be the first time they've operated in the harsh Arctic environment. Rising tensions between the West and Russia have fueled concerns that a future war between the two could unfold across frozen battlefields, making it critical that troops from Italy to the US are prepared for that possibility. A fight against China, another Arctic rival, could likewise involve Arctic activity.\n\nFinland shares an 800-mile-long border with Russia, is one of NATO's front-line countries, and has long been training for the possibility of renewed conflict in the Arctic, even before it joined the alliance in 2023. The Finns have fought the Russians before. It's been decades since the last round of hostilities, though.\n\n\"Now we are in NATO,\" Aikio said. \"We want to support our allies so that they can also fight and work here in our conditions — in our terrain.\"",

    "description": "Uber is teaming up with Waabi, an autonomous trucking outfit led by an Uber alum, to deploy robotaxis. Business Insider spoke with Waabi COO Lior Ron.",
    "fullText": "Uber has a new plan to get 25,000 robotaxis on the road — and it will come with the aid of some Uber alums and an autonomous trucking company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ride-hailing giant announced a partnership with Waabi, a Canadian self-driving trucking startup founded by Raquel Urtasun. The partnership will include a $250 million investment from Uber, dependent on a set of milestones Waabi will have to achieve. The companies did not disclose what those were.\n\nThere are a few familiar faces here. Urtasun was the chief scientist at Uber's self-driving car division, Advanced Technologies Group. That division was sold in 2020 to Aurora Innovation, another autonomous trucking company and Waabi's competitor.\n\nWaabi's chief operating officer, Lior Ron, is also an Uber alum who founded and led the ride-hailing company's trucking business, Uber Freight.\n\n\"Uber has always been great in building marketplaces, in matching supply and demand, and in pricing,\" Ron told Business Insider. \"That's what created Uber, that what's created Uber Eats, and that's what I created with Uber Freight.\"\n\nAlphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox are already on the ground providing unsupervised rides. Even in its core business, that is, autonomous trucking, Waabi has yet to deploy a fully driverless truck without safety drivers on commercial routes.\n\nThe startup didn't disclose a timeline or announce a partnership with an automaker that can deliver that many cars.\n\nHowever, Ron dismissed the first-mover advantage narrative.\n\n\"I think it's really about: Can the system scale? Can the system be mass-deployed?\" he said. \"It's not about getting the first driver out of the car or truck. It's not about the first lane. It's not about the first neighborhood.\"\n\nTrucking and ride-hailing are two different beasts. One has set routes and long stretches of highway driving; the other sees dense neighborhoods and unpredictable pedestrians.\n\nRon told Business Insider that Waabi has been building a generalizable AI \"brain\" that can be transferred to different vehicle platforms since \"day one.\"\n\n\"Nothing needs to be rebuilt,\" Ron said.\n\nIn addition, Ron said Waabi has built a sophisticated simulator that allows the AI driver to learn from an infinite number of scenarios that can’t easily be replicated in the real world.\n\nThe simulation allows for \"mixed reality testing\": An AI driver steering a truck or car is deployed on a closed course but responds to simulated events like a traffic jam or a lane-changing car that isn't really there.\n\nVideo from Waabi shows how a truck driving on a closed-course environment can slow down, reacting to a virtual traffic jam.\n\n\"Now we can test anything you can imagine — every permutation of traffic jam under the sun, every millions of different scenarios of construction zone,\" Ron said. \"A motorbike cutting you off — you can never do that because you'll be endangering the tester.\"",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Tesla plans to more than double capital spending to a record high of more than $20 billion this year - but little of it will go to its traditional business ​of selling electric vehicles to human drivers.\n\nThe company, which last year lost its global EV sales crown to China's BYD, ‌is instead shifting investment to yet-unproven business lines such as fully autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, based on executive comments on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nHighlighting the change, CEO Elon ‌Musk said Tesla would end production of its Model X SUV and Model S sedans and instead use the space in its California factory to make its Optimus robots.\n\nSeparately in a post on his social media site X, Musk said the robots will be built in Tesla's Texas Gigafactory at an even higher volume. \"This is going to be a very big capex year,\" he said. \"We're making big investments for an epic future.\"\n\nMost ⁠of the record investment will be spent on ‌production lines for the Cybercab, a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel and pedals, the long-promised Tesla semi-truck, Optimus robots and plants for battery and lithium production, Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said.\n\nTesla is still ‍reliant on human-driven EVs for most of its sales, but its valuation far exceeds any other automaker, putting it \n\nIt joins Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet in planning sharp increases in capital spending this year, as those ‌companies invest heavily in hardware and data centers to support AI model training and customer demand.\n\nScott Acheychek, chief operating officer of REX Financial, which manages ETFs with exposure to Tesla stock, argued that Tesla's car business was no longer the main focus. \"The bigger story,\" he said, \"is the business model transition now underway\" as Tesla focuses on autonomous driving.\n\nTesla shares were down 1% in early trading on Thursday.\n\nAndrew Rocco, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said he viewed the $20 billion as \"necessary spending.\"\n\n\"If Optimus is going to be a best-selling product, the AI ⁠must be trained as well as possible,\" he said, adding the planned spending ​gives him confidence that Musk's \"sometimes loose timelines will actually be honored.\"",

    "description": "In a hearing, a judge advised YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson and Virtual Dining Concepts to settle their legal dispute over MrBeast Burger.",
    "fullText": "A judge urged MrBeast and his burger business partner to settle their legal battle to avoid airing \"dirty laundry\" — but paved the way for the case to go to trial.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter appeared skeptical about the damages sustained by either side, both of which are suing the other. Despite that, she ruled that both cases could proceed.\n\nVDC said it looked \"forward to having our day in court.\" MrBeast's reps declined to comment.\n\nYouTube's top star, MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson), launched MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture selling burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, with Virtual Dining Concepts in 2020. Donaldson hoped it would become the cornerstone of a food empire, but the partnership was plagued by tensions over undercooked orders and Donaldson's demands for more control of the business.\n\nIn July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.\n\nA big issue for the judge was the level of damages claimed by both sides. She said the evidence presented by MrBeast about bad Yelp reviews over MrBeast Burger orders seemed \"very compelling.\" But she said she was \"very skeptical\" that they \"would materially and irreparably harm the MrBeast brand under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe judge took special interest in MrBeast's argument that VDC owes him royalties over burger sales.\n\nVDC says MrBeast's camp instructed the company to reinvest his royalty share back into the business. MrBeast's side says it's entitled to royalties now that the partnership has fallen apart.\n\nThe judge urged the parties to think about seeking a business solution rather than a legal one, given the cost of fighting the case in court.\n\n\"If they can't take each other anymore, they should be thinking about a buyout, and it may be costly, but at the end of the day, maybe that's what these parties both should want,\" she said.\n\nThe judge also admitted some fascination with the case involving the world's biggest YouTuber and his ill-fated business venture.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half hearing, MrBeast's lawyer, Steven Marenberg, alleged that the burger complaints harmed the YouTuber's reputation.\n\nHe said the \"systemic, deep\" dissatisfaction with MrBeast Burger could \"impact, irreparably,\" the YouTuber's brand.\n\nShawn Rabin, VDC's lawyer, countered by claiming that MrBeast wanted to lower the value of the business so he could \"buy it on the cheap\" and take control of it.",

    "fullText": "Most Super Bowl advertisers stick to a familiar formula: inoffensive humor and A-list celebrities. Hims & Hers is breaking from the playbook.\n\nTitled \"Rich People Live Longer,\" the digital health company's 2026 big game spot takes aim at a divide in access to quality healthcare between wealthy Americans and everyone else.\n\nOne scene features a space-suited cowboy over the TV news-style chyron \"World's richest man in orbit again.\" The scene is reminiscent of tech billionaire Jeff Bezos emerging from a capsule after completing Blue Origin's first passenger spaceflight in 2021.\n\nAnother shows a shirtless, muscular man strapped to an oxygen mask while sprinting on an exercise bike, alongside text reading \"spends millions\" and \"cheats death\" — perhaps a reference to biohacker Bryan Johnson, who has been known to test oxygen therapy as part of his expensive, public quest against aging.\n\nDan Kenger, the chief design officer at Hims & Hers, told Business Insider that the figures in the ad \"aren't specific individuals,\" and instead \"symbols of an intimidating, members-only healthcare culture.\" Kenger said Hims & Hers is aiming for the ad to be a provocative conversation starter about health inequity.\n\n\"We don't shy away from uncomfortable truths, and we fully expect this will ruffle some feathers,\" Kenger said. \"But if our message makes the industry uncomfortable, it's because we're exposing an outdated system that benefits the very few at the expense of everyone else.\"\n\nHims & Hers is no stranger to advertising controversy. Its \"Sick of the System\" Super Bowl ad last year drew backlash from senators and lobbyists for promoting non-FDA-approved compounded weight-loss drugs in a spot that lacked the sort of safety information typically disclosed by pharmaceutical companies. At the time, Hims & Hers said it adhered to advertising regulations and aimed to raise awareness of the obesity health crisis by showcasing the difficulties of accessing affordable weight-loss treatments.\n\nFor this year's campaign, Hims & Hers also plans to partner with podcast hosts and influencers to produce content across Meta, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms. It also has commercials planned throughout the Olympics, which begin next month.\n\nThis year's Super Bowl takes place on Sunday, Feb. 8.",

    "description": "How Amazon's decision translates to your own workplace.",
    "fullText": "16,000 jobs down. How many more to go?\n\nThe sequel to Amazon's mass layoffs last fall came yesterday with another round of deep job cuts. I'd love to tell you it's an isolated incident, but it feels representative of a broader shift across tech and corporate America.\n\nAI is ushering in a new era for workplaces, and companies are adjusting accordingly. As the ones closest to the tech (and spending the most on it), Big Tech would be the first to evolve. Make no mistake: Where Big Tech goes, the rest of the business world will likely follow.\n\nSo what can we glean from Amazon's layoffs? Fortunately, my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart are crushing it with scoops. Their stories provide context about Amazon's decision and how that translates to your own workplace.\n\nNo one is safe: Internal Slack messages Ashley viewed show how many teams were bitten by the layoff bug. That includes businesses within AWS (its AI cloud service and cloud data warehouse service) and Amazon's retail business.\n\nOne Amazon worker used an AI tool to flag roles on the chopping block. That list is even broader, although it may contain inaccuracies since it's AI-generated. Another noticeable trend is how software engineers got hit particularly hard, as has been the case in tech recently.\n\nOwn it: After a not-so-hot start, Amazon has coordinated its post-layoffs communications. And there's one word that keeps cropping up: ownership.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP of AWS Infrastructure, and Colleen Aubrey, SVP of Applied AI Solutions, both described \"doubling down on a culture of ownership\" in memos Ashley viewed. That sentiment, coupled with the changes Eugene reported on in performance reviews, signals that the further away you are from doing the actual work, the more at risk you are.\n\nAI can be a friend as much as a foe: Artificial intelligence often takes a lot of blame for why jobs are getting swallowed up. A memo from AWS VP Greg Pearson that Eugene viewed paints a different picture.\n\nHe urged workers to \"keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work.\" It's something I heard a lot of last week when chatting with execs: \"AI won't take your job, but the person willing to use it will.\"\n\nMake change, don't manage it: I'm not a tech career coach (I'll leave that advice to this guy), but the layoffs, coupled with CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing war against bureaucracy, indicate a desire to get more people rolling up their sleeves.\n\nIt's reminiscent of a recent convo I had with Cisco president and chief product officer Jeetu Patel. He stressed the importance of figuring out the change you want to make and working toward it, rather than focusing on a job title.\n\n\"If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,\" Patel told me. \"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.\"",

    "description": "\"You lose people, employees.\"",
    "fullText": "The second week of January brought hope of a snowstorm for Santa Fe, New Mexico, businesses.\n\nSki resorts and winter sports shops were struggling because of high temperatures and a lack of snow, KOAT reported.\n\nBluebird Mountain Sports assistant manager Wanonce Rakestraw said: \"Usually, our season extends out to the first week of April. Past seasons used to be second week of April. But now, if it keeps going the way it is, we're looking last week of March, if not mid of March.\"\n\nThe warmer weather highlights a worldwide trend in which temperatures have drastically risen because of humans' burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gas. In the United States and elsewhere, this change varies by region, but winter temperatures in the continental U.S. have climbed 3 degrees since the preindustrial era, according to The Climate Reality Project.\n\nIn the Southwest, that means drier winters that increase drought risks. In addition to the impact on businesses and economies, this \"season creep\" is stressing agriculture and ecosystems.\n\nFarmers rely on snowmelt to irrigate crops in spring, while plants and animals have evolved to rely on seasonal cues for survival instincts that include reproduction. People similarly have built their lives around the rhythms of Earth.\n\n\"It's been really slow,\" Rakestraw told KOAT. \"When places lose business, you lose people, employees. You close early.\"\n\nSki Santa Fe general manager Ben Abruzzo said his business was using snowmaking machines to remain open. Others have not been so lucky. In France, hundreds of ski resorts shut their doors, and some in the western U.S. couldn't open as usual because of a lack of snow. Excessive snowfall in the Northeast and Midwest underscored the variability.\n\nWarmer weather can also mean more rain, which may create flooding issues.\n\nWhile some ski resorts may be able to supplement low snowfall, they cannot stay afloat without more of the white stuff. Adapting to new weather patterns should be one priority, while investing in infrastructure and planning upgrades should be another.\n\nDo you think America could ever get all of its power from clean energy?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe rise in temperatures at the root of the problem may only be mitigated by the transition to solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy, which do not produce pollution that traps heat in the atmosphere.\n\nYou can make a change — and even save yourself a ton of money — by installing solar panels, replacing your gas-powered vehicle with an electric one, and changing how you update your wardrobe.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A former marketing manager explains why leaving corporate life to freelance after having kids led to burnout and mental health struggles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Katie Bullon of activ Marketing Franchise. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my firstborn, I was working in the corporate world as a marketing manager. It was an intense job that I absolutely loved, both as a single person and then as a newly married one. I got to travel the world, quickly advance in my career, and diversify my skill set, but I could only do the job because I didn't yet have kids.\n\nI knew once I started a family, I wouldn't want to continue working in the corporate world full time. I never wanted to be in a position where I had to choose between taking care of my kids and doing my job, so I initially decided to go back to my role part time, thinking that would be a happy medium.\n\nBut after keeping in touch day, a reintroduction to work after maternity leave, when my son was 7 months old, it became clear I couldn't even manage the part time role. To do the job well, to the high standard I expected of myself, I had to give it my everything.\n\nI remember finishing the keeping in touch day, crying in my boss's office, telling her I just couldn't come back. The day had been a reminder of my old life — the life of a young, free, travelling corporate marketer. It was a life I knew I couldn't maintain with a baby in tow, and I mourned the end of my life as a corporate professional.\n\nI quit my job and, after months of deliberation and dreaming, decided to go freelance — I was really excited. Surely, I thought, I would strike a healthy balance of parenting and working if I worked for myself.\n\nThe plan would be to devote all my attention to my son when he was awake, and pull out my laptop to work while he slept.\n\nBut the reality of being self-employed as a new mom was not what I had imagined.\n\nI was running on empty all the time, exhausted from sleepless nights. I didn't know what I was doing with parenting, as I had never done it before, and often felt I was doing it all wrong. I adored my son even more than I had imagined I would, and not being with him while I worked constantly pulled at my heartstrings.\n\nIt was from this state that I then tried to work, attempting to be at clients' full-time disposal. Even though I knew about marketing, I didn't fully take into account the amount of work or the number of non-billable hours I'd be working as a self-employed individual. As opposed to working for a corporate company, I was the sole person responsible for every aspect of the business. It was all on me.\n\nNot keen on putting my son in a day care to save us a bit of money, I tried to build the business with him around most of the time, save for a few hours a week when my mom or sister would have him.\n\nI was on a hamster wheel from the moment I woke up, becoming more and more exhausted as I tried to work as if I didn't have a child, and parent as if I didn't have a job.\n\nThe standards I set for myself as a mother and business owner were unachievable, and I could feel myself starting to burn out as I attempted to do it all.\n\nOnly 20 months after my first son was born, I gave birth to my second son, and I continued trying to balance my own business with parenting, this time with a toddler and newborn in tow.\n\nMy second didn't ever take a bottle, so I frequently sat with him breastfeeding on one side with my laptop set up on the other. I was absolutely determined to do it all, and do it all perfectly.\n\nI suppose part of me wanted to prove people wrong, to show them that I could be a completely present mother while also being an incredibly successful self-starter.\n\nMy mental health crashed. My physical health deteriorated. My relationship with my husband was rocky. I was exhausted all the time and felt like I had hit rock bottom.\n\nIt wasn't what I had expected freelancing to be like, and it most certainly wasn't what I wanted motherhood to be like.\n\nWhile self-employment might seem like the \"easier than corporate path\" for new mothers, it wasn't — not for me.\n\nSomething had to change, so I went back to the drawing board, considering what I could do differently, and joined a marketing franchise. It allowed me to continue doing what I loved, marketing, but I had the back office and a team of people behind me to carry out all the work that had overwhelmed me when I was working on my own.\n\nIf I could go back in time and give myself advice, I would say: You can't do it all, nor should you.\n\nAs a mom, I can't put myself last. I must build my life in a way that prioritizes me; otherwise, I'll burn out repeatedly, which is detrimental to ume, my family, and my work.",

    "description": "I used points to upgrade to United Polaris business class on an eight-hour flight. From the lounge access to the amenities, the upgrade was worth it.",
    "fullText": "I never thought I'd prefer sleeping 35,000 feet in the sky to my own bed, but my recent trip in United's business class proved me wrong.\n\nI like to take red-eye flights when I'm traveling to a destination in a different time zone because it helps me keep my sleep schedule on track. However, if I don't get proper rest on these flights, I land feeling completely groggy and end up missing out on my first day of travel.\n\nSo, on a recent overnight flight from New Jersey to Morocco, I decided to upgrade to United Polaris business class in hopes of getting a good night's sleep. I originally had a regular economy ticket and, as a frequent flyer, used my PlusPoints to get the upgrade at no additional charge.\n\nBetween the Saks Fifth Avenue blanket and a toiletry kit filled with skincare products, the experience did not disappoint.\n\nBecause I was flying business class on an eligible long-haul international flight, I had access to United's Polaris lounge.\n\nI typically like to be in and out of the airport as quickly as possible, but this time, I arrived a few hours early just to enjoy the perks.\n\nAs I walked in, I thought the space itself was stunning. It had a sleek, modern design with a marble check-in area and an overall elevated, luxury feel.\n\nThe lounge featured an extensive hot and cold buffet, but I opted to visit the full-service dining room instead.\n\nI ordered the tagliatelle pasta, which was perfectly al dente, followed by a warm sticky toffee cake that practically melted in my mouth.\n\nAfter my meal, I stopped by the bar to enjoy one of the signature cocktails before boarding.\n\nAfter boarding, I made my way to my seat, which was set up in a private pod. I immediately noticed how spacious the layout was and how it provided a real sense of privacy.\n\nWaiting at my seat was Saks Fifth Avenue bedding, including a plush pillow, a duvet, and a cooling-gel pillow. I also requested a mattress pad and a pair of slippers for extra comfort.\n\nOn my seat, I also found a complimentary toiletry bag with some travel essentials.\n\nInside was everything I needed for a long-haul flight — an eye mask, cozy socks, tissues, a dental kit with a toothbrush and toothpaste, earplugs, and a pen.\n\nIt was also stocked with Perricone MD skincare products, including a cleansing wipe, eye gel, hand cream, lip balm, and face mist.\n\nAll of it was super helpful for staying refreshed throughout the flight.\n\nAt this point, I was so comfortable I could've fallen asleep at any second, but I had to stay awake for the food.\n\nBefore the meal service began, the flight attendants came around with warm towels, which was a thoughtful, elevated touch. They even pulled out my tray table and placed a cloth napkin down.\n\nFor dinner, I was served a welcome snack, an appetizer (salad, bread, and an olive tapenade), and my main course. I also had a glass of white wine.\n\nHowever, I was left a bit underwhelmed by my entrée. The steak was cooked more than I would've liked it to be, and the potatoes tasted underseasoned.\n\nBecause I had a satisfying meal at the lounge, though, I wasn't too disappointed.\n\nHowever, dessert is where things really stood out. The flight attendants came around with an ice-cream sundae cart, where passengers could build their own treat with different toppings.\n\nI went all out with caramel sauce, hot fudge, chocolate chips, and cherries.\n\nAfter eating, I got ready for bed in the spacious cabin bathroom and settled in for a good night's rest. Honestly, the best part of this seat was how well I slept.\n\nBeyond the luxury bedding, the seat itself reclines into a completely flat bed. There's even a footrest up front that adds extra room.\n\nAccording to United's website, the bed offers about 77 inches of sleeping room. As someone who's just over 5 feet tall, this was more than enough space to stretch out completely.\n\nThe controls on the side of the seat made it easy to adjust everything exactly as I liked. Between the fully flat bed, plush bedding, walls surrounding my pod, and my sleeping mask and earplugs, I slept just as comfortably as I would've at home.\n\nSince my flight was a red-eye, I landed in Morocco at 9 a.m. with a full day of events ahead of me. Being well-rested made all the difference and allowed me to hit the ground running.\n\nAlthough I thought the upgrade was completely worth it because I used points, I probably wouldn't pay full price for a business-class seat.\n\nHowever, I'd gladly use any points or upgrades I had available to recreate this experience in the future.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luke Breen, co-owner of specialty bike shop Perennial Cycle in uptown Minneapolis. The following conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nPerennial is a specialty bike shop. We do cargo bikes, city utility bikes, and commuting bikes, and have been a niche business for 33 years.\n\nPerennial focuses on community events. Last year, we did 35 organized community rides. So, while we do rely on selling bikes, we're very community-driven. That's always been a big piece of Perennial Cycle.\n\nYou cannot be in Minneapolis without ICE's presence impacting your day-to-day. You just simply cannot. Imagine: We had to shut down our schools to keep children safe. It is insane what is happening right now.\n\nAs a bike shop, we've had meetings so we can be aware of each other's levels of anxiety — how we're doing, is everybody OK? For some people, it's going to affect them a little differently, and we've come up with a plan for if ICE is on the block.\n\nWe were closed on Friday, January 23, for the ICE OUT protest. To me, it's a big ask to have small businesses go on strike, and later I heard that it was the first general strike in 80 years. I'm really glad that Perennial did that.\n\nI also went to the march in downtown Minneapolis last Friday afternoon and was a little overwhelmed with emotions. I had no idea how massive it was. When you're in a march like that, you can kind of see the few thousand people that are around you. It isn't until later when you see those overhead videos posted online, and it's like, 'Oh my God.'\n\nIt had an amazing vibe. There was not a lot to cheer about, and yet there's a lot to be together about. It took a lot of awesome organizing to pull that off. There were restaurants that were handing out food. There were tables with cases and cases and cases of hand warmers. It was minus 10 when I went down there, and the wind was blowing. I did not expect that many people because it was so cold.\n\nWe held a fundraiser for MIRAC, a local immigrant rights organization, scheduled for Sunday. I talked with Brieanna, the artist and screenprinter I am working with. We considered canceling. Brieanna and I decided that canceling is exactly what ICE would want us to do. We did not cancel the event.\n\nThere was a line outside the door that was a half-block long at one point. Tons of people showed up. Everybody was just happy to be part of the community. A couple of legal observers explained what it's like to be an observer, knowing that lots of people are very curious about it, but it's pretty intimidating when you just go by what you're seeing on the news and on Instagram. That was part of the aim of the fundraiser: to foster observer conversations.\n\nWe raised over $4,000. We brought in, I don't know, probably like 20 grocery bags of food for a food shelf. All those things were great, but the most appreciation came from people saying they were happy to be together, happy to have a place to go and be around other people who were kind of in mourning.\n\nWe had little cheat sheets with information about the event that we handed out when visitors walked in the door. One of the things was, \"Yes, we're a bike shop Monday through Saturday, but today we're not. Please don't ask us questions about bikes.\" We just didn't have the capacity to do bike stuff.\n\nThere were plenty of people at the fundraiser who weren't familiar with the bike shop. But plenty of people who were like, \"Wow, this is kind of weird. Why is this happening in a bike shop?\" And that was kind of fun explaining that, actually, this is very normal because we focus on community events. We have Cambros containers for serving coffee to 100 people. We have serving trays for treats. We have all the things that are necessary to organize an event like this. The bike shop actually already has the musicians who were singing.\n\nIt's off-season for me. I am really happy to have found a place to plug in to be useful during what's happening in Minneapolis right now. Numerous people came up and thanked me for opening the shop and doing the fundraiser. Most of the kind words were about community and not about raising money.\n\nHopefully, the shop will make it through, but honestly, it is a real challenge.\n\nOur city's under siege, but in reality, we all know it's our country that's under siege. We know a lot of people are super challenged by what's going on right now. I sell pretty expensive bicycles. These cargo bikes are not cheap. So for me, the tariffs have completely turned my life upside down. I'm learning that there is a plural for the word crisis, and it's crises. And that's what I'm looking at — one crisis on top of another.\n\nI have high seasons and low seasons. It's a low season, so I have to be very protective with my money right now. Any loss of income is a big deal because we're barely going to cover expenses for the month. This is a typical cycle for a business in Minnesota, a very seasonal business, so none of that is overwhelming. But, yeah, that's why the strike was definitely a big ask, and I'm so happy I did it. I believe that the store will reap rewards on the other side of this.",

    "title": "The questions Leonis Capital investors ask to see if a startup's tech actually holds up",
    "description": "Leonis Capital founders Jenny Xiao and Jay Zhao tell Business Insider what they ask AI startup founders to evaluate their tech.",
    "fullText": "If you hadn't heard, there's an AI race sweeping through Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile stalwarts like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, are grabbing the headlines as they unveil model after model, there are plenty of startups trying to find a foothold.\n\nFor investors, it can be hard to tell which of these upstarts have true technical potential and which are likely to fade into tech oblivion.\n\nThat's part of why Jenny Xiao, the cofounder of Leonis Capital, said it's important for venture capitalists to get serious about understanding the AI technology they're investing in.\n\nLeonis Capital, founded in 2021, is now deploying its second $40 million fund. The venture capital firm is focused on next-generation AI companies and has invested in over a dozen since its launch, including MaintainX, Motion, and SpectroCloud.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Xiao and her cofounder, Jay Zhao, to share the top five questions they ask founders when evaluating their tech. They shared their responses over email, which have been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nThe best founders don't think in terms of incremental feature improvements — they think in capability thresholds. We're looking for whether they understand that progress in AI is often non-linear, and whether they can anticipate which future capabilities might fundamentally change or even break their product.\n\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from our Leonis AI 100 — where we benchmarked the most important AI startups — is that the strongest AI founders build just ahead of the next technical breakthrough.\n\nA good answer talks about entirely new workflows that get unlocked, not just marginal efficiency gains, and clearly explains how the company would adapt or pivot as the technology evolves.\n\nMost AI startups don't fail because they're bad, but because they're building something that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google can eventually ship \"for free\" as a feature.\n\nThat's why we don't accept \"they're not focused on this\" as an answer. We push founders to explain what internal constraint would actually prevent a foundation model lab from building the same thing. If the answer comes down to focus or culture, that's not a real moat.\n\nStrong answers acknowledge that the big labs technically could build it, but doing so would break their incentive structure, pricing, or distribution model; require operational complexity that doesn't scale for them; or shift value to downstream execution rather than model capability.\n\nSome founders can also credibly argue they have a 12- to 18-month head start. Weak answers, by contrast, lean on claims like being \"more vertical,\" having \"more niche data,\" or understanding customers better — responses we hear from about 95% of founders.\n\nWe've noticed a consistent pattern: Most founders underestimate foundation models, and most VCs underestimate them even more.\n\nAsking \"How much proprietary data do you have?\" is usually the wrong question, since no early-stage company has truly meaningful data. And if a founder's pitch boils down to \"we have more data, therefore our models are better,\" that's a red flag: foundation models often improve faster than proprietary ones, and the companies building them have enough capital to buy data and quickly close any gaps.\n\nWhat matters much more is not how much data exists today, but whether the product naturally generates better data over time. For example, industrial systems where data only emerges once software is embedded in workflows, or products where switching costs come from accumulated context.\n\nWe ask this question to understand where defensibility actually lives once code becomes commoditized. If a founder can't answer it clearly, they likely don't understand their own moat.\n\nCosmetic advantages like code, UI, or models are easy to copy, while structural advantages — such as being a system of record or being embedded into compliance, audits, or standard operating procedures — are much harder to replicate.\n\nThe question also reveals founder temperament: Strong founders are candid about their vulnerabilities (\"Here's what we're most worried about\"), while weaker ones tend to get defensive and insist a threat \"would never happen.\"\n\nThis question forces founders to explain their earliest technical decisions and the trade-offs they intentionally made, revealing whether they understand system dynamics rather than just iterating on features.\n\nStrong answers sound like, \"We chose to execute actions, not just make suggestions, which increased liability but created real lock-in,\" or \"We became the system of record instead of a thin layer, which slowed integrations and sales early but made switching organizationally expensive later.\" By contrast, many founders default to saying they want to \"stay flexible,\" which often signals they haven't yet designed anything fundamental.\n\nThe best AI systems are opinionated by design, deliberately removing degrees of freedom and hard-coding assumptions about workflows, authority, or data flow.\n\nReal insight usually comes from abandoning old assumptions. This question helps distinguish founders who simply stumbled into AI from those who experienced a genuine shift in how they see the world.\n\nWe're looking for intellectual flexibility, not credentials. Strong answers point to a specific belief the founder once held, why they believed it, and what changed their mind; weak answers stay vague, like saying they \"realized AI was going to be big.\"\n\nThis question assumes copying is possible and pushes founders to explain what isn't obvious. Shallow answers fall back on claims like \"they couldn't move as fast\" or \"they don't have our data,\" while stronger ones point to hard-to-see advantages such as deep operational knowledge, customer-specific integrations, or accumulated context that isn't visible from the outside.\n\nFounders who can't point to moments where they changed their mind usually aren't learning — they're executing a fixed plan in a world that won't stay fixed.\n\nThis question reveals epistemic humility and whether a founder is genuinely truth-seeking or just looking for confirmation. AI moves too fast for people who can't update, and we're especially wary of founders who treat every pivot as vindication rather than correction.\n\nMarket timing, regulatory shifts, and platform dependencies kill far more startups than bad management. This question tests whether founders think probabilistically about external forces and whether they've designed for resilience instead of relying on luck.\n\nFounders who say \"nothing\" haven't thought hard enough. The ones we want to back can name several concrete external risks and explain how they're hedging against them.\n\nThe best founders aren't contrarian for its own sake, but they can hold an unpopular position long enough for the world to catch up.",

    "description": "It turns out investors are willing to forgive huge capital spending if a company's core business is thriving.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Wednesday's hoy trinity of earnings — which saw Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla report within five minutes of each other — everyone knew that updates on AI progress would be the only game in town.\n\nHow those results ended up playing out shed crucial light on where we are in the AI trade right now.\n\nThe overarching focus for the Big Tech trio was not who has immediately seen results from AI investment. Instead, it was whether those companies were doing enough to support the appearance of maybe, eventually doing something. Investors love the prospect of future upside, and want a reason to preserve their optimism.\n\nEach of the three companies showcased this trend in their own unique way. Let's go one by one:\n\nLast quarter, Meta was punished for its capex-spending plans. This quarter, the company once again blew the doors off spending forecasts … but this time the market seemed OK with it.\n\nWhat changed? Look no further than the company's stronger-than-expected first-quarter revenue, driven by a big beat in advertising. Meta CFO Susan Li also got investors hyped on the earnings call by saying the company will fund its AI ambitions primarily with cash, rather than debt.\n\nIn the end, it's not that Meta has tangible proof that its AI spending is going to generate monstrous future earnings growth. The company has instead fallen back on its cash-cow advertising business to alleviate financing pressures and buy itself more time.\n\nWe haven't yet gotten an answer about whether the AI spending will pay off. We just know the company can afford to keep pursuing it.\n\nMarket reception: Very positive\n\nI present the counterpoint to Meta's well-received quarter. Microsoft also announced much larger-than-expected spending plans … and its stock fell.\n\nThe difference? One of Microsoft's main cash cows — its Azure cloud-computing unit — showed slowing growth. Suddenly, big spending doesn't look so appealing when your backstop is weakening.\n\nWhile Tesla's AI push has taken the form of self-driving vehicles and robotics, the company's lofty valuation is still being largely driven by hopes that big AI-linked profits will one day be unlocked.\n\nBut unlike Meta, the EV-maker is doing it at a time when its core business is in decline. One overlooked highlight of Tesla's report was that — even though the company posted a bottom-line beat — it also saw first-ever decline in annual revenue.\n\nIt didn't matter. Investors instead focused on Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI, the company owned by Elon Musk. They also seemed to take the discontinuation of the Model S and Y vehicles in stride.\n\nAgain, the perception of eventually monetizing AI won out. In the AI race, it's not what you're doing, it's what you can convince everyone you're going to do down the line.",

    "description": "Some small-business owners in Portland, Maine, are debating how best to support staff and customers amid a federal immigration crackdown.",
    "fullText": "After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a \"No ICE\" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly.\n\nGerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung \"No ICE\" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state.\n\nFor Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business.\n\n\"The posters are up, and they're not coming down,\" Gerry said.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.\n\nAlso on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign.\n\nGerry said that some owners he's been speaking with favor taking part in the stoppage, and others are calling for businesses to remain open to divert profits to groups helping immigrants.\n\nAlready this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. His current thought: Close for the day and donate weekend proceeds to charities helping those affected by the immigration sweep.\n\nThese are the sorts of calculations that many small-business owners across the US have considered over the past few months. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week.\n\nWhile some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action.\n\nSome workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention.\n\nGerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep.\n\nHe said he contacted restaurant review sites to flag the negative ratings, and he and his co-owners instructed the restaurant's more than 50 staffers on how to handle negative phone calls. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to \"review bomb\" the restaurant.\n\nEarlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a \"No ICE\" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. The following week, she attended an online training conducted by a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union about where federal agents are permitted to go within a business if they don't have a warrant.\n\nMillecchia said she feels she's in a more privileged position to speak up than some other shopkeepers.\n\n\"I'm the white lady who can yell,\" she said.\n\nYet, Millecchia said, motioning toward the poster, the sign is a \"hollow gesture\" — other than the show of support it sends.\n\nWhat is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said.\n\n\"They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here,\" she said, referring to the presence of federal officers.\n\nThat could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. Another disruption: She plans to close on Friday to support the strike.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. The cards were printed in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Somali, and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in parts of Africa.\n\nAn employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community.\n\nHe estimated that foot traffic at the store had fallen by at least half from what's typical for January.\n\nAt a skate shop called Mocean, owner Jasper Tripp said he hung a \"No ICE\" sign because it aligned with his beliefs. Ordinarily, he said, he tries to separate his political views from the store he has run for nearly a decade.\n\n\"It just feels right,\" Tripp said of the decision to put up the poster. He worked with an artist to design an anti-ICE T-shirt. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said.\n\nFor some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. One restaurant owner said she plans to shut down for at least a week — and pay workers — while she's out of town. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.\n\nShe asked that Business Insider not use her name or that of her restaurant to protect her employees, who she said are legal immigrants but who nevertheless feel threatened.\n\nShe taped a \"No ICE\" poster to the door to help employees and customers to feel safe, not to denounce immigration agents, she said.\n\nThe balance is tricky, the owner added. \"I have the responsibility to keep people safe. I also have an economic responsibility.\"",

    "fullText": "Lord Stockwood says people in government ‘definitely’ talking about idea as technology disrupts industries\n\nThe UK could introduce a universal basic income (UBI) to protect workers in industries that are being disrupted by AI, the investment minister Jason Stockwood has said.\n\n“Bumpy” changes to society caused by the introduction of the technology would mean there would have to be “some sort of concessionary arrangement with jobs that go immediately”, Lord Stockwood said.\n\nThe Labour peer told the Financial Times: “Undoubtedly we’re going to have to think really carefully about how we soft-land those industries that go away, so some sort of [universal basic income], some sort of lifelong mechanism as well so people can retrain.”\n\nA universal basic income is not part of official government policy, but when asked whether people in government were considering the need for UBI, Stockwood told the FT: “People are definitely talking about it.”\n\nThe technology entrepreneur, who took up his ministerial post in September, said part of his motivation for joining the government was to help ensure the workforce was prepared for rapid change.\n\nFears continue to grow about the impact of artificial intelligence on Britain’s job market. This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

That left the community without a true grocery store for years, forcing people to drive nearly a half-hour to pick up basics, or to overpay for them at local specialty stores.\n\nSomething similar happened when the K-Mart closed in Key West. That shutdown, one of the last in the chain, robbed that remote area of its only department store, forcing residents to drive four to five hours before they hit a Walmart or a Target.\n\nResidents in the Pacific Northwest now face similar challenges, according to local reports.\n\nIn the markets it serves, Cascade Farm and Outdoor, which is closing all its stores, will leave a similar hole for consumers.\n\nA rival to Tractor Supply, Cascade Farm serves farmers and rural communities.

    "title": "Oprah Winfrey turned her weight-loss journey into a business. Here's how her health empire has evolved.",
    "description": "Oprah Winfrey's newest book, \"Enough,\" is about her relationship with weight-loss drugs. Since the '90s, she has been combining her health with business.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey has spent years turning her private health journey into a public conversation — and, at times, a lucrative business.\n\nThe billionaire, real-estate mogul, talk-show host, journalist, actor, and producer has just released her 12th book: \"Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It's Like To Be Free.\"\n\nThe book, which she co-authored with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, a doctor and professor at Yale's School of Medicine, dives into the role of GLP-1 drugs to facilitate weight loss.\n\nThe practice is something that Winfrey herself has touted. On CNN in December 2024, she said she had first begun using a GLP-1 before Christmas in 2023.\n\nWinfrey has been combining her personal health and fitness with business for decades, including investing in WeightWatchers (now WW International), writing books about health, identifying exercise and health trends for her show and magazine, and putting her support behind figures like Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is now the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWinfrey did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of how her health empire has evolved.\n\nDuring a 1988 episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" — a few years after Joan Rivers asked about Winfrey's weight gain — Winfrey wheeled out a red wagon filled with 67 pounds of animal fat.\n\nWhy? To convey to her audience how much weight she'd lost in the last year while on the Optifast liquid diet.\n\nThe episode put a spotlight on medically supervised liquid formula diets. After it aired, The New York Times reported that Winfrey got just 400 calories a day from Optifast and wrote that the ability of people on such diets \"to maintain the loss is questionable and not yet fully evaluated.\"\n\nFor a 2005 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Winfrey wrote, \"For four solid months, I didn't eat a single morsel of food,\" and lost 67 pounds. \"What I didn't know was that my metabolism was shot. Two weeks after I returned to real food, I was up 10 pounds.\"\n\nWhile she was proud of losing the weight, Winfrey later regretted the decision to pull the wagon out.\n\n\"When I look at that show, I think it was one of the biggest ego trips of my life,\" Winfrey told Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe cowrote \"Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life\" with exercise physiologist (and her personal trainer) Bob Greene.\n\nThe 10 steps included guidance such as \"exercise 20 to 60 minutes a day,\" \"eat a low-fat, balanced diet,\" and \"eat three meals and two snacks each day.\"\n\nIt went on to become a No. 1 bestseller and is still in circulation.\n\nWinfrey introduced audiences to Phil McGraw, aka Dr. Phil, in the late '90s as her show's resident relationship expert. He proved so popular that Winfrey produced and co-created a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" starring McGraw: \"Dr. Phil.\" It aired from 2002 to 2023, and for most of its run, it was second in ratings only to Winfrey's show.\n\nLike Winfrey, McGraw frequently discussed weight loss and health on his show, and also lent his face and name to nutritional supplements. As The New York Times wrote in 2003, \"Oprah Winfrey has talked about weight loss — hers and everyone else's — for years. Her protégé Dr. Phil has found a way to make money from it.\"\n\nHe's also written his own weight-loss books, including \"The Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 Keys to Weight Loss Freedom\" and \"The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide.\"\n\nWinfrey also introduced Dr. Mehmet Oz to her show's audience. He made his \"Oprah\" debut in 2004 and ultimately appeared more than 60 times, per NPR, before Winfrey greenlit \"The Dr. Oz Show\" in 2009. It aired until 2022, when he began a US Senate campaign in Pennsylvania.\n\nSimilarly, Oz's program featured many segments on weight loss, and Oz himself endorsed multiple \"cures\" for obesity that have been disproven. He was appointed administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2024.\n\nWhile it's not known how much money Winfrey made from their two shows, both aired for over a decade (with reruns on Winfrey's channel, OWN), and Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, was involved throughout.\n\nWinfrey's own show, which aired for 25 years, was the foundation of her wealth, rocketing her to millionaire status when it became nationally syndicated in 1986. By 2003, she was a billionaire, and she's now worth an estimated $3.2 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2015, Winfrey announced she was joining the board of WeightWatchers (now known as WW International, or WW) and was purchasing a 10% stake in the company worth $43 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that it led to an increase of $400 million in market value for the brand, which had been trending downward before Winfrey's involvement.\n\n\"WeightWatchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" she said in a statement. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nIt's an example of the Oprah Effect: the trend of Winfrey endorsing, supporting, or investing in a brand that leads to a spike in value.\n\nWinfrey posted on X (then Twitter) a video about how she'd lost 26 pounds on WeightWatchers while still eating bread.\n\n\"I love bread,\" she said. \"That's the genius of this program. I lost 26 pounds, and I have eaten bread every single day.\"\n\nAccording to MarketWatch, the subsequent bump in the stock price, just one hour after the post, netted Winfrey around $12 million.\n\nWinfrey's cookbook, which also reached bestseller status, incorporated the WeightWatchers system into its recipes and flagged the number of points each meal was worth, in a neat bit of corporate synergy.\n\nSoon after confirming her use of a GLP-1, Winfrey publicly said she wouldn't be seeking reelection to the board.\n\nThe announcement sent WeightWatchers' stock tumbling 25%. As Business Insider wrote at the time, it seemed like Winfrey was jumping ship from an \"outdated operating system\" in the age of Ozempic and other GLP-1s.\n\nWinfrey's latest book, \"Enough,\" which she cowrote with Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, was released in January 2026. It details Winfrey's experience with GLP-1s, combined with Jastreboff's expertise.\n\nWinfrey has been promoting her book heavily, including a stop on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" where she explained how reframing her relationship to obesity and weight has changed her life.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" she said.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see [GLP-1s] as a tool,\" she continued.",
