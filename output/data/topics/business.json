    "description": "Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, has responded to Trump's calls for the company to fire Susan Rice from its board as it bids for Warner Bros.",
    "fullText": "The head of Netflix has responded publicly for the first time to President Donald Trump's calls for it to remove Susan Rice from its board.\n\n\"This is a business deal. It's not a political deal,\" Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, told the BBC's Today program on Monday, referring to the company's bid to buy Warner Bros. \"This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US, and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.\"\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump called on Netflix to fire Rice, a former US ambassador and national security advisor in the Obama and Biden administrations, from its board of directors.\n\nTrump was responding to comments Rice made in a podcast about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" warning that they could face retribution from a future Democratic administration.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC how big a deal it was for the president to weigh in on Rice, Sarandos said: \"He likes to do a lot of things on social media.\"\n\nIt comes at a delicate time for Netflix, which is battling Paramount to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. A deal would require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal. But that changed over the weekend, with the president writing that Netflix should remove Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka called Trump's demands an \"extraordinary use of power\" and said it's a reminder that the White House would be involved in the future of Warner Bros., regardless of what Trump is saying at any given moment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sarandos said his pitch to Trump for Netflix's Warner Bros. bid is \"growth in the economy.\"\n\nHe said that Netflix's deal is a \"vertical merger\" in which the company is buying assets it doesn't already have, and so it will be \"adding to the market.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is seeking to buy Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets, Paramount is looking to buy all of the company.\n\nThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery earlier gave Paramount a seven-day window to submit a new offer, which expires at the end of Monday.\n\nOn February 17, WBD told shareholders that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that the bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal. The company's previous bid in December was for $30 per share.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Steven Polito, 49, a drag performer from New York with the stage name Hedda Lettuce. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI am a native New Yorker who lives in Puerto Vallarta during the winter.\n\nAs a drag performer, it's a great place to be — it's a very LGBTQ+ friendly community here. There's a lot of theater, a lot of cabaret, and great restaurants. It's also walkable, which I love.\n\nThe moment you leave the house here, it's like one big \"hello.\" That's what's really special about this place.\n\nIt's why I come here — and why I'm still going to come back. Being part of a community means staying when things are tough.\n\nI went to the gym at 8:30 a.m., and I was struck by how unusually quiet it was. Then, my friend at the gym told me the city is under attack by a cartel, and I had to stay put.\n\nWhen I left around 10 a.m., it was a very different scene.\n\nEveryday life was juxtaposed against horrendous property damage. There was an older woman sweeping leaves in the street, while burned-out car after burned-out car was in flames.\n\nMy neighborhood was particularly hard-hit. One neighbor pointed out a burned-out car that belonged to another neighbor who's an Uber driver with two young children. That was the bulk of his income.\n\nMy nerves are shot a bit from the sensory overload of all of it. I've had some tough experiences, but never anything like this.\n\nAs I walked home from the gym, I saw a restaurant that I go to three, four times a week. They offered me coffee. Despite everything, they were trying to be good neighbors.\n\nI saw people were cleaning up the burned out cars: it's neighbors taking care of neighbors.\n\nI could go back to New York City, but we have to think in a less cavalier way. People who live here don't have the luxury of getting up and going.\n\nDuring COVID, I stayed in Puerto Vallarta the entire time instead of going back to the States. We all thought it was going to just crumble around us. But somehow, everyone found their way and part of that was through the community.\n\nThe strength of the community, that's what's so great about Puerto Vallarta.\n\nI've experienced it firsthand and that's what keeps it going. People persevere here.",

    "description": "New tariffs chaos means investor should focus on AI and sectors of the S&P 500 that have outperformed this year, investing experts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tom Landry. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt was during the pandemic that my daughter Maddie's creativity really started to blossom. She loved doodling in particular, giving each of the characters she created back stories.\n\nWhen she was 7, she asked me if she could create stickers featuring her characters, for herself and to give to her friends.\n\nMy wife and I could have just done this for her, but we decided to involve Maddie in the process. We all researched sticker companies to find the ones that could help us get the job done. Once we decided on a company to use, we filled out the interest forms and learned to scan the characters together to send to the company.\n\nAt the beginning, it was purely about having fun. None of us were thinking about this as a business opportunity.\n\nWhen Maddie took the stickers into school, her friends loved them, asked her how she had done it, and gravitated toward the characters on the stickers and their corresponding stories.\n\nWhen she was 8, Maddie said she wanted to have a lemonade stand and sell some of her stickers at the same time. People bought them, which launched Maddie's business selling her sticker creations.\n\nFrom the lemonade stand, she donated a portion of her profits to a local charity, setting a precedent for her future business growth.\n\nGiving back to the community has always been a priority in our family, something Maddie has grown up with, so it was no surprise that she wanted to do the same with her own business.\n\nWe often say, \"Do well, but do good.\" Maddie clearly took this on board. She had internalized behaviors she's seen at home for years.\n\nThe initial interest sparked by her stickers led Maddie to work with her mom and me to learn how to set up a business.\n\nHow do you set up a website? How do people order online? Where can you sell your products? What do you do with the profit?\n\nWe answered all of these questions, and more, together.\n\nEven though I'm an entrepreneur, it was fun to just play again and be creative with my daughter. It's been incredibly energizing for me.\n\nI think that as adults who are often busy, our innate artist can disappear, and that attitude of \"anything is possible\" dissipates. It's kind of sad.\n\nI've been working for 35 years, and it's easy — almost subconscious — to assume that because something has been done a certain way for a long time, that's the way it must continue to be done. Watching Maddie approach her work with curiosity, optimism, and a willingness to try things without overthinking them pushed me to look at my own business through a much fresher lens.\n\nEven more importantly, I've had the chance to nurture Maddie's creativity, empower her to take control of what she wants, and help her learn about her agency. These are such great life skills.\n\nHer business, Maddie Moo Designs. has continued to grow. She has sold stickers online, in local souvenir shops, and at events. She's learned so much about business along the way.\n\nSince starting, Maddie has generated more than $5,000 in sales and has already donated over $500 of her earnings to Maine charities.\n\nWe've encouraged her to think about how she'll use the money she's made, suggesting four \"buckets\" — the fun bucket, the giving back bucket, the investing in the business bucket, and the savings bucket.\n\nOne of Maddie's favorite purchases with the money she has made is a black North Face coat that is fluffy and warm on the inside. She's also bought squishies and books.\n\nMaddie didn't need pressure from me or perfectionism to succeed; she just needed exposure, possibly, and look where that has taken her. Kids are capable of so much more than we assume.",

    "description": "A photographer moved from the Bay Area to Miami for a fresh start, family, and cultural connections, after his business stalled during COVID-19.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gustavo Fernandez, a 50-year-old photographer in Miami. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI had lived in the Bay Area longer than anywhere else, and I was ready for a reset. Something about the rhythm of Miami felt like the next chapter. More movement, more culture, more color.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, everything came to a standstill. Like many service-based businesses, the photography business that I had been running in SF since 2007 went to zero almost overnight.\n\nIt was a big reset moment for me, and it was time for a change.\n\nMy parents retired to Naples, Florida, about two hours from Miami, a few years earlier, and being near them felt more important than ever. My sister had recently moved from St. Louis to Naples with her family. The first Christmas after I moved in 2020, we were all together for the first time since we'd lived together.\n\nI also wanted to be closer to home. I'm originally from the Dominican Republic, and Miami felt like a natural middle ground. I missed hearing Spanish on the street. Miami didn't just offer more diversity; it gave me a sense of cultural belonging.\n\nSince moving to Florida, I've built a local photography business, primarily working with visiting companies hosting corporate events, retreats, and activations in the Miami area.\n\nI love to travel, and I wanted to be in a place that made it easier to jump between continents, especially Latin America and Europe. California is sort of the middle of nowhere, and my vacations were limited to Vegas, Hawaii, or Cabo.\n\nThe second year I lived in Miami, I went to Europe twice, visited the Dominican Republic, and other Caribbean islands. I traveled more that year than the last five years combined in SF because it's so easy.\n\nSan Francisco is cold. Because of the cold, there's also no real beach culture, which I was excited about when I moved to California. I was looking forward to paddleboarding, kitesurfing, and scuba diving, but it didn't happen.\n\nIn Miami, the water is part of the lifestyle. It's not a weekend thing. It's every day.\n\nThe median home price in SF is $1.2 million. Being an artist, I didn't want to be in that rat race of meeting someone while living in an apartment, then needing to move out to the East Bay to afford a little house. SF is very apartment-driven unless you're operating in a very different income bracket.\n\nMedian property prices in Miami are around $570,000. Also, there's no state income tax. While Miami is still cheaper than San Francisco, prices are rising here as well.\n\nI rent now but plan to buy eventually. I want the right neighborhood, the right lifestyle fit, and something that aligns with my long-term goals.\n\nI didn't realize how professional San Francisco was until I left. In San Francisco, people followed through. I felt like a big fish in a well-run pond. In Miami, I often feel like a small fish swimming against the current.\n\nYou can still make things happen, but now I have to send five times as many follow-ups. There's more ghosting, more last-minute changes, and a lot of \"let's circle back\" that never actually circles.\n\nIn San Francisco, people are very well educated and well-read. I used to be into mountaineering, and it seemed everyone in SF had already climbed Everest. If I said I just ran a 5K, someone might say, I just ran the New York Marathon last weekend. Everyone was humble but extremely accomplished\n\nHere in Miami, it's a flashy kind of lifestyle, with people hustling to get into rooms they don't deserve, whereas in San Francisco, the Google guys are driving around in a Prius.\n\nIt's easy to meet people, but harder to build deep, consistent friendships. It can stay surface-level unless you put in the work. People ask what you do before they ask who you are, and it's more transient, with a lot of snowbirds coming and going.\n\nI only had family in Naples when I first arrived, and I had one acquaintance in Miami. I've lived all over the world and built a strong network. As soon as I landed, I reached out aggressively to my contacts and asked for introductions. Within a few months, I was plugged in.\n\nMiami rewards action. If you sit back and wait, nothing happens. If you reach out, doors open quickly.\n\nI miss the variety of nature and weather in SF, the mountains, and winding roads. You can drive up to Napa, Mount Diablo, and Marin. I miss road biking, mountain biking, or running up hills. Here, it's super flat. The beaches are amazing, though.\n\nI choose freedom, but I also know it takes more discipline to create structure for yourself. You don't just plug into the community or systems. You build it. That can be exciting or exhausting, depending on the day.\n\nI'm definitely happier here; I don't miss wearing layers. I still travel back to California regularly since I have a lot of clients there, but this city is the right fit for where I am in life now.",

    "fullText": "Will AI agents be the employees of the year in 2026?\n\nOnly time will tell. Last year, one category AI absolutely dominated was being an extremely agreeable coworker. While this might sound nice, this can turn into a problem for founders who rely on AI as their only teammate.\n\nWhen your head of legal, HR, and supply operations are all AI agents, unsubstantiated flattery can create costly blind spots. That's one of the reasons OpenAI said goodbye to its \"yes-man\" version of ChatGPT, and why some AI-powered solo founders are training their tools to push back.\n\nThree business owners who rely on AI daily shared with Business Insider how they've built workflows and prompts that force their AI employees to challenge their ideas. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesim Saydan is a branding and communication expert in her early 50s, based in the Netherlands.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched custom GPTs, everything changed for me. I used the feature to create over 17 custom GPTs to build my team. Then I thought of my ideal mentors and created custom GPTs of them.\n\nWhen I'm stuck on a business decision or need to come up with a creative idea or strategy, brainstorming usually starts with my Steve Jobs custom GPT. When I prompt it, I avoid asking questions like \"What do you think of this idea?\" because the AI usually wants to agree with me and please me. Instead, I ask, \"On a scale from one to 10, how good is this idea?\"\n\nIt's not going to say the idea is bad, but now it might tell me it's a five. Then I'll ask, \"OK, what would make it a 10?\"\n\nThat's usually when it starts drawing on the experience of Steve Jobs that I've trained it with. We can go back and forth until I get the most useful and honest feedback possible. Depending on the task, I usually go through three to five rounds of refinement for more strategic outputs.\n\nAaron Sneed is a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida.\n\nWhen I started my business, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish. The training never really stops.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nI told my chief of staff agent which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI have a roundtable set up in ChatGPT's projects section with all my AI agents, including my chief of staff, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nTim Desoto is a 49-year-old founder and CEO, based in San Francisco.\n\nI've been working with AI to launch my startup since late 2024. I don't have a tech background, and since starting my business, I've learned a lot about where to leverage AI, and where not to.\n\nTaking whatever I'm building or ideating and having AI push against it, either as I'm thinking about the idea or afterward, is part of an exercise I call my AI conveyor belt. Usually, I start with a written prompt, then go multimodal, talking out loud to the model. I'll talk back and forth with it about my idea and try to get the agent to push back because I know that some AI models tend to be more agreeable.\n\nOnce I get an output that I'm happy with. I use a different model to get a different view. I'll drop the document in and go back and forth with the new model. Sometimes, I'll push a document out to both models at the same time and see what comes back. Some are better than others at giving feedback, researching, and annotating, but I'm always getting a better, more well-rounded perspective by feeding content to multiple models at a time.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "description": "NATO needs to use this time to prepare for a Russian resurgence in the Arctic, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Russian forces pulled from the Arctic to fight in Ukraine have suffered heavy losses on the battlefield, but NATO expects them to eventually rebuild, emerging as a \"dangerous\" challenge, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nVice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, said there is no \"clear and immediate military threat\" from Russia in the north right now. But, he warned, Moscow has plans to rebuild and expand their military once the fight in Ukraine ends.\n\n\"We are preparing for a more dangerous Russia,\" he said, adding that NATO needs to use this time well and make preparations.\n\nArctic security has become an important issue for the NATO alliance in recent years, as Western officials have grown increasingly concerned about Russia's expanded military footprint in the strategic region.\n\nNATO leadership has called for greater investment in Arctic defense to counter Russian — and, more recently, Chinese — activity. Allied countries are increasingly taking steps to strengthen their posture in the High North, including through new deterrence operations.\n\nDespite rising tensions between Russia and NATO, an Arctic conflict does not appear imminent, as Moscow remains focused on its war in Ukraine — a campaign that has come at tremendous cost.\n\nRussia has pulled most of its forces from the strategic Kola Peninsula — a large swath of territory near Finland and a hub for its military and nuclear power in the Arctic — and sent them to Ukraine, where a lot of their troops have been killed in combat, Andersen said.\n\n\"Russia is bogged down in Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nExperts at the RAND Corporation, a US global policy think tank, said in a report this week that Russia's decision to deploy resources from the High North to Ukraine has ultimately led to \"the hollowing out of the country's Arctic-capable ground units.\"\n\n\"The conclusion of hostilities in Ukraine would allow Russia to reinvest in its military posture in the High North,\" they said.\n\nRussia's Arctic force presence has long been a concern for countries like Norway, where the threat is directly at their doorstep.\n\nIn the 2000s, Russia began returning to some Soviet-era Arctic bases, refurbishing airstrips and reopening facilities that had been closed during or after the Cold War, and in the late 2010s, Moscow launched more active submarine deployments from the Kola Peninsula, Andersen said.\n\nRussia has also deployed missile defense systems, increased its aerial and maritime patrols, and ramped up its military exercises, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank that tracks Arctic military activity.\n\nWhile Russia's Arctic forces have taken a beating in Ukraine, leaving it less prepared in the region, NATO military planners are still acutely aware that there is potential for conflict down the road and are prepping for such a scenario.\n\n\"We are now in a time where we have an opportunity to focus on strengthening ourselves,\" Andersen said.\n\nNATO allies are investing in technology and systems to help secure the Arctic, including additional surveillance capabilities, icebreakers, drones, satellites, and vehicles that can operate in the cold.\n\nAllies have also expanded their footprint and increased the scale of their exercises in the Arctic to familiarize soldiers with the harsh realities of fighting so far north, where temperatures can kill just as easily as the enemy, and supply lines are vast and fragmented.\n\nNext month, for instance, thousands of NATO troops will participate in the biennial Cold Response drills in northern Norway, which are designed to train soldiers for high-intensity combat operations in the Arctic. These would be crucial skills for Western forces if Russia eventually reinvests in its capabilities across the High North.\n\n\"You need to train here to be able to fight here,\" Andersen said. \"In practical terms, it is those troops who have that training and that equipment who are relevant in the Arctic.\"",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, three reporters from our data centers investigation preview the themes they're watching this year.",
    "fullText": "The data center boom crept up on America, and we were ready. Business Insider jumped on the topic nearly two years ago, and this past week we won a George Polk Award for our work, which included a first-of-its-kind interactive map of data centers across the country and a riveting video showing their impact.\n\nWe checked in with lead journalists on the package to get their take on what to watch in data centers this year.\n\nHannah Beckler, data centers' use of water and electricity to produce computing power for AI was a big part of your work. Looking ahead, what are the biggest concerns on that front?\n\nSo many questions remain: Will tech companies uphold commitments some have made to pay for grid infrastructure buildout? Will novel strategies to generate power on-site at data centers alleviate spiking electricity bills? Even if they do, would such an approach damage air quality? And how will communities safeguard precious and often finite drinking water as thirsty data centers are built nearby?\n\nDakin Campbell, the market loves the AI boom but also periodically signals a limited appetite for the massive spending to build these data centers. What are the key concerns on Wall Street right now?\n\nFrom my conversations with bankers and others in the financing game, Wall Street has two, maybe three, big questions.\n\nOne, how worried should we be about the circular deals in which the likes of Nvidia invest in the AI labs that then buy Nvidia chips? These deals may be boosting the market in a way that isn't sustainable.\n\nTwo, many of these data center deals are backstopped by Big Tech companies, which are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to build out data centers — spending that eventually needs to be made back. Any meaningful decline in the perceived creditworthiness of these companies could weigh on credit markets more broadly.\n\nAnd three, what is the state of bottlenecks in power, gas turbines, memory chips, and other inputs, and how might that slow construction? Time is money, and the longer it takes to build the data centers, the more expensive it's going to be.\n\nRobert Leslie, what do you plan to look into with satellite imagery?\n\nNewly released satellite imagery clearly shows the trends in data center build-out across the US. We hope to study the speed of construction as well as the size of data centers.\n\nWe can already see how vast some of these gigawatt-scale sites are, with Meta's \"Hyperion\" in Louisiana set to be larger than Central Park. High-resolution satellite images can also provide clues to help us calculate a data center's overall power usage.\n\nGiven the scale of these projects, I'm also looking into the impact these vast server factories are having on rural communities.\n\nThanks everyone! As always, any thoughts please reach me at eic@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "While some billionaires threaten to relocate over the threat of higher taxes, the Oracle of Omaha is proudly writing checks to the IRS — big ones.\n\nWarren Buffett has never been one to hide behind tax shelters or complain about what he owes Uncle Sam. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2024, the then-CEO — and who remains chairman — made a striking statement about corporate taxation. It wasn’t a political speech or a carefully rehearsed soundbite. It was vintage Buffett: straightforward, grounded, and backed by numbers that are hard to argue with.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nPut professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, he told the assembled shareholders, sent a check for over $5 billion to the U.S. federal government the previous year. And if just 800 other companies had done the same? “No other person in the United States would have had to pay a dime of federal taxes,” he said. “Whether income taxes, no Social Security taxes, no estate taxes — up and down the line.”\n\nIt was the kind of line that makes an arena full of shareholders applaud — not because it was rehearsed, but because it was true.\n\nBuffett has long been transparent about how he views the relationship between profitable companies and the government. At the meeting, he framed it in characteristically simple terms. “The federal government owns a part of the earnings of the business we make,\" he said. \"They don’t own the assets, but they own a percentage of the earnings. And they can change that percentage any year.”\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nThe current corporate tax rate sits at 21%, established under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But Buffett made clear he doesn’t expect that number to stay put. With the national deficit ballooning and political appetite for spending cuts remaining limited, he suggested that higher rates are “quite likely.” The government, he said, “may decide that someday they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large” and “may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we earn.”\n\nHis response to that possibility was remarkably unbothered: “We’ll pay it.”\n\nThere was no talk of restructuring, relocating, or lobbying for loopholes. Just a plainspoken acceptance that taxation is part of the deal — and one he considers fair.",

    "fullText": "Overdependence on chatbots is a growing problem, and though your boyfriend’s ADHD may be a factor, he needs to find the root of his anxiety\n\nMy boyfriend of eight years, who is 44, has ADHD and runs his own business. He’s always struggled with admin and mundane tasks, but AI has revolutionised how he works. Now I’m worried he can’t seem to do anything without AI. He is a heavy ChatGPT user and uses it even when there’s a better non-AI alternative (eg he’ll ask it for train times rather than using Trainline, even though it’s less accurate). He just got his ChatGPT Wrapped and he’s in the top 0.3% of users worldwide.\n\nI worry about his ability to think independently, as well as the environmental impact. I know it’s a useful tool for him at work, but he uses it for everything in life.\n\nI’m very aware I can come across as quite naggy, and his ADHD can make him obsessive. I’d love some advice on how to approach this with him .\n\nRunning a business can be stressful, and although your boyfriend’s ADHD may be a factor, I wonder if he is anxious anyway and if his use of AI is a symptom rather than the cause.\n\nI took your letter to consultant clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst Dr Stephen Blumenthal and Henry Shelford, CEO of ADHD UK.\n\nBlumenthal wondered if we are “on the verge of a new diagnostic category of ‘chatbot overdependence syndrome’ as we head into an age in which we become increasingly reliant on AI. When used judiciously, AI aids us, but it could have disastrous consequences if we become dependent on it and lose the capacity for ordinary functioning.\n\n“Someone with ADHD has a shorter attention span, difficulty focusing and a reduced capacity to plan and think ahead, so AI is a perfect fit, which is why it can be so helpful. The downside is that there is a greater propensity to become overdependent on it.”\n\nShelford wondered if your boyfriend was struggling anyway, and if the AI provided a useful “flotation aid”? “AI can take you down a rabbit hole,” he said, “but it can also support you and help you structure your thoughts, schedule stuff and get things done.”\n\nYour boyfriend’s use of AI seems to go beyond this. It’s as if he’s doubting himself, and that can be pernicious.\n\nBlumenthal says: “Problems arise when your use of AI goes beyond satisfying the problem you wish to resolve. It feels as if a relationship with it has started to develop, and you imbue it with human qualities, a projection of our own wishes and desires for validation and care.”\n\nWhat to do? You’re right not to nag, which rarely solves anything, because it just becomes noise. As with all tender and difficult conversations, pick your moment when you’re both calm.\n\nShelford recommended asking your boyfriend, “‘What are you getting out of it? Why is this tool such a big deal and what are the gaps it’s filling?’ Then look to see if there are better solutions or better ways to use it.”\n\nBlumenthal thought: “as with any overdependence syndrome, there first needs to be recognition that there is a problem. It’s easy to become critical of the person who’s struggling, but that’s only likely to cause them to withdraw further into dependency. The case must be made compassionately, recognising that being without the scaffold of ChatGPT probably feels like a threat.”\n\nThe good news is that, unlike the generation now growing up with AI, your boyfriend has a track record of functioning well without it. Hopefully he can be reminded of that and find a place where AI augments the abilities he already has. But it sounds as if he’s anxious and I think the cause has to be found so you can both move forward.\n\nEvery week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

    "description": "Marc Bowker, a small business owner, said Trump continues to cause uncertainty for small businesses after Supreme Court tariff ruling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marc Bowker, owner of Alter Ego Comics, a comic book shop in Lima, Ohio, after the Supreme Court overturned some of President Donald Trump's tariffs. This story has been edited for length a clarity.\n\nMy first reaction to the Supreme Court decision was, \"This is awesome and long overdue.\" The second was, \"Okay, what's next?\"\n\nThen I saw the president say there would now be a new 10% global tariff and that the Supreme Court justices who ruled against him are unpatriotic and unloyal. So it feels like this is going to drag on forever and ever until he gets his way. It's like death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\nI think there are more questions remaining than answers. I appreciate the Supreme Court siding with Americans and American businesses, but it feels like it's going to be a tug-of-war that may go on throughout this entire administration.\n\nThis administration has created a level of uncertainty in the small business landscape that I haven't seen in 23 years of owning my store.\n\nIn addition to being a small-business owner in America, I'm a consumer in America, so I'm paying more for everything that my family consumes, from food to physical products. It's a one-two punch for us.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet of every shipment that had a tariff charge, and as of today, we've paid over $12,000 since Trump started all of this.\n\nWe've had to pass on a percentage of that to our customers, and as a result, we've seen a slowdown in orders. Some are taking a wait-and-see mentality, or they just don't want to pay the extra fee.\n\nComics themselves — a lot of which are printed in Canada — have not been impacted by tariffs. But for me and for other comic book stores, action figures, board games, and comic book supplies, like storage items, are being impacted. Action figures account for about 65% of my shop's revenue, and they are made in China.\n\nA lot of these orders are made far in advance, too. We were being charged tariffs on items ordered in 2023 and 2024. There's stuff I need to order next week that ships in June of 2027. Is the tariff going to be 6%? Is it going to be zero? Is it going to be 100%? I have no idea.\n\nAs for the tariff costs small businesses have already paid, are we getting that back? Probably not. Are the corporations that paid the bulk of the tariffs going to be reimbursed? Where does that come from? I feel like this is just going to cause more paperwork, more red tape, more headaches. I don't know what the next step is.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, yes, there would be some reimbursement of the fees that all American businesses have had to pay. If I had to settle for something, it would be that, effective today, there are no more of these Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's hard to be excited about the Supreme Court ruling when, within hours, the White House says it's going to push back with more tariffs.\n\nThe administration is throwing so much at us every day that we can't make any progress. It's hard to see what the future will look like.\n\nI would hate to see this stretch on the next three years of the administration. It's going to take all this extra time that could be spent running our businesses and serving our customers, just trying to stop the government from getting its hands in our pockets.\n\nIt really feels like our elected officials are not listening to us. Historically, the Republican Party has been promoted as the party of business in the United States. If they truly were, they would be listening to constituents who are saying these tariffs are hurting our businesses.",

    "description": "A solo founder used AI to vibe code her website, cut 60-minute tasks to one-minute, and scale her coaching business without hiring employees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Christina Puder, a 35-year-old solo founder based in Madrid. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I took my side hustle full-time, I needed a website and accidentally fell into the world of building with AI.\n\nAfter trying an old website builder and failing, I hired a designer and an engineer part-time to do it. They were a bit slow, so while I was waiting, I tried using a suggested AI tool to build my website.\n\nI don't have funding or a technical background, so I made a free account with Lovable, an AI coding assistant. I started adding simple information about the website design, and all of a sudden, the AI platform built the entire landing page. That was my gateway into all the things AI can do.\n\nSometimes using AI feels like I'm working with the dumbest person I've ever met, but the word \"constraint\" very rarely enters my mind when I think about how AI is enabling me to run my business.\n\nFor about the last 10 years, I've been doing career coaching for product managers on the side of my full-time job. I went from zero clients to consistently having a full plate. In 2025, I decided to coach full-time.\n\nI knew I wanted to be bootstrapped, and hiring full-time employees was way too expensive. Part-time isn't ideal either because that's somebody who might not fully understand my business needs; it's not their main focus.\n\nBefore building my website, I was a casual AI user. I would go to ChatGPT for help with ideas, writing, and research. I don't have a background in tech, and because of that, I initially didn't think of AI as an enabler for my business. After building my website, I discovered how useful AI could be for both my webpage and the internal system of my business.\n\nWhen I tried building my website before using AI, I probably put in 30 or 40 hours, and it turned out so ugly and clunky. Then I started testing Loveable using five free credits a day. After seeing how fast the AI tool worked and how good it looked, I knew I'd be back the next day to keep building.\n\nWhen I first started using Lovable, I think the credits were correlated to the number of messages I sent. I discovered a hack after I sent a message with a single easy change request, and it cost me a credit. In the next message, I put six requests, and it did all six changes and only took one credit again.\n\nI think they've discovered that loophole. Now, credit usage seems more closely tied to the amount of power a request consumes. There are times I'm building, and I'm surprised because I won't realize I'm making such an expensive request.\n\nI'm not sure how many credits it took to build my whole website. It's definitely more than five, but someone could build a whole landing page with five credits. They could ask the AI tool to make a basic website with three sections and brand colors, and I think it would honestly only take two and a half credits.\n\nI switched to a paid account, and now I pay $20 a month for my subscription, which I don't think is that expensive. I get 100 credits a month, plus my five free credits every day that don't roll over.\n\nI've started to think of my AI tools as workers. I want to make sure I use them to their full capacity, which is why I always try to use the credits that don't roll over. It's the same as if I hired someone full-time: I'd want them to deliver high output every day.\n\nIf it's been a while since I've given my website backend some love, I'll write a prompt asking which areas of the code would most benefit from a refactor, and ask it to rank them. Then, based on how many of my five credits I have left, I'll tell it which areas to fix.\n\nOne service I offer is finding and applying to jobs for clients. Each client has very specific criteria for the kinds of jobs they want, and I would manually search for jobs that fit those criteria for each client.\n\nIt used to take me around 60 minutes a day per client just to manually find the right jobs to apply for. I built AI-driven automations that reduced search time to one minute. Getting 60 minutes a day back for each of my clients has been a massive scale unlock.\n\nI really didn't think it was possible.\n\nEvery once in a while, things break, or I hit bugs. There have been times when I'm building something, and I spend 40 credits trying to fix it. After a while, I'll ask the AI to completely remove the feature we're working on because we've hit a bug. I'll tell them that instead of continuing to try to dig our way out, we're just going to start from scratch.\n\nThere was once an issue with some logos on my website. I tried and tried to prompt it to make them all look the same size together, but it wouldn't do it. I eventually went back to my part-time engineer and asked them to fix it.\n\nEvery once in a while, I go back to that engineer and just pay him to fix one or two specific things that I can't get done.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "description": "America's supply-chain bosses are experiencing a fresh bout of uncertainty after Friday's tariff ruling by the Supreme Court.",
    "fullText": "Friday's tariff ruling has once again put America's supply-chain bosses in a bind.\n\nMany made strategic changes after the levies were announced last year, and the new ruling — plus Trump's strong reaction to it — are now clouding their path forward. With the commander in chief fighting back, COOs must decide whether to proceed as if the court's decision is impenetrable or wait to see if the White House can successfully keep the tariffs intact.\n\n\"Tariffs are written in DC, and they're felt in the COO's inbox,\" Jason Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, told Business Insider. \"It's kind of an impossible job.\"\n\nIn a news conference held shortly after the ruling, Trump lashed out at the court's justices who sided against him, saying they should be \"absolutely ashamed\" and accusing them, without evidence, of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He also said \"alternatives\" would be used to preserve his trade agenda and that he'd tap a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of existing tariffs.\n\n\"President Trump has been abundantly clear: Tariffs are here to stay, and the America Last era of American workers being ripped off is over,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to maintain President Trump's America First trade and economic agenda while continuing to implement a pro-growth agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance.\"\n\nTrump's alternative was announced Friday night. Trump signed a proclamation that would implement a temporary 10% import surcharge for 150 days, starting on February 24, under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The executive order also carved out exemptions for certain categories, including critical minerals and some agricultural products.\n\nAny strategies Trump deploys will likely face legal and other hurdles that could take months to resolve, said Schloetzer. In the meantime, \"COOs will just press the pause button\" on decisions involving sourcing, factory locations, labor, and other expenses, he added.\n\nMany companies are still grappling with the impact of actions they took last year to cope with Trump's tariff hikes, said Rob Lalka, who teaches entrepreneurship at Tulane University.\n\nFor example, he said that some companies responded by raising prices on consumer goods, which in turn affected people's spending habits and opinions of those businesses.\n\n\"That disruption is something you can't reverse,\" he said.\n\nNow, with the fate of Trump's tariffs up in the air, COOs are experiencing the kind of whiplash that can be debilitating, said Lalka, especially for those at startups and small businesses with limited resources.\n\n\"They're the ones who are often working with the thinnest margins,\" he said.\n\nFriday's ruling could also benefit companies financially through refunds. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government illegally collected more than $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nYet while business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision, Trump administration officials have suggested that issuing refunds would be a messy process.\n\nFor now, the burden of figuring out how to keep operations humming will fall largely on COOs, said Schloetzer.\n\n\"CEOs can always focus on talking about long-term strategies, and CFOs can focus on modeling what these things might mean for margins,\" he said. \"But COOs actually have to be the ones in the short-term that are delivering.\"\n\nThose in manufacturing have it particularly bad, he added, because such companies may need to move components across multiple countries.\n\n\"It really is difficult to think through what the margin implications would be,\" said Schloetzer. \"They've got to just be pulling their hair out.\"\n\nBrian Smith, COO of Omni Containment Systems, an Elgin, Illinois, manufacturer of HVAC cleaning systems, is feeling the heat.\n\n\"It's very frustrating … because of the journey that we just went on for one year in altering our import-export strategies,\" he said.\n\nOmni, which imports goods from Spain and exports to Canada, lost sales last year due to the Trump administration's tariffs, Smith said. The company managed, however, and Smith said he thought \"things had kind of stabilized\" in recent months.\n\n\"This will take us right back to where we were in the first and second quarter of last year, which was complete uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nSmith added that it's hard to know how this will play out with suppliers and buyers.\n\n\"We're going to have to have some conversations with our larger customers who buy multiple machines and discuss what influence this is going to have,\" he said.\n\nAnother unknown he's wrestling with is whether a refund is headed Omni's way for the tariffs the company has paid to date.\n\n\"What are they going to do with all the money they collected?\" said Smith of the payments that the federal government illegally collected from US businesses, per the Supreme Court's decision. \"If they could just answer that question, it would be helpful either way.\"",

    "title": "Supplements are the new obsession, even as doctors stay wary. I went inside one of the industry's biggest factories.",
    "description": "Business Insider visited Thorne's supplement factory where creatine, electrolytes, and magnesium were being tested and shipped.",
    "fullText": "As soon as I stepped inside the supplement factory, the sweet smell of red berries filled the air. It reminded me of being a kid and gorging on chewable multivitamins — a not-quite-natural \"mixed berry\" scent that was both nostalgic and vaguely medicinal. As factory tour smells go, it could have been much worse.\n\nInside Thorne's headquarters, raw materials from around the world were arriving by the pallet. Under the neon lights of a giant, temperature-controlled warehouse outside Charleston, South Carolina, forklifts hummed and beeped as they stacked ingredients on towering shelves.\n\nIn here, it's always 70 degrees and dialed in to a moderate 60% humidity level. The relief stepping in from the muggy southern heat outside was immediate.\n\nI saw pallets of creatine monohydrate, long popular with bodybuilders for improving strength, speed, and recovery. Indian barberry — the source of berberine, which influencers sometimes call \"nature's Ozempic\" — was also being stocked. (It's not actually comparable to GLP-1 drugs.) Flavoring agents destined to become mango limeade or blood orange electrolytes sat quarantined until they could be cleared for use. Workers in full-body suits moved between sealed mixing rooms where air pressure kept outside dust out. No perfume. No open-toed shoes. No mistakes.\n\nFacilities like this one are increasingly common. The supplement industry has been quietly expanding its manufacturing footprint across the US, racing to meet demand that surged during the pandemic and has never slowed. Thorne's newest warehouse, which opened in 2023 and doubled its manufacturing capacity to 549,000 square feet — about six football fields — is a monument to the supplement boom. The company poured $35 million into expansion after moving from a small-town Idaho factory to this suburban South Carolina location.\n\nConsumers are clamoring for supplements and daily powders, fueled by influencers, personalized medicine, and a fast-growing online market for both peptides and supplements that's racing ahead of regulation and bypassing doctors' recommendations. The doctors and experts I've spoken with don't dismiss supplements outright, but they warn the market is a minefield — one that patients are navigating largely on their own.\n\nThe global supplement market is now estimated at $100 to $200 billion and is growing rapidly, with the US accounting for about one-fifth of worldwide demand. Once considered to exist only on the fringes of medical care, \"stacks\" of supplements have now become daily rituals for millions of Americans.\n\nBefore the pandemic, around 58% of US adults reported taking some kind of supplement. Today, that number is closer to 75%, according to industry estimates. Online sales are taking over. The Nutrition Business Journal's 2025 report cited annual growth of over 10% in online supplement sales, even as other pandemic-era e-commerce trends have cooled.\n\n\"It's just been an explosion of people being like, 'I should probably pay attention to my health a little bit more and think about it proactively and take it a little more into my own hands,'\" Nathan Price, Thorne's chief science officer, told Business Insider from his office near Silicon Valley.\n\nThe pandemic didn't just trigger interest in immunity-boosting and hygiene; it fundamentally changed how people think about their health and what they can do to improve it. Wellness culture — especially nutrition, fitness, and longevity — moved from the margins to the mainstream.\n\nThere are many reasons for this shift. A bloated American \"sick care\" system that no one feels is working well. Growing distrust of one-size-fits-all medical advice. Doctors pressed for time with patients. The rise of direct-to-consumer lab tests that sample blood, spit, urine, and other substances from the body, promising to tell you exactly which pills, potions, and microbiome supplies you need to feel your best.\n\nI'm not immune to the trend. About a year and a half ago, I did some testing at a high-end longevity clinic as part of a reporting trip and discovered I was magnesium-deficient. Now, I take a pill or two every day — not because a doctor prescribed it, but because a gargantuan 12-vial blood test led me to understand that it would be a good idea.\n\nOther than a little increase in morning (ahem) regularity, I don't notice much difference, but my levels are back in range — which suggests it's doing something, even if I can't feel it. My doctor said she thought my dosage seemed a little high, but shrugged it off and said, \"If you want to, it's fine,\" given my normal-looking bloodwork.\n\nA decade ago, there was no way to get Thorne's supplements outside a doctor or healthcare practitioner. Today, consumers are no longer content with a one-size-fits-all multivitamin. Many track their sleep, heart rate, and workouts on smart devices, then feed that data into apps or AI tools to create personalized supplement \"stacks.\" Podcasts and influencers amplify new studies — sometimes responsibly, sometimes not.\n\nNow that you can get the product with just a tap of your smartphone, Thorne's marketing has followed suit. Whether it's sports, beauty, or wellness, there's a good chance someone you follow has touted a Thorne supplement. Model Karlie Kloss, tennis player Ben Shelton, Chris Hemsworth's trainer, Da Rulk, Dwayne Wade, and Ciara have all been featured in ads or promoted the brand on social media.\n\nThis is not the same company that founder Al Czap started in 1984. A former supplement salesman, he started the company after seeing the poor state of industry manufacturing standards. He thought there were too many additives, too many hidden ingredients, too much messy manufacturing, creating ineffective, or worse, dangerous products.\n\nSo, he started to make his own. He built a successful business selling directly to doctors, bypassing stores and advertising entirely, establishing a brand based on quality and clean manufacturing.\n\n\"I was dealing with physicians who knew nutritional medicine, and they would bring the patient in, and they would look at their blood pattern. They would look at doing urinalysis. They would get the symptoms, and they would say, 'Alright, I've had success with this product, and I would like you to take this product,'\" Czap told me about the early days of Thorne.\n\nCzap stepped down as CEO in 2010, and after that, the company went through a period of rapid commercialization and expansion, first with Czap remaining as a shareholder and consultant, and later with private equity firm L Catterton taking full control. Over the years, Thorne developed flashier packaging, built an online presence, and launched consumer-facing blogs before starting to sell directly to consumers in 2018. They didn't know it then, but soon they'd be in prime position to ship out supplements directly to consumers during the pandemic. A highly absorbable form of zinc, called zinc picolinate, was Thorne's big seller during lockdown, as shoppers scrambled to pick up anything that might boost their immunity.\n\nSome of the biggest names in the wellness space, including controversial wellness giants Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, have mentioned Thorne by name, noting the brand's reputation for quality, even though Thorne is far from the largest player in the game. It's dwarfed by supplement giants including Nature Made, Nature's Bounty, Nestlé's Garden of Life, and Bayer's One A Day.\n\nInfluencer endorsements are big, especially in supplements, where it's nearly impossible to know exactly what you're getting. Unlike pharmaceuticals, supplements are not approved by the FDA before they hit shelves.\n\nUnder a 1994 law, manufacturers are largely responsible for ensuring their own products are safe and accurately labeled. The FDA does show up to inspect supplement makers — Thorne is quick to point this out — but those inspections aren't mandatory or regularly scheduled, they're mere retroactive checks on manufacturing and labeling. That regulatory gap has allowed innovation to flourish. It has also led to mislabeling, contamination, and exaggerated claims across the industry. Sometimes, the FDA only shows up after people complain about a brand or get sick.\n\nThis is where Thorne says it's eager to differentiate itself. Every product at the factory undergoes four rounds of testing, they say again and again. During my tour, I see miniature metal detectors screening raw materials and finished capsules coming off the line, checking repeatedly for heavy metals inside the pills. Refrigerators and heaters churn with finished pill bottles inside, testing to ensure the finished products remain stable across various climates. I'm introduced to lab workers in white coats and goggles who are uncapping products and spooning out scoops of powder to test for microbial contamination and potency.\n\nAt times, it feels excessive, but in an industry where trust is fragile, that redundancy is part of the brand ethos, Price said.\n\n\"We position as a premium brand, but to maintain that reputation, we're very strict,\" he added. \"The fact that we do [test] repeatedly just draws the probability of us having a negative to be very, very small. It's a trade-off.\"\n\nWhen I asked about his thoughts on the company's current standards, Czap is pleased that quality control remains paramount. \"Kudos to them because they didn't screw it up,\" he told me, adding he still gets his own supplements from Thorne.\n\nIt seems customers are taking notice, too. One of Thorne's most popular products, creatine, had more than 12,700 5-star reviews on Amazon at the time of publication, with hundreds of customers commenting on its high quality and dissolvability.\n\nEven if a product is safe, some consumers will overdo it. A woman in New Jersey, seeking inflammation and joint pain relief, recently suffered liver damage after she followed the advice of a person who said they were a doctor on social media and recommended a monster 10x dose of turmeric every day. (It's not clear what brand of turmeric supplement she was using.)\n\nOn top of consumer misuse, numerous studies show that most supplements don't accurately contain what they say on the label. Certain additives deemed \"incidental\" may not be listed at all. The FDA has even found prescription drugs like blood thinners, typically used to help prevent strokes and heart attacks, and anticonvulsants, prescribed for seizures and neuropathic pain, masquerading as \"supplements.\" It's a mess.\n\nThe doctors and longevity experts I've spoken with aren't categorically opposed to supplements. Still, many resent what a minefield it can be picking out the right products for the right person. Most agree that consumers shouldn't do this on their own, with no guardrails.\n\n\"I struggle with the supplement industry, not because I don't believe that some supplements have value, some certainly do, but I just feel like the incentive structures are all geared toward forcing companies, individuals, people in that industry who are marketing supplements to be dishonest,\" said Matt Kaeberlein, a scientist who studies the biological mechanisms of aging, and who recently cofounded Optispan, a longevity healthcare company.\n\nDr. Haleem Mohammed, the Chief Medical Officer at Gameday Men's Health, where he focuses on hormonal health, said he often sees patients get \"burned\" by inflated influencer claims on social media.\n\n\"The supplement brands and supplement shillers and influencers can make any sort of claims they want, whether it's performance, fat loss, libido,\" he said. \"They're not formulating, testing, verifying anything. They're out there cherry-picking studies. They're using animal data that's stretched into human claims.\"\n\nThere's one supplement, in particular, that's now a bestseller across demographics. Inside Thorne's facility, creatine is everywhere. Arriving by the pallet and showing up in cart after cart, being prepared to ship to a customer's doorstep.\n\n\"Creatine is the overnight sensation, even though it's been around forever,\" said Ken Rowe, Thorne's chief R&D officer, and a former VP at Nestlé.\n\nOnce a staple in gym lockers, it's now gaining steam as a longevity aid, cognitive enhancer, and everyday health hack. It's one of the most well-studied supplements, with decades of research — something supplement proponents, like Price, are keen to mention.\n\n\"There's some evidence now that 5 grams kind of saturates up your muscles, but if you go to 10 grams, there's this notion that some of that overflow actually goes into the brain,\" Price said.\n\nPeople are especially thrilled by a 20-person study with no placebo arm. It was designed to test safety, not efficacy, though it showed marginal benefits that still need confirmation in larger, placebo-controlled trials. Already, word has traveled that it works.\n\n\"I'm looking at an article online right now: 'Creatine shows potential to boost cognition.' That's not what they were saying,\" Dr. Nathaniel Chin, medical director for the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, said. \"They were just saying, 'This is feasible. People could take this. We should study this. We should see if this helps people in the long run,' which I'm excited about.\"\n\nNearby, in Thorne's testing labs, new flavors and formulations are already in development. Before we can lift the camera to take photos, workers quickly flip the labels on jars so we can't see the names of these not-yet-for-sale products, including two flavored versions of Thorne's creatine that it has since released: strawberry and pineapple-orange.\n\nCreatine is the industry standout star for now — with a forecasted compound annual growth rate of around 20-30% in the US — but it's not the only one. Women's health, gut health, and sports performance are Thorne's biggest categories, Rowe said.\n\nMagnesium, fish oil, curcumin (the anti-inflammatory compound in turmeric), prenatal vitamins, CoQ10, they are all here, buoyed by TikTok trends, podcast endorsements, and a broad obsession with longevity and performance.\n\nThere's a new \"advanced testosterone support\" product made with ashwaganda, jumping into the hype around hormone health. \"Even if people come in for creatine, then they find something else,\" Rowe said.\n\nDoctors fear many patients are overdoing it in this DIY-your-stack world. There's little concern for how these ingredients might interact with or counteract one another, or a prescription medication.\n\nLongevity experts and medical professionals recommend a more targeted approach to supplementation. Skip the blends and green powders, they say. Test for what you're deficient in, then add in supplements slowly, discuss your progress with your doctor, retest, and see how you feel along the way.\n\n\"If you're not testing before you're taking these supplements, you may just be taking expensive pee, especially when it's water-soluble vitamins,\" Mohammed, the men's health practitioner, said.\n\nBased on his own lab work and expertise, his current \"stack\" includes creatine, fish oil, Omega-3s, CoQ10, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D.\n\n\"A lot of times, patients are deficient in those,\" he said. \"But I believe in testing for those before you just start willy-nilly telling people, 'Hey, take a multivitamin.'\"\n\nIf you're going to do one thing for your longevity, doctors consistently say to prioritize exercise. Then start incorporating fresh, nutrient-dense foods like vegetables and fish into your diet before taking pills.\n\n\"If you would spend this money on a gym that you thought would get you moving, I would rather that,\" Chin said.\n\nAs a perk, Thorne workers get to take home the supplements they make — with a monthly allotment of products, free of charge. The idea is that this is great quality control. Amy Caplette, Thorne's SVP of Quality & Regulatory Affairs, told me that if it's not good enough to serve your family, it shouldn't be coming off the line.\n\n\"Rather than suggesting a standard 'stack,' we encourage employees to make informed choices based on their own goals, lifestyles, and health considerations, with expert support available when helpful,\" the company said in a statement to Business Insider, after our tour.\n\nDoctors say that while that's probably not an unsafe strategy, it's not exactly optimal in a sector where influencers are often the loudest voices.\n\n\"It always comes back to the influencers and these certain celebrity doctors saying that traditional medicine has abandoned you. We have the solution,\" Mohammed said.\n\nChin said he understands the impulse to boost. He throws a little turmeric in his morning coffee, thinking of it as a mild anti-inflammatory. He pops a multivitamin, hoping to refill any dietary deficiencies.\n\nI left the factory with some creatine samples, plus a berry-flavored amino acid powder, and electrolyte packets. The electrolytes were delicious, and I quickly reached for them on hot, busy days when I felt my hydration lagging.\n\nBut the other supplements have been sitting in the kitchen pantry ever since. Do I really need them? Would daily creatine help, or would it just make my muscles a little rounder? It all feels so marginal. For now, I'll stick to working out.",

    "title": "Kansas City moved to close a downtown nuisance business. It hasn’t worked | Opinion",
    "description": "Five months after being labeled a nuisance, Downtown Market at 11th and Grand remains open despite city orders and an eviction. From David Hudnall:",
    "fullText": "For a business that was supposed to be on the brink of closure, Downtown Market is doing a brisk trade.\n\nFive months after the city labeled it a nuisance and the landlord moved to evict, the lights are on at 1103 Grand. The beer coolers hum. The liquor selection remains vast. The counter display still includes synthetic urine kits for anyone looking to game a drug test. Step outside the market, and you won’t struggle to find a sidewalk entrepreneur selling some of the substances those tests are meant to detect.\n\n“We’re still seeing all the same activity, dealing with all the same problems,” said Jason Swords, one of the owners of The Grand, a high-rise a few doors down. “We still find bottles of alcohol all over the place on the sidewalks every morning. There are vagrants everywhere. We still see people hiding in the alleyways, peeing on the sidewalks.”\n\nIt has not been for want of effort from those with authority to intervene.\n\nIn September, Public Safety Director Lace Cline sent Downtown Market a cease and desist letter giving the store 10 days to correct conditions the city said enabled “unrelenting, open, and notorious drug activity and public intoxication.” The letter cited 184 calls for service over two years — 101 of them disturbances — and referenced a January 2025 shooting inside the store.\n\nTwo months later, the building’s owner took the matter to Jackson County court. The Alexander Company, which owns the 16-story Professional Building where Downtown Market occupies the ground floor, filed suit seeking to give Downtown Market the boot. The landlord says it sent a notice of default in October, gave the tenant time to address multiple violations, then terminated the lease when it concluded the problems continued. It has asked a judge for possession of the space and back rent while the case plays out.\n\nThe city and the landlord have the same gripe: The lease envisioned something more like a grocery store for on-the-go downtown dwellers and workers. The operation on the ground moves mostly booze and attracts loose characters that have turned the block into something resembling a skid row.\n\nShawn Choudry, part of the management team that owns Downtown Market, has a different version of the story: This is a city problem, not a Downtown Market problem.\n\n“Downtown Market didn’t get 184 calls for service,” Choudry told me back in the fall. “This area did. The problems come from outside our store, not inside.”\n\nChoudry said this week that he preferred to let his countersuit against The Alexander Company do the talking for now. That complaint, filed in January, says the market’s owners poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into renovating the space and that its mix of groceries, alcohol and tobacco was approved from the start. It argues that, contrary to the landlord’s allegations, alcohol makes up less than half of sales and that much of the activity cited by the city happens at the bus stop across the street. It accuses the landlord of using the city’s nuisance designation as leverage to push them out of a long-term lease.\n\nThis fight probably burns hotter because of where it sits. The corner of 11th and Grand is a few blocks from the Power & Light District and T-Mobile Center, adjacent to the city’s financial district, and next door to the Ambassador Hotel. It is a part of downtown that’s supposed to feel stable and safe, a stretch of street the city will be showing off to visitors with the World Cup on the horizon.\n\nSwords and his investors at The Grand have been saying for months that the disorder around their building is bleeding into their balance sheet. They’ve asked PIEA, the city’s Planned Industrial Expansion Authority, for additional tax relief, arguing that shootings, street activity and constant repairs have made their $69 million investment increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nPIEA hasn’t taken up that request yet; chair Tom Porto told me this week that he expects it to come before the board later this spring. I imagine Kansas City Public Schools and other taxing jurisdictions that would forgo revenue in such a deal are unlikely to shrug quietly at the prospect of extending further relief to a project already enjoying a substantial tax break.\n\nSwords said he has noticed a stronger police presence in recent months. He credits officers for spending more time on the block and the city for trying to take action against Downtown Market, even if the day-to-day street scene still looks familiar to him.\n\nOn my own drop-ins over the past few months, the store does appear to be on slightly better behavior. The supply of kratom products and other “gas station drugs” has been cleared out, and I’m not seeing loosies or airplane bottles moving across the counter.\n\nHis complaints are backed up by the call data regardless. I asked KCPD for calls to service to the address since the cease and desist went out in September. Between late August and mid-February, police logged 215 calls — including most commonly disturbances (69), followed by advice or non-emergency calls (56). At least 10 incidents involved weapons, and more than 40 required fire or EMS response.\n\nI asked Mayor Quinton Lucas Wednesday where the city stands on the matter, and got a statement heavy on legal phrasing. The plain-English version reads something like: The city intends to keep citing and pushing for compliance while the landlord-tenant case works its way through court, and it hasn’t ruled out shutting the place down if conditions don’t improve. It has made a similar move at least once in recent years, when it closed an illegal nightclub on Prospect Avenue after a shooting.\n\nBut it remains hard to know how much the issue involves Downtown Market customers versus people who would be on that corner regardless. Closing Downtown Market might remove one piece of the puzzle. But the corner sits at the intersection of much bigger problems in the city: chronic homelessness, addiction and a mismanaged KCPD budget that has started to make sustained community policing feel like a luxury. One padlock won’t solve all that.",

    "description": "A founder explains how turning a personal needlepoint hobby into a modern brand led to over $10 million in sales and long-term growth.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Krista LeRay, founder and CEO of Penny Linn Designs. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first needlepoint project was in college. I moved from the Chicago suburbs to the University of Kentucky for college and remember feeling struck by how preppy everything was. Everyone had these needlepoint belts that they would wear. I wanted to immerse myself in the culture, so I decided to try needlepoint.\n\nA local needlepoint store showed me how to do the basic continental stitch, and that was that. I stitched in college but then didn't think about it for a while, until my then-boyfriend (now husband) started talking about a needlepoint belt, and I said I could make him one.\n\nThen I stitched a ringbearer pillow for our wedding in 2019, and really fell back in love with the hobby. But I couldn't find the things I wanted to stitch in stores. It all felt older to me, so when the pandemic hit in 2020, and I had extra time on my hands, I started painting my own canvases. Since then, I've grown Penny Linn Designs to over 10 million in sales.\n\nI worked for Major League Baseball after graduating from college in 2013, but also ran a successful blog on the side. Eventually, I started making more money from my blog than at my corporate job, and I began blogging full-time.\n\nI shared the canvas I painted with my followers. It was the green Ralph's Coffee cup. My followers started asking me if I could paint a canvas for them to stitch, and that's what led me down the path to starting Penny Linn.\n\nThings just sort of snowballed. By 2022, I was making as much as I was making from my blog, making needlepoint canvases. When I had my first son that year, I had been blogging for 10 years and had sort of hit my max with sharing my life online. It felt like a natural progression to turn my full attention to Penny Linn.\n\nThroughout my blogging experience, I dealt with a lot of negative comments and cattiness. It helped me build a thick skin, something that is definitely needed when running a business.\n\nI have a 24-hour rule about dealing with criticism. I try not to read things about myself online, but if I do, I always ask whether the comment is valid. If it's not, I can push the critique aside.\n\nIf it is, I give myself 24 hours to be upset about it. After that, I either move on or decide to make a change.\n\nI only want to invest in things I'm good at and feel confident in. It's tough, but you have to decide what you're standing firm on when you grow a business. For me, that means that Penny Linn doesn't offer finishing services for our needlepoint projects.\n\nI don't want to provide a product that isn't up to my standards, and right now I don't believe we're good enough to get there. That makes some people mad, but I know it's right for us.\n\nOne of the other things I do is hire people who are smarter than me for my team. I know I don't know everything, so I look to others to help guide me on things like accounting and legal issues.\n\nI always say that Penny Linn is for a stitcher by a stitcher. I'm the stitcher that I'm talking about. Everything we sell is something I'd want to make. For now, that means mainly smaller canvases.\n\nA lot of people coming to Penny Linn are needlepoint beginners, so the projects are easier to manage and less expensive than larger projects like Christmas stockings. As our customers continue to grow with us, we'll start offering bigger projects.\n\nNeedlepoint is a popular hobby now, and I definitely worry about whether its popularity will continue. But I always remind myself that things like embroidery and needlepoint have been around since the dawn of time. Once you're a needlepointer, you're one for life. I think people will always come back to it, and we'll continue to evolve.",

    "title": "From a tense corporate split to a viral photo: A timeline of Anthropic and OpenAI's budding rivalry",
    "description": "Once colleagues, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have nurtured one of AI's biggest rivalries.L",
    "fullText": "If you want to know one of the biggest rivalries in AI, just ask for a show of hands.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei provided what is sure to become an iconic image of their feud. The pair went viral for refusing to join hands as the rest of the world's tech leaders gathered for a moment of unity, sparked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nHere's a timeline of how Altman and Amodei went from colleagues to becoming the face of AI's Cold War.\n\nIn July 2015, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Altman, and a group of elite AI researchers all gathered at the swanky Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, California.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Musk had a falling out with then-Google CEO Larry Page. Weeks later, Musk, Altman, Amodei, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, and others discussed the formation of a new AI lab to ensure Google had a worthy competitor in the AI space. Musk invited Amodei, per tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz.\n\nTheir vision became OpenAI, though Amodei initially elected not to join the startup research lab. Roughly a year later, he changed his mind and joined OpenAI as \"Team Lead for AI Safety.\"\n\nAmodei quickly moved up the ranks at OpenAI. In September 2018, the startup named him its research director.\n\nAltman, who cofounded OpenAI while still serving as president of Y Combinator, began to devote more time to the startup.\n\nIn March 2019, Altman stepped down as YC's leader. He then became CEO of OpenAI and led the startup's pivot to a capped for-profit structure.\n\nIn November 2019, OpenAI released GPT-2, which Amodei played a major role in developing. A month later, OpenAI named Amodei as its Vice President of Research.\n\nIn June 2020, OpenAI began to show just how far the technology had come with the release of GPT-3, considered to be the first highly capable Large Language Model (LLM).\n\nAmodei told The New York Times that the model had \"this emergent quality.\" Independent researchers told the publication that GPT-3's capabilities surprised them, even as the model still showed signs of struggle.\n\nTo address safety concerns, OpenAI initially controlled access through a private beta.\n\nThe release of GPT-3 solidified OpenAI's standing, but behind the scenes, tensions were rising.\n\nThe rifts began when Amodei successfully lobbied to keep Greg Brockman, an OpenAI cofounder, off the team that developed GPT-3, according to Keach Hagey's biography of Altman, \"The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future.\"\n\nHagey wrote that Amodei's stunning power within OpenAI had started to ruffle feathers. Differences continued to escalate over Amodei's long-held views on safety, Hagey wrote, especially regarding slowing the pace of updates to prevent malicious uses of the AI models.\n\nAmodei told friends that he \"felt psychologically abused by Altman,\" Hagey wrote. Altman, in turn, was telling colleagues that the tension \"was making him hate his job.\"\n\nOn December 29, 2020, OpenAI made it official. Amodei was leaving, and a \"handful\" of other colleagues were leaving.\n\nAmodei has since suggested that his vision became incompatible with OpenAI's direction.\n\n\"It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision,\" Amodei told podcaster Lex Friedman in 2024, when asked why he left OpenAI.\n\nWith seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei founded Anthropic in early 2021. The group was extremely close and included Daniela Amodei, Dario's sister. Daniela Amodei later said the name was chosen to emphasize their company's focus on humans.\n\nOnly one of Anthropic's initial employees hadn't worked at OpenAI, according to AI Business.\n\nDespite starting from scratch, Amodei said that by the Summer of 2022, the company's chatbot, Claude, had finished training. Amodei said he was worried about what the release of a powerful AI could mean. Anthropic held off on a release.\n\n\"I suspect it was the right thing to do,\" Amodei told Time Magazine in 2024. \"But it's not totally clear-cut.\"\n\nMonths later, OpenAI released ChatGPT, kicking off the AI race and making Amodei's former employer a household name.\n\nAs Anthropic began to establish itself in its own right, Amodei began to use his public appearances to take what were widely viewed as implicit shots at OpenAI.\n\nDuring an appearance at a Bloomberg event, Amodei noted how Anthropic had kept its leadership intact.\n\n\"We have 7 cofounders,\" he said, Gizmodo reported. \"Three and a half years later, we're all still at the company.\"\n\nWhile never calling out by name, OpenAI was experiencing upheaval at the time. Months earlier, Andrej Karpathy, an OpenAI cofounder, had left the company. And in November 2023, Altman was briefly pushed out of OpenAI, an effort fellow cofounder Ilya Sutskever assisted. (Sutskever later expressed regret over his role. He formally left OpenAI just days after Amodei's jab, though there had been months of speculation surrounding Sutskever's standing.)\n\nJournalist Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Amodei about OpenAI's decision to declare a \"code red\" to marshal resources for ChatGPT amid Google's rising strength.\n\nWe have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds,\" Amodei told Sorkin during an appearance at The New York Times' DealBook summit.\n\nEarlier in their conversation, Amodei appeared to take another swipe at Altman when he talked about some players \"who are YOLOing\" by making too risky bets on future demand based on their current revenue.\n\n\"Who is YOLOing?\" Sorkin asked.\n\n\"I'm not going to answer that,\" Amodei replied.\n\nA who's who of AI and tech elite gathered in India for a major summit on artificial intelligence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the opportunity to orchestrate a classic image of unity: competing CEOs with their hands raised together. (It's something Modi has done before with other world leaders, and politicians have been doing forever.)\n\nModi almost got his moment. While Altman held the prime minister's hand, the OpenAI CEO didn't grasp Amodei's hand, who was positioned to his other side. Amodei grasped the hand of the other person next to him, but not Altman's.\n\nThe internet, predictably, had a field day. And the world got a perfect encapsulation of one of AI's bitter rivalries.",

    "title": "PwC engineers built an AI agent to tackle the corporate world's least sexy task: spreadsheets",
    "description": "When tech exec Matt Wood arrived at PwC, he found that massive spreadsheets were \"all anybody was working on.\"",
    "fullText": "The real way to judge a company's AI expertise isn't in the flashy headlines, but by looking at the \"unsexy\" work rolling out behind the scenes, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US commercial technology and innovation officer, told Business Insider.\n\nIf Wood's theory holds — that real AI prowess shows up in unglamorous advances — PwC's latest launch is certainly notable. After all, what could be less sexy than spreadsheets?\n\nThe Big Four firm announced this week that it has developed a \"frontier AI agent\" capable of reasoning over vast, enterprise-grade spreadsheets — something that conventional AI systems struggle with because of their complexity, size, and interdependencies.\n\nThe agent can understand and navigate spreadsheets, mimicking \"how experienced practitioners work: scanning, searching, jumping across tabs, integrating charts and receipts, and reasoning,\" PwC said in a press release.\n\nWood, who joined PwC in 2024 from a role as vice president of AI at Amazon Web Services, said that when he started, he'd noticed the wraparound, ultra-wide monitors filled with spreadsheets: \"That's all anybody was working on,\" he said.\n\nBut these were not \"your school soccer team budget spreadsheet,\" said Wood. The spreadsheets that power large enterprises are enormously complex, often containing millions of cells, charts, graphs, images, receipts, and dozens of interlinked workbooks. \"They are more like financial engines than they are spreadsheets,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThese files often underpin business-critical decisions, yet PwC \"found that even today's modern AI was very poorly suited to managing these big enterprise spreadsheets,\" Wood said.\n\n\"They just kind of shrug and give up for want of a better word.\"\n\nCreating an AI capable of understanding and reasoning across large, complicated spreadsheet applications is what PwC's engineers set out to solve. Their solution was a \"genuine advance in the field,\" Wood said.\n\nThe agent has unlocked use cases across assurance, advisory, and tax, and boosts time saving on some tasks \"from literally days to hours,\" said Wood.\n\nHe gave the example of audit walkthroughs, where teams previously spent weeks manually gathering and validating evidence across numerous complex spreadsheets that existing AI tools couldn't handle.\n\nNow, users simply upload the files, and the frontier agent automatically maps their structure, extracts relevant data, and performs validation and consistency checks — tasks that would otherwise require combing through millions of rows by hand.\n\nThe result is faster meetings, less back-and-forth with clients, and cleaner, structured data ready for deeper AI-driven analysis, he said.\n\nPwC's AI spreadsheet agent was built in-house by engineers — a function the firm has been rapidly expanding as it shifts beyond the traditional roles associated with the Big Four.\n\nIn January, PwC launched a dedicated tech engineering career track to attract more technical talent, saying it wants to become \"a destination for top engineering talent.\"\n\nPreviously, the firm offered only consulting and accounting career paths. Wood told Business Insider that adding the engineering track is \"a signpost\" of its future plans.\n\nAt the same time, PwC is retraining non-technical employees. The US branch of the firm recently announced a companywide workplace learning strategy focused on knowledge sharing and on developing a mix of human and AI skills needed for the future.\n\nWood described the work engineers do at PwC as having two modes: \"transforming today\" and \"building for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe first focuses on improving current workflows — reducing back-and-forth with clients, increasing trust, and delivering work more efficiently. The second reimagines professional services from scratch: \"If you were to start from a blank piece of paper, what would professional services look like in an AI agent world?\" said Wood.\n\nPwC engineers also work directly on client engagements, building AI systems tailored to specific projects. For example, they help organizations reorganize and redesign their finance functions from the ground up using agents, Wood said.\n\nMany of the consulting industry's top players are pursuing similar investments in technical talent as AI reshapes the work they do.\n\nAccenture, already one of consulting's most technically sophisticated players, has added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global headcount.\n\nEY, another Big Four firm, has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "After filing for bankruptcy, closing dozens of locations, and facing mounting losses, a once-iconic seafood chain is now considering further restaurant shutdowns to stabilize its business and return to growth.\n\nFor many customers, the chain's financial troubles signaled the potential end of an era, taking along with it its Cheddar Bay Biscuits and the popular Endless Shrimp promotion. Instead, the company has spent the past two years fighting for a comeback, aiming to rebuild its brand and win back customers by restructuring operations and cutting costs.\n\nFor nearly 68 years, Red Lobster has built its reputation on offering affordable, high-quality seafood and has expanded to more than 500 locations worldwide. Yet the very strategy of premium offerings at low prices that fueled its growth eventually became too difficult to sustain.\n\nAfter shuttering around 130 restaurants during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring, Red Lobster is now reviewing its real estate portfolio and considering additional closures in 2026. The goal is to reduce costs and focus on higher-performing markets.\n\nMany of the chain's current challenges trace back to 2014, when the private equity firm Golden Gate Capital acquired Red Lobster from Darden Restaurants (DRI) for $2.1 billion. To help finance the deal, the company sold its real estate properties for $1.5 billion in a sale-leaseback transaction.\n\nWhile the move provided short-term liquidity, it left the chain paying substantial rent, increasing operational costs. By 2023, annual lease obligations had climbed to about $190.5 million, roughly 10% of its revenue, with more than $64 million tied to underperforming locations, according to the bankruptcy filing.\n\nRed Lobster ended 2024 with approximately 528 locations. However, some leases bundle multiple restaurants, making it difficult to close weaker stores without affecting stronger ones.\n\n\"Much of the liquidity from the sale-leaseback went toward paying dividends to private equity investors rather than addressing systemic operational issues or adapting the menu and brand to shifting market demands,\" wrote University of Pennsylvania Professor of Operations, Information & Decisions Gad Allon on Substack. \"This misallocation of resources underscores the risks of prioritizing short-term gains over strategic reinvestment.\"\n\nSince emerging from bankruptcy, Red Lobster has revamped its menu and marketing to better align with shifting consumer preferences and evolving trends.",

    "description": "Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024, but there’s a price.",
    "fullText": "A new analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute reveals that while aggressive trade policies implemented in 2025 have successfully driven a significant wedge between midsize American businesses and Chinese suppliers, the decoupling has come with a staggering price tag for U.S. companies.\n\nThe report, titled “Tracking international payments: How are midsize firms reacting to tariffs?” paints a picture of a business sector that is bending but not breaking under historic pressure. According to JPMorgan banking data on financial outflows of firms with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, the cost of importing goods has skyrocketed—and American companies are bearing the brunt.\n\nWhere are U.S. companies sourcing imports instead of China?\n\nHow much have tariff payments increased for midsize firms?\n\nWhat long-term risks do these trade policies pose?\n\nWhy are midsize firms particularly vulnerable to tariff impacts?\n\nWhile these companies scramble for alternative sources to Chinese manufacturing, they’re paying a big price on imports. Following the implementation of tariff rate increases and new universal tariffs in April 2025, monthly tariff payments by these midsize firms have tripled compared with early 2025 levels.\n\nIf the primary objective of the trade policy was to reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing, the banking giant’s data suggests the strategy is working. Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024.\n\nHowever, this retreat from China has not signaled a retreat from the global economy. Instead of reshoring operations entirely, American businesses appear to be engaging in a costly game of musical chairs.\n\nThe report finds that while payments to China fell, outflows to other regions—specifically Southeast Asia, Japan, and India—have accelerated. This evidence points to “import substitution,” where U.S. firms rush to find alternative suppliers in friendly nations to bypass the steepest levies placed on Beijing.\n\nThe JPMorgan researchers warn that while trade volumes have remained stable, the financial health of these companies may be at risk. Midsize firms are uniquely vulnerable; they are often too large to fly under the regulatory radar but “lack the scale to absorb sustained cost increases” compared with massive multinational corporations.\n\nThe burden of these new taxes has been particularly uneven. While the “universal tariffs” announced in April 2025 did capture new firms that previously paid no duties, the JPMorgan analysis found that the vast majority of the surge in government revenue came from firms that were already paying tariffs. Essentially, the policy has intensified the financial pressure on existing importers rather than spreading the cost widely across new players.",

    "description": "Walmart has steadily gained share from households earning over $100,000 who come for the savings and stay for the convenience — and AI is helping.",
    "fullText": "Walmart's former side hustle is getting serious.\n\nThe retail giant reported that 2025 was its first full year of profitability in its e-commerce operations, which started — as most ventures do — needing time and money to get rolling.\n\n\"We've far surpassed the breakeven level,\" CFO John David Rainey said of the e-commerce business in the company's fourth quarter earnings call Thursday. \"The momentum is only upward from here.\"\n\nThe bet is paying off thanks in large part to the addition of higher-income shoppers, who Walmart said are attracted to its combination of low prices and increasing convenience.\n\n\"The majority of our share gains came from households making more than $100,000,\" CEO John Furner said on the earnings call.\n\nThe company said high-earning households have responded favorably to Walmart's online and in-app offerings, from ordering their weekly groceries to picking out stylish new outfits, as has been the case for several quarters now.\n\nFor the fiscal year, Walmart's overall sales grew 4.7% to $713.2 billion, with e-commerce increasing by nearly 25% to top $150 billion.\n\nDespite Walmart's growth, e-commerce giant Amazon dethroned it as the world's largest company by revenue last year with $716.9 billion in revenue. The stock dipped immediately after the earnings report but recovered during trading on Thursday.\n\nBut Walmart's progress in e-commerce could give Amazon a run for its money, thanks to its physical proximity to 95% of US households.\n\n\"Stores are a huge part of the solution to deliver the customer experiences that the customers are looking for,\" CEO John Furner said on the call. \"Having the US with 5,200 locations between Walmart and Sam's, where inventory is forward-deployed, is really helpful.\"\n\nAmazon, for its part, is working hard to counter Walmart's dominant physical presence, which so far has given it an edge in delivering items like groceries and everyday essentials in an hour or less.\n\nIt's not just fresh food delivery that's helping Walmart reach new shoppers. Rainey said shoppers are using some of the savings from groceries to try new items from other categories.\n\n\"It's not just convenience,\" Rainey said. \"I'd argue fashion is not really a convenience item. It shows that our broader assortment is appealing to a much larger customer base.\"\n\nFashion not only led sales growth in general merchandise in the US, Rainey said, but on-trend styles are also helping draw in more of these high-income households, who wind up sticking around.\n\n\"They're coming to Walmart, in many cases, some of them for the first time, and they're enjoying an experience that makes them want to come back these platforms,\" he said.\n\nGlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders said his firm's data also shows wealthy households increasingly choosing Walmart for more than groceries, thanks to its expanded assortment and in-store experiences.\n\nIt's still too soon to see the impact of Walmart's recent AI partnerships, but Furner says the early results promise to turbocharge sales online and in-app. He said the company's in-house shopping assistant bot, Sparky, has led to 35% larger transaction totals.\n\n\"Roughly half of our app users have used Sparky, and when they use Sparky, it drives them to build bigger baskets,\" US segment CEO David Guggina said.\n\nWalmart still has a long road ahead to catch Amazon's online sales, but the past year has shown that it now has a powerful engine to get there.",

    "description": "Lauren Rose Kocher never worked full-time in the US, so her understanding of corporate culture was formed almost entirely in Japan.",
    "fullText": "Lauren Rose Kocher, now 39, grew up in Indiana and became fascinated with Japan as a kid.\n\nShe studied Japanese in college and has built her career — and started a family — in Japan.\n\nAs CEO of a Tokyo-based marketing agency, she's learned not to assume silence means satisfaction.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lauren Rose Kocher, 39, an American entrepreneur and CEO of Vegas PR Group in Tokyo. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in a small town in Indiana, but my interest in Japan started early. I still remember watching a \"Sesame Street\" episode where Big Bird visits Japan. That image stuck with me.\n\nIn college, that curiosity took shape: I studied Japanese at the University of Chicago and spent a summer in Hokkaido. After graduating, I moved to Japan in 2008 to teach English, though a career in teaching was never my goal.\n\nI wanted to work for a Japanese company and use the language skills I'd built in school. I'd never worked full-time in the US, so my understanding of corporate culture has been formed almost entirely in Japan.\n\nAfter teaching, I transitioned into corporate roles in Japanese companies. I spent three years as an assistant and international concert promoter before joining Sony Music's business development division for four years. I later became the cofounder and COO of a VC-funded ticketing platform.\n\nAfter nearly a decade inside corporate Japan, I stepped into senior leadership.\n\nNow, I'm the CEO and sole founder of Vegas PR Group, a Tokyo-based marketing agency focused on culture, the arts, music, and fashion. Our bilingual team of nine works across Japanese and international clients.\n\nSince 2024, I've also overseen two businesses founded by my late husband, a sandwich restaurant and a clothing brand.\n\nI plan to stay in Japan long-term. My two children are half-Japanese, and I value raising them here.\n\nJapanese business culture relies heavily on consensus-building, often through \"nemawashi,\" the process of privately aligning stakeholders before any formal decision is announced.\n\nFeedback is similarly indirect. Japanese teams are often hesitant to raise concerns openly, which means issues can remain unspoken until they surface all at once. Decision-making is cautious and risk-averse, and change tends to be incremental rather than dramatic.\n\nI've learned to factor this into timelines, particularly when working with Japanese clients who require internal alignment before moving forward. The people I hire tend to defy that stereotype and slot easily into our open, international culture.\n\nI wouldn't say my management style is particularly American, but my American communication style and entrepreneurial instinct certainly are. I try to respect local expectations, though I know my tendency to move quickly and take decisive swings has occasionally come across as abrasive in a culture where decisions are slow, and relationships are built with great caution.\n\nBecause all of my work is rooted in the Japanese market, I encourage international staff to follow Japanese work customs when dealing with local clients, while leaving room for each person to navigate what they're personally comfortable with.\n\nPunctuality is one example. In many countries, joining a Zoom call a minute or two late is inconsequential. In Japan, it's not. Logging in at 9:01 a.m. for a 9 a.m. meeting is considered late, and I enforce that expectation.\n\nThe same applies to in-person meetings, where arriving at least 10 minutes early is standard. When doing business in Japan, being on time is non-negotiable.\n\nMy leadership philosophy is rooted in servant leadership. I'm heavily invested in the success of the people I work with, and that approach has helped me build trust across Japanese and international teams.\n\nAs a white American woman in Japan, I'm perceived first as foreign. I'm also conscious of the privilege I carry. For anyone moving to Japan to lead a team, my advice is to be slow and deliberate.\n\nDeliver important news one-on-one before making major announcements. Don't expect clear or immediate feedback, and don't assume silence means satisfaction. It's also critical to respect people's attachment to their roles, hierarchies, and existing relationships, which hold significant weight in Japanese workplaces.\n\nI learned all of these lessons firsthand.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working abroad?

    "description": "GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen echoed Warren Buffett by calling out corporate bosses who collect big paychecks but shirk accountability.",
    "fullText": "Ryan Cohen seems to be doing his best Warren Buffett impression, just like Michael Burry suggested.\n\nThe billionaire GameStop CEO and Chewy cofounder channeled the legendary investor in a lengthy X post titled \"The Hollow Men\" on Wednesday.\n\nCohen railed against a \"new, parasitic class of corporate bureaucrat: The Risk-Free Insider.\"\n\nHe lambasted independent directors who don't dare rock the boat and risk losing their cushy, well-paid jobs.\n\nHe berated corporate bosses who balk at tying their fortunes to their company's success — they collect big bonuses if its stock price rises, and receive huge payouts if they tank the business and leave.\n\nHe also chastised managers who avoid accountability by hiring expensive consultants to blame if things don't work out.\n\nCohen labeled those three groups the \"hollow men of the boardroom\" who \"wear the right suits\" and \"say the right buzzwords\" but have little skin in the game.\n\nRisking your own bottom line is the \"only thing that keeps a business honest,\" Cohen wrote. He called for a return to an \"owner's mentality,\" where bosses treat shareholders' money as if it were their own.\n\nHe warned that failure to change would mean \"iconic American franchises hollowed out by fees, managed for the benefit of the Insiders, while the true owners — the shareholders — are left holding the bag.\"\n\nRyan has rougher edges than Buffett, but that just makes him more modern in approach. https://t.co/p0R06M2Ojr\n\nBurry shared Cohen's post and wrote: \"Ryan has rougher edges than Buffett, but that just makes him more modern in approach.\"\n\nThe investor-turned-writer of \"The Big Short\" fame and GameStop shareholder has been touting the opportunity for Cohen to transform GameStop through acquisitions, drawing parallels to how Buffett reshaped Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile mill into a $1 trillion conglomerate over six decades.\n\nBuffett, who recently stepped down as Berkshire's CEO, has frequently taken aim at crony directors, overpaid executives, and costly consultants.\n\nIn his shareholder letter for 2019, he bemoaned that many independent directors don't spend a penny of their own money on shares of the companies they're overseeing — and high fees heavily incentivize them to be compliant in the hope of landing additional, lucrative board seats.\n\n\"When seeking directors, CEOs don't look for pit bulls,\" Buffett wrote. \"It's the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.\"\n\nBuffett joked that he was the \"Typhoid Mary of compensation committees,\" as he'd only ever been appointed to one despite sitting on 18 different boards up to that point.\n\nTime and again, Buffett has espoused an owner's mentality, underpinned by having more than 99% of his net worth in Berkshire stock.\n\n\"We want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion,\" he and the late Charlie Munger wrote in their \"Owner's Manual\" for Berkshire shareholders.\n\n\"Moreover, when I do something dumb, I want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours,\" Buffett added.\n\nCohen has diverged from Buffett's playbook in some ways, such as buying bitcoin for GameStop last year, and recently agreeing a compensation package worth tens of billions if he hits certain market-value and profit milestones.\n\nBut he's also refused a salary as GameStop CEO, built a roughly 9% stake in the video-game retailer, urged frugality across the business, and even modeled its investor-relations website on Berkshire's homepage.\n\nCohen's tirade against the \"Risk-Free Insider\" is certainly rooted in Buffett's philosophy too, even if he's harsher in his wording as Burry said.",

    "description": "Richard Boccato turned his bartending career into a successful, multimillion-dollar ice business serving top NYC bars and restaurants.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Richard Boccato, owner and operator of Hundredweight Ice in Queens, New York City. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor years, I made my living bartending in New York City. I recognized early on that ice was perhaps the most important and overlooked ingredient in the modern cocktail.\n\nIf you're going to take measures to use fresh ingredients, squeeze your juice à la minute (just before serving), make your syrups in-house, procure the finest spirits, and then marry all of that to an inferior quality of frozen water, it would amount to a fool's errand in the glass, especially in exchange for top American dollar.\n\nThat said, never, at any point when I was bartending, would I have imagined that I would one day be a business owner of an ice company. My path to becoming an ice man began with a freezer full of rust-colored ice.\n\nWhile bartending at two of the best bars in New York City, I was fortunate to rise through the ranks enough that the owner of those bars asked me if I wanted to go into business with him and open a bar together. We called it Dutch Kills.\n\nWhen the day came to get ready to open Dutch Kills for the first time in 2009, I opened the chest freezer and saw a rust-colored, reddish-brown block of cloudy ice. The pipes coming into the building were not suitable for the quality of water that I wanted to serve, so instead I decided to source crystal-clear blocks of ice from a local ice sculptor.\n\nCustomers were immediately impressed by the opulence, beauty, and clarity of the sourced ice. Ultimately, we were making enough money as a business that it seemed viable to reinvest some of it in our own ice block maker.\n\nAt the time, though, I was only interested in making enough ice for our bar, not starting a business with it. By 2011, however, word had gotten around about the quality of our drinks, and a lot of bars were interested in obtaining ice from us.\n\nI didn't have the money or the infrastructure to launch a cocktail ice business, but I decided to do it anyway. I called it Hundredweight Ice.\n\nThe way that we used to make our ice is vastly different from how we make it today.\n\nIn the early days, it was me, Pedro, my first full-time employee, and Ian, my business partner, in the back of Dutch Kills, breaking down 300-pound blocks of crystal-clear ice with chainsaws and finishing the cubes by creasing all six sides with clothing irons to achieve smooth surfaces and clean edges.\n\nObviously, our techniques and practices weren't sophisticated at all in the beginning. If I had been an outsider walking into the storage room of that bar and saw the setup we were working with, I'd have thought, \"These people have no chance of survival.\"\n\nMany of my industry peers and former co-workers did, in fact, tell me that I was crazy for thinking this would ever work.\n\nOver the years, we kept making ice and the business kept growing. I had to stop bartending and focus my attention on the ice business. At a certain point, it dawned on me that I wasn't a full-time bartender anymore. I was an ice man now, and that was somewhat of a difficult and unexpected career transition to accept, but it was also very empowering because it meant we had succeeded in doing what we had set out to do.\n\nWe were forced to move the ice business back into the back house of Dutch Kills. We struggled from ruin to recovery, and toward the end of 2021, we broke ground on a new warehouse just a stone's throw from the old one, which is still where we make our ice today — having just expanded to an additional 3,000 square feet next door.\n\nWe now deliver ice to over 20 Michelin-starred restaurants, and our clients in New York City number in the triple digits.\n\nIn 2025, our revenue was close to $3 million, and we are on track to significantly surpass that in 2026, with projected revenue of $3.5 million.\n\nWe start our days between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and finish by about 3 p.m. We cut about 15,000 2-inch cubes of ice per day and harvest over 3 million pounds of ice each year.\n\nThe investment is tremendous, but necessary to achieve the final product. For example, the upfront costs for some of the equipment include:\n\nOne thing we're proud of is that we haven't raised our prices a penny since 2017. A 50-pack of 2-inch cubes sells for $30. Logo cubes average about $100 per pack.\n\nThe only reason this company exists is because we wanted to make our cocktails at Dutch Kills the best they could be. I didn't expect that it would turn into the business that it is now.",

    "fullText": "AI's impact is still largely unknown, but what's powering its rise is pretty clear.\n\nData centers are the backbone of artificial intelligence, and they are real-world evidence that businesses are betting big on the tech.\n\nAn AI project can rise and fall without many people noticing. A 50,000-square-foot data center that pops up in your neighborhood is a lot harder to ignore.\n\nIt's not just their sheer size that's tangible. The cost of these data centers, both economically and environmentally, is very real.\n\nThat's why Business Insider embarked on an investigation to better understand these data centers' impact. That work just earned us a very prestigious award.\n\nThe investigation was a full newsroom effort, with multiple reporters, editors, videographers, and designers chipping in. From environmental implications to complex financing to neighborhood drama, we covered the topic from all angles.\n\nWe've also got an incredible video and interactive map worth checking out.\n\nWinning an award doesn't mean our work is done.\n\nBig Tech companies keep ramping up their spending. Amazon and Alphabet recently announced plans to spend $200 billion and $185 billion, respectively, on AI infrastructure this year.\n\nNew states are also vying for data-center business, threatening traditional hubs like Northern Virginia.\n\nFinancing these deals is becoming increasingly complex and exotic, ranging from 100-year bonds to various types of securitization. In short, it's not just tech companies carrying the risk for these massive bets.\n\nYou can even include yourself in that group if you've noticed your utility bill went up recently.\n\nIt's still not entirely clear if these companies' AI efforts will eventually pay off. In the meantime, society is footing the bill.",

    "fullText": "I'm thrilled to share that Business Insider has won the George Polk Award for Environmental Reporting for The True Cost of Data Centers, an investigation that created the most comprehensive national database of data centers and revealed hidden costs of the AI boom.\n\nThe George Polk Awards, which honor original, resourceful, and thought-provoking investigative work, are widely considered among the most prestigious in journalism. The judges said Business Insider's investigation was \"a thoroughly researched series highlighting the strain new and semi-secret facilities that fuel artificial intelligence are likely to place on communities, diverting overwhelming amounts of power, water and economic support.\"\n\nThis is Business Insider's first Polk Award. It is a milestone for our newsroom as we focus our investigative chops on the most crucial subjects in business, and as we combine our extraordinary talents across text, data, visuals, video, and more to deliver world-class journalism.\n\nThe True Cost of Data Centers identified 1,240 data centers built or approved across the US by the end of 2024 — nearly four times the number from 2010 — and exposed an infrastructure transformation happening almost entirely in secret. By filing public records requests across every US state and winning lawsuits to obtain water consumption data, our team uncovered how these data centers together would consume as much power as entire US states and guzzle enormous amounts of water daily in drought-stricken regions.\n\nBusiness Insider's investigation included a first-of-its-kind interactive national map displaying all 1,240 data centers for readers to see how close the data center boom is to their own backyards. It also included a documentary video, \"Exposing The Dark Side of America's AI Data Center Explosion,\" which has been watched more than 5 million times.\n\nThe database has been shared with 23 universities, including Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, Yale, and Columbia, and has been cited in at least 15 policy briefs.\n\nI am incredibly proud of this team for the creativity, care, and persistence it took to make this investigation happen. The reporting team includes Hannah Beckler, Dakin Campbell, Daniel Geiger, Rosemarie Ho, Narimes Parakul, Adam Rogers, and Ellen Thomas, along with editors Jeffrey Cane, Rosalie Chan, Jason Dean, Esther Kaplan, and Jake Swearingen.\n\nOn video, credit to Erica Berenstein, Alexander Calbi, Paige Clark, Robert Leslie, Reem Makhoul, Tyler Merkel, Ruqayyah Moynihan, Marco Secci, and Whitney Shefte.

    "fullText": "Data analytics firm moves from Denver after about six years and joins host of businesses relocating to south Florida\n\nPalantir announced on Tuesday that it has moved its headquarters to Miami from Denver. The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.\n\nPalantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, Peter Thiel, announced on 31 December that he opened a Miami office for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with its CEO, Alex Karp, citing disagreements with the state’s values.\n\nPalantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of protest, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the UK’s National Health Service.\n\nColorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.\n\n“Colorado has rejected the values of Palantir – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.\n\nMany of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a billionaire tax. There has also been a concerted effort by the business leaders Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.\n\nPalantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees appear to be disturbed, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to Wired.\n\nJames Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had voiced the same position last month. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign Purge Palantir has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that the Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to donate more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.\n\nPalantir blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.",

    "description": "Perplexity, a San Francisco-based AI startup, emphasizes subscriptions and business sales, diverging from OpenAI's ad-centric approach.",
    "fullText": "Perplexity is going full steam ahead with subscriptions and business sales and plans to focus more on monetization than it has in the past, executives said at a roundtable with reporters on Monday.\n\nThe AI search startup, based in San Francisco, is the latest to publicly distance itself from putting ads in chatbot answers, with one executive saying it isn't exploring any ad deals at the moment. That's a contrast to OpenAI, which is going all in on ads, while arch-rival Anthropic has publicly touted the opposite.\n\nOne Perplexity executive said the startup is increasingly targeting large businesses. The company has only five people on its enterprise sales team and plans to ramp that up, the executive added. It also wants to serve high-powered users such as finance professionals, doctors, and CEOs.\n\nThe focus on selling to businesses positions Perplexity more directly as a competitor to startups like Glean, which lets employees search internal files and data more efficiently with AI.\n\nThe move comes amid some VC skepticism about Perplexity's prospects, with Silicon Valley investors voting it the company they'd most like to bet against in an informal poll at an AI conference last year, amid back-to-back funding rounds and talks of a wider AI bubble.\n\nPerplexity will focus more on revenue and revenue retention than on other metrics, such as the number of questions it answers, the executive said. Perplexity also pledged to keep allowing people to use the product for free, with rate limits.\n\nAt the roundtable, the company declined to share specific financials and shared that revenue grew 4.7 times last year. Perplexity generated over $150 million in annual recurring revenue by mid-last year, its head of communications Jesse Dwyer told Business Insider in August. It hit $200 million in ARR in October, Alex Heath of Sources reported.\n\nThe news comes after several months of the AI startup lying low, as Perplexity said in a press invite. The company's leaders said it was busy building and not focusing on AI-related drama.\n\nPerplexity had announced in 2024 that it would start experimenting with ads. That effort stalled, with the top ads leader, Taz Patel, quietly leaving last year. One consistent issue with ads in AI-generated answers is that users won't believe them, the Perplexity executive said.\n\nPerplexity also launched a product for enterprises in 2024 that uses internal and external data to generate research reports, among other features.",

    "description": "Lauren Rose Kocher never worked full-time in the US, so her understanding of corporate culture was formed almost entirely in Japan.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lauren Rose Kocher, 39, an American entrepreneur and CEO of Vegas PR Group in Tokyo. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in a small town in Indiana, but my interest in Japan started early. I still remember watching a \"Sesame Street\" episode where Big Bird visits Japan. That image stuck with me.\n\nIn college, that curiosity took shape: I studied Japanese at the University of Chicago and spent a summer in Hokkaido. After graduating, I moved to Japan in 2008 to teach English, though a career in teaching was never my goal.\n\nI wanted to work for a Japanese company and use the language skills I'd built in school. I'd never worked full-time in the US, so my understanding of corporate culture has been formed almost entirely in Japan.\n\nAfter teaching, I transitioned into corporate roles in Japanese companies. I spent three years as an assistant and international concert promoter before joining Sony Music's business development division for four years. I later became the cofounder and COO of a VC-funded ticketing platform.\n\nAfter nearly a decade inside corporate Japan, I stepped into senior leadership.\n\nNow, I'm the CEO and sole founder of Vegas PR Group, a Tokyo-based marketing agency focused on culture, the arts, music, and fashion. Our bilingual team of nine works across Japanese and international clients.\n\nSince 2024, I've also overseen two businesses founded by my late husband, a sandwich restaurant and a clothing brand.\n\nI plan to stay in Japan long-term. My two children are half-Japanese, and I value raising them here.\n\nJapanese business culture relies heavily on consensus-building, often through \"nemawashi,\" the process of privately aligning stakeholders before any formal decision is announced.\n\nFeedback is similarly indirect. Japanese teams are often hesitant to raise concerns openly, which means issues can remain unspoken until they surface all at once. Decision-making is cautious and risk-averse, and change tends to be incremental rather than dramatic.\n\nI've learned to factor this into timelines, particularly when working with Japanese clients who require internal alignment before moving forward. The people I hire tend to defy that stereotype and slot easily into our open, international culture.\n\nI wouldn't say my management style is particularly American, but my American communication style and entrepreneurial instinct certainly are. I try to respect local expectations, though I know my tendency to move quickly and take decisive swings has occasionally come across as abrasive in a culture where decisions are slow, and relationships are built with great caution.\n\nBecause all of my work is rooted in the Japanese market, I encourage international staff to follow Japanese work customs when dealing with local clients, while leaving room for each person to navigate what they're personally comfortable with.\n\nPunctuality is one example. In many countries, joining a Zoom call a minute or two late is inconsequential. In Japan, it's not. Logging in at 9:01 a.m. for a 9 a.m. meeting is considered late, and I enforce that expectation.\n\nThe same applies to in-person meetings, where arriving at least 10 minutes early is standard. When doing business in Japan, being on time is non-negotiable.\n\nMy leadership philosophy is rooted in servant leadership. I'm heavily invested in the success of the people I work with, and that approach has helped me build trust across Japanese and international teams.\n\nAs a white American woman in Japan, I'm perceived first as foreign. I'm also conscious of the privilege I carry. For anyone moving to Japan to lead a team, my advice is to be slow and deliberate.\n\nDeliver important news one-on-one before making major announcements. Don't expect clear or immediate feedback, and don't assume silence means satisfaction. It's also critical to respect people's attachment to their roles, hierarchies, and existing relationships, which hold significant weight in Japanese workplaces.\n\nI learned all of these lessons firsthand.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working abroad?

    "fullText": "A senior Pentagon official told Axios that Secy. Hegseth was “close” to cutting business ties with Anthropic due to CEO Dario Amodei’s concerns about some military uses of AI. “It’s the cost of doing business with this particular government,” says tech journalist Kara Swisher.\n\nAfter being traded twice and waived, the longtime NBA veteran is returning to the Timberwolves.\n\nCyber stocks are getting crushed by the \"AI scare trade.\" That may create a buying opportunity, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\n\nThe WNBA and the players union are still working to reach a deal on a new CBA before the season starts.\n\nAfter a 23-0 start to the season, things have gone downhill fast for Arizona.\n\nTuesday was a marquee day at the Milan Cortina Olympics as the women's figure skating competition got underway.\n\nNvidia and Meta are expanding their chip deal to include millions of more AI processors.\n\nThe reigning U.S. champion, Glenn arrived in Milan with hopes of winning an individual gold medal. Just two fateful seconds on the ice in the women's short program likely destroyed that dream this year, and she knew it the moment it happened.\n\nFederal Reserve governor Michael Barr said Tuesday that the boom in artificial intelligence \"is unlikely to be a reason for lowering policy rates,\" disputing the idea of AI as a productivity accelerator that puts the Fed on a rate-cutting path.\n\nThe Rockies, Padres, Giants, Astros and Phillies make up the bottom tier of our 2026 rankings.\n\nThe S&P 500 was on track for double-digit earnings growth, with more than half of companies having reported Q4 results so far.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Christina Jones, 40, the CEO of a nonprofit and management consulting firm based in Washington, DC. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy son, Xavier, less than a year old at the time, was fast asleep in his crib while I worked on a policy document as midnight approached.\n\nI was relatively new to my position at a Minnesota-based nonprofit that helps survivors of gender-based violence, and I wanted to demonstrate my value to the organization.\n\nIt was a shared document with other team members, so many could see that the timestamps indicated that I was revising it at 11 p.m.\n\nOne of my colleagues, a mom of teenagers, tried to coach me in a soft, gentle way. \"You don't need to be in here so late,\" she said. \"You need to get some rest.\"\n\nInstead of listening to her, I manipulated the system. I started setting my late-night emails to schedule-send so they arrived at 9 a.m. the next day.\n\nTriple-checking that the Ts were crossed and the Is were dotted was second nature to me. Women, especially Black women, are so often trying to prove ourselves because we want to show we belong.\n\nFor me, it goes back to my parents and community saying that we have to do twice as much to get half of what everyone else has.\n\nIt felt especially true for me in my 20s and early to mid-30s. I was ambitious and forging my legal career, including several years in the office of the attorney general for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe long hours and stress levels were OK for me because I was married without kids. Still, I continued in the same vein after I had Xavier, now 5, because I wanted to create so many things in my life and demonstrate my worthiness.\n\nThen my perspective changed. It took a vehicle collision involving my car and a tractor-trailer to make me reassess the situation.\n\nMy husband, Jason, two girlfriends, and I were driving to a restaurant on January 18, 2025, to celebrate my 39th birthday when it happened.\n\nThankfully, we were traveling at a low speed and emerged relatively unscathed with a few scratches. It was traumatic, but it might have been so much worse.\n\nThe experience scared me into thinking that I could have been taken out. The fact that it was my birthday made it particularly significant — a reminder that I only have one body and time is not infinite.\n\nI'd already been waffling about what to do about my current job for several months. Although it was interesting and challenging, I wondered whether I should start my own consultancy.\n\nFear had put me off. I earned six figures, my company paid 75% of my health insurance, and provided a 3% match to my retirement. The role was fully remote and offered other perks.\n\nI prayed a lot about it, asking God what I should do. It became very clear that I needed to listen, not sit on my dreams, and take this bet on myself.\n\nI needed buy-in from my husband, Jason, because it could have put our household at risk. Still, he and my mom were very supportive. \"What's the worst thing that can happen?\" they said. \"You're an attorney. You can go get another job if it doesn't work out.\"\n\nI'm a firm believer in not burning bridges and leaving a position as graciously as you came in. I resigned in mid-June 2025 and served two months' notice.\n\nMy firm, Command Joy Co., which helps people in the nonprofit field turn passion into sustainable impact, was launched last August.\n\nI'm still learning and growing, but the company is thriving. There is great satisfaction in guiding creatives through the business side of things.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of entrepreneurship can be a feeling of isolation. As a result, I go to lunch intentionally three or four times a month with other business owners and spitball ideas.\n\nAs for me-time, I've learned what recharges me, whether it's being near water or relaxing with friends.\n\nMy top priority is always my family. Having Jason and Xavier forces me to unplug in a good way.\n\nI like to think of my life right now as a slow unfold. Just because you were something in one season doesn't mean you have to stay like that in the seasons that follow.",

    "fullText": "The craft brewery industry has faced economic challenges over the last three years, leading to hundreds of businesses closing, which industry insiders have called the craft beer apocalypse.\n\nIt seems like another craft beer brand permanently closes its business every day.\n\nBrewery closures outpaced openings, with 434 shutting down and 268 opening by mid-December 2025, Brewbound reported on social media.\n\nCraft beer volume was estimated to be down about 5% from the previous year, according to the Brewers Association’s mid-year report in July 2025, Craft Brewing Business reported. Volume was down about 4% in 2024.\n\nBrewers have cited similar reasons for closing down their businesses, including increased product and labor costs driven by inflation and rising lease rates.\n\nThe industry has also faced a drop in consumer demand and declining alcohol consumption rates from younger generations, the Brewers Association reported.\n\n\"Raw material costs have emerged as a significant constraint in the North American craft beer market, with substantial increases in the prices of essential ingredients, such as malted barley and hops, alongside packaging materials like aluminum cans,\" according to a 2026 North American Craft Beer Market Report by Mordor Intelligence.\n\n\"The impact of these cost increases has been particularly severe on production economics, forcing breweries to revise their pricing strategies and operational models,\" the report said.\n\nAward-winning craft brewery Panther Island Brewing closed its doors for the last time on Feb. 13 after 11 years of serving customers across most of Central and Southern Texas, according to an Instagram post.\n\n\"After 11 unforgettable years, Panther Island Brewing will be closing its doors,\" the Instagram message said.\n\nThe brewery closed down the business with its Farewell Event in the taproom on Feb. 13.\n\nThe Fort Worth, Texas-based family-owned beer brand's spokesperson said the reason for closing wasn't the usual lease or landlord issue, according to CultureMap.com.\n\nThe brewery blamed severe economic issues for its closure.\n\n\"Between the current climate and economy, there were a lot of factors,\" Johnnye Soles, director of sales and marketing at Panther Island Brewing, said.\n\n\"As a family, we agreed that this was the best path to move forward. It's just our time, and we wanted to go out swinging,\" Soles said.\n\nAll employees, including the company's seven executive and senior staff members, would lose their jobs.",

    "description": "Basware CEO Jason Kurtz explained how he keeps his software company ahead of AI startups threatening his business.",
    "fullText": "It's the end of the world as software companies know it, and this CEO feels fine.\n\nJudging by what some AI experts are saying, and the state of the stock market, you'd think software companies were on their last legs. Basware CEO Jason Kurtz, whose company sells software for financial processes, sees it slightly differently.\n\n\"I will tell you there is not a single piece of data that we see that says that,\" said Kurtz.\n\n\"I have not had a single customer tell us, 'Oh, we're just going to go figure this out on our own and do AP with OpenAI or whoever.' That's not the way these companies work,\" he added.\n\nKurtz reached out to me last week after I asked for some reader feedback on the topic. (I genuinely read all your emails. Even the mean ones!)\n\nBasware, which counts Mercedes and Heineken among its roughly 6,500 customers and uses AI within its own products, hasn't felt threatened thus far. Kurtz told me the company saw a 20% year-over-year increase in sales in 2025, primarily driven by a surge in the back-half of the year.\n\nHe acknowledged that there had been some customer chatter about experimenting with AI on their own. But more recently, clients just want results.\n\nKurtz recalled a conversation with the digital transformation officer of a large European company. After spending roughly a million euros on internal AI-related projects in finance over the past year, the executive told Kurtz they \"can't point to a single penny that we have saved, earned, or helped our business in any way.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of experimenting. I want people who know how to use AI in our processes in our workflows,\" Kurtz said the executive told him.\n\nI asked Kurtz for advice for fellow software companies looking to protect themselves.\n\nBasware primarily works with AWS to help build its AI tools for customers. The company also has an \"AI czar,\" according to Kurtz, to surveil the industry. Figuring out ways to implement AI into your own products that'll drive more value for customers is one way to stay ahead.\n\nThere's also strength in numbers. Kurtz said maintaining tight integrations with fellow vendors to become a part of the workflow creates stickiness.\n\n\"If we weren't doing that, I'd be even more paranoid,\" Kurtz said.\n\nAnd then there's the data element. Basware has processed 2.5 billion invoices and 10 trillion euros of spend in the company's 40-year history. Having such a large swath of info can help train models and identify new efficiencies to pitch to customers.\n\n\"If you don't have a data strategy around AI and how you're going to use that to differentiate your AI and your capabilities, I think that's going to be a challenge,\" he said.",

    "description": "I flew 26 hours in Qatar Airways business class on different flights. The lie-flat seats, food, and amenities were good, but there were drawbacks.",
    "fullText": "I'm not someone who travels in business class regularly, but for our honeymoon, my husband and I wanted to treat ourselves.\n\nSince we chose the more affordable destination of Vietnam and went for 10 nights rather than two weeks, we had more budget to splurge on traveling in style.\n\nSo, we booked business-class flights from London to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha with Qatar Airways. Sure, the flights cost more than our actual honeymoon — they would've been around $10,000 before credit-card points — but we don't regret it.\n\nI now completely understand why the World Airline Awards have highlighted Qatar Airways as having the best business class in the world for multiple years in a row.\n\nThough we didn't have Q Suites, the business-class configuration on our first flight was still suite-style, in a 1-2-1 layout.\n\nThe suites felt modern and well-maintained. Later on in the flight, an attendant pulled a door across the side opening, which made it feel really private.\n\nEach business-class seat came with a cushion, a pillow, a plush blanket, a refreshing towelette, and a Diptyque toiletry bag.\n\nThe bag contained socks, an eye mask, earplugs, body lotion, face cream, perfume, and lip balm. There were also complimentary toothbrushes, shaving kits, and face sprays available to use in the restrooms.\n\nNot long after sitting down, we were greeted by the friendly staff and offered a drink. I opted for Champagne and was also brought a candy cane, which was a nice seasonal touch as we flew at the end of December.\n\nEach suite had a decent amount of storage and space — I'm 5'9\" and had ample legroom. The buttons by the sides of the seats made it easy to recline and adjust the leg rest.\n\nI also had a wireless charging phone holder; a cupboard containing a mirror, headphones, and a water bottle; and a stylish lamp.\n\nAs I browsed the movies, perused the food menu, and sipped my Champagne, I felt relaxed and excited. This was nothing like traveling in coach.\n\nDuring the six-hour flight, we were served one main meal that we could request whenever we wanted. (We could request a second meal, I later learned, though I didn't need it.)\n\nAs business-class travelers, we also had access to a basket of snacks, including popcorn and cereal bars, that we could help ourselves to at any time.\n\nPlus, we could order a range of wines, spirits, cocktails, and soft drinks whenever we wanted.\n\nBefore my meal began, I enjoyed more Champagne, served with crisps and nuts.\n\nAll the crockery and glassware felt elegant and sturdy — a far cry from foil containers and plastic cups.\n\nWhen it was time for the main meal, the staff pulled out my table, laid down a white tablecloth, then placed a (fake) candle and cutlery on top of it.\n\nFirst, I was brought a bread basket with butter, olive oil, and mini salt and pepper shakers. The butter was the perfect temperature for spreading, and the three types of bread were warm.\n\nI was then given a tasty mozzarella amuse-bouche.\n\nFor my starter, I had the Qatari mezze — pesto hummus, labneh tahini, and avocado muhammara — with pita bread. It was delicious and a sizable portion.\n\nFor the main course, I chose the grilled beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, and parsley sauce. It was really good.\n\nI skipped the cheese course and opted for the fruit plate for dessert. We were offered chocolates, too.\n\nAfter dinner, I had a cup of tea and reclined to watch a film.\n\nThis first flight was in the daytime, so I didn't take as much advantage of having lie-flat seats.\n\nThe second was overnight, which is when I really appreciated my ability to lie down. The suite set-up felt nice and private, too.\n\nMy only qualm was that the space for my feet felt quite narrow and a bit constrictive. It wasn't a huge issue, though, and I still got some sleep.\n\nWe had a brief stopover in Doha on both our journeys, and I was impressed by how modern, clean, and slick the airport felt.\n\nWith our tickets, we had access to the Al Mourjan Business Lounge and its lounge overlooking the airport garden. We tried one on the way there and the other on the way back.\n\nThe lounges were beautiful, and we got complimentary delicious food and Champagne. I actually wish we'd had longer layovers to take advantage of the lounge's gym, spa, showers, and sleep rooms.\n\nFor the second leg of our journey to Vietnam, we were on an older plane. The business-class seats weren't suites; they were in a 2-2-2 layout.\n\nWe still had lots of legroom, but this flight didn't feel as chic — it had fewer modern touches, and I missed the wireless phone charger I enjoyed on the first one.\n\nSince this was a nighttime flight, Qatar Airways provided business-class passengers with pajamas and slippers to keep. I really enjoyed this extra touch.\n\nThe staff also arranged my seat into a bed with a mattress topper and pillow, which was lovely. I normally never sleep on planes, but I got a couple of hours on each flight.\n\nI actually preferred the older business-class seat for sleeping since my feet weren't as restricted at the end.\n\nThese two round-trip flights for two people should've cost about $10,000, which is undoubtedly a lot of money.\n\nWe'd been saving our credit-card points for a long time, so we were able to take a lot of money off that price, but this was still a splurge.\n\nEven though these tickets cost a lot, they felt worth it. Flying business class made the journeys really special — something to look forward to and enjoy, not just a way of getting from A to B.\n\nSure, this experience might make going back to economy a bit painful, but I'm so glad to have done it. I would definitely fly business class again for a special occasion or if I had a lot of points.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president's name on airports but says it doesn't plan on charging a fee — at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home.\n\nApplications filed by the Trump Organization with the federal trademark office are seeking exclusive rights to use the president's name on airports and dozens of related things found there, from buses shuttling passengers to umbrellas and travel bags to flight suits. The filings come amid debate in Florida over a state bill to name the Palm Beach airport after Trump and a dispute over funding of a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that is tied up with proposals that both it and the Dulles International Airport in Virginia bear his name.\n\nThe Trump Organization said that the applications were triggered by the Florida bill and that it didn't seek any profit — only protection against “bad actors” given that the Trump name is the “most infringed trademark in the world.”\n\n“To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” the company said it in a statement, referring to what is now called the Palm Beach International Airport near Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nThe company didn't respond immediately when asked if it would charge royalties for the use of the name at other airports in the future, or on merchandise listed for protection in the filings.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he's ever seen.\n\n“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”\n\nThe applications filed by a family company unit called DTTM Operations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are for the use of three names — President Donald J. Trump International Airport, Donald J. Trump International Airport and DJT.\n\nThe family has been on a branding spree in the past year, putting its name on towers, golf resorts and residential developments in Dubai, India, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. The company has also been selling Trump branded electric guitars, bibles and sneakers, ventures that also fall under the DTTM unit.\n\nIn response to criticism that he and his family are profiting off the presidency, Trump has said that his business is held in trust by his sons and that he has no day-to-day involvement in the company.",

The team saw promising initial results from their innovations, but they faced a decision about whether to reveal their new techniques. The U.S. Team’s strategy was easily imitated if competitors witnessed it in a race, but it was a risk not to test it in competition before the Olympics. And, were there possible upsides to imitation if it improved the entire sport? Should they share their techniques, and if so, when?\nHarvard Business School Assistant Professor Rebecca Karp joins Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “A Winning Strategy: Innovation in Olympic Speed Skating.” They explore whether and when to launch a novel idea, product, or service, and what are the consequences—good and bad—to being imitated.\n\n Back / Innovations in Olympic Speed Skating: When to Reveal a Novel Approach\n\n Latest in this series\n\n All episodes",

    "fullText": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - The world's most valuable technology stocks have suffered sharp declines in market value ‌this year after years of outsized gains, ‌as investors question whether heavy spending on AI will generate sufficient ​returns to justify the lofty valuations.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) shares have fallen about 17% year-to-date on concerns over risks to its AI business and growing competition from Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) latest Gemini model ‌and Anthropic's (ANTH.PVT) Claude ⁠Cowork AI agent, wiping roughly $613 billion off its market value to about $2.98 trillion as ⁠of Friday.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) has shed around 13.85% so far this year, erasing about $343 billion in market value and leaving ​the company ​valued at roughly $2.13 trillion.\n\nEarlier ​this month, Amazon said ‌it expects capital spending to jump more than 50% this year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet have also seen their market values decline by $89.67 billion, $256.44 billion and $87.96 billion, respectively, since the start of 2026, to $4.44 trillion, $3.76 trillion and $3.7 ‌trillion.\n\nThe pullback signals a broader ​shift in market psychology, with ​investors moving from rewarding ​long-term AI ambitions to demanding near-term ‌earnings visibility after years of ​speculative enthusiasm.\n\n(Reporting ​by Gaurav Dogra and Patturaja Murugaboopathy in ​Bengaluru; Editing by Sumana Nandy)",

    "description": "Funds of hedge funds struggled to deal with the financial crisis and fallout from the Bernie Madoff scandal.",
    "fullText": "Funds that bet on hedge funds instead of stocks or bonds are finally in vogue again.\n\nThe double whammy of the financial crisis and Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme hit the fund-of-hedge-fund business so hard in 2008 that the industry is just now surpassing its 2007 asset level.\n\nData from Hedge Fund Research show that funds of hedge funds — which create portfolios of external hedge funds — now manage $818 billion, as of the end of 2025. It's the highest figure on record for the longtime industry tracker and the first time the industry has surpassed its onetime high-water mark of $799 billion in assets, which it ended 2007 with.\n\nThe surge in assets comes on the back of strong industry performance, with the average fund of funds returning 10.4% last year, the highest since 2009, according to Ken Heinz, president of Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research.\n\nThe asset growth can also be attributed to broader industry trends, Heinz said. Separately managed accounts, which give external fund investors more control over the managers they invest in, are now much more common. Firms like billionaire Izzy Englander's Millennium have increasingly used SMAs to access investing talent outside their walls. A With Intelligence report from last summer found that multistrategy funds have allocated to more than 100 external funds.\n\nThe greater insight granted to LPs via SMAs allows funds of funds to more closely monitor performance and risk metrics.\n\n\"Funds of funds have evolved,\" Heinz said.\n\nThe hedge fund industry overall has changed drastically compared to roughly two decades ago. Funds of funds and wealthy individuals' family offices used to account for a much larger share of hedge funds' overall assets. Still, the 2008 market crash forced many to liquidate their holdings, even if a fund had performed well.\n\nThis forced the hedge fund industry to turn elsewhere for capital, and now institutions such as pensions, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and foundations make up the vast majority of the $5.2 trillion in assets in the space. This shift to a more institutional investor base is why hedge fund assets have soared over the past 18 years, while funds of funds have slowly inched up.\n\nBut the diversification offered by funds of funds is still sought out, as evidenced by the surge in investor interest in multistrategy hedge funds, particularly the biggest players like Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny. Heinz expects that this interest has helped the fund-of-funds space in recent years and will continue to pump up assets as the biggest players fill up.\n\n\"Some of the larger multimanager programs are not always open or have a very high minimum,\" he said.\n\nStill, there are other ways in which \"the broad exodus\" from the space in 2008 is being felt. In 2007, there were nearly 2,500 funds of hedge funds, according to Hedge Fund Research. At the end of 2025, there were fewer than 1,000.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone pilot told Business Insider of how he found a Russian arsenal of horses and Ladas.\n\nRussia has increasingly been seen using unconventional transport, such as horses or bicycles.\n\nThe pilot's commander said it's a sign of how Russia fights and calculates its losses differently.\n\nCosmos floated his quadcopter over the ruined warehouse, guiding it through a corner of the roof where shattered metal sheets had collapsed to form a hole.\n\nThe drone pilot's unit, the Wild Division, suspected that the building was a logistics hub for Russian soldiers, roughly 15 km, or about 9 miles, from the line of contact in southern Ukraine. These hidden locations often held ordnance or fuel stockpiles, and Cosmos' fiber-optic drone was armed with explosives to destroy them.\n\nYet inside, the drone rotated its camera to reveal what looked more like a farmer's garage: Four civilian cars, a pair of motorcycles, and two bridled horses.\n\n\"We had not expected to see this. It was unusual,\" Cosmos told Business Insider, speaking on condition that he be identified only by his call sign.\n\n\"We were expecting to find some armored vehicles,\" he added.\n\nVideo of the discovery went viral last week in Ukraine, as the war has increasingly seen Russian soldiers using unconventional transport tools, such as pack animals and bicycles, to conduct assaults or logistics missions. Cosmos said his drone mission was conducted in early February.\n\nThe smaller profile of a horse or civilian car might be harder for a drone to spot, though Russia's repeated use of them has also raised questions about the viability of its tactics and whether it's been producing enough military equipment to sustain its invasion.\n\nCosmos' squad mates and officers at the Wild Division, a first-person-view drone company in the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, had seen clips of Russian soldiers riding on horses to attack Ukrainian positions before.\n\nOne famous example they remember was in Zaporizhzhia, when a Ukrainian drone crew attacked Russian infantry crossing the front lines on horseback last month.\n\nCosmos, who's been piloting drones for a year, said it was the first time he'd personally seen the animals on the front lines.\n\nHe flew his explosive-laden drone straight into the back of one of the cars, and said his crew later struck several other vehicles inside. When Russian troops moved their transport assets, the Wild Division found the next warehouse and attacked that one, too, Cosmos said.\n\n\"The enemy usually lives in hiding close to these places,\" Cosmos said of the warehouse. \"It's common for us to check all targets. Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles.\"\n\nThe Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.\n\nThe commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.\n\n\"I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub,\" said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.\n\nFizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.\n\nThe cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.\n\n\"They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway,\" he said. \"Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more.\"\n\n\"Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?\" Fizruk added.\n\nThe Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.\n\nSustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.",

    "fullText": "Prospective Sheffield Wednesday owner James Bord has become the subject of a major legal battle in the United States, according to The Times.\n\nThe English businessman and former professional poker player led the group that won the race to take over Wednesday after the club’s administrators announced an agreement.\n\nBord is being sued by his former business partner, Jonathan Cohen, over his investment in Spanish second division club Cordoba, where he is both a part-owner and a director.\n\nAccording to court papers filed in Clark County, Nevada, Bord allegedly misled Cohen during an investment deal linked to Cordoba in 2024.\n\nIn the complaint, Cohen says he was told Cordoba were debt-free when he agreed to invest. He now alleges that the club was in fact carrying debts of around $23 million (£16.9m) at the time.\n\nCohen argues that this information was crucial to his decision and that he would not have invested had he known the club’s true financial position.\n\nThe legal documents also claim that Bord wrongfully took control of a bitcoin account worth around $6m which belonged to Cohen.\n\nIn addition, Cohen says that Bord failed to formally confirm his stake in Cordoba through a written contract, ignoring numerous notifications to do so.\n\nOne of the more unusual claims in the filing is that Bord offered Cohen a “coupon” in exchange for a share in the club, a proposal Cohen’s team suggests was not a serious or fair arrangement.\n\nCohen’s lawyers, Holland & Hart LLP, are seeking punitive damages. They argue that Bord’s actions amount to fraud, oppression and deliberate wrongdoing.\n\nCohen has filed a total of seven separate claims, including fraudulent inducement, unjust enrichment and breach of confidence.\n\nBord’s representatives have responded by referring to the situation as a “deeply upsetting matter” for their client.\n\nThey have also claimed that over the past few years, Bord has “helped and supported Jonathan [Cohen] financially and personally, and has long considered him a friend”.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the situation will affect Bord’s Wednesday takeover, which is still pending green light from the English Football League.",

    "fullText": "\"We're the same age,\" I told Ernest Ang, a 24-year-old who opened an eatery two years ago with his grandmother's recipes.\n\nAnd yet, it feels like we live in different worlds.\n\nEvery day, he whips up large batches of fried chicken and beef rendang in Singapore's 90-degree tropical heat. On the other side of the island, in the glitzy financial district, I write about the Trump administration and the general chaos of the world.\n\nI started my first job in a newsroom after graduating from college in 2024, diving headfirst into the corporate grind. I sign off at 5:30 p.m. and value the work-life balance my writing job offers.\n\nLast year, I started collecting stories of Singaporean Gen Zers and millennials shunning the comfort and stability of the 9-5 in favor of starting their own food businesses — ventures that come with backbreaking long hours. I was humbled.\n\nHawker centers, like where Ang set up shop, are the go-to for budget meals in Singapore. They're cheap, hearty, and convenient, and I've eaten from them as long as I can remember.\n\nThere are 123 hawker centers in the country, managed by the National Environment Agency. On average, each center has about seven to 10 individual stalls.\n\nTraditionally, they sell dishes like Hainanese chicken rice, bak kut teh, a peppery and flavorful pork soup, or nasi lemak, aromatic rice served with dishes. The stalls are typically run by middle-aged to senior hawkers.\n\nBut as younger hawkers join the business, there's been an increase in specialty stalls selling matcha, craft beer, baked goods, and fusion dishes.\n\nSuccess is an uphill battle, with a massive failure rate due to rising store rents and a frugal consumer base. In 2025, 3,074 food and beverage businesses in Singapore closed their doors, per statistics from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore.\n\nThis has not deterred hopeful entrepreneurs — 4,103 new food businesses opened last year.\n\nMost of the young chefs I interviewed work six to seven days a week, getting up well before the sun rises to prep ingredients for the day and retiring late into the night after feeding hungry dinner crowds.\n\nI spoke with eight Gen Z and millennial F&B owners across the country about what makes them tick, what fears give them chills at night, and if they regret choosing a risky career path.",

    "description": "A certification debacle left Lufthansa's complex 787 business class mostly empty for months. The airline said it can finally sell the lucrative seats.",
    "fullText": "Lufthansa can finally start making money on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners after a certification debacle left one of its most lucrative cabins largely empty for months.\n\nThe German flag carrier said on Monday that it will begin selling tickets for its Allegris business class on the 787. Allegris, Lufthansa's signature cabin concept, spans economy, premium economy, business, and first class, but the business class rollout has been particularly tricky.\n\nThe program first launched on the Airbus A350 in May 2024, with the cabin spanning the entire plane. The first Allegris-equipped 787 followed in October 2025, but certification of business class dragged on due to the cabin's complexity: there are five staggered seat configurations in a single airplane cabin — some with doors or more legroom, others with extra-long beds.\n\nThis is because the Dreamliner's geometry — including a slightly tighter usable footprint and different fuselage contouring compared to the A350 — made it harder to demonstrate to regulators that passengers could evacuate quickly from every seat, whether staggered, partially enclosed, or fully cocooned, in an emergency.\n\nThe result? For months, only four of the 28 business class seats could be sold — the front-row Business Class Suites — leaving the remaining 24 empty. Business class is a cash cow for airlines, and by flying most of the cabin empty as competitors pour investments into their own premium seats, Lufthansa was essentially leaving money on the table.\n\nIt has been a particularly costly headache for a carrier in the midst of a multi-year turnaround plan to restore profitability after years of financial pressure from frequent maintenance, aircraft shortages, rising operating costs, and labor strikes.\n\nLufthansa even opted for an already-certified business-class seat to retrofit onto its Airbus A380s rather than risk another prolonged and costly certification process.\n\nBut the saga is nearing the finish line. Beginning April 15, Lufthansa plans to carry passengers in 25 business-class seats on its 787s, with three remaining blocked in the second row of the cabin.\n\nBookings are open, though it's unclear whether the news indicates the seats have been fully certified or if that's just Lufthansa's expected timeline.\n\nLufthansa said \"Classic\" seats — one of the Allegris categories available — are free to secure with the premium fare.\n\nThe others require an extra fee: this includes the first-row suites, the \"Privacy\" seat next to the window, the \"Extra Space\" seat with more legroom, and the \"Extra Long Bed\" with an over seven-foot sleeping surface.\n\nThe three second-row seats that are blocked — and not yet available for booking — are two privacy seats and an extra-legroom seat.\n\nLufthansa flies eight Allegris-equipped Dreamliners and expects to have 29 by the end of 2027.\n\nThey are set to first fly from Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro, Bogota, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, and Austin; New York-JFK and Los Angeles join the roster in June, followed by Delhi in July.\n\nAs part of Lufthansa's greater multibillion-dollar fleet overhaul plan, Allegris is also being fit onto the airline's existing A350s and Boeing 747-8s, as well as its future, yet-to-be-certified Boeing 777Xs.\n\nA similar spacing issue on the 747 double-deckers' upper level means it will have a split business class: the lower deck will have Allegris, while upstairs will feature the plane's original cabin.",

Even when I was given a chance to sit down and learn the family business full time, I told myself it would only be temporary.\n\nI had plenty of peers who planned from the get-go to take over their parents' companies, but not me. Still, my mother was determined to have me learn the ins and outs, no matter what I may end up doing in the future.\n\nNow that I've been a full-time employee for seven years, I've learned the intricacies of our family business. It isn't easy, but working with my family has made me appreciate everything I grew up with and the professional skills I've gained.\n\nMy mom started the companies I now work for in her early 30s. Starting out as a real estate agent, she learned that many of the properties she listed had underground or basement heating oil tanks that needed to be removed and replaced. Instead of coordinating multiple contractors, she started her first company to become a one-stop shop for the entire project. As many of her clients now had new oil tanks, she also started a company to provide oil and service for their heating equipment. The one-stop shop got a bit bigger with the newest addition.\n\nSince my mother has been an entrepreneur her entire life, it's all my sister and I have ever known. There are many pictures of our mom on job sites while pregnant or with us in strollers, watching the excavators and trailers go by.\n\nMany of the people who worked in the office felt like family, as I grew up stopping in with my mom and dad after school so they could wrap up their days.\n\nAt home, at work, or anywhere we may go, Mom is the boss. I didn't even know that HVAC and construction were male-dominated fields until my teens because every colleague she had did exactly what she said with little to no questioning.\n\nAs a kid, I would help clean the offices on the weekends. When I was in college, I worked in the office during my summer break. I got to learn just how the daily operations I'd heard about and seen my entire life.\n\nI started answering phones, sending out marketing mailers, and gradually taking on more of the responsibilities my older sister had handled years earlier.\n\nAfter college, I started working full-time at my mother's company as an office assistant. Now, I'm a coordinator for job sales, contract writing, bookkeeping, scheduling, and an ongoing list of administrative tasks that keep the businesses running.\n\nAlthough I never pictured myself working here full time, I try to look on the bright side. I left college not wanting to pursue the degree I ended up with, but I'm still able to support myself and my loved ones while I determine the new path I want to take.\n\nPeople often ask me if I enjoy working with my immediate family every day. I'd be lying if I said it didn't have its benefits, like the job security and ease of taking time for family matters.\n\nBut it also, of course, comes with an array of challenges.\n\nHaving my older sister directly over me as the office manager means that when things get frustrating, she easily treats me like the baby brother. Stern though she may be, she's always got the right answer and is sure I don't make the same mistakes twice. Like our mother, she commands a room's attention and reminds everyone exactly who's in charge at that moment.\n\nSure, it is tough to ask my mom for time off without her prying into my personal life to find out why, but my family has always reinforced the value of hard work, dedication, and an unshakable work ethic. I'm learning from the best.\n\nBeing able to work with my family is one of the luckiest lots in life I could have pulled. The frustrations are real, and the challenges of a small (but mighty) set of family businesses are ever-present.\n\nHowever, I can never deny the privilege of learning and growing with the ones I love. I'm not sure how long I'll work in the family business, but I feel prepared for whatever path I may walk next — with a strong base of support behind me.",

    "description": "A former banker and his lifelong friend turned a franchise obsession into owning Capriotti's and running the sandwich chain together.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ashley Morris, CEO of Capriotti's. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy whole career is based on a love affair with food — and a lifelong friendship. I grew up on the West Coast, but had tried cheesesteaks on trips east, and adored them. In college, I was living with Jason, who has been my best friend since we were 10. One day, he came home talking about the best sandwich he'd ever eaten. He told me I had to go to Capriotti's.\n\nI was busy, studying finance and working at a bank. By that Friday, when I still hadn't gone, Jason dragged me to the sandwich shop. I was just as blown away as he was. I'd eaten a lot of cheesesteaks, but this was the best of the best. It was true love.\n\nJason and I went to Capriotti's so much that when we needed a new apartment, we chose one further from school, but closer to the restaurant. That was the first sign of the role Capriotti's would play in our lives.\n\nI started working as a bank teller at Wells Fargo when I was 18 because it was the only finance job they'd let me do at that age. After I graduated from college, I moved to the financial services team, and by the time I was 25, I was earning more than any young kid should: about half a million a year.\n\nJason and I had always wanted to get into business together, and now I had the financial resources to make that a reality. We decided to spend a week thinking about business ideas, then decide what to do. When the meeting came, we each brought one idea: open a Capriotti's franchise.\n\nWe planned to be 50/50 business partners while both maintaining our day jobs. I would put in more capital, and Jason would do more of the hands-on work, while keeping his government job.\n\nHowever, we quickly learned that running a passive business just isn't a reality. The restaurant wasn't going to be a side hustle, especially because we were so cocky that we opened two franchises at the same time. Before long, we had a third. My girlfriend at the time (now wife) handled a lot of the operations, while Jason and I supported her as much as we could.\n\nWe wanted to own 10 restaurants, but we started butting heads with Capriotti's CEO. I thought she had an old-fashioned mindset, and each time we asked to open another location, she said no.\n\nAfter a year of that, I'd had enough. I realized if I waited for her to say yes, I'd be 40 and not living my dream. After speaking with Jason, I told the CEO we wanted to buy the whole company. It took everything Jason and I had, but we purchased Capriotti's in 2008, when I was 27.\n\nWe've been running the company together since — Jason's the CEO and I'm the president. We have a lot of the same values, probably because we forged them growing up together. We know each other inside and out, like brothers. That allows us to give really honest feedback. Jason has no problem walking into my office and saying, \"You're missing the boat on this one,\" and instead of getting defensive, I immediately open my mind to what he has to say.\n\nWhen we decided to buy the business, we established commandments to make sure our business partnership wouldn't ruin our friendship. First, there's a hierarchy: if we reach an impasse on a decision, I have the final say. That's only happened twice, and Jason has graciously accepted my decision.\n\nOur second commandment is that if either of us wants out, the other must be fully committed to helping him exit. Luckily, we've never had to use that, but we know that we could part ways amicably, fairly, and with integrity if we wanted to.\n\nToday, Jason's four boys are close with my sons and daughter. We all went on vacation together for New Year's. Life is busy, and it's not always easy to find time together outside work, but we try. It's wonderful to see our friendship recreated with our kids.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — British and Canadian citizens can enter China without a visa starting Tuesday, bringing to 79 the number of countries granted visa-free access in a bid to boost tourism and business.\n\nChina has expanded eligibility for the program significantly in the last two years. Visitors can stay for up to 30 days for business, tourism, exchange programs and to visit family and friends.\n\nMost Europeans qualify for visa-free entry, along with some from select countries in other regions including Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\n\nCitizens of a few other countries, including the United States and Indonesia, can enter for 10 days if they are in transit — meaning they have a ticket departing for a different country than they arrived from.\n\nBusiness executives and tourists have welcomed the change, as the China visa application process can be a relatively cumbersome one.\n\nThe U.K. and Canada are being added following visits to China last month by their prime ministers, Keir Starmer and Mark Carney. Both are relatively new leaders who are trying to revamp ties with Beijing after a downturn in recent years.\n\nFor most countries, the visa-free access expires at the end of this year, but it has been extended in the past.",

    "fullText": "The January transfer window provides clubs with a chance to strengthen mid-season, and several winter window signings already look fine business.\n\nHere are five January signings that have hit the ground running.\n\nAntoine Semenyo's superb start at Bournemouth indicated the winger was ready for the next step, but few could have envisioned the ease at which he has slotted into the Manchester City side.\n\nSemenyo scored and assisted on debut in theFA Cup thrashing of Exeter City last month and has continued to shine as part of the club's new-look frontline.\n\nHe's scored five times and added two assists in just nine appearances for the Citizens and certainly looks the part in Sky Blue.\n\nEndrick badly needed a loan in January. The 19-year-old was afforded just 12 minutes ofLa Liga football over the first half of the campaign, before heading to France in search of minutes. Lyon loaned in the forward, who is thriving in Ligue 1.\n\nEndrick marked his debut with a goal against Lille, before netting a hat-trick in a 5-2 thrashing of Metz.\n\nHe's joined a Lyon side who are on a formidable run of 13 wins in a row in all competitions and was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month for January.\n\nHe's back in the frame for the Brazil squad for this summer's World Cup.\n\nAtletico Madrid made a move for Ademola Lookman in January, agreeing a deal to sign the winger from Atalanta for just north of £30m. The Nigerian has quickly made that fee look like a bargain with an electric start for the Rojiblancos.\n\nHe's scored twice and provided two assists in just three appearances, and was a standout asAtletico thrashed Barcelona 4-0 in the Copa del Rey earlier this month.\n\nAtletico have a rich history when it comes to forwards and Lookman is aiming to write his own chapter.\n\nDonyell Malen's time atAston Villa was a curious case. Parachuted in last January, he was afforded just seven league starts in his 12 months at the club.\n\nDespite that, Malen scored sevenPremier League goals across those limited minutes in a hint of what was to come in Rome.\n\nThe Dutchman has made an immediate impact with five goals in fiveSerie A games. Trusted as the club's focal point under Gian Piero Gasperini, his form has helped Roma's bid for Champions League qualification.\n\nIt looks likely that the capital club will activate the €25m purchase option in his loan.\n\nWest Ham's striker curse has been well documented, with the Hammers having trouble finding the right man to lead the line. Taty Castellanos came in from Lazio in January, with some dubious given a modest goal record in Italy.\n\nThe Argentine has scored just twice in eight appearances for West Ham, but his profile has provided Nuno Espirito Santo with a badly needed target.\n\nWest Ham have won three times in six games with Castellanos in the side, as many wins as in their previous 20 games.",

    "fullText": "Delivery service Instacart is moving further into new areas, such as advertising and retail tech.\n\nThe company's roughly 600,000 gig workers, who shop and deliver groceries and other retail goods, are its most visible face for many people. But Instacart's business is growing in many directions, CEO Chris Rogers said on a November earnings call.\n\n\"We have the leading online grocery marketplace, a best-in-class suite of enterprise technologies for retailers, and a growing advertising ecosystem,\" Rogers said on the call, his first as CEO after assuming the position in August.\n\nInstacart needs people to make good on its growth plans. The company had about 170 open roles on its careers website as of early February.\n\n\"We're hiring selectively, with priority on roles that support our core marketplace, Instacart Enterprise solutions for retailers globally, and our ads and data platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\n\"We regularly review compensation to ensure it's competitive and aligned with market benchmarks, location, and role,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThat hiring can include some employees from outside the US on H-1B work visas.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 157 H-1B visa applications submitted by Instacart and certified by the Department of Labor in the year ending September 30, 2025. These applications provide insight into how much employees in certain roles make. Many of the salaries were for tech roles, including data science, engineering, and product management positions.\n\nThe Trump administration has initiated changes to the H-1B visa system. In September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which Instacart has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.\n\nData Scientist: $125,000 to $210,000\n\nDirector of Engineering, Machine Learning: $320,000 to $380,000\n\nEngineering Manager, Software: $220,000 to $290,000\n\nManager, Machine Learning Engineering: $260,000 to $280,000\n\nPrincipal Software Engineer: $350,000 to $380,000\n\nSenior Computer Vision/AI Engineer: $180,000 to $290,000\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $170,000 to $265,000\n\nSenior Engagement Manager: $235,000 to $285,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Engineering Manager, Software: $275,000 to $305,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $185,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $190,000 to $298,000\n\nSenior Product Manager: $185,000 to $280,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $176,000 to $285,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $165,000 to $215,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $250,000 to $310,000\n\nHave a tip?

To get his first customers in Seoul, he decided to get Starbucks' help.\n\n\"So my strategy was, I'm going to put a Gong Cha — the first five stores — next to Starbucks,\" Berry told CNBC. \"And if I can get one in a hundred people who are going into Starbucks to come and try a Gong Cha, then I've got a business.\"\n\nGong Cha was founded in Taiwan in 1996 by Wu Zhenhua, and Berry entered the business in 2011 to expand the brand to South Korea and other countries. As of January, the chain had about 2,200 stores in 33 countries, including the US and Canada.\n\nThe chain is known for its fragrant, fruity teas and its milk foam topping.\n\nBubble tea brands have seen large success in recent years, with several making splashy IPOs.\n\nMixue, the world's largest fast-food chain that sells cheap bubble tea and ice cream, has more than 45,000 stores worldwide and just opened its first outlet in New York City at the start of the year. It went public in Hong Kong last March, with its stock jumping 30% from its IPO price at market open.\n\nOther Asian beverage brands, like Luckin Coffee, have positioned themselves as Starbucks' rivals, offering similar drinks at lower prices.

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about how going to Disneyland has gotten so expensive.",
    "fullText": "My wife and I are about to take our two kids to Disneyland … and I'm absolutely terrified.\n\nNot because I don't want to go. My nearly 3-year-old carries his Mickey Mouse stuffie everywhere. He sleeps with it. Eats with it. When he sees Mickey in real life, he'll lose it. I can't wait for that.\n\nHere's the problem: I'm really worried about how much it's going to cost. The price of visiting Disney — and competing amusement parks — has been rising for years. But the upper end of what it can cost, depending on the experience you want, has entered rarefied air.\n\nIn a recent Business Insider documentary, we dug into Disney's history to better understand the real reason the Mouse House has gotten so expensive. When Disneyland opened in 1955, admission was basically pocket change. Back then, it cost 50 cents for a child and $1 an adult, to get in, or $6 and $12, respectively, in today's dollars adjusted for inflation. Going on the rides cost more.\n\nToday, admission plus rides can run close to $200 a day, although the lower tiers are cheaper. Then there's the food. The merchandise. Not to mention the enormous crowds and the endless lines if you don't pay for a line-jumping pass. The happiest place on Earth? My wallet might disagree.\n\nDisney parks have been a bright spot for the company post-COVID under the stewardship of parks czar Josh D'Amaro. He is set to succeed Bob Iger as CEO.\n\nThe question now is whether Disney diehards start to change course.\n\nOne hardcore Disney fan who still visits multiple times a year told us she's cut back on extras and avoids premium shortcuts or add-ons.\n\nAnother family dropped nearly $10,000 on Disney World and came home with a list of what they'd cut next time.\n\nThere are Disney-specific budgeting stories, too, showing how families save on tickets, food, and hotels. I'm taking notes.\n\nMy real fear isn't the credit-card bill. What if my kids love it? What if they beg to go back? What if this trip becomes such a core memory — priceless, one might say — that they measure other vacations against it?\n\nWhat are your best Disney tricks and hacks?

    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about the booming mini economy of public breakups.",
    "fullText": "I know, I know, it's Valentine's Day, so who wants to read about breakups? Hear me out. Today isn't just about love; it's about every part of a relationship — the meet-cute, the intoxicating limerence, and even splitting up over soup. Meet the breakup economy.\n\nBusiness Insider's Juliana Kaplan writes about how breaking up in public is still a thing, and many are choosing restaurants, bars, and coffee shops to do the deed. It's not only affecting the two people sitting at the table. Waitstaff are also taking notice and trying their best to navigate what happens when someone suddenly leaves the table.\n\nChef Gabrielle Macafee encountered this exact scenario when she worked at a Brooklyn restaurant serving a small tasting menu. After a couple walked in looking \"morose,\" the man stood up and left halfway through the $130 meal.\n\n\"My teammates and I were like, wait, how do we handle this? He's gone. You can only hold the food for so long,\" Macafee told BI's Kaplan, who added that the woman still seated paid for both meals. \"We offered to send her the rest, but obviously, she just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\"\n\nIf you do find yourself giving the \"it's not you, it's me\" speech in public, dating coach Julie Nguyen advised picking a neutral spot, such as a park, and avoiding regular haunts you both frequent. \"You don't want either of you to feel dread going back, or tie bad memories to a spot they love. A neutral, quiet outdoor setting is the best play,\" she added.\n\nLane Denbro, a former line cook, said that if you're not in total shock at what's happening, be thoughtful of the staff, the servers, and the bartenders. \"If you're going through a breakup, make sure to tip well, because the service staff in the back of house, we're going to try to support you however we can,\" Denbro said.",

    "description": "Joe Fenti, a former Big Four consultant, quit his job to become a full-time content creator and makes videos mocking corporate culture.",
    "fullText": "It's a scene many office workers would recognize — a consultant arguing with their boss about how they should be logging, or not logging, the hours they're putting in, using insider language like daily \"touch points\" and charging the \"client code.\" \n\nEventually, the boss slips up.\n\n\"We just don't want your utilization to get too high so we have a reason to lay you off when it comes to layoff season,\" the boss says. \"Oh, wait. I said the quiet part out loud.\"\n\nThe scene — \"Timesheets In Consulting Make No Sense\" — is actually a comedy sketch, one of the most viewed videos on Joe Fenti's Instagram account. It's racked up 1.8 million views and hundreds of comments from users who say they can relate.\n\nFenti, a 29-year-old in Boston, is also saying the quiet part out loud, depicting the frustrations that are all too common in corporate America but often go unacknowledged.\n\nThey're situations he knows firsthand: Before becoming a full-time content creator and stand-up comedian, Fenti spent five years as a consultant at a Big Four firm.\n\n\"I found myself doing a lot of repetitive work and just noticing a lot of silliness in the workday,\" Fenti told Business Insider.\n\nWhen he started posting videos online, the ones mocking corporate culture resonated the most, and not just with fellow consultants but also with folks in other fields like accounting, investment banking, and private equity.\n\n\"Wow, this is such a universal experience,\" he realized. \"Corporate is corporate is corporate.\"\n\nLampooning professional services firms comes with a large potential audience, as the Big Four — Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG — collectively employ 1.5 million people.\n\nA post shared by Joe Fenti (@fentifriedchicken)\n\nFenti started working as a consultant in 2019. Little frustrations quickly started piling up, like having to write emails for his boss to a client, but the boss knew everything that needed to be in the email, so he had to ask the boss what to write. \"The whole time I'm thinking, 'This would be so much faster if you just did this,'\" he said.\n\nWhen he began posting videos around the spring of 2021, the ones about work were taking off, so he started posting more frequently. Since around 2023, he's been posting six videos a week, and for much of that time, he also had his full-time consulting job.\n\n\"I really was maximizing every minute of my day just to make this content and comedy thing work,\" he said. He'd write his scripts during the day on a notepad so he could film immediately when he got home. He'd edit his videos while on the bus to work or to a stand-up comedy show.\n\nFenti said he always loved comedy, but never imagined it could be something he actually did for a job. He remembers saying to his friend when he first started, \"If I even make a dollar doing this, it'll be a good adventure.\"\n\nWhile he makes most of his income from content, he also travels for stand-up comedy shows and plans to do more of that. He also recently recorded a 60-minute special that should be coming out this spring.\n\nEven as a content creator, it's hard to escape the realities of corporate culture. He's had brands approve a script only to ask for edits once the video was already done. But he loves being his own boss and setting his own schedule.\n\nNow that he's left the corporate world, he can't imagine ever going back. \"I love not having to get anything approved,\" he said. \"It's whatever I think is funny.\"\n\nWhile his comedy goes beyond mere mockery of corporate culture, it's a topic that continues to resonate. A year out from his consulting job, he said he still has no shortage of ideas for jokes about work.\n\nFans come up to him after shows and tell him his videos helped them get through a hard time or an especially annoying project. He thinks people want to see their world reflected back at them, and that they appreciate seeing the frustrations they're experiencing actually be acknowledged.\n\n\"People want their lives to be seen and understood,\" he said. \"When you have a humor page about it, that's really the most understanding you can get.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "James Eagle founded UK artisan brand The Pished Fish in 2014 and is known for its booze-infused, Scandinavian style smoked salmon.",
    "fullText": "As a medical devices salesman, James Eagle travelled across Scandinavia and would frequently be met with salmon or gravlax as “the main event” on menus.\n\nBack in the UK, he felt that thinly-cut smoked salmon was a sidenote on our plates. “I always thought that was a shame,” says Eagle.\n\nRedundancy from his sales job in 2013 allowed Eagle to start a smokehouse from a small shed at the bottom of his garden in Camberwell, London, which turned from a hobby into the birth of his artisan brand – The Pished Fish.\n\n“In the UK, when you get a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel, it’s the cream cheese and bagel you can taste,” adds Eagle. “How I likened it is with wafer-thin smoked salmon almost melting into the bagel.”\n\nEagle, who didn’t complete university, worked for drum and bass label Good Looking Records in the early 2000s and was PA to musician LTJ Bukem before turning to a career in sales.\n\nHowever, being laid off at the medical devices firm left a “sour taste” and taught him a lesson in \"how to look after my own staff now.”\n\nIn late 2014, Eagle ventured to farmers' markets with homemade smoked salmon made in what he describes as a “glorified filing cabinet” smoker. He would start at 1am for the laborious 16-hour process.\n\nHe produced three different flavours, sold out every weekend and it gave Eagle the confidence that a more lucrative business was in the offing.\n\nThe Pished Fish’s USP is using botanicals and alcohol – hence the fun company name – such as whisky, aquavit and vodka to flavour its booze-infused, Scandinavian-style smoked salmon. “The ones which I thought were more fun were done with alcohol,” he recalls of his early smokehouse testing.\n\nAfter meeting his now wife, Hermione, through dating site My Single Friend, the couple had attended a course on how to start a food business. Eagle’s main takeaway was not to rely on the product but to have a compelling brand.\n\nHe spent £4,000 on a design and logo. “Having someone to properly imagine what it could be was really important,” he says. “I felt it was an awful amount of money at the time, but it was the best money you could spend.”\n\nWhen a fishmonger at Selfridges later spotted the brand, the Eagles moved to East Sussex and went full-time to upscale the business. The start-up was housed on his father’s land near the Sussex Downs, at first in two shipping containers before moving to an adjacent building where Eagle today employs eight full-time staff.",

    "fullText": "A few times a year, I take Amtrak trains to travel to destinations along the East Coast. I've found it's an efficient way to travel between Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., especially when I'm looking to avoid rush hour traffic in those cities.\n\nI've traveled in coach and the quiet car — and have even paid premium prices for business-class seats. But in my opinion, the best spot on the train isn't in any of these spots. In fact, it doesn't even require a special ticket.\n\nAlthough not available on every Amtrak train, the café car is my favorite place to sit. The best part is that I'm able to come and go at my leisure, since the car is open to all ticketed passengers on the train.\n\nI also think it has a number of advantages over the coach and even business-class sections. For example, the first-come, first-served table seating gives me plenty of space to comfortably set up my laptop and notebook so I can get some work done on the train. There's also plenty of legroom, which is a nice bonus.\n\nEach table can seat up to four passengers, but sometimes, I get lucky and have the whole space to myself.\n\nTypically, though, I end up sharing a table with one other person, which is nice because I can ask them to keep an eye on my things while I use the restroom or stretch my legs.\n\nPlus, this car is a nice option when I'm traveling with groups of friends, so we can comfortably chat at side-by-side tables.\n\nI typically enjoy a full meal at home before a train trip, but it's nice to know that I have plenty of options when I'm riding in the café car.\n\nAlthough menus may vary by route, most include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack items for purchase. I've seen everything from breakfast sandwiches and pastries to salads and cheeseburgers on board. There's also a selection of soft drinks, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages.\n\nOn a recent trip, I bought a vanilla yogurt parfait with granola and berries, and a plate of cheese and crackers.\n\nOf course, life in the café car isn't always perfect. For example, I've found that people can be more chatty in this part of the train, whether they're engaged in conversations with tablemates or having a loud phone conversation.\n\nAs a writer who likes to get work done on the train, I mitigate this issue by wearing noise-canceling headphones.\n\nPlus, seats are limited in this car, and I'm not always guaranteed to get a spot.\n\nOverall, though, I've found the café car to be the best spot on the train and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little extra space without the price of a premium seat.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 28, 2025, and most recently updated on February 13, 2026.",

    "description": "A Ms. Maine winner explains how modern pageants have evolved and how winning the title helped her business while raising two children.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kristan Vermeulen, the founder of Makers of the USA podcast and community. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI won the United States of America Pageants' Ms. Maine title in 2025. This was not a competition like \"Miss Congeniality.\" There was no pulling of hair between us. It's more about the camaraderie and understanding what these women are going through, and how we can all support each other.\n\nHere's what I learned during my tenure.\n\nHistorically, most pageant systems were restricted to unmarried women aged 18 to 28 with no children. Over the past five years, many systems across the US have expanded requirements to include more women. This shift isn't unique to my pageant organization, but a broader trend within the industry.\n\nAnother example: our pageant system was really positive when it came to physical attributes; we had a lot of women with tattoos. There was even a woman in my category who was in her mid-50s.\n\nIn my pageant, the interview portion accounted for most of my score. Pageantry offers a platform to pursue a new hobby or amplify an existing passion. Every contestant represents a platform or nonprofit.\n\nFollowing my divorce, I was in a period of self-discovery. Competing for and winning Ms. Maine while raising two children and navigating a new career path was a significant undertaking, but I wanted to show my children that their mother is powerful and capable of achieving anything — including winning a title at age 35 and walking across a stage in a bikini.\n\nI took it seriously. I even hired a walking coach in Brussels — I was getting up at 2 a.m. to practice while the kids were sleeping. I knew I wanted to win.\n\nThe pageant allowed me to amplify my maker brand. I have a podcast and storytelling platform called Makers of the USA, where I tell stories about American-made brands. I wanted to demonstrate how to shop local and support small brands in a big showcase. I had Maine-based Luxe by Dorcass and Angelrox make my gowns and patriotic wear bodysuit, for example. The former Mrs. United States of America reached out after my pageant and said she wanted to buy the gown I wore because it was so unique.\n\nThese relationships also helped me identify challenges within the maker community. I learned that Maine makers needed more visibility across all creative industries, which led me to work with my State Rep. to officially designate October as \"Maine Makers Month.\" We launched this past October with an event involving state reps, press, and the maker community.\n\nThere is a monetary prize, but the biggest thing I got from it was opportunities. I really took advantage of being Ms. Maine, even though I knew people might make fun of me. I'm currently discussing making my podcast into a television show, for example.\n\nWinning Ms. Maine helped my business. There has been a small negative, though. I'm a working professional, and I've decided to take my title off my professional online presence. People still have misconceptions about pageants, and that's not how I want to be perceived professionally.",

    "fullText": "The January transfer window in Germany might have closed on February 2 (ironic, is it not?) but other transfer windows remained open past that date. Ergo there were still some outgoings at Bayern Munich as well as a very late confirmation of an incoming signing. Here is the list of the final transfer activity of the 2026 January transfer window at the Bayern Campus:\n\nMax Mergner- permanent transfer to Austria Vienna, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\nMax Mergner lined up for Bayern’s U-23s in the first half of the 2025/26 season but lost his pre-season to an ankle injury. Even when the 19-year-old midfielder came back from this injury, he played just 124 minutes in total for the team. A change was in order and it arrived through a permanent transfer to Austrian Bundesliga side Austria Vienna.\n\nDavid Emmanuel- loan to KSV Hessen Kassel cut short, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\n19-year-old defensive midfielder David Emmanuel was loaned out to KSV Hessen Kassel back in the January transfer window of 2025. However, he only played 5 minutes the rest of the season for the team in the Regionalliga Südwest, one of the 5 different regional fourth divisions in Germany. There was hope he would be able to push his way into the picture a little more following a pre-season and further acclimatization at the club, but he only played 1 minute in the first half of the 2025/26 season.

    "title": "Here's how smart people in tech are reacting to Matt Shumer's viral essay about what AI means for jobs",
    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan is consolidating power to move faster on AI.\n\nThe bank is reshuffling its commercial and investment bank to \"maximize the impact of AI,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider that was sent this week.\n\nThe firm has named Guy Halamish as the chief operating officer of the CIB and tasked him with overseeing the ongoing effort to \"harness the power of our data and fully leverage rapidly evolving AI capabilities,\" the memo, signed by the CIB's co-CEOs, Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, said. Halamish's new role was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder the new structure, each major business in the division, including banking, markets, payments, and securities services, will have its own chief data and analytics officer reporting jointly to Halamish and business heads. The bank recently hired Zachery Anderson as the chief data and analytics officer of its payments division, after a nearly six-year stint at UK-based lender NatWest. In a LinkedIn post about the new job, Anderson said he wants to push the \"edge of the possible with AI.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new strategy to break silos across the unit and speed up adoption of AI.\n\nThe team of officers will work with the wider firm on a range of efforts, including \"preparing our infrastructure for more advanced AI and the expanded use of AI agents\" and \"driving end-to-end transformation\" in areas such as client onboarding.\n\nThe CIB is a huge profit driver for JPMorgan — in 2024, it generated $25 billion in net income out of a firmwide total of $58.5 billion, according to that year's annual report.\n\nJPMorgan, backed last year by an approximately $18 billion tech budget, is one of the financial industry's leaders in AI, with its own proprietary genAI platform and additional tools in the pipeline. CEO Jamie Dimon defended the firm's AI spending on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the spending.\n\nWork at JPMorgan or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Vybe, the startup cofounded by two repeat Y Combinator entrepreneurs, has raised $10 million to bring vibe coding inside large companies.\n\nThe practice of vibe coding has become more widespread as it allows people to use AI and natural language prompts to build an app, rather than traditional programming. The sector has attracted hundreds of millions in venture funding and is blurring the lines for businesses deciding between buying software or just vibe-coding their own tools.\n\nWhile popular vibe-coding products like Lovable and Replit have made it easy for companies to create prototypes and landing pages, Vybe offers stronger security that cannot be modified by AI and also taps into internal data systems, said cofounder and CEO Quang Hoang.\n\nHoang previously founded the engineering mentorship platform Plato and is building Vybe alongside cofounder and CTO Fabien Devos, founder of the security AI startup Wolfia.\n\nVybe lets teams across an organization collaborate on apps. Engineering teams manage access to internal systems like Salesforce, Snowflake, and Databricks, while business teams can build apps for onboarding, performance reviews, customer service, and more.\n\n\"The new SaaS is going to be more like Legos,\" Hoang said, referring to software-as-a-service. \"You can build it exactly how you want.\"\n\nVybe also offers app templates created by high-profile executives, such as former Airbnb product leader Lenny Rachitsky and Front cofounder Mathilde Collin, that users can \"remix\" to suit their needs, including templates for performance reviews and one-on-one meetings.\n\nFirst Round Capital led Vybe's seed round, which featured participation from Y Combinator, the CEOs of Datadog and Grammarly, and product leaders from OpenAI and Meta.\n\nVybe has six employees and dozens of customers, Hoang said. It plans to use the funding to hire engineers. Vybe charges $12 per user a month, plus usage-based credits for app development.\n\nThe round comes as vibe coding continues to attract major funding — with startups like Emergent pulling in tens of millions from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank — even as Barclays analysts warn the initial boom may be cooling.\n\nAt the same time, investors are also weighing how AI and vibe-coding tools can reshape the software sector. Software stocks have entered one of their sharpest downturns in years, shedding roughly $2 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Vybe used to raise its $10 million seed round.

    "description": "A security source told Business Insider that the drones struck a refinery in Russia's Komi Republic on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian long-range drones struck an oil refinery nearly 1,100 miles into Russia, marking one of Kyiv's deepest strikes of the war, a security official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe drones struck the Ukhta refinery in Russia's Komi Republic, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe source said the targeted refinery is located 1,750 kilometers (1,087 miles) from the Ukrainian border, in what was Kyiv's latest strike on Russian energy infrastructure.\n\nThe attack on Thursday triggered a fire at the refinery. Plumes of smoke are visible in footage of the facility shared by the SBU source. One video shows what appears to be a large Ukrainian drone streaming across the sky. Business Insider could not independently verify the imagery.\n\nThe refinery is part of Russia's state-owned PJSC Lukoil Oil Company, and it processes about 4 million tons of oil annually. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which confirmed the attack, said the facility supplies Moscow's military.\n\nThe General Staff wrote on the Telegram messaging platform that \"other components\" of Ukraine's defense forces were involved in the attack.\n\n\"The SBU continues to carry out targeted strikes on the enterprises of the Russian oil refining complex, which ensure the functioning of the military machine of the aggressor country,\" the security service source said in a translated statement.\n\nHitting such targets \"reduces the enemy's ability to provide their troops with fuel, complicates logistics, and reduces financial revenues that go to the war against Ukraine,\" they said.\n\nRussia's defense ministry said that it shot down 211 fixed-wing Ukrainian drones over the past 24 hours, but it did not specify where. Neither the ministry nor the country's embassy in the US immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russian energy facilities, hitting oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as refineries and ports, as well as tankers and platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign targeting Russia's energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions on Moscow, which uses the revenue from this industry to fuel its full-scale invasion.\n\nYehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, told Business Insider earlier this week that striking the Russian energy sector has been \"one of the best decisions\" because \"it is painful for them.\"\n\n\"I think that's why they have a problem in their economy and with the financing of the war, actually, of their armed forces,\" he said. \"We have to continue to do this.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian deep strikes have affected Russia's oil sector. Refining has declined over the past year; Moscow processed 5.3 million barrels a day last month, compared with the 5.6 million barrels it usually processes in January, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has stepped up its missile and drone barrages on Ukrainian energy infrastructure this winter, causing blackouts in cities around the country and leaving civilians without heat, electricity, and water.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia used 219 drones and 25 missiles to attack the country during the previous night, killing multiple people in an attack primarily aimed at energy infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities.\n\nUnited Nations officials have called this winter Ukraine's coldest in over a decade.",

    "description": "Solopreneurs like Katrina Purcell and Gigi Robinson use AI tools to optimize their content creation, boost efficiency, and enhance lead generation.",
    "fullText": "These days, content creation can feel like a full-time job. For solopreneurs running podcasts or active social channels alongside client work, maintaining a consistent presence can be hard to manage without any teammates.\n\n\"I would not be doing this level of content if I didn't have AI,\" said Katrina Purcell, Fractional COO and host of the Managed Chaos podcast. Purcell produces a weekly podcast and publishes related content across LinkedIn, Substack, and a blog on her website. AI tools like Riverside for transcripts and Gemini for content ideation and creation make it possible, she said.\n\nHere are the specific ways Purcell and two other solopreneurs have integrated AI into their processes to make content creation more seamless.\n\n\"I've never really thought of myself as a content-generating creative person,\" Purcell told Business Insider.\n\nBefore generative AI, she struggled to identify which content from her podcast would perform well on different platforms and often took the \"lazy route\" and simply published the same copy everywhere.\n\nNow, she's trained a custom Gem on Gemini to support her in creating content tailored to different platforms.\n\n\"I gave it the brand guidelines for the podcast, told it that it was adept at SEO, that it knew all the latest content trends, and then I asked it to start coming up with content based on the transcripts,\" she said. Prompts she uses include:\n\nShe'll do some light tweaks and editing, but the AI does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nRecently, she wrote a Substack post based on a podcast episode using this process, and a reader reached out to say how valuable the post was for them, and asked how long it took her. She had to admit it didn't take her long at all, thanks to AI.\n\nPurcell added that she's continually training this Gem on new information about her goals and audience, and always \"closes the content loop\" by telling it how different posts performed.\n\nFor Gigi Robinson, who's been a social media creator since college and now runs a consultancy called Hosts of Influence to help other creators with their brands, creativity was never the bottleneck — it was going from an idea to a finished post.\n\nRather than getting in her head about optimizing every aspect of a post, AI helps her get it done rather than focusing on perfection.\n\nFor instance, she's been able to create LinkedIn videos based on trending news stories quickly. She'll copy and paste parts of a trending article she likes into ChatGPT and ask it to generate specific talking points in her brand voice. From there, she can quickly ad-lib a video without needing to script something out herself. This approach helped her get over 100 million impressions on LinkedIn in just 90 days last year (confirmed from a tracking document viewed by Business Insider) and led to more inbound brand deals from LinkedIn.\n\nRobinson has also found AI video editing tools like Adobe Premiere and OpusClip valuable for a first round of edits. She and her contract interns still make nitpicky tweaks, but it takes much less time than doing everything manually.\n\n\"Before, video editing could take hours. With these tools, getting a cut of the video finalized for posting is usually done in under an hour,\" Robinson said.\n\nEsosa Edosomwan, the coach and nutrition specialist behind The Raw Girl and UMI, still prefers to keep her content creation process largely human-driven after experimenting with AI video and finding her audience doesn't respond to it.\n\nOutside of small things like using Claude to optimize social captions or Nano Banana for video thumbnails, the biggest benefit of AI has been helping her turn social media followers into customers. When she had a piece of content go viral on Instagram early last year, the flood of DMs became impossible to keep up with.\n\nFor help, she turned to the AI tool Manychat. In addition to the automations that send lead magnets — free resources in exchange for contact info — when followers message call-to-action phrases like \"workshop\" or \"hormones,\" she's trained the bot to respond to other messages with her brand and voice, keeping the conversation going.\n\n\"I have even had a couple times where friends thought it was me before realizing it was my chatbot,\" she said. \"That has really helped with inbound leads.\"",

    "title": "The booming business of public breakups",
    "description": "From fancy tasting menus to bars, restaurant workers have overheard their fair shares of public breakups. Here's what they think of yours.",
    "fullText": "From Lane Denbro's vantage point in the open kitchen of the trendy restaurant where he worked, it was hard to tell which was causing the couple more pain: the spicy food… or the unfolding break-up.\n\n\"They were ordering all of the spicy dishes on the menu, and so I just remember thinking that it must add so much intensity to what is already an intense conversation about whether or not we're going to break up,\" Denbro tells me.\n\nDenbro, then a line cook working the wok and the fry, saw the couple growing more frustrated with each other throughout their meal. By the time they left the table, Denbro says, they decided to call it quits.\n\nThe public, or quasi-public, break-up is its own storied genre. It's inspired some of the best scenes in great movies: The infamous \"Legally Blonde\" restaurant meltdown, or Mark Zuckerberg not realizing he's getting broken up with in \"The Social Network\" (Joe Cammarata, the co-owner of bar Tall Order, which took over the space in Somerville, MA, where that scene was filmed, says there's been at least one breakup in the bar since they opened in March). If you've decided it's time to part ways, a public end can sting; sobbing at a coffee shop or park isn't pleasant for anyone. Of course, ending things in public has its uses, especially if you're worried about a partner's reaction to pulling the plug.\n\nIf anything, public breakups might become more common. As homes get smaller, rents rise, and roommates abound (including ones you're related to: 18% of 25- to 34-year-olds live with their parents), you don't want to have to move out of a now-cursed space or have your parents asking what's wrong. I once heard that a New York edict is never to break up with someone at your apartment: Chances are it's small, and afterward every tiny crevice — or the dent in your cheap Ikea couch — will remind you of your ex.\n\n\"I think public breakups are as common as they've ever been, but they might've been amplified through social media, which creates the illusion that public breakups are a thing,\" Julie Nguyen, a certified dating coach at the Hily dating app, says. \"In Gen Z, it can be uncomfortable to break up, and a public setting can often be used as a way to emotionally manage the intensity by not giving the person an opportunity to crash out.\"\n\nFor the bartenders, back-of-house workers, and servers helping people navigate their \"it's not you, it's me\" speeches, that's spawned its own mini break-up economy.\n\n\"If you're going through a breakup, make sure to tip well, because the service staff in the back of house, we're going to try to support you however we can,\" Denbro says.\n\nGetting into a relationship is an investment. Back in 2024, I calculated the cost of getting a successful relationship off the ground and found that singles had to pony up around $650 to move forward with their matches. Climbing out of a relationship is similarly costly — especially if you cohabitate. The cost of the singles tax — how much more solo renters pay annually to live alone compared to couples — is above $7,000. Even if you don't live with that formerly special someone, you are likely to incur some costs from a breakup, especially if you've been divvying up various costs. That begets another economic question: Who pays in a public break-up?\n\nEmma, a bartender at Ethyl's — a New York City bar listed as one of the best spots in the city to break up — witnessed a couple come in on a packed Saturday night. The woman turned to her then-boyfriend and asked him why she had caught him kissing her male best friend. Then, she threw his phone to the ground. The now-ex-boyfriend quietly paid for their margaritas. Bela, another bartender at Ethyl's, says that one-half of a Gen X couple came in already drunk, and the couple split up on the spot over her drinking. When the inebriated member of the defunct twosome went to pay, her debit card declined. The now-ex-boyfriend there ended up paying and tipping well.\n\nGabrielle Macafee, a 30-year-old chef and writer, has witnessed the higher-end version of a public split. She was working at a small tasting menu restaurant in Brooklyn when a \"morose\" couple came in. As their conversation grew more emotional, the staff took notice. Halfway through the $130 tasting menu, the man stood up and left.\n\n\"My teammates and I were like, wait, how do we handle this? He's gone. You can only hold the food for so long,\" Macafee says. Eventually, the woman left behind said she'd just pay for both meals. \"We offered to send her the rest, but obviously, she just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.\"\n\nThere is also an art to choosing where to have the public breakup, if it must be done outside the comfort of your home. Macafee thinks somewhere that's a step above a dive bar in a neutral neighborhood — one that's mutually convenient, but not a place you frequent — is an ideal spot.\n\n\"I wouldn't recommend choosing a place that's in your neighborhood or a spot that you visit,\" Nguyen, the dating coach, says. \"You don't want either of you to feel dread going back, or tie bad memories to a spot they love. A neutral, quiet outdoor setting is the best play.\"\n\nWhile it's good advice, it can also make for breakup patterns. One Business Insider editor recalled getting dumped by three separate paramours at the same park in Chicago. There are also a few common signs that your bar or restaurant outing might not end with an intact relationship. Denbro, the former line cook, says that one tell-tale sign that things were not going well was when a couple kept changing their order, or when one half of the couple decided after the fact that they wanted something different. Duplicative orders — like each ordering their own appetizers and entrées at the family-style restaurant — were also a tip off.\n\nAt one breakup that Macafee witnessed, the duo had different wines, perhaps marking the end of the conviviality that would lead you to split a bottle with a lover. AB Soria, a general manager of a restaurant in Chicago who's worked in the industry since 1995, tells me that if you're planning on ending things, a seat at the bar is the way to go.\n\n\"If you're going to sit down at the table, I just feel like that's kind of cruel. Because then it's you're anticipating having a dinner and spending time there — and then to get broken up with, and then you're just stuck sitting there — is horrible,\" Soria says. \"At the bar, at least, I feel like there's more of an ability for the bartender to see what's going on, and then also make sure that whoever's left at the bar is OK.\"\n\nTiming is another complicating factor in the art of the public breakup. There's what's colloquially known as \"breakup season,\" the time around the end of the year when folks take stock of what they want and don't want. That can align with what dating coach Amy Nobile Messing says is generally a pivotal time in a relationship: The three-month mark is decision time. If you participated in a late-summer, early-fall tryst, your time might be up come years' end. Messing says she's coached many people to break up in a coffee shop — she feels like there's less pressure there.\n\n\"Here's the thing — unless it's a total shock — usually it's not a shock, usually it's like, 'Things haven't been great. I really think we should talk and meet at our coffee shop',\" Messing says. \"There's already an energy of separation, and so it just lends itself to paying separately.\"\n\nIronically, some of the impetus for a public breakup might be financial.\n\nChristine Hargrove, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Georgia and the assistant director of the university's Love and Money Center, says that daters are increasingly comingling their finances without a set structure in place — they may not have the formality of a shared bank account, but are informally splitting expenses like rent and food. That makes sense in our increasingly costly times. The downside, though, is that a breakup can feel even more heightened in those situations. Disentangling shared finances — even those informal ones — can feel like a threat, Hargrove says.\n\n\"People get really emotional when they feel financially threatened. Frankly, people can behave in unexpected ways when they're experiencing that level of threat,\" Hargrove says. That can lead to a public uncoupling, where folks hope to leverage social norms to head off more intense emotional reactions.\n\nThere is some good financial news: Messing says break-ups shouldn't be costly. If you have to take it outside, she advises against ordering food. But if you do crack open the menu, avoid anything fancy.\n\n\"You don't want to be eating a crab claw when you're breaking up. You don't want to have a mouthful of shrimp,\" Messing says. If you have to eat, maybe get a muffin or something you can nibble on — nothing too involved. Get a to-go cup, and try to keep the spending to around $5 to $10.\n\n\"I really think it should be minimal spending. I think it should be coffee. I think it should be maybe one drink,\" Messing says. \"It should be commensurate with what's happening, and what's happening is the end of something.\"\n\nThat's a spot of good wallet news for those ending their relationships. And, emotionally, there is a light on the other side of the public break-up tunnel. Macafee, the chef and writer, loves to frequent her favorite neighborhood diner. Over the summer, she found herself there, getting broken up with.\n\n\"This little doowoop song comes on, and I've never heard it before, but it was like, 'Breaking up is hard to do.' It was just that line over and over and over again,\" she says. \"And then I was trying not to laugh at the irony that that was playing in my little diner that I love so much as this woman is eviscerating my heart.\"\n\nIn the case of Macafee's breakup, the now-ex paid. Still, she was worried that her favorite spot would be tainted forever. It's a conundrum that every public dumper or dumpee has likely encountered, seeing their ghostly selves sitting in the windows of that random bar or restaurant. When I found out that the ice cream store I was once dumped at had closed, it felt bittersweet — a version of me that had once been there (and split the bill!) would no longer be able to haunt it. I wouldn't want to go through the breakup again, but it was nice to have a physical marker of a version of myself — heartbroken and lost — that I would hopefully never be again.\n\nFor her part, Macafee continued going to the diner, powering through the lingering sadness that would arise every time she came in to write or gab with a friend. Ironically, she went in the other day and heard that same break-up song again.\n\n\"After the breakup, I still went, but definitely, every time I would go, it'd give me this pang of sadness that, over time, just heals. Now I don't have that anymore,\" Macafee says. \"As I'm dating somebody else now and I'm falling in love, now it's just this pillar that I'm kind of tethered to, and I can look at and recognize my own growth and my own love stories as they unfold and break down.\"\n\nJuliana Kaplan is a senior reporter on the economy team, where she covers the labor force, kitchen table economics, and the people behind the numbers.",

    "fullText": "Today, Windows 11 powers over a billion devices and supports millions of apps across business, creativity, education, gaming and productivity. For decades, our commitment to openness and compatibility, in partnership with our global community of developers, has enabled a rich and enduring ecosystem. However, users are increasingly seeing apps override their settings, install additional software or alter core Windows experiences without their awareness or consent. And your feedback is clear: Windows must both remain an open platform and be secure by default — protecting the integrity of your experience regardless of the apps installed. Our developers and ecosystem partners echo this need. They have called for stronger, more consistent security foundations in the operating system. Windows is evolving to take more accountability to place you firmly in a consent‑first model by making app and AI agent behavior transparent, decisions reversible and access limited to clearly approved capabilities. At the same time, we remain committed to app compatibility and will provide developers with the tools and guidance needed to adapt to this strengthened security model.\n\nMicrosoft has made security a top priority, investing deeply through company‑wide efforts like the Secure Future Initiative to make Windows more secure by default and focused on helping organizations prevent, manage and recover from incidents through the Windows Resiliency Initiative along with our ecosystem partners. We’ve strengthened Windows with security controls designed to meet customer needs, delivered through capabilities like Smart App Control and Administrator protection. Building on this, we are starting new SFI efforts for Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent in Windows. This establishes a more robust security model that advances app transparency and user consent, with features that make app behavior more visible and app permissions easier to understand and manage.\n\nWith Windows Baseline Security Mode, Windows will move toward operating with runtime integrity safeguards enabled by default. These safeguards ensure that only properly signed apps, services and drivers are allowed to run, helping to protect the system from tampering or unauthorized changes. Users and IT administrators will still have the flexibility to override these safeguards for specific apps when needed. Developers can also check whether these protections are active and whether any exceptions have been granted — giving them insight and control over the conditions under which their apps run.\n\nWith User Transparency and Consent, we are bringing a more consistent and intuitive approach to how Windows communicates security decisions. Just like on your smartphone, Windows will now prompt you when apps try to access sensitive resources — like your files, camera or microphone — or when they attempt to install other unintended software. These prompts are designed to be clear and actionable, and you’ll always have the ability to review and change your choices later. Apps and AI agents will also be expected to meet higher transparency standards, giving both users and IT administrators better visibility into their behaviors. These updates raise the bar for security and privacy on Windows, while giving you more control and confidence in how your system and data are accessed.\n\nWindows has a long-standing tradition as an open platform. We will continue to preserve what has made it successful: freedom to install any app and openness to every developer. Building on that foundation, Windows Baseline Security Mode and User Transparency and Consent are grounded in a set of principles that put users clearly at the center.\n\nWe recognize that change takes time. That’s why this will roll out through a phased approach guided by clear principles – developed in close partnership with developers, enterprises and ecosystem partners to ensure a smooth and thoughtful transition. We’ve already begun this work alongside some of them to shape the early direction. We’re learning and adjusting from their feedback and perspectives as we refine our approach to stronger security, user transparency and consent, and how this evolution of Windows supports their needs.\n\nJacob DePriest, CISO and CIO at 1Password, says, “We’re excited to see Microsoft’s commitment to hardening desktop app security by making app behavior more transparent and strengthening security by default. As more people continue to rely on SaaS apps, agents and AI-driven tools, clarity and consent at the operating system level are critical to protecting sensitive data without adding friction. The focus on user transparency and choice for security is something we deeply value at 1Password.”\n\nMichael Draper, VP of Global Consumer Trust at Adobe, says “Adobe has always taken a proactive approach to security and we are collaborating across the ecosystem to strengthen customer protection. These efforts align with our broader focus on trust and we appreciate the opportunity to work alongside companies that share this commitment to keeping people safe.”\n\nAlex Ionescu, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at CrowdStrike, says, “CrowdStrike is looking forward to being an early partner in the development of a new, more secure and resilient runtime model for Windows applications, which helps raise the bar for user security and privacy. When applications and agentic workloads are well-behaved and respect user consent settings with proper security boundaries, security software can better protect users from attackers with reduced performance overhead.”\n\nElise Murphy, Head of Game Security at Electronic Arts, says, “At EA, delivering great player experiences through fair and competitive play is foundational to how we build games. We support platform initiatives that build stronger foundations for security and integrity, and raise the cost of cheating.”\n\nRaycast is a popular productivity tool used by developers and professionals. Thomas Paul Mann, Co-founder and CEO of Raycast, says, “At Raycast, privacy and security have always been core to how we build. As a tool that works deeply with Windows, we believe users deserve full transparency about what apps can do. This matters even more as AI agents start to act on their behalf. We’re excited to support User Transparency and Consent and shape it together.”\n\nNow, we’re expanding the conversation to our broader community. Through upcoming blogs and dedicated feedback channels, we’ll invite you to engage with us, share your insights and help refine this journey. Together, we can strengthen the Windows ecosystem and build the next 40 years of innovation — grounded in trust, transparency and user consent.",

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

But I didn't find Danny, my husband, until I was in my 30s, and once I did, I wanted to spend as much time with him as I could — to catch up on the years we hadn't known each other.\n\nWe met in 2017 and married two years later. Between us, we had five children. I was working in hotel management and helping a friend build her own business, while Danny had been running his own business for years.\n\nAfter we started investing in property and found our strengths complemented each other, I suggested we try running a property management company together. Six years later, we now own £10 million ($13.6 million) worth of property.\n\nWhile I wouldn't suggest to everyone that they should start a company with their partner, the setup has worked really well for us because we've put practices in place to protect our relationship.\n\nWe live in a no-blame culture — both in work and at home. Blame builds resentment. I've seen this a number of times when couples are in business together, and it doesn't end well.\n\nWhen one of us has done something wrong, we don't blame each other; we never make it public, but instead coach each other in private.\n\nInstead of finding fault with each other when something goes wrong, we look at what needs to happen now. What is the next step to take responsibility?\n\nEarly on, we decided that if we were going to go into business together, it was our responsibility to keep our relationship strong and healthy.\n\nIf our relationship broke down, so would the family lives of our kids and our business.\n\nOne very practical way we have done this is by sticking to the 777 rule. Every seven days, we go on a simple date — it might be just a walk or a coffee. Every seven weeks, we may have a bigger, longer date, and every seven months, we take a short holiday, just the two of us.\n\nWe also keep the romance alive — making sure we consistently have sex, making it a goal to be intimate with each other at least 86 times a year, a figure based on a statistic about how much sex healthy couples have. We've both got tattoos that read \"~86\" — just to remind us of how important physical intimacy is.\n\nEvery Sunday, we sit down as a family and make a plan for the week. It's here we make space for work, family, and couple time. Every single thing is on the family calendar.\n\nWe make every effort not to talk about work outside our working hours. If Danny attempts to show me a spreadsheet at 11 p.m., I'll ask him why he is showing me — it isn't work time. Family vacations are, for the most part, work-free.\n\nOccasionally, we don't have a choice — we'll have to work unexpectedly. When this happens, we don't try to multitask family and work. We build in the time we need to work, and get it done during that timeframe.\n\nYou may think that, as joint-business founders, we'd spend all our time together, but we actually work several times apart each week, as our working styles are different.\n\nDanny likes working from coffee shops, whereas I need a quiet space — usually at home. We divide and conquer tasks — often taking meetings separately.\n\nHowever, we really enjoy each other's company — we're obsessed with each other — so we love working together too.\n\nIt's imperative that we communicate clearly with each other, never assuming we know what the other person is thinking.\n\nIt becomes passive-aggressive and can be harmful to the relationship, which, in turn, is harmful to business. Both of us are honest, even blunt, with each other, but always in a kind way, and always in private.\n\nThe reason working together as a couple has worked is because we have put considerable energy into our relationship and ourselves.\n\nWe've both been prepared to hold up a mirror to ourselves, asking what we might need to change, and we've prioritized stretching our relationship.\n\nI wouldn't have gone into business with just anyone, but it works really well with Danny.",

    "description": "Ford once predicted it would sell 150,000 electric pickups each year. Instead, it recorded another multi-billion-dollar loss in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Ford's electric vehicle business lost nearly $5 billion last year — and CEO Jim Farley says the company got the message.\n\n\"So I think the customer has spoken. That's the punchline,\" he said during Tuesday's earnings call.\n\nFord's EV unit posted a $4.8 billion loss in 2025, as sales of its Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit fell 14% from a year earlier.\n\nNow, the automaker is reshaping its electric strategy — shifting toward lower-cost, high-volume EVs and leaning harder into hybrids. It's a reversal of Ford's early strategy of electrifying its most iconic, priciest vehicles first, betting that brand loyalty and subsidies would offset sticker shock.\n\nFord was one of the earliest legacy American automakers to directly challenge Tesla with mass-market EVs.\n\nThe Mustang Mach-E arrived in December 2020 as a rival to the Tesla Model Y. In mid-2022, Ford launched the F-150 Lightning.\n\nOn paper, the bet was simple: electrify the century-old carmaker's two most iconic nameplates to leapfrog EV startups.\n\nEarly enthusiasm was strong. Ford said it received nearly 200,000 reservations for the Lightning and projected annual sales of 150,000 units.\n\nThat early momentum faded — and never materialized into the high-volume sales Ford was hoping for.\n\nIn 2025, Ford sold 27,307 F-150 Lightnings — down 18.5% from 2024 — and 51,620 Mustang Mach-Es, roughly flat year over year.\n\nSales figures were even more stark after the $7,500 federal tax credit ended last September. The F-150 Lightning's estimated sales dropped from 5,197 units in December 2024 to just 1,724 a year later, according to Ford Authority.\n\nMeanwhile, US EV sales declined while hybrid demand climbed. For example, Ford sold 84,934 hybrid F-150s last year, a 15% increase.\n\nSo, the company is switching up its plans.\n\nThe company has since ended production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning. It will return at an undisclosed time as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV — a battery-powered truck with a gas generator onboard.\n\nFord expects the new model will have improved range and increased towing capacity, both of which were concerns for early F-150 Lightning adopters.\n\n\"We're betting on hybrid across our lineup, and EREV where it makes sense,\" Farley said during the call. \"Like a large truck, where towing is a really important application, and both PHEV (plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles) and pure electric will definitely not work.\"\n\nAt the same time, Ford is developing a new \"universal\" EV platform designed for lower-cost, high-volume vehicles.\n\nThe first model — a roughly $30,000 midsize pickup — is expected in 2027. Ford plans to build at least five vehicles off the platform, potentially including SUVs and commercial vans.\n\n\"We aren't just building compliance vehicles at Ford. We're launching a cost-efficient, universal EV platform that will drive profitable growth,\" Farley added. \"Tesla's shown that they could, we can make money in that market, even without subsidy from the government at the right cost level.\"\n\nIt follows a trend in the auto industry. Other major automakers — including Toyota, Subaru, Rivian, Nissan, and Chevrolet — are planning launches for sub-$50,000 EVs this year.\n\nStill, Ford expects its EV business to remain in the red for several more years. CFO Sherry House said the company is targeting break-even for the segment around 2029.\n\nInvestors have taken a cautious view of the company's long-term financial health. Ford missed earnings estimates for the quarter, reporting 13 cents adjusted estimated earnings per share versus analysts' estimates of 19 cents.\n\n\"On paper, it's a big miss, but I don't think it's a big deal,\" John Rosevear, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"Ford's guidance for 2026 anticipates nice year-over-year increases in cash flow, as well as higher capital expenditures — all stuff that the market will almost certainly like.\"",

    "description": "From drafting documents to reclaiming family time, these solopreneurs explain how AI is changing the way they work, decide, and lead their businesses.",
    "fullText": "When Pete Srodoski meets with a new executive coaching client these days, he can do more in-depth work more quickly, thanks to ChatGPT.\n\nSrodoski, who founded the coaching firm Roll With the Punches in 2021, used to spend hours with clients discussing what should be included in strategic documents. Now, he uses ChatGPT to draft those documents alongside his clients in about 10 minutes.\n\nWith AI handling the initial framework, Srodoski and his clients can jump right into fine-tuning strategic plans and key job descriptions.\n\n\"That allows us to go deeper, go further, actually take those plans and make actionable items,\" he tells Business Insider.\n\nSrodoski is one of three solopreneurs who spoke with Business Insider about how they're using AI to streamline mundane decision-making — like writing initial drafts, formatting emails, or editing social media posts. The time and mental energy saved allows them to focus on the most critical decisions for their businesses and their clients, they say.\n\n\"We want to make the most impact for our time,\" Srodoski says — and AI can help.\n\nGeorgia Fort, founder of Stories by Georgia Fort, is an independent journalist in Minnesota who started using AI about 18 months ago. She uses ChatGPT to format her newsletters and social media posts, and OpusClip to edit videos for social media.\n\nShe estimates that using those services has freed five to ten hours in her workweek — time that she can now apply to the in-depth reporting she's known for.\n\nUltimately, \"the biggest impact is increased output,\" Fort says. With AI assistance, she's able to post more content on social media and release newsletters regularly, something she struggled with in the past.\n\nAn added bonus, she says, is that utilizing AI makes it just a bit easier to find the work-life balance that many solopreneurs struggle with.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's a meal I get to sit down and have with my kids,\" Fort says.\n\nDusti Arab, owner of The Reinvention Co., a boutique marketing firm, says AI is integrated into nearly every aspect of her workday. Because of that, \"I don't think I've put up so much high-quality content, ever,\" she says.\n\nFor Arab, who has ADHD, managing the constant decisions that a solopreneur must make was draining. She would often worry about missing a small detail, which distracted her from higher-level thinking.\n\nNow, she uses Wispr Flow to take voice notes throughout the day on topics like client communications and content ideas. Then, she imports those into Notion AI, which combines access to Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to help her turn her notes into briefs.\n\n\"If you use AI to process the brain dump first, the deliverable comes out way better,\" Arab says.\n\nHer efforts with AI and being vocal about how she uses it are also paying off in a different way — clients now reach out to her specifically for advice on how to use it. She often guides them in using AI to delegate more effectively.\n\n\"Once the raw notes exist, you can use AI to turn the brain dump into a clear brief, a task list, and a handoff that someone else can actually execute,\" she says.\n\nLike Arab, Srodoski is often the one to introduce his clients to AI, specifically ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, the platforms he uses. Often, the response is \"awe,\" he says.\n\nLast week, for example, a client shared that the time involved with pricing jobs had become a major roadblock in his business. Using ChatGPT, Srodoski guided him in creating a price book based on the previous three years' sales data.\n\n\"He was smiling ear to ear, saying that this would have cost him a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor time to get this pulled off,\" Srodoski says.\n\nWhile clients are often enthusiastic about AI, part of Srodoski's coaching is now emphasizing the decisions that leaders shouldn't outsource to AI.\n\nRecently, he had a client who wanted to confront an underperforming vendor. The client was planning to draft an email using ChatGPT, but Srodoski stopped him.\n\n\"Get on the phone. See how they respond,\" he recalls saying. During the phone call, Srodoski's client was able to explain himself, empathize with the vendor, clarify a misunderstanding, and create a solution.\n\n\"That's a leadership decision you can't do with ChatGPT,\" Srodoski says.",

    "fullText": "\"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\"\n\nIrish playwright Samuel Beckett's famous quote has become Corporate America's new mantra.\n\nFrom Okta to Salesforce to Blackstone, executives told BI's Sarah E. Needleman and Ana Altchek getting it wrong is ok. Just do it quickly and learn from it.\n\nThe tech industry has always been a big proponent of failing fast, but Corporate America is now catching on thanks to AI. The tech allows companies to quickly launch new tools to a wide group.\n\nAnd, perhaps more importantly, it's a way for executives to prove the big money they are spending on AI isn't going to waste. (Hence why they want you to fail fast.)\n\nIt's not just for launching products either.\n\nEven the ideation phase can be quickly sped up with chatbots that can talk through ideas. What previously might have taken executives (or, more likely, their underlings) hours of research can get figured out a lot faster.\n\nThere are still some hurdles with the fail-fast approach.\n\nWhat does failing even look like? There isn't a big, red alarm that goes off every time an AI project fails. (Although that sure would be fun.) Executives will say they set clear guidelines for a prototype beforehand, but a tool's benefits can be nuanced. And maybe you just need a little bit more time to really make it sing. All that makes it a lot harder to decide when to pull the plug.\n\nBuilding airplanes in the sky. The rush to get things out can lead to the belief you'll just fix things on the fly. But that's a dangerous precedent. Just ask the video game industry. When games came in physical copies you had to blow on to get working, companies made sure their product was bulletproof. Nowadays, they can digitally ship a game knowing an update for a glitch wont be far behind. It's a dangerous game that can cause major headaches.\n\nOpening the floodgates. A formalized product launch slows things down, but it also makes sure everyone is on the same page. A massive greenlight risks a lack of standardization. That might not seem like a big deal for a prototype. It becomes a bigger problem down the road if the product needs to be reconfigured to fit into the company's wider tech stack.",

    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has heard every version of the same question over the years. How do you get rich? How do you build a billion-dollar company? What's the shortcut? On most podcasts, the answers come packaged as business advice. On Bobbi Althoff's show, they arrive somewhere between awkward silence and dry humor.\n\nThat contrast is part of what made a 2023 episode of \"The Really Good Podcast\" stand out. Althoff, known for her signature deadpan delivery and intentionally uncomfortable interview style, steered the conversation from Cuban's early days sleeping on floors with roommates into a blunt question about her own future.\n\n\"Do you think I could be a billionaire one day?\" she asked.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nPut professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.\n\nCuban told her yes — with a reality check attached.\n\n\"If you want to be,\" he said. \"But being a billionaire takes luck. I mean you could be rich. I mean you can be well off if you bust your a**. And that's not to say a lot of people bust their a** and don't make it, but there's like a path.\"\n\nCuban's answer drew a line he has talked about for years. Billionaire status often comes down to timing, scale, and luck. Getting rich, he said, is more repeatable.\n\nCuban fans know his own fortune was built during the dot-com boom, when he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion — a deal he's often credited with closing at the perfect time, just before the bubble burst.\n\n\"There's like a path if you have your own business and you know how to sell,\" Cuban told her. He added that building sales skills and growing a business creates the foundation for wealth long before anyone starts thinking about billions.\n\nTrending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\n\"If you get good at selling and you can build your business then you can start as a millionaire,\" he said. \"And then if you get lucky then you never know where it takes you from there.\"\n\nThe exchange fit neatly into Althoff's style. When Cuban pointed out she had not been strong at selling yet, she replied with a flat \"thank you,\" keeping the tone somewhere between joke and business lesson. Cuban responded the same way he often does with founders and entrepreneurs — monetize the opportunity.",

On Feb. 5, police served a search warrant at the establishment. Gang suppression officers were on the scene, according to the release.\n\nThe GGPD’s Sgt. Nick Jensen told The Orange County Register that police found DD Café employees serving customers while clad in bikinis, as well as in what the newspaper described as “various states of undress.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the business was operating as a “bikini cafe.” The Yelp page for the business shows photos of employees in bikinis, and lists it in business categories for “coffee & tea,” “juice bars & smoothies” and “adult entertainment.”\n\nJensen also told The Orange County Register that the business owners were among the 17 people arrested in the Feb. 5 bust.\n\nThe café violated public nudity and alcohol regulations among other Garden Grove municipal codes, the GGPD sergeant said. The business was not permitted to sell alcohol at the location, the newspaper reported, citing authorities.\n\nIn addition to the arrests, DD Café has also been red-tagged, according to police. This means the business is required to cease operations until the various violations are addressed, Jensen told The Orange County Register. The business is currently listed as closed on Google.\n\nThe owners of DD Café could not be reached for comment. A GGPD spokesperson did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nThe police investigation into and arrests comes after a video describing the Orange County establishment as a “strip club” went viral on TikTok.\n\n“So I went to a strip club today by accident, and I know what you're thinking. ‘By accident?’ No, actually, for real,” user @dosdaygirl, identified by CBS News as Paulina Abena, says in a Feb. 2 video that has amassed nearly 2 million views.\n\nAbena describes DD Café as “topless” in the TikTok, stating that she visited after searching for coffee shops in her area and finding the now-closed establishment. “They meant double D, like boobs,” she says of the business’s name. “So I walk in and everybody's naked. Quite literally, they're all naked. … I'm the only non-naked woman in the place.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPolice have previously taken action against a “bikini café” in Garden Grove, Jensen told The Orange County Register.\n\nHe also told the newspaper that authorities believe that similar establishments are operating elsewhere in the area.",

Executives say they can't afford to meticulously test ideas in isolation if they want to outpace their competitors, and AI makes it easy to deploy new offerings at scale anyway.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" said Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, which has rolled out around 120 AI pilots and features over the past two years, keeping half and scrapping the rest. \"You can spin up a lot more pilots at the same time.\"\n\nThis so-called fail-fast method isn't new, as tech startups have been doing it for decades. It's now gaining traction among larger, established businesses due to the AI boom.\n\nLeaders say they're under pressure from their boards and shareholders to justify their AI spending, and that the fail-fast approach is helping them meet the moment.\n\n\"The stakes are higher, the risks are bigger, and to keep pace with the innovation churn, we need to fail faster than ever,\" Cisco's senior vice president and global innovation officer, Guy Diedrich, told Business Insider.\n\nFor some companies, fail fast isn't just a mindset — it represents a new reality driven by AI efficiency gains.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said the cloud-data platform company has rolled out numerous pilot programs, often moving from a planning meeting on Monday to a demo by Friday. With its agentic support system, he said, many cases that once took hours to debug can now be resolved in about 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, something like preparing a customer briefing for an executive used to take hours. Now, Ramaswamy said, it can be done in a minute by asking a sales agent.\n\nJohn Stecher, the chief technology officer at Blackstone, told Business Insider that the \"fail fast\" mindset has long been a mainstay in the engineering world, but AI tools have enabled companies to accelerate development timelines.\n\n\"Our software engineers, by quantifiable metrics, are about 2x more effective than they were in 2024 with writing code,\" Stecher said, adding that they now have the ability to deliver faster and higher quality work.\n\nHe said the \"blocking-and-tackling part of software development and engineering,\" including tasks like writing unit tests and higher-quality code, allows engineers to \"deploy more robust,\" reliable, and secure code, so that workers spend less time fixing bugs and more time building. That increase in productivity allows teams to build prototypes more quickly and launch them to users faster.\n\nRamaswamy similarly said that a lot of the heavy lifting on engineering teams for tasks like boilerplate code, tests, and migrations happens much faster. That frees workers to spend more time on tasks that require judgment, architecture, and design, he said.\n\nMoving at warp speed comes with risks, however.\n\nLast year, Salesforce launched an AI agent designed to answer customer queries, and it recommended a competitor's application to a user. The user then wrote about the snafu on LinkedIn, said Joe Inzerillo, president of enterprise and AI at the software company.\n\nAnother time, one of Salesforce's newly released AI agents provided a customer with false information gleaned from old web pages that had been removed from its website but were still crawlable by search engines. The error was discovered during a review of conversations the agent was having with users.\n\nThough both incidents exposed early-stage gaps to users, Inzerillo said they also revealed important insights into how users interact with the products and how experiences can be improved. \"We're going into every single deployment as an experiment to try to learn something,\" said Inzerillo.\n\nThe consequences of failing fast, however, can be worse if companies overlook important security measures.\n\nStecher said companies in general shouldn't necessarily deploy more products just because they can now do so more easily. He said firms need a \"robust checks and balances\" system and have data privacy and security controls in place from the get-go, or they'll pay the price with outages or cyber issues.\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy said that while the \"fail fast\" concept is reappearing, the current version is \"less about recklessness and more about shortening the feedback loop.\" He said the phrase \"iterating rapidly\" is a more accurate way to describe the company's approach to building with AI.\n\n\"We identify areas that we know are going to be generally positively impacted by AI, but set up small, almost weekly, goals,\" Ramaswamy said. \"This way, we can adjust and know when things are working well and when we need to course correct.\"",

    "fullText": "Sen. Kevin Harris (D-Prince George's) speaks with Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery) on the Senate floor Tuesday. Harris introduced a bill that could let utility companies to build and operate power-generation infrastructure. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)\n\nSen. Kevin Harris is not sure his bill allowing investor-owned utilities to get back in the business of generating power — and using ratepayer dollars to do so — is the answer to high energy prices and constrained demand in the state.\n\nBut the Prince George’s County Democrat is sure that something needs to be done.\n\n“We need to have all possible options out there for the state of Maryland. Who knows if this is the right one, but we won’t know until we actually do the deep dive, have the discussions and figure out what’s best for our constituents,” said Harris of Senate Bill 954 that he is sponsoring.\n\nThe bill, which lays out a pathway for investor-owned electric utilities to use ratepayer dollars to build power generation infrastructure in Maryland, has the support of Exelon — the owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco. The Chicago-based utility has been campaigning hard for the idea, including in TV commercials that aired in Maryland during the Super Bowl.\n\nBut consumer advocates and environmental groups argue that putting additional costs on the backs of customers would be deeply harmful amid already-high costs. They warn that high infrastructure spending by utilities is part of the reason for the current high rates, and allowing further construction would make matters worse.\n\nMaryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who is tasked with representing utility ratepayers in the state, said in a statement that he believes “the Exelon bill is anything but affordable.”\n\n“Turning new business over to Exelon unnecessarily exposes customers to the Exelon utilities’ long record of exceeding cost projections and of cost overruns,” Lapp said.\n\nIn Maryland, the utilities, which control the distribution of power to homes and businesses across the state, are separate from the companies that generate power and supply it to the grid.\n\nThe utilities enjoy monopolies in their service territories and are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which presides over the costs they can pass on to customers. Utilities receive reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs, and a guaranteed profit on top of that, often 9% or higher.\n\nCurrent law technically states that the PSC “may require or allow investor-owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities … subject to appropriate cost recovery.”\n\nHarris’ bill is considerably more specific.\n\nThe bill directs the PSC to require one or more electric companies to submit plans involving power generation, if it determines that there is a power scarcity, or that an event impacting “price stability” has occurred. The commission then has one year to approve or deny the plans.\n\nHarris said that his bill, called the Affordable Energy Act, would only allow the utilities to build renewable energy projects, but not fossil fuel projects.\n\nValencia McClure, senior vice president of government, regulatory and external affairs for Exelon’s Maryland utilities, said her company wants to focus on operating community solar farms and battery storage infrastructure, not natural gas generation. She noted that power customers who \n\n“We really are focusing on: How can we support our customers during this affordability crisis?” McClure said. “The way to do that is to — if called upon by the state — to be able to build new generation.”\n\nBut Lapp said Maryland consumers should not be paying for any increased power generation in the state through their rates, since much of the predicted strain on the regional grid isn’t actually coming from Maryland. It’s largely coming from data centers projected for other states, he said.\n\nHouse caps amount of utility employee salaries that can come out of ratepayers’ pockets\n\n“PJM projects that the Maryland Exelon utilities’ power demands decrease — not increase — through 2029.” Lapp wrote. “Aside from some relatively small data center growth in Maryland compared to PJM — growth that existing customers should not be responsible for — the Exelon utilities’ energy demands only go up modestly starting in 2030, at a growth rate much lower than historical growth rates.”\n\nHarris’ bill explicitly states that the electric utilities required or authorized to construct power facilities can recover all of their costs from ratepayers — even if some of those costs are stranded, including if the infrastructure is never built.\n\n“That’s one of the things that we would be discussing further and see what is actually needed and what is not needed,” Harris said.\n\nLapp argues that the provision is alarming.\n\n“It would give utilities unprecedented statutory protection from the consequences of building power plants that turn out to be unnecessary — a real possibility given the vast evidence suggesting that projections of data center energy demands are inflated,” Lapp wrote.\n\nIn a statement, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the company supports the measure “to make sure a large generation project doesn’t jeopardize the utility’s health or lead to higher debt costs overall, which would adversely impact customers.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the bill will be able to advance: Senate President Bill Ferguson said Tuesday that “there is a level of skepticism that exists across the caucus, and across the Senate membership” about whether it will reduce ratepayer costs.\n\n“That’s going to be the lens that we are really trying to hone in on, is whether or not a policy is going to provide long-term savings for the ratepayer,” Ferguson said.\n\nMcClure said Exelon estimates that average customer bills would increase about $2 per month for a few years, but those would turn to savings of $5 to $10 a month in the future. The company’s analysis was based on construction of 2,700 megawatts of battery storage and 1,200 megawatts of solar.\n\nFerguson said that he would “prefer that that the risk” of investment “land with investors.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\n“But there is a question that if there is a strike price or point where … the market is not generating sufficient domestic generation, whether that has to be some other market intervention to push it,” Ferguson said.\n\nLast year, lawmakers passed the Next Generation Energy Act, which included a fast-track permitting process for “dispatchable” energy projects, which can provide energy for the grid when called upon during peak times. Only two projects have been approved to move through the fast-track, under the legislation’s requirements: Two different concepts for a natural gas plant in Harford County, submitted by Constellation.\n\nConstellation, formerly an Exelon subsidiary, also proposed a battery storage project, but it did not meet requirements of the fast-track bill, even though it created a procurement specifically for battery storage.\n\nConstellation has been opposed to Exelon’s push to enter the generation game, arguing that it would crowd out competitive power producers, and that Exelon is ill-suited to enter the generation fray.\n\n“BGE doesn’t need new law to build new generation,” said Constellation spokesman Paul Adams. “BGE wants new law to guarantee a return on any investment, whether or not that investment is in the best interests of Maryland ratepayers or at the lowest cost. Unlike them, Constellation is ready and willing to put our own capital on the line, with no guarantee of profit. It seems only reasonable that if you aren’t willing to take on any risk, you should take no profit.”",

This includes employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development, and others. \n\nSchindler said America's large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles would not be eligible for the programs.\n\n\"While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we've decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,\" he wrote.\n\nGoogle has made similar offers to employees in other orgs over the past year. Last June, Google offered buyouts to some US-based employees as it cracked down on its return-to-office mandate. In October, it offered buyouts to YouTube employees as part of a reorganization.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "If you're starting your career at PwC, deciding where you'll do it has gotten a lot easier.\n\nThe Big Four firm cut the number of US locations where entry-level consultants can start working to just 13, BI's Polly Thompson exclusively reports.\n\nLimiting the options — new hires could previously choose any of the 72 US offices — is about building a greater sense of community among junior employees early in their careers, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Polly.\n\nIt's an example of how PwC is evolving in the AI era. Polly previously reported on the firm's launch of a learning initiative to train workers in specific skills necessary for AI. It also created a new career path aimed at engineers.\n\nIt's not just PwC. Polly has done a fantastic job covering consulting firms and their attempt to use AI without upending their business. AI agents are still falling short of outright replacing human consultants, but the CEO of one AI training giant told BI the models are learning fast.\n\nIn the meantime, AI use by entry-level employees remains a key issue.\n\nOn the one hand, the tech can automate a lot of the mind-numbing work that juniors get bogged down with early on. On the other hand, skipping that initial work means losing foundational knowledge that is crucial down the road.\n\nThe AI-for-juniors issue isn't specific to consulting.\n\nThe risks posed by training young workers on AI are universal. And with so much emphasis on benefiting from AI, companies can't delay their decision much longer.\n\n\"What differentiates outperformers in 2026 won't be strategy; it will be execution,\" Paul Griggs, CEO of PwC US, told me last month when discussing big themes for the year.\n\nLeaders need to be \"hyper intentional around discipline, around road maps, around building teams that are measured based on what they execute,\" Griggs added.\n\nTwo senior bankers I spoke with last month raised questions about how to use AI efficiently early in your career. They debated the benefits of expediting a junior's path toward more impactful work, alongside the risks of creating a knowledge gap by skipping early steps.\n\nIt's a tricky balance. Forgoing it entirely means you risk falling behind your competitors. Leaning in too heavily risks losing the attribute your clients still pay you big bucks for: human judgment.\n\n\"You're missing some of this basic training that's actually a very important underpin and foundation to your more sophisticated evaluation and judgment of things at a later stage in your career,\" one of the bankers said about outsourcing early work to AI.",

    "description": "Salesforce's senior VP of business technology said he tries to teach his kids resilience, and it's a skill is important for entry-level talent, too.",
    "fullText": "As companies rethink how they train early-career workers in a job market shaped by AI, Salesforce executive Andy White said resilience is top of mind for him — both at work and at home.\n\nWhite oversees Salesforce's implementation of Slackbot, an AI personal agent that generates responses based on conversations, files, and workflows inside Slack.\n\nAs White raises his son and daughter during a period of rapid technological change, he said he preaches to his kids the importance of powering through moments that don't go as planned. He said resilience is pivotal and that it's important for people to focus on doing the hard things and being OK when things don't go as expected.\n\nThe senior vice president of business technology said he recently spoke with his daughter about the importance of dealing with situations rather than merely labeling them as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\n\"Hard is hard,\" White told Business Insider. \"Hard isn't necessarily bad.\"\n\nExpectations, he said, are the \"destroyer of hope and joy,\" and that when things don't go as planned, it often turns out to be a good thing down the line, even if it doesn't seem that way in the moment.\n\n\"It's when we look back, and it's like, 'Oh man, I'm glad that didn't go the way I expected,'\" White said. \"But when you're in it, it's really hard.\"\n\nThe resilience lesson is one White also thinks is relevant for entry-level workers. While junior hires often arrive ready to use new tools and deliver a \"pretty high output,\" he said, persistence is an area where some still need to grow.\n\nHe described today's entry-level talent pool as \"incredibly capable, very bright, and very driven,\" with a stronger grasp of how to use AI tools to solve problems.\n\n\"They're much more fluent at being able to leverage AI tooling in the flow of their work,\" White said.\n\nHowever, he said the group sometimes struggles when it comes to working through challenges.\n\n\"There's more willingness to give up sooner,\" he said, adding that this trait doesn't apply across the board.\n\nWhite said he's seen AI tools, such as the company's recently upgraded Slackbot, help boost entry-level workers' confidence. He said they could help reduce feelings of imposter syndrome by helping early-career workers navigate challenging situations that arise at work.\n\nWith that said, White added that workers need to stay balanced and not let tools make them \"overly confident.\" He said workers need to bring skepticism to \"any kind of information\" they get, and be diligent about reviewing sources and citations when using AI.\n\n\"If you don't believe something, read the citation, and if it doesn't have a citation, you have to assume it's a hallucination,\" White said, adding that he tells his kids the same thing.",
