The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mark Rivers, the CEO of Canyon Ranch, based in Austin. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been the CEO of Canyon Ranch, a wellness hospitality company, since September 2023. Before that, I guided the company's new development opportunities starting in 2022.\n\nJoining Canyon Ranch capped off over 25 years of experience in hospitality operations and property development at other resorts and clubs. I was the original master developer of the campus that's now the Driftwood Golf & Ranch Club in Austin, a development principal of Solage Hotels and Resorts in Napa Valley, and an executive at the Steve Wynn-founded, Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts.\n\nCanyon Ranch sits at the crossroads of hospitality and wellness. Wellness is certainly having its moment right now — and for a brand like ours, which was just named the best wellness resort in the Americas in 2025 by the Michelin Guide, this is a seminal moment to lead, redefine, and infuse our expertise and energy.\n\nWe have resorts in Tucson and Lenox, Massachusetts; the largest day spa in North America at The Venetian in Las Vegas; and a wellness club and spa in Fort Worth, Texas. We're also developing a new resort and residential community outside Austin.\n\nNot much can derail my day — I'm an optimist and highly motivated. I brush off the difficult, the impossible, and the stressful, and move on.\n\nHere's an idea of what a day in my life is like.\n\nOn a typical day, I wake up at 4 a.m., but on Mondays, I'm up at 2:45 a.m. to make the nearly three-hour drive from my home in Austin to our corporate office in Fort Worth. I live in Austin, and our company's biggest investment to date is the new resort we're building, so I like to be at or near it during most of the week.\n\nThe ride to work gives me time to listen to my favorite podcasts. My go-tos are usually Acquired or Founders, which have great insights on corporate brands and stories.\n\nIt's important to get the body moving, first and foremost.\n\nWhether at the office gym in Fort Worth or the fitness facilities at all our properties, I work out daily.\n\nI always hydrate before caffeine in the morning, stretch, and get my brain going with The New York Times Spelling Bee before dawn.\n\nI try to get some busy work and emails done early, before the day is overrun with meetings and the daily unexpected.\n\nThis is our fun morning ritual where we recreate a ranch tradition of brewed coffee served by our 'ranch hands' on staff — I can visit with coworkers and guests around a warm fire.\n\nWe meet in a eucalyptus courtyard in the center of the property. It's a warm, social morning gathering for guests and staff — a perfect way to start the day.\n\nWith properties and management sprinkled throughout the country, I'm frequently on the road visiting all of our locations. I prefer in-person human connection, but virtual meetings dominate.\n\nOn any given day, I probably have 10 to 12 meetings until 6 p.m., with a quick break for lunch.\n\nI grab a quick lunch from one of our dining outlets. These healthy, nutrient-packed meals help me with my mood and mental focus for the rest of the day.\n\nI love breakfast at almost any time of the day — egg scrambles with all sorts of veggies, a fruit bowl, or an oat bar snack.\n\nI also have an absolute sweet tooth — ice cream is a vice. I'm always grabbing coworkers and making a beeline for a quick ice cream.\n\nI try to spend time in Fort Worth with our leadership team, and balance the week between our properties and our new resort project in Austin.\n\nSpending time with our food-and-beverage, programming, spa, and health teams is especially rewarding — and it motivates me to maintain my diet and exercise regimen.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I've spent a few days each week at the 600-acre ranch, located west of Austin, where our newest resort and residential community will open in fall 2026.\n\nWe'll have the largest spa in Texas — a Women's Wellness Collective dedicated to well-being, featuring 141 rooms, outdoor adventures, and three dining outlets.\n\nI love the process of creating guest experiences, innovating and experimenting, and marshaling our teams to launch this new destination. It's something like a movie production with our cast, sets, script, imagination, and location.\n\nFor me, that means meetings with the architects and contractors, interior designers, and our teams on the campus.\n\nTennis has become a passion of mine, and I can play year-round with friends and pros in Texas.\n\nI'm not much of a TV or Netflix person, but I will follow some sporting events of my favorite teams: the Buffalo Bills, UConn Huskies, and Boise State Broncos. I share Buffalo Bills season tickets with my adult children.\n\nBefore settling in for sleep, I apply some sleep learnings and protocols from Longevity8, a program we recently launched that enables guests to enjoy a longer and healthier lifespan. I do a specific breathwork technique designed to trigger relaxation, which can be followed by journaling.\n\nTo keep my morning routine intact, I don't stay up late and barely drink alcohol. I'm early to bed — I'd rather have 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. to think, organize, and get ahead of the day than 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. for TV.",
