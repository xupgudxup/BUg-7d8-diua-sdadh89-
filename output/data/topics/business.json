    "fullText": "His parents, Giovanni and Jana Ina Zarrella, are quite well-known in the show business. Now there is also positive news about their son. Gabriel Zarrella has extended his contract with VfB Stuttgart today.\n\nThe U19 central defender has been playing with the Swabians since 2024.\n\nAccording to 'Bild', Borussia Mönchengladbach was reportedly interested in the defensive gem. There were also talks with the second division club Fürth. However, Gabriel Zarrella decided to stay in Stuttgart.\n\nFor VfB, this is an important extension, as he quickly became a key player after his signing and reached the semifinals of the German Championship with the U17 last season.\n\n\"We believe in Gabriel's prospects at VfB beyond the U19 and are pleased that he is with us,\" said Stephan Hildebrandt, Director of the Youth Academy, in the VfB press release. These are indeed promising prospects.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Jason Myers plays bass in the heavy metal band Icarus Witch and still works full-time as a senior vice president for a boutique marketing firm.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Myers, a marketing-firm executive and professional bass player in the band Icarus Witch. He is based in Pittsburgh. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started playing bass in heavy metal bands in junior high. I wanted to become a professional musician, but as soon as I got out of college in 1993, I started a side hustle doing publicity for concert promoters and record labels for in case my rock-and-roll dreams didn't pan out.\n\nThe side hustle was really a full-time day job, which made managing a serious band challenging. I'd have to book studio time at night and work until the sun came up, and I could only book shows on weekends unless I took time off from my job.\n\nIn 2003, the band I'm still in today, Icarus Witch, got signed to a label. We put out our first record in 2005 and started getting radio play. As our popularity grew, I wanted to accept longer tours. But the money you earn from touring is essentially a loan against your royalties, so I had to keep working to sustain myself.\n\nOut of a 24-hour day, the band is only on stage for maybe an hour. The rest is spent traveling, waiting, and sleeping. There was a lot of wasted time I knew I could fill, and we were entering an era of greater WiFi capabilities.\n\nAs the years passed, I started to recognize that the music industry was shrinking. People were downloading songs instead of buying CDs, and there were fewer opportunities to make money. Even though my band was successful, it felt more like a personal victory, and I realized it was time to make some adult decisions about how I would protect myself in the future.\n\nIn 2010, I was asked to join a marketing and PR startup called The Content Factory that was early into the remote work thing. I had previously worked with the owner and founder, Kari DePhillips, at another startup. Though I'd only ever done publicity and marketing for bands, Kari said that didn't matter.\n\nSoon after, my band went on tour with the veteran group Y&T, and they were gracious enough to let me work from their bus since we were following them around in a small van. When we'd stay at a hotel, I'd sit in our room after shows working, while my bandmates would check out the local bar scene and meet up with fans.\n\nThese days, my band is more selective about the shows we play because going on tour doesn't make as much financial sense as it once did. That's why you see exorbitant ticket prices when a band does decide to go out.\n\nI'm still with The Content Factory. I worked my way up from account rep to senior vice president of PR and social media marketing. I still enjoy the hell out of playing music, but the company's well-being is on my mind all the time now.\n\nWhen you're in a band on the rise, it's easy to feel invincible, like this is going to last forever. But you have to look out for yourself. No one is going to save you.\n\nI used to have this mindset that if I allowed myself to think about a Plan B, I'd somehow jinx my chances of making it big. In hindsight, I realize that's foolish. You can plan for your future and live the wild life at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.",

    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of Senegal football fans lined the streets of Dakar on Tuesday as the Lions of Teranga held a victory parade to celebrate their triumph in the Africa Cup of Nations final against Morocco.\n\nThe players and coaches brandished their trophy from an open-top bus which inched its way through immense crowds across the capital, winding towards the country's presidential palace.\n\nAs the players travelled the final stretch of their journey along the city's oceanside highway, the Corniche, fans walked and sometimes ran alongside the bus, with throngs of people lining the sidewalks.\n\nDowntown was overcome by a fever pitch of almost deafening noise -- revving engines, horns, vuvuzelas and shouting -- as the players neared the palace, where they will be officially received.\n\nIn the morning, thousands had gathered at the parade's starting point in Patte d'Oie, a working-class neighbourhood across town, wearing team jerseys, chanting, whistling and blowing vuvuzelas.\n\nAll along the route old and young, men and women turned out decked in the country's green, yellow and red colours, sometimes watching on from buildings and bridges, or even climbing on top of cars and billboards.\n\nSecurity forces were also present in large numbers, including anti-riot police.\n\nThe Senegal team made its way across the capital after arriving on a special flight from Morocco shortly before midnight on Monday, where they were greeted by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and other members of the government.\n\nSenegal won the Africa Cup of Nations when they beat hosts Morocco 1-0 in a chaotic final in Rabat on Sunday that saw the eventual champions storm off the pitch late in the game.\n\n\"I wouldn't have missed this moment for the world,\" 26-year-old fan Doudou Thiam told AFP from the parade's sidelines in the Bourguiba neighbourhood, wearing a Senegal jersey.\n\n\"The Lions are our pride and they deserve all the honours. Even if it meant staying here all day, I would have done it\", he said.\n\nA ruckus of whistles and horns has been almost constant since Senegal's victory on Sunday night, when fans flooded the streets, filling the air with honking, fireworks and the deafening roar of vuvuzelas.\n\nThe win marked Senegal's second title, after their 2022 victory over Egypt in Cameroon. It was the team's third final in just the last four editions.\n\nHortense Kenny brought her five-year-old child to Patte d'Oie to watch the parade.\n\n\"The Lions made an entire nation proud, beating the host country in those circumstances,\" she told AFP, referring to the end of the match.\n\n\"Now, all that's left is to win the World Cup. With Sadio Mane, anything is possible,\" she said, referencing the team's biggest star.\n\nHis role as peacemaker during the final -- he was the one who stayed on the pitch and persuaded his teammates to return -- has been widely praised.\n\nNearby Abdulai Sy, a 49-year-old, told AFP he felt personally touched by the victory which gave him a \"big sense of pride to also be Senegalese\".\n\nTuesday's crowd seemed unphased by a cloud of controversy surrounding their team's decision to storm off the pitch late in normal time in protest at a penalty awarded to Morocco.\n\nPrompted by Mane, they returned to the pitch and an attempted 'Panenka' penalty from Morocco's Brahim Diaz was easily saved by Senegal's goalkeeper before Pape Gueye won the game with a superb shot in extra time that stunned the Moroccan crowd.\n\nThe Moroccan FA said it had referred the incidents, including protests from Senegal players and fans, to the Confederation of African Football and FIFA.\n\nFar from Morocco, football's lucrative business side had trickled down even to the streets of Dakar on Tuesday.\n\nAmath Ndiaye, a 36-year-old street vendor who usually sells tissues, told AFP he has switched to hawking jerseys, flags, vuvuzelas and whistles for the duration of AFCON and the celebratory aftermath.\n\nOn Tuesday, he was basking in the wisdom of his decision.\n\n\"I'm doing well,\" he told AFP from Patte d'Oie, near the joyous crowd decked out in patriotic Senegalese gear and waving flags.",

    "fullText": "Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools.\n\nMore than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland.\n\nThey included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nJetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThe most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider.\n\nBuying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower.\n\nThe world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August.\n\nAt 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours.\n\nOther major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay.\n\nPrivate jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro.\n\nLondon was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose.\n\n10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai.\n\nDozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week.\n\nTuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy.",

    "description": "\"The Diary of a CEO\" host said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that using AI to translate podcasts into Spanish broadened its reach.",
    "fullText": "Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,\" Bartlett said during the \"What it Takes to Build\" panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nThe British entrepreneur and host of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast was in conversation with Jessica Lessin, the CEO of The Information, alongside Bret Taylor, formerly the co-CEO of Salesforce and CTO of Meta.\n\nBartlett said using AI tools to translate the podcasts was initially an \"expensive experiment.\" The problem he was trying to solve, he said, was reaching the untapped market of non-English speakers.\n\n\"If we're just in English, we're reaching like 10% of the world,\" Bartlett added.\n\nThere were technical challenges, too. Some languages use longer words, Bartlett said, meaning three-hour English-language conversations could become significantly longer when translated, risking the audio and video falling out of sync.\n\nTwo years ago, Bartlett announced on LinkedIn that \"The Diary of a CEO\" had hired a full-time data scientist who helped the company achieve a technological breakthrough, enabling them to use AI to translate the podcast into \"EVERY language.\"\n\nAt Davos and in the LinkedIn post, Bartlett did not elaborate on exactly how the AI translations work. Today, however, the videos show Bartlett speaking Spanish in a voice similar to his own, a shift he said had significantly expanded the podcast's reach.\n\n\"This month, 28% of my audience is Spanish,\" he said, adding that Spanish speakers now have access to interviews with some of the world's most high-profile podcast guests, citing his own interview with former first lady Michelle Obama as an example.\n\nOther guests on the podcast include former vice President Kamala Harris, Simon Cowell, and the psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nSpotify said in its \"2025 Wrapped\" press release in December 2025 that \"The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett\" was the platform's second-most-listened-to podcast globally, behind \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" On YouTube, Bartlett's podcast channel has 14.5 million subscribers.",

    "title": "Citi has quietly built a 4,000-person internal AI workforce",
    "description": "Around 4,000 employees globally have volunteered to fan out across their business units as \"AI accelerators.\"",
    "fullText": "At Citi, some of the people leading the Wall Street bank's AI push aren't part of a specialized tech team. They're colleagues a few desks over.\n\nThose employees are part of the bank's AI Champions and Accelerators program, which got off the ground in early 2024 and now counts around 4,000 people among its ranks of voluntary AI helpers. At its most basic level, the program aims to have the designated \"accelerators\" help colleagues within their business units leverage and understand AI tools. The program's approximately 25-30 \"champions\" help lead the accelerators in their line of business.\n\nCiti's program is one of many ways banks are racing to adopt AI, from offering engineers capstone-style courses to luring top tech talent by promising a seat at powerful managerial tables. To date, Citi's AI tools are available in 84 countries for 182,000 employees. Adoption of the firm's proprietary tools is above 70%, Citi CEO Jane Fraser told analysts during the bank's earnings call last week.\n\nAnd it's clear that she has high expectations for all employees, including accelerators. In a January memo, she told staff she expected \"a more disciplined, more confident\" workforce in 2026, and that AI will likely \"reshape how work gets done.\"\n\nAmong the bank's range of initiatives to encourage AI uptake, the accelerators and champions model is uniquely embedded throughout teams and based on peer-to-peer interactions, said Carey Ryan, one of the initiative's leaders and the chief of staff for the technology organization.\n\n\"A small central team would never be able to reach where we are now,\" Ryan said.\n\nTech leaders at Citi came up with the program when brainstorming how to engage a wider swath of its population with AI, Ryan said. Originally, her team only planned to have 2,500 accelerators, but they saw more interest than expected and still maintain a waitlist for the program.\n\nWhile colleagues nominate champions for the position, anyone can volunteer to be an accelerator. The only requirement is being excited about AI, Ryan said.\n\nJosh Goldsmith is the AI champion for internal audit, where he's also the head of digital solutions and innovation. He's been a part of the program since its inception, and said that \"demystifying AI\" is among its greatest successes so far.\n\n\"It's a lot different when you hear from a colleague as to how you can leverage these tools, as opposed to having someone who's, let's say, a technologist trying to push this,\" he said. \"To be able to see someone put it in action: 'Hey, they can do it! I'm just like them, I can do it as well.'\"\n\nRyan also said that the peer-to-peer approach is part of what makes the initiative work, since a more general team couldn't understand all of the job-specific AI use cases across the bank. She added that accelerators have helped host more than 100 Citi AI Days, where they hold demonstrations and answer questions.\n\nAccelerators meet with their cohorts two times each month to participate in demos, learn about new tools, get training, or talk about their recent work. Goldsmith oversees around 50 participants; between attending their meetings and his own bi-monthly champion meetings, he said he devotes between three and five hours to the program each week, on top of his usual job.\n\nThe program members can also opt into trainings on topics including agentic AI to earn visual \"AI badges,\" which they can include in their email signatures. There are no specific engagement metrics, though, and people can drop out of the program if it becomes too demanding a time commitment.\n\n\"One accelerator might have five interactions, and maybe they're five small interactions,\" Ryan said. \"Another accelerator might have one really big interaction, where they're doing something with hundreds of people.\"\n\nAmong the AI peer coaches in internal audit, between 70% and 80% have stayed in the program, Goldsmith said. He added that, despite the extra hours, participating has given him a broader perspective on AI across Citi, and \"a clear vision in terms of what's coming next.\"\n\nFor Carey, there's something of a symbiotic relationship between program leads, participants, and the rest of the bank. Accelerators will explain what they're hearing from their lines of business — where people are struggling, what they might need — as Citi continues to fine-tune its approach to AI. They have, for example, helped Citi tweak AI tools, suggesting enhancements like adding notifications and allowing employees to upload larger files.\n\n\"It's an important conduit for feedback back in,\" she said.",

CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call in November that DoorDash would invest hundreds of millions of dollars this year in key initiatives, including a global tech platform for all its brands and autonomous tech.\n\nDoorDash employees don't just work on big problems, though. The company requires its corporate workforce to periodically make deliveries themselves through a program called WeDash.\n\nSome of the people making all of that happen at DoorDash corporate have joined the company from outside the US, and the company has sponsored H-1B visas.\n\nEmployers include salary information when submitting applications to the US Department of Labor for H-1B work visas. The publicly available data includes ranges for base pay, but excludes equity or other benefits that companies often offer employees. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers in similar roles.\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2025, DoorDash submitted roughly 540 H-1B visa applications, which can offer insight into what the delivery company pays for certain jobs.\n\nThe H-1B visa application process is changing under President Donald Trump.\n\nIn September, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications. He's also proposed changes to work visa rules that could tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nHere's a look at some of the jobs for which DoorDash has disclosed salaries in the work visa data.

As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",

    "description": "Hady Kfoury, founder of Naya, said working in fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants made him realize some common misconceptions about the business.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Hady Kfoury, the founder of Naya, a fast-casual Lebanese-inspired food chain with more than 40 locations on the East Coast. Naya plans to have 200 locations nationwide by 2030. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI studied hospitality in Switzerland and then came to New York to work under celebrity chefs, Daniel Boulud and François Payard, so I had experience in fine dining. When I decided to open the first Naya in 2008, that was more or less my comfort zone.\n\nA week after we launched, we got an amazing article in the New York Times and then we were packed for lunch and dinner. It definitely helped prevent us from shutting down after a few months.\n\nA couple of years in, we realized the food worked incredibly well in a faster and more accessible format. If you go to a Lebanese restaurant, you have all these mezze in the middle of the table, like a plate with a variety of dips and vegetables, and you're putting scoops on your plate. That's how we eat usually. So that's why I shifted my focus into a fast-casual model.\n\nToday, we have 44 restaurants and we are riding the wave of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine in general. It's definitely become mainstream, which is totally different than almost 20 years ago when I started the business.\n\nAs we scale, I've found there are four major misconceptions about the restaurant business.\n\nA lot of people think fast-casual restaurants are easy. It is not easy. Serving more guests at a faster pace doesn't mean it's a simple effort; it means you should master your systems and consistency at scale, possibly even more rigor than in fine dining.\n\nThe biggest challenge we have is that you're on an assembly line. You're not cooking per order. It's a problem for any restaurant with a service line. How do you plan to rotate food in a certain way, and to cook it a certain amount, so the food remains fresh and not overcooked?\n\nMy R&D doesn't stop. It keeps me up at night thinking about how we can keep improving what we do. And any change you make to improve something, you're rolling it out at 44 restaurants, so you have to be very mindful and careful.\n\nGrowing only works when the business fundamentals — training, supply chain, quality control — are built to handle it repeatedly. Growing without readiness is chaotic.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2020, I grew Naya to seven restaurants without any partners because all I cared about was being profitable and having a great team in place. Growth only works when you have those fundamentals. In 2020, I partnered with a private-equity firm, which was initially scary, but the rules were clear from day one that we would prioritize those fundamentals.\n\nSome people think cutting corners gets you a more profitable bottom line, but that is not the case. Cutting costs often undermines guest trust. You lose the customer trust, and the brands that endure are the ones that deliver authenticity, quality, and transparency every time.\n\nWe're trying to be very affordable, and we fall somewhere in the middle of the category, but I will never drop quality. I recently partnered with Pat LaFrieda, one of the best high-end butchers in the tristate. Even with our vegetables, we try to get deliveries three to four times per week rather than two times where you could get cheaper products.\n\nPeople think that it's all about the food, but people matter so much too. What keeps guests coming back and what keeps your team thriving is a culture of service, training, and retention.\n\nI take extremely good care of my team. Most of our general managers are grown within the company and we have very low staff turnover.\n\nGreat food is really important, but there's a people component to it that you can't avoid.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luisa Zhou. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy parents raised me to get good grades, go to a good college, and get a good job. They were entirely focused on security because they didn't want my sister and me to experience the hardships that they had as immigrants. They encouraged me not to take risks — just keep my head down, work hard, and appreciate what I had.\n\nThe day I got into Princeton, I thought, \"Thank goodness. I'm going to be OK.\" I graduated with an engineering degree and started working in analytics at a financial services company.\n\nIt was what I'd been raised to do, but from the beginning, it wasn't a good fit. I hated that my boss wouldn't let me leave before 5, even if I'd finished all my work. Still, I thought that if I climbed the corporate ladder, the work might become more challenging and fulfilling.\n\nIn my early 20s, I met a man who was launching a startup. He brought me on as cofounder because of my engineering background. Raising money for the startup opened my eyes to a whole new world of career options. That venture failed, but it gave me a different skill set and worldview.\n\nAfter that, I started working at a digital ad startup. I had a six-figure salary and a cool job, but I still wanted more.\n\nThen, my family had a difficult year: my dad had heart surgery, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and my little sister experienced an eye injury that required her to sit in the dark for weeks on end. My sister was staying with me, and as I shut the door on the way to work one day, she quietly said \"Bye.\" It broke my heart that I had to leave her.\n\nThat's the moment I vowed to do something that would let me spend more time with the people I loved.\n\nI'm fairly risk-averse, so I didn't do anything sudden. Instead, I spent the next two years building my side business, offering coaching, ad consulting, and other services. I was working on my lunch break and at night, so I had even less time for family than before.\n\nThat's where my background really helped me. My parents and grandparents raised me on a Chinese proverb: \"First bitter, then sweet.\" I knew I was working hard then, so I could enjoy the fruits later.\n\nThose early years were challenging because I'm not naturally confident. It seemed like no one believed in me. I was seen as nice, but not necessarily smart or business-minded. That gave me a chip on my shoulder, and I was determined to prove myself. The year I was 26, the business did more than $1 million in revenue. Last year, I did more than $1.5 million in revenue, while working fewer hours.\n\nAt first, I didn't understand that $1 million doesn't mean you're a millionaire, especially when you factor in costs and taxes. I still needed to learn about managing money and work on my own mindset about spending. As I did that, my wealth really accumulated: by the time I was 30, I had $1 million in investable assets.\n\nToday, I'm 36. Although I'm a millionaire, my parents still nervously ask me if work is going OK every time we speak. They don't understand this alternative path, and that's OK. We just don't talk about it much.\n\nHaving financial security was worth the non-stop work in those earlier years. These days, I typically work about four hours a day. I limit my screen time and only book phone calls two weeks out of the month. I spend about two hours each day walking my German Shepherd, and I have the flexibility to spend time with my husband — he's a doctor, so his schedule is much more demanding. I can easily travel to visit my parents.\n\nIt took a lot to get here, but I'm so glad that I've been able to step away from the time-money trade-off.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Bernie Sanders wants a nationwide pause on AI data center construction. Few of his colleagues are willing to go there yet.\n\n\"In terms of the actual policy prescription, it's something that I haven't made a determination yet on,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told Business Insider.\n\nThe Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate first made the call in December, saying in a video posted to X that a national moratorium would \"give democracy a chance to catch up with the transformative changes\" that the technology is bringing.\n\nSanders told Business Insider last week that he plans to introduce legislation to back up his call soon.\n\n\"There's enormous issues for our economy and for our democracy that have got to be dealt with,\" Sanders said. \"And I feel we're not ready to do that.\"\n\nBut his proposal is unlikely to become reality, given GOP control of Washington.\n\n\"I mean, this Congress isn't going to do that,\" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin told Business Insider. \"He's pointing out the right problems.\"\n\nRepublicans have been generally dismissive of Sanders's idea. Even Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a major critic of the AI industry, signaled he wouldn't go as far.\n\n\"If these AI companies want to build these data centers and local folks want to give them permits for it, I mean, that's up to local voters,\" Hawley told Business Insider.\n\nA handful of Sanders's progressive allies are backing him up. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told Business Insider that a moratorium \"would be a good idea,\" while Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan issued a full-throated endorsement in a post on X.\n\n\"I fully support the call for a national AI data center moratorium,\" Tlaib wrote.\n\nAnd while few Democrats have fully endorsed the idea, it's spurring a conversation within the party about the impact of data centers and AI.\n\n\"I don't want a moratorium on data centers but Bernie is right that we are sleepwalking past risks which alarm even the optimists,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii wrote on X last month.\n\n\"What we do know is that these AI data centers are just uncontrollably jacking up people's energy costs,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider. \"There are a lot of problems that arise from these data centers, and I think that they certainly should not be getting the blank check from Congress.\"\n\n\"Bernie makes clear that the debate over AI is not about states rights or affordability,\" White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks wrote on X in December. \"He would block new data centers even if states want them & they generate their own power. It's about stopping progress completely so China wins the AI race.\"\n\nYet even the administration has come to recognize that data centers are engendering local resistance, in large part due to rising electricity costs.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump declared that he wanted Big Tech firms to \"pay their own way\" on data centers, with AI companies footing more of the bill for the electricity their facilities consume.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAnd on Friday, the administration and a group of governors called on a major power grid operator to hold a new emergency power auction amid rising costs driven by AI data centers.",

    "title": "At This Office Park, Scamming the World Was the Business",
    "description": "Times journalists got a rare look inside one of the compounds where the online fraud industry makes its billions. Inspirational slogans (“Keep going”) were just the start.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from Min Let Pan, Myanmar\n\nIn a Southeast Asian war zone, cloaked in dense rainforest, the Chinese settlement dedicated to scamming people from Kentucky to Kazakhstan grew fast on fertile ground.\n\nOver just a few months, a sprawling office park materialized and metastasized in the chaotic borderlands of Myanmar, with cavernous rooms holding rows of computer monitors and walls decorated with inspirational work slogans: “Dream chaser,” “Keep going,” “Making money matters the most.” In video conference suites, bookshelves stocked with fake business tomes and ersatz modern art simulated the kind of boardroom a successful crypto investor might inhabit.\n\nThe scam center, Shunda Park, opened for business in 2024 with more than 3,500 workers from nearly 30 nations, including Namibia, Russia, Zimbabwe and France. Some had been kidnapped and enslaved, but all had become skilled in the art of the online grift. When the scammers bilked $5,000 out of someone, they struck a Chinese gong. A $50,000 shakedown earned a celebratory pounding of a giant drum, then an offering to a Chinese deity resplendent in his golden altar.\n\nWhile each nationality required a different approach — for Americans, one scammer told me, the preferred mark was “white old men” — the general approach was the same: an online foray by a sympathetic and attractive person, followed by an invitation to participate in a select investment opportunity.\n\nVictims were not just lonely hearts or technologically timid retirees. Using generative intelligence and deepfake videos, as well as fraudulent businesses, websites and financial apps, the scammers at Shunda embraced the long con and reeled in people from almost every demographic.\n\nBut in late November, Shunda Park was unexpectedly captured by a rebel force long at odds with the Myanmar military, whose coup nearly five years ago catapulted this Southeast Asian nation into civil war and created a chaotic space for criminality to thrive. The photographer Jes Aznar and I were granted rare access to the scam compound to document the inner sanctum of this secretive, highly fortified industry. Shunda Park had been closed for business by the rebel militia, but we were able to meet some of its scammers, both those who were trying to return home and others who wanted to find another job in the fraud business.\n\nWith millions of people falling victim to online shakedowns every year, the cyberscamming industry has quickly grown into one of the planet’s most lucrative criminal enterprises, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nIn the United States alone, in 2024, at least $10 billion was stolen through cyberscams run out of Southeast Asia, the U.S. Treasury Department said. That figure is likely only a fraction of the true toll because victims are often too embarrassed to admit they have been fooled. Late last year, the United States formed its first ever federal task force to combat scam centers and the Chinese transnational crime networks that American investigators say run them.\n\nThe Myanmar junta, which has imprisoned members of an elected government and killed thousands of civilians, recently vowed to tackle the scam networks. But its current crackdown feels like a Potemkin exercise. The global profits from online cons rival the gross domestic products of the countries where the fraud factories have proliferated, including Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.\n\nThese illicit proceeds do not just line the pockets of the gangs, most of which are originally from China; dirty money also flows to powerful elites across the region — most of all, crime-watchers say, to powerful people in the conflict-ridden, failed state of Myanmar.\n\nOur journey to Shunda Park occurred during what was supposed to be a lull in the fighting between the Myanmar military and the opposition militia, known as the Karen National Liberation Army. (The Karen, pronounced Kuh-REN, are one of Myanmar’s many ethnic groups that have been persecuted by the military for generations.)\n\nWhat we discovered inside Shunda Park’s thick walls ringed by razor wire resembled a set for an apocalyptic film. Amid white office blocks, Chinese restaurants and luxury villas reserved for the compound’s Chinese bosses, bonfires burned, consuming the tools of the illicit economy. Piles of electronic equipment — keyboards, tangles of cables and thousands of cellphones — littered the site. In some buildings, with nearly every step I took, I crunched on SIM cards, scattered like snow in the tropical heat.\n\nWhile members of the Karen militia handed over armfuls of evidence to the police in Thailand, along with a man identified as the compound’s Chinese boss, no representatives of foreign governments or intelligence agencies have come to Shunda Park to investigate. Now, the fighting has intensified, and all of Shunda Park’s workers have scattered. Other proof of scamming has gone up in flames.\n\n“We are trying our best, but we are not scam experts,” said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the spokesman for the K.N.L.A.’s political wing, as he leafed through a notebook with instructions on how to cheat middle-aged women in Taiwan. “We do not like that our land is known as the place where criminals cheat people.”\n\nThe layers of victimhood at a place like Shunda Park are complex. Many of the scammers who worked here say they were duped, too. They arrived in neighboring Thailand, thinking they had been hired for well-paying tech or marketing jobs. Others thought they were checking out merchandise for online sales businesses. Instead, they were hustled at gunpoint across the river that demarcates the border with Myanmar.\n\nI spoke with several scammers whose bodies bore scars from beatings or tight shackles. They never received payment for their 12-hour shifts, they said. Life was a Sisyphean loop: sleep, eat, scam, eat, sleep, scam.\n\nKason, a 22-year-old from Malaysia who is being identified only by his first name, said he suffered only two “hard” beatings. But his legs and torso were crisscrossed with traces of lacerations from what he called “many, many” smaller beatings.\n\nHis job for more than a year was to send endless “hellos” into the social media ether. If he did not receive responses from at least 5 percent of the greetings, then he would be punished physically, he said.\n\nIvan, a Malaysian who once worked as a member of the ground staff at the Singapore airport, said he was chained in a crucifixion position and denied food for days.\n\n“You think you know hell,” he said, “and it’s actually even worse.”\n\nIn one of the Shunda Park workrooms, bobblehead dolls and fake gold bars enlivened the space. At the front, near a statue of a Chinese god worshiped by the gangsters, were three port-a-potty style boxes that scammers said were used as punishment chambers, in clear sight of the rest of the room. Elsewhere in the compound, behind a barbecue restaurant, a row of cement torture cells was outfitted with bars and shackles.\n\nNot all the workers at Shunda landed there unwillingly. Many of the Chinese employees at Shunda Park received salaries, a review of records in one finance office shows. A company called Huisheng International, for instance, had stacks of wage receipts, sick-leave forms and medical tests for H.I.V. and syphilis, among other diseases, all written in Chinese. Employees were identified by nicknames like “Eastern Dragon” or “Little Li.” Contracts in the office specified that workers would be bound by Myanmar labor law.\n\nWhile most of the workers at Shunda Park were transported to safety via Thailand, about 900 Chinese workers refused to leave for more than two weeks, despite the compound being in the middle of an active conflict zone. The Chinese government has periodically cracked down on the scamming industry, arresting Chinese workers who are repatriated. So tense was the situation that days before our visit, some Chinese workers had tried unsuccessfully to wrestle weapons away from the Karen soldiers, according to members of the militia and other scammers who witnessed the melee.\n\nAll but one Chinese man at the compound refused to speak with me. The scammers shielded their faces with their hands or with masks. The one worker who agreed to talk said he had been promised a salary of 30,000 yuan a month, or $4,250. But upon arriving, he said, he only received 30,000 Thai baht a month, or $940. Records in the finance office showed base salaries of that amount.\n\n“They tricked me,” he said of his employers. The boom of shelling punctuated our conversation.\n\nAround him, rotten food festered. On the basketball court and by a nightclub, fires smoldered. A French bulldog that used to be cared for by one of the compound’s Chinese managers padded by, before collapsing in the shade provided by a luxury sedan. The cars on site came from all over Myanmar, including a fire department vehicle from halfway across the country. There was also an oil tanker truck with Chinese license plates.\n\nThe Myanmar military appears determined to reclaim Shunda Park, even as it dynamites buildings in other scam centers to show it is tough on crime. Workers at those raided sites, also run by Chinese criminal networks, however, say the crackdowns are just for show. In fact, some of the workers at Shunda said they had just arrived from these cleared out compounds. With international sanctions biting, Myanmar’s generals, supported by business allies and sympathetic militias, have embraced various illicit economies, making the country a global crime capital.\n\nOutside the scam compounds, life is impoverished and insecure. The Myanmar military regularly launches airstrikes around Shunda Park, and across the rest of the country, targeting civilians. More than 3.5 million people nationwide are now displaced.\n\nAs the shelling intensified, we climbed into pickup trucks and sped away. Our driver, the commander of the K.N.L.A.’s special forces, varied his speed to ward off the suicide drones that terrorize the area’s roads. A few days before, an armed drone detonated a bus length away from one of the trucks.\n\nIn the next village, in an area where an ethnic armed group aligned with the junta had held sway, I spotted more neat rows of scam centers being built, Chinese red lanterns hanging from the eaves. Chinese workers wandered through the construction site, shirts off in the heat.\n\nA few days later, the 900 or so Chinese workers left Shunda. Some went over the border to Thailand. But most headed to other Chinese compounds in the wilds of Myanmar, where scammers are busy finding their next victims.\n\nBerry Wang contributed research.",

    "fullText": "My wife and I met nearly two decades ago in the same newsroom. We were cub reporters, then friends, and then started dating. Eventually, we got married. Now we have two kids.\n\nI'd say it's a sweet story — and an increasingly antiquated one.\n\nDating in 2026 looks quite different. Dating apps have gone from taboo to mainstream to played out. Now, a white-collar job apocalypse and a cutthroat AI arms race have people working harder than ever, and that's put dating on the back burner for plenty of folks.\n\nMy colleague Henry Chandonnet reports on a new phenomenon taking hold in Silicon Valley. He says tech's dating scene, which was never particularly hot, has frozen over.\n\nHenry spoke with more than two dozen young tech professionals in the Bay Area who described a dating culture shaped by anxiety and exhaustion. There's a large cohort who have sworn off dating entirely, with many \"locked in\" on building their careers.\n\nIt all shows how the rules of romance are changing.\n\nTake LinkedIn. What appears to be a strictly career-focused platform has quietly morphed into a shadow dating app. In the age of remote work, users are sending banal LinkedIn requests under the guise of networking. In reality, they're screening potential love interests.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional dating apps are turning to AI to bring back lapsed users. Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble are pouring millions into generative AI matchmaking tools that promise fewer swipes and deeper connections. A new crop of AI-first dating startups is making the same promise: Let the bots do the work of sifting through people and finding your perfect match. AI wingmen are a thing now.\n\nThere's stuff IRL, too. Partiful, the social event invite app, recently launched \"Crush,\" a feature that lets users discreetly signal interest in people they've met at real-world events.\n\nIf the crush is mutual, you'll get a notification affirming that the person \"has a crush on you too!\" Think Tinder without the swiping — dating layered onto genuine social overlap.\n\nWe're optimizing everything these days, dating included. But at the end of the day, maybe we all just want to ditch the algorithms and find connections that feel human again.\n\nOr maybe we're all destined for AI spouses instead.\n\nWhat do you think of the dating landscape?

    "description": "Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter spoke to Business Insider on how humanoid robots will take over the factory and when they'll come to our homes.",
    "fullText": "In a few years, factory employees at Hyundai's massive Georgia plant could be getting a new coworker.\n\nIt's about 200 pounds, six-feet, two-inches tall, has a four-hour battery life, and a face inspired by Disney's Pixar lamp, Luxor Jr.\n\nIts name is Atlas, an all-electric humanoid robot from Boston Dynamics, the Massachusetts-based company and maker of the four-legged inspection robot, Spot, and the mobile warehouse robot, Stretch.\n\nHyundai, which owns Boston Dynamics, unveiled the latest version of Atlas at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5. During live demonstrations, Atlas was seen waving hello to its audience before moving car parts from one rack to another.\n\nThis is how the humanoid robot revolution starts, according to Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter.\n\n\"We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing,\" Playter said in an interview with Business Insider. Eventually, the tasks get more complex, and Atlas will be on the assembly line. Then, the CEO said, perhaps in five to 10 years' time, the robots will enter our homes.\n\nPlayter, an MIT alumn and aerospace engineer by training, has been at Boston Dynamics for more than 30 years and has seen the company change hands multiple times — first to Google, then to SoftBank, and now to Hyundai after the South Korean automaker acquired a majority stake in the robotics company five years ago.\n\nPlayter was appointed CEO in 2019. Since then, he has steered the company through its commercial launch of Spot, Atlas' transition from a hydraulics platform to an all-electric platform, and more recently, Boston Dynamics' partnership with Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research lab, to help build Atlas' \"brain.\"\n\nThe CEO spoke to Business Insider on the Atlas demonstration floor about how humanoid robots will transform the workplace before they take over our homes, the problems still to be solved before humanoids can work, and why Atlas looks like a Disney-inspired character.\n\nThe interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nIs there a story behind Atlas' face?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of the humanoid producers create what I would call scary, dystopian robot faces. It's like, oh my god, there's this black face. Is that a human shape? Why can't I see it? It's just scary.\n\nSo we tried to go the other way, and the shape is really driven from the Pixar lamp, the original friendly mechanism. We wanted to forecast that this is not a human. It is a machine — it's a friendly machine.\n\nIs this what you imagined the robot takeover looking like when you were at MIT about 40 years ago?\n\nI think it's what we dreamed about. But we've been doing humanoids since 2008. We've been doing this for a long time. But for us to be approaching a point where we're really thinking about commercializing the humanoid, I don't know that we expected that years ago. The turning point has been AI. It's really the enabler that lets a robot like this do a huge variety of tasks, which is what's needed to really make these generalizable.\n\nIs AI the main technological advancement that's transformed the robot?\n\nThere's a lot of hardware advancements as well. The early robots were hydraulic. These are all electric. This is our newest version that is going to be mass-produced. And it's designed for simplicity and cost. If you notice, there's a lot of similar joints and shapes on this robot — it's really built to be modular. There's only three different types of motors, which means we're going to be able to mass-produce them at scale and get the cost down. The joints all have 360-degree rotation, which is why you see these crazy inside-out yoga motion. And it's strong. This robot's going to be able to pick up 110 pounds.\n\nA few years ago, Aaron Saunders, the former CTO, talked about the bipedal form factor and how it's not the best for every task. That's why you have Stretch, for example, to carry boxes. Has that mentality shifted at Boston?\n\nI think we're still going to see lots of different morphologies for different applications. But one of the great things about humanoids is people are just fascinated by them, and they could be truly general-purpose. With two manipulators, you could basically pick up and put down almost anything that a person could do. You can go to almost any place that a person can go to.\n\nIs the tradeoff of tackling the technical challenges of doing a humanoid worth it compared to sticking with a robot like Stretch that can perform limited tasks but is already deployed?\n\nDefinitely, there's more complexity. This has 56 degrees of freedom. Stretch is going to work in warehouses. Humanoids could potentially work anywhere and eventually in our homes. So the generality of this shape is really what lends it power. It's the best robot we've ever built. It's the one we've built to be mass-producible right out of the gate. But there's still complexity that has to get solved. Part of that's in the AI. We've solved a lot of the hardware parts; now we need to go solve the AI problems.\n\nSo there's still something to solve between now and 2028 deployment.\n\nAbsolutely. What we've seen is that AI techniques allow us to get an unprecedented diversity of skills onto the robots quickly, but we really need to generalize that. If you're going to have a robot that's actually useful in the factory, it's got to do a hundred different tasks, not just one or two. And it's really the AI that's going to enable that. We also have to make that unprecedented reliability — 99.9% reliable. The AI is not quite there yet, but it's very promising.\n\nIs there a specific number of tasks Atlas needs to achieve that will make it ready to be shipped out?\n\nWe need to be able to bring a new task to bear in a day or two. And that's because, I think in a factory, there's literally hundreds of tasks, and the tasks evolve. So yeah, every 24 or 48 hours to get a new task onto a robot.\n\nHow do you imagine Atlas transforming the workplace, starting with the factory?\n\nThere's a lot of logistics work that has to be done in an automotive factory — a huge variety of pick-and-place tasks to get all the pieces of the car to the line. Atlas is going to start in that sequencing — it's called parts sequencing. It's really a logistics task. And as the capabilities get more sophisticated, we're going to eventually start entering assembly tasks. We're going to deal with heavy lifting, repeatable tasks that tend to wear people out. That's kind of what we're doing with Stretch, which is unloading trailing. The people who used to unload trailers now operate the robot. We see the same thing happening in factories. Factory workers are going to be the trainers of these new technologies.\n\nCan the workers interact with the robots and talk to them?\n\nYes. We have demonstrations of some of these behaviors where we just tell the robot, \"Empty out this bin of parts,\" and it'll go do that. That is all part of the package, and we really want to just make it a seamless interaction.\n\nIs there a list of tasks you believe Atlas will be best for and ones that Atlas will avoid?\n\nWe've analyzed all the jobs that have to occur in an automotive factory. We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing. And then above that, you have gradations of complexity. Do you have to get inside the car to fit something? Do you have to do a close-tolerant fit? Do you have to deal with flexible wiring harness? Those things are more complex, and it's going to take more time to bring to bear. So, we're starting with the simple stuff, and then it'll grow over time.\n\nThere's a lot of ambivalence around robots taking over our jobs. Has Boston Dynamics done an analysis of how many jobs one Atlas can actually replace or take on?\n\nLet me get to the ambivalence. There's a feeling of a little anxiety around robots in general. What we're actually finding when we bring robots into the workplace is that people end up enjoying interacting with the robots.\n\nSome of the people who used to unload trailers now operate Stretch. They just got upskilled. They like their job more now that Stretch is doing the heavy-lifting. And I think there's a great potential with AI-powered robots that anybody can interact with them and train them. It will not require an advanced engineering degree, and that essentially opens up the productivity enhancements to regular workers. I think it's going to be a symbiosis.\n\nSo, less about human replacement?\n\nI think so. We're going to build a whole new industry. There's going to be a lot of jobs created just building, maintaining, deploying, and training robots.\n\nAnd if you've paid attention to demographic trends worldwide, population has decreased everywhere. If we're going to bring manufacturing back to the United States, we have to increase productivity. And I think robotics is a way to increase the productivity of our workforce.\n\nSo Boston Dynamics doesn't have a metric or ratio — like, one Atlas robot can do the job of five humans?\n\nI think it depends totally on the task. And so we don't have that metric yet. The way we measure that in the Stretch is it's all about case pick rate: How many boxes can you pick per hour, and how does that compare to the humans that did that job? And we pretty much have to at least match that. In some cases, we can exceed it, but in some cases, people are still better because the robots aren't quite smarter.\n\nHow do you pitch companies on Atlas? Do you tell them they can save X amount of money?\n\nWe have experience doing this with Spot. Companies typically want to see a return on investment in around two to three years.\n\nWe talk a lot about AI talent wars. Is it competitive for Boston Dynamics?\n\nHoly, it's crazy. We need the same AI talent that Meta and Google and Nvidia are all hiring, so it's extremely competitive. The thing we have that nobody else has, which is important for the top talent, is really exciting robots.\n\nDo you have Atlas running around in your home right now for testing?\n\nNo, we have it in the lab. We had Spots at home. During COVID, everybody had to go home, and our developers just took the robots home with them. We probably paid for the damage to the house when they ran into the walls.\n\nHa, the real test case. Well, the goal with Atlas is to bring them home, too, right?\n\nEventually. We see industrial as the first stepping stone for three reasons.\n\nCost. These first robots are going to be a little bit too expensive for consumer level. Safety. Factories are a safer environment. You can control it a little bit more than the home. And then capabilities.\n\nAt home, you've got the worst of all worlds. It has to be the cheapest, it has to be the most safe, and it's the most complex environment.\n\nWe're going to get to home, I'd say, in five to 10 years. The next five years we're really focusing on industrial applications.\n\nIs there something your competitors don't understand about deploying humanoid robots?\n\nI think they understand it just fine. They're just playing a slightly different game.\n\nThis is a very expensive business to be in. It takes billions of dollars of investment to sort of get this technology to where it needs to be. If you're going to play that game, you got to have the largest possible market. So, of course, they're saying they're going to go home. It's the large end market, but I just think that's a mistake.",

    "description": "Shiyao Tang quit her $390K job at DoorDash to build a silk womenswear brand. Five months of careful planning helped her exit her corporate job.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shiyao Tang, a 34-year-old business owner based in New York City and Paris. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was on a very strong upward trajectory in my manager role at DoorDash when I quit in 2025. I was making $390,000 and felt that I still had room to grow, but when I was honest with myself, my heart wasn't in it.\n\nLeaving to start my own silk womenswear brand wasn't an instantaneous decision; it was a long-term calling inside of me. It took a lot of courage to quit and choose the unknown.\n\nI still constantly ask myself if I made a huge mistake. I think to myself, \"How could I just leave a job that most people would dream of?\" It was high-paying, the benefits were great, and there was room for learning. But I don't want to look back and think I climbed the wrong mountain.\n\nIn 2022, I was hired as a strategy and operations manager on the homepage team at DoorDash. My job was challenging, and I got to wear a lot of hats. I also developed deep friendships with some truly talented people.\n\nHowever, I realized I missed the feeling of being close to the people I was building for.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a small entrepreneurial chapter where I worked on a fashion wholesale startup. I built my own customers from the ground up and interacted with them every day.\n\nWhen I was 16, I moved from China to the US and later spent a year studying abroad in Paris. I've always lived between cultures and felt super energized by working with people from distinct backgrounds and creative disciplines. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted my career to reflect that part of me, too.\n\nTech created a structure for me to learn and expand my horizon, but I was ready to try entrepreneurship again. I spent a lot of time journaling and reflecting on what business I really wanted to make.\n\nEvery weekend was dedicated to foundational discovery work and even talking to potential customers or friends to get some early feedback on different ideas. I even started connecting with other young, inspiring entrepreneurs at founder events, which expanded my horizons regarding what life might look like as an entrepreneur.\n\nFrankly, I was extremely scared every day, but seeing people thrive gave me more confidence to envision what it might look like for me. I decided on my business, Soir Si, where I make simple, minimal sculptural silk pieces. The mission is to make luxury accessible.\n\nEven though I was sure of my decision, walking away was scary, and honestly, it was really sad for me. However, the thought of not pushing to the edge of my potential was scarier than quitting.\n\nI have my own apartment in NYC, and I spend half my time in Paris, typically staying with friends or family, to fuel my creative inspiration during the design process.\n\nThe first month after quitting, I focused on building a strong visual and emotional identity for Soir Si by enrolling in online courses and even partnering with a freelancer. The next stages were developing my website, connecting directly with customers, and using my branding and website to open up my supply chain.\n\nNow I'm focused on securing and strengthening those relationships while sprinting toward product development.\n\nRight after quitting, I was so focused on transitioning into entrepreneurship that I didn't have time for self-doubt. I felt a mix of grief and sadness about leaving, but I also felt excitement about what was ahead of me. The doubts didn't start bubbling up until several weeks later, when I hit a steep learning curve. I realized I had no idea what went into manufacturing or production, or even how to find a pattern-maker.\n\nI remember the first time I visited some manufacturers in New York, they treated me like I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I didn't speak their \"language,\" and it felt alienating. However, those moments of self-doubt were always counterbalanced by the highs, such as building relationships with potential partners. For example, my branding designer is based in Italy, and my manufacturers are based in Portugal. Establishing those relationships from scratch without any experience gave me the assurance that I can really do this.\n\nEvery day, I wake up knowing I need to work really hard and give it my all to make this dream a reality. The gradual, positive feedback from peers or my audience feeds me every day, and it's fulfilling to work with people from around the world and get to talk about silk and the region it comes from.\n\nThere are still moments when I'm super scared about the path I chose. The self-doubt bubbles up, and it all feels overwhelming, but underneath it all is a steady sense that I'm building something that aligns with who I am, not just the perception of success or stability. I'm finally excited about life again.\n\nPeople might say this is a risky move, but everyone starts from nothing. I just had to be willing to take the first step.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting your six-figure job for a riskier path? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "The post-pandemic era has sent the high-end watch market into a slump that analysts say could last a decade",
    "description": "Industry experts told Business Insider that 2021-2022 was probably the top of the market, and luxury watch prices won't see a similar boom anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "The luxury watch market is coming off a wild sugar high.\n\nAfter what looked like an unstoppable rally in watch prices at the tail end of the pandemic, the market for high-end timepieces has cooled. The corner of the luxury consumer space could also be sluggish for years, with low single-digit growth that pales in comparison to the pandemic era, industry analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThat relative decline has been triggered by a few factors. While people have less time and money on their hands, less flashy, more austere fashion trends rooted in \"Quiet Luxury\" are also having an impact, watch industry insiders said.\n\nSecondhand prices in the luxury watch market have dropped sharply from their highs during the pandemic. The WatchCharts Overall Market Index, a gauge of secondhand luxury watch prices, is down 33% from its peak just after the pandemic, though it is up about 5% over the past year.\n\nHigh-end watches were the worst-performing luxury category last year, according to Claudia D'Arpizio, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Company.\n\nWhile a few dominant brands are seeing some growth — kingmakers like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet — virtually all high-end watchmakers in the business are struggling or stagnating at the moment, she said, even those with a \"great heritage\" name.\n\n\"The rest are all facing difficult times,\" she said, speculating that the watch market could continue to normalize and remain broadly weak for several years until the global economy enters a fresh growth cycle.\n\n\"Probably we are near the bottom, but it's really difficult to say,\" she said.\n\nRevenue growth in the broader online jewelry and watch business has collapsed from its 2020 peak. Growth is also expected to remain near zero through the end of the decade, even lower than the average growth rate in the years leading up to the pandemic, according to an estimate from IBISWorld.\n\nOliver Müller, a longtime consultant in the luxury watch business and the founder of LuxeConsult, said he believed 2021 and 2022 were likely the best-ever years for the watch market, with the industry unlikely to achieve a similar growth rate in the foreseeable future.\n\nHe attributed the post-COVID bubble to a unique cocktail of circumstances that pushed newcomers into the watch market — mainly, people having extra time on their hands to get into new hobbies, and the fact that crypto markets and meme stocks were delivering big gains in very little time for many traders.\n\n\"The crypto boys, as they call them, all of a sudden discovered that there was something called watches on which they could flip a lot of money,\" he said, referring to the practice of traders buying high-end watches to quickly resell them at a profit on the secondhand market.\n\n\"I don't think we will get back anytime soon to those crazy high prices that we have seen,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Morgan, another watch consultant, said he believed the market reached its zenith in 2022.\n\n\"I think to get to those prices, again, we're talking decades,\" he said, speculating that the market would only see \"shallow\" growth from here on out.\n\nThe pandemic-era watch vibe was marked by \"flashy\" styles and special edition models that flew off the shelves, D'Arpizio said. The buying spree was largely driven by ultrawealthy clients who were sitting on big gains on their investments and were willing to splurge.\n\nMany speculators in the market at the time also seemed to be interested in integrated or stainless steel sports watches, styles that tend to be associated with \"over wealth.\"\n\n\"Luxury watches got swept up as part of this whole affluent luxury, Instagram lifestyle,\" Morgan said.\n\nFor luxury watches, it seems to have kicked off a new era: one defined less by excess and more by refinement, D'Arpizio and Morgan said.\n\nThough there are exceptions, the worst-performing models on the market tend to be integrated and stainless-steel sports watches, Morgan said. While models from leading brands are still reaping a \"mild\" return on the secondary market, models from most other brands face a \"significant depreciation\" the minute they're sold, he said.\n\n\"Some of those really spiky hype watches have calmed down, and are continuing to calm down,\" Morgan said of watches that contributed to the pandemic spike. \"Collectors of classy reserve time pieces will still purchase those, but the reasoning for purchasing them has become more about a personal self-reflecting sense of achievement, rather than a publicly broadcast sense of self-achievement, if that makes sense.\"\n\nIt's difficult to equate \"quiet luxury\" with the watch market, since watches are by definition a status symbol, D'Arpizio. But she agrees a more \"conservative\" style has proliferated, with most consumers now focusing on classic pieces from timeless brands — something that can be worn again and again.\n\n\"These SKUs are superstars and very recognizable, so they are not really quiet, but for sure the model stays, and the value stays,\" she said of the more understated vibe among shoppers. \"They don't want to make a mistake, so they choose the safe side.\"",

    "description": "Tommy Bahama's restaurant is popular for a business lunch. We ate there to see why — and left simultaneously underwhelmed and somewhat sold.",
    "fullText": "The Tommy Bahama on 45th Street and 5th Avenue bills itself on its website as \"an oasis in the big city,\" a \"refuge\" that's \"ideal for business lunches.\" Geographically, it makes total sense — on foot, Tommy Bahama is six minutes from JPMorgan's new tower, nine minutes from Bank of America Tower, five minutes from a PWC building, and 12 minutes from the main Morgan Stanley office.\n\nWe'll spare you the full list of adjacent corporate headquarters.\n\nWe had a 12:30 p.m. reservation, and the restaurant kept filling up throughout our meal. Diners eventually sat at the bar, and when I, Alice, went to the bathroom around 1:20 p.m., a gaggle of waiters was congregating by the kitchen, discussing table numbers over a window crammed with burgers and salads.\n\nApart from the kitchen, though, the crowded restaurant didn't feel cramped. Tables were far enough apart that we couldn't hear others' conversations, yet the background din of conversation made the room feel lively. The only deal talk we overheard came from a woman on her way out, who mentioned her interest in bringing ESRT, the company that owns the Empire State Building, on as a client.\n\nSo when it comes to layout, it's not a bad spot for a semi-private, relatively casual business lunch.\n\nFor a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, the price point wasn't too surprising, but it seemed more suited to dinner than lunch. The cheapest item in the entrée section was $31.\n\nOne table of four almost entirely ordered the macadamia-nut-crusted fresh catch, and our waitress said the ahi tuna poke bowl was also a popular lunch choice. There were also a number of salad orders around the restaurant, which seemed fitting for lunch.\n\nThe $23 \"world-famous\" coconut shrimp appetizer arrived at our table fairly quickly — it was the only item we knew we had to try during our visit.\n\nThe shrimp sat atop a papaya and mango chutney, adding another layer of sweetness to the coconut coating. The cabbage salad that sat on top was our favorite part of the plate. The coleslaw was dressed with a light vinaigrette, and the cilantro added a nice freshness.\n\nUltimately, though, the overall dish was too sweet for our liking, and we left some lonely shrimp on the plate.\n\nI, Jordan, admit that I'm a newbie to ordering French dip sandwiches. I was expecting mine to come with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese. For $33, the Tommy Bahama wagyu French dip came with neither, despite the description listing sweet-and-sour onions as an ingredient.\n\nThe missing onions aside, I found myself taking some of the sliced beef off to make the sandwich a little easier to bite into. I felt kind of silly picking the valuable wagyu out of my sandwich, but I wanted to be able to close it properly. The broth was good for dipping, but I was left wanting more thinly sliced beef and additional ingredients.\n\nOur waitress surprised us with two free desserts: the piña colada cake and malted chocolate pie.\n\nThe cake was incredibly sweet, and we initially didn't realize it had any pineapple, but the whipped cream was, unsurprisingly, fantastic. Jordan said the chocolate pie was the only dish that tasted exactly as it looked. An Oreo crust is rarely a bad thing, but we agreed we wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor $145, we were sufficiently underwhelmed by the food. Then again, everyone else around us seemed pretty pleased, and the service is efficient without feeling rushed.\n\nAs a Wall Street go-to, Tommy Bahama presents a funny inverse. Many firms are setting up outposts in the south, namely in Texas, but the beachy restaurant is trying to bring southern, Floridian charm to 45th Street. And it is, at times, easy to forget that you're in the middle of Manhattan while sitting in the palm-filled dining room, until you look out the window, or at the guys in Charles Tyrwhitt vests sitting next to you.\n\nThe noise level and layout are conducive to a genuinely productive, laid-back business meal, and it's an easy escape from Manhattan's chaos. Provided you like the food, we see how it could become an unlikely power lunch staple.\n\nThe price is comparable to that of a steakhouse dinner, but it's nothing the corporate card can't handle, right?",

    "title": "I founded a wellness startup after leaving McKinsey. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.",
    "description": "Cesar Carvalho founded Wellhub, a corporate wellness platform. This is how he thinks companies should approach employee wellbeing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cesar Carvalho, the CEO and cofounder of Wellhub, a global corporate wellness platform. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI became interested in consulting through some older friends while studying at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Their stories about how fast you could learn and grow in the career made me want to pursue it.\n\nI applied to all the top firms and accepted McKinsey's offer to be a business analyst in 2010 as soon as I received it. It was the best thing I could imagine as a long-term career.\n\nI was at McKinsey for about two years before they encouraged me to pursue an MBA. At that time in Brazil, you could only become an associate or a manager if you had one.\n\nI applied to Harvard Business School with the intention of returning to McKinsey and continuing the consulting journey. But the summer of my first year in Boston, I had the idea of starting WellHub.\n\nThe working environment at McKinsey was super intense. I would do an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, and when there was a crunch, it could be more.\n\nAs a consultant, I often traveled to different cities or juggled between a client's office and McKinsey's office. There were no gym memberships that provided access to facilities in different locations.\n\nIf I were at a client site and had two hours before my next meeting, I would have nothing to do but extra work. I had three gym memberships that were going unused, and I wanted to feel less stressed and improve my well-being.\n\nMy experience showed me there was a need for busy workers to get convenient access to health and well-being. And I quickly realized that was true not just for CEOs, bankers, and consultants, but also for FedEx drivers and grocery store workers.\n\nIt's now been 14 years since I started Wellhub.\n\nWe're now in 18 countries, and partner with 40,000 companies to offer wellness to their employees, including many McKinsey offices. 5 million employees engage with Wellhub every month.\n\nWith Wellhub, employees can book a class regardless of the country or city they are in, without needing a membership for a specific gym or studio. Companies pay a fixed monthly fee based on their employee count, and employees also contribute.\n\nI grew a lot at McKinsey, and that was especially thanks to one thing — in two years, I worked under seven different partners, all with their own managing style.\n\nIt could change everything: the team culture, the hours you're putting in, and the work you prioritize. I quickly learned what worked well for me, and what didn't.\n\nThe best experiences I had were when we were given flexibility. Some leaders used a process I always use today: a kickoff meeting in which every single employee is given the opportunity to talk about their own boundaries and how they operate.\n\nManagers with families would say their ideal schedule was to go home early, eat with their families, and then log back on if needed. My own boundary at McKinsey was that I was willing to work as much as needed during the week, but my weekends were sacred. During my two years at the company, I worked only four or five weekends.\n\nI learned that when expectations are clear and leaders are good enough to ask and respect the boundaries of employees, you can get everything done and still have great morale.\n\nI also made a ton of friends, and those connections became really important. My Wellhub cofounder and several colleagues worked at McKinsey with me, and two of my seven angel investors were my previous bosses.\n\nCompanies benefit from having employees who are active and in a great state of well-being.\n\nIf companies don't support well-being, they won't just be less productive — they'll also have higher costs than peers who do invest in it.\n\nIt impacts the amount of sick leave and PTO people take, and plays into retention and attraction.\n\nThe trend some corporate companies have taken towards hardcore culture is completely insane. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.\n\nMany CEOs are missing the mark, and the consequences will show up as companies underperform those that take a more balanced approach. Hustle culture leads to burnout, and it pushes great people out before they would otherwise leave.\n\nAs a CEO, I believe in treating every employee like an adult and trusting them. My focus is always on getting the work done — not how many hours it takes or whether someone is showing up to the office.\n\nWhen I meet coworkers, we typically do a yoga session or a workout, instead of going to bars or restaurants. If you switch a happy hour for a wellness hour, and build healthy habits into everyday routines, you can improve well-being across a company.\n\nTo me, well-being means being productive, healthy, and happy. I put productive there because it means that happiness and health are being put to good use.\n\nI want to be a great CEO to my employees, want to inspire our clients and partners to join the movement, but more importantly, I want to be a great dad to my three kids, and a great husband to my wife.\n\nMy solution is integrating life and work. You don't need to be sacrificing your marriage or family for success.\n\nWhen people ask me, \"What are your hours?\" I say, \"I'm working all the time. I'm thinking about work when I'm exercising.\"\n\nI have also built rituals in my well-being journey that I almost never break.\n\nWhenever I'm traveling, I call my kids at 7:30 p.m. no matter what — even if that means setting an alarm for 2 a.m. It's a way for me to be close to them, no matter where I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career as a consultant?

    "title": "Trump's first year back in office was a mixed bag for the business world",
    "description": "Here are the businesses that Trump's first year back in office have greatly benefitted, and industries that have been hit hard.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's year in office was a mixed bag of blessings and woes for the business world.\n\nLast year began with a lineup of billionaires at Trump's inauguration, all of whom soon saw their net worth diminish after Trump enacted sweeping tariffs aimed at reshoring manufacturing jobs.\n\nTheir fortunes soon rebounded, and Trump has been a booster of the tech industry, which continued to grow in 2025.\n\nBusinesses were also often caught in Trump's crosshairs, including Intel, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nFrom the retail sector to the AI industry, here's how different industries fared in Trump's first year of his second term.\n\nThe AI industry continued to soar during the first year of Trump's second term.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, the company's AI basket of 34 stocks, which includes Amazon, Cisco, and Apple, saw a 50.8% in share value in 2025, while the overall stock market gained 17.3% and the broader tech sector rose 21.4%, based on the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nWithin the first month of his presidency, Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate, to be led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, which he said would be \"the largest AI infrastructure project in history.\"\n\nTrump has also been a booster of the tech industry at large — while receiving donations, gifts, pledges for more American manufacturing, and praise from leaders.\n\nHe's had notable visits with CEOs, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The US eventually allowed Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China, under the condition that the government gets a cut of the profit.\n\nTrump also rescinded an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden that established a federal framework for AI safety and risk mitigation, and he signed a new order intended to override state-level AI regulations.\n\nAnd after publicly calling for the resignation of Intel's CEO, Trump made a deal for the US to take a nearly 10% equity in the company, which has since seen its stock rise.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump's second year in office in his second term will bring.\n\nConcerns are bubbling under the industry boom. Industry experts fear that an AI bubble burst will bring about a market crash similar to the dot-com crash.\n\nTrump is also warning tech companies that data centers cannot contribute to the affordability crisis by driving up energy bills. Some tech bulls, such as Dan Ives, said that the focus on costs could derail the AI boom.\n\nRetail businesses, large and small, have been hit hard by Trump's first year back.\n\nThe Trump presidency kicked off with a flurry of tariffs, sometimes on some of the country's closest trade partners. Businesses in retail have been struggling to keep up with the pace of change, and some have responded by hiking prices.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that the tariffs had disproportionately affected Main Street and entrepreneurs who make physical products. Several small businesses sued Trump over the tariffs enacted using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nEven if businesses were able to handle tariffs, they were competing for skittish consumers after sentiment sank to a new low in November, based on the Consumer Index by the University of Chicago. Economists have also found that while the wealthy have continued to spend, others have cut back.\n\nNot everything was down. Trump did backtrack on some of his tariffs, and the retail sector did see some growth compared to 2024, according to the ‌Commerce Department's Census Bureau.\n\nDespite Trump's promise to bring blue-collar jobs back to the US and some high-profile plans, like Apple's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically and Nvidia's plans for a US-based supercomputer plant, the manufacturing sector has still not taken off.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, factory employment has dropped by more than 70,000 since April, to 12.69 million as of December, the lowest point since March 2022. The Bureau also estimated that the manufacturing sector lost 8,000 jobs in December alone.\n\nIn May 2025, a month after Trump enacted the bulk of his tariffs, Wells Fargo economists predicted that the duties would not be effective in reshoring manufacturing jobs and that the administration would face an \"uphill battle.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that some small and medium-sized businesses have canceled domestic investment plans due to economic uncertainty stemming from the constantly changing tariffs. The loss of manufacturing jobs also reflects a broader trend of a low-hire, low-fire environment, where businesses freeze in the face of an uncertain environment.\n\nTrump has shown a recent interest in policy around the sector.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump floated the idea of a 50-year fixed-rate mortgage, arguing it could make monthly payments more affordable for buyers shut out of homeownership.\n\nHe also recently said that he wants to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes in order to increase the supply of homes. He also announced that he would instruct his \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, without further clarification.\n\nHome prices rose in 77% of metro markets during the third quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors' latest report. Business Insider also previously reported that the median age of a first-time homebuyer hit 40 in 2025, up from 31 a decade earlier.\n\nEconomists have thus far commented that neither idea would address the root of the problem, which is a shortage of homes. Trump's tariffs on raw materials may have also contributed to the cost of constructing homes.",

    "fullText": "As you may have noticed, I wasn't at work last week. (Thanks, Paige, for filling in!) I decided to ease into the year sans meetings, emails, or circling back.\n\nMy intention for taking the first full week of the year off was simple: to be intentional about rest so that I can spend the next two quarters running at full speed. I had planned to do only one joyous activity per day.\n\nI started the week by taking my son to a pottery painting class and then a massage on Tuesday. Wednesday was spent decluttering the garage, followed by doing absolutely nothing but catching up on Netflix series on Thursday. I capped the week off with a Friday facial.\n\nDespite sticking to my one activity per day, I still had to get the kids off to school. I had more time, so I also offered to pick them up, too. I cooked all of my meals (because have you seen this economy?!) and I finally joined Costco. I felt very productive, but also very tired.\n\n\"There is a win. You set good intentions, and you set a plan,\" Bryant, who's also the author of \"Homecoming: Overcome Fear and Trauma to Reclaim Your Whole Authentic Self,\" told me. \"Intention doesn't equal impact.\"\n\nBryant said my mistake was clear. \"You traded labor. You did less of one job and replaced it with more of another job,\" she explained. \"The reason the exhaustion surprises you is because you're like, 'but I didn't do any work this week.' But the driving, the cooking, the baths, these things are work.\"\n\nFor you, it may not be your home life, but the incessant accumulation of small tasks or tiny decisions — whether it's text message triage, planning meet-ups with friends, or caretaking your parents — can eat up ease while on vacation.\n\nIn the future, Bryant suggested that I remember that childcare and home labor are still work, even if they are labors of love. She added that instead of taking on more at home, outsource as much as I can afford.\n\nBryant also left me with this reminder: \"Embrace the truth that 'I'm worthy of rest from it all.'\"",

    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith says Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen won’t get past the Denver Broncos — despite calling him one of the best in the business.\n\nSpeaking on ESPN’s ‘First Take’, Stephen A. Smith broke down why he believes the Buffalo Bills face an uphill battle on the road in Denver.\n\nJosh Allen, who is battling both knee and finger injuries, will lead a depleted Buffalo team into one of the most challenging environments in the league, as the Denver Broncos prepare for their first playoff home game in a decade.\n\nStephen A. Smith argued that while Josh Allen remains an elite quarterback, the Denver Broncos’ defensive front and secondary present too many problems.\n\nHe highlighted the Broncos’ relentless pass rush and all-around balance, along with the Bills’ health, as the deciding factors.\n\n“No, nonsense. This is ridiculous. Josh Allen’s got the knee injury, got the finger injury, but he’ll overcome that. They got 14 dudes on IR — 14! Okay, you got Shakir out, you got Davis out.\n\n“I’m just looking at Denver — 68 sacks on the season. You got seven different guys with at least seven sacks, led by Bonito with 14. They’re going to get to the quarterback. You got Patrick Surtain shutting down half the field. It’s just too much to overcome.”\n\nHe added that while Allen is one of the most gifted players in the NFL, this matchup heavily favours Denver. “I get it, we love Josh Allen. He’s one of the best in the business. But he’s going home.”\n\nThe Buffalo Bills enter the game with one of the longest injury lists in the league, missing several key starters on both sides of the ball.\n\nAllen’s determination is unquestioned, but the loss of top targets has forced Buffalo to adjust its offensive approach.\n\nThe Broncos, meanwhile, are rested and healthy after their bye week. With a top-tier defensive front and Patrick Surtain leading the secondary, Denver will look to capitalise on Buffalo’s thin depth to strengthen their own postseason push.\n\nSmith concluded that while Allen’s talent and leadership are undeniable, this game may simply prove too difficult given the circumstances surrounding the Bills’ roster.",

    "title": "How to lose fat while maintaining muscle, according to the personal trainers of celebrities and business execs",
    "description": "When you're in a calorie deficit, which is essential for weight loss, you risk of losing muscle. Two personal trainers explained how to avoid this.",
    "fullText": "If you want to lose fat without losing muscle, there are three things you need to know.\n\nThat's according to Magnus Lygdback, a Hollywood personal trainer who helped Alexander Skarsgård prepare to play a Viking warrior in \"The Northman,\" and Harry Cox, a personal trainer to busy C-suite execs based in London.\n\nTo lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you use, but if that number drops too low, you'll start losing muscle along with fat.\n\n\"Because your body is in an energy deficit, it's going to try and find energy wherever it can, and sometimes that ends up being muscle,\" Cox told Business Insider.\n\nYou may look slimmer, but it could backfire in the long run, because muscle mass is essential for overall health, he said. It plays a key role in regulating metabolism, including glucose levels, and increases the number of calories your body uses at rest. All this impacts body composition.\n\nWe also naturally start to lose muscle with age, and building and maintaining it allows us to move around freely, lift things, and prevent injury longterm.\n\nBoth trainers endorsed establishing long-term healthy habits like eating a balanced diet and getting enough sleep over quick fixes, which can be structured around the following three tips.\n\nStrength training regularly, particularly if you're trying to lose fat, will help you preserve muscle mass, Cox said. It signals to the body that we need it and must keep it, he said.\n\nThe most effective and evidence-backed way to build muscle is to train with progressive overload. This is where you work your muscles to the point of failure — where you could barely do even one more rep— and continually add more weight or reps as your body adapts over time.\n\nCox said the same principle applies to maintaining muscle. \"If you're just going to the gym and lifting some of the lightest dumbbells and hope that's going to help you preserve muscle, that's not the case. The training needs to be somewhat intense,\" he said.\n\nHe said to aim for a minimum of two strength training sessions a week, but that you'll likely get better results from three or four.\n\nEach workout should include at least one pulling exercise — such as a chin-up, pull-up, or lat pull-down — a push exercise — such as a push-up, bench press, or shoulder press — and some kind of leg exercise — such as a lunge, squat, or deadlift.\n\n\"If you start putting in place those healthier habits of eating more protein, exercising more frequently, a lot of the time, the fat loss happens as a byproduct without even focusing on it,\" Cox said.\n\nProtein is the building block of muscle, so eating enough is crucial for maintaining muscle while losing fat, Lygdback said.\n\nWhether or not you're trying to lose weight, you should aim to eat the same quantity of protein  to maintain your muscles , he said.\n\n\"You don't really want to adjust that too much if you ask me. And I never do,\" he said.\n\nThe scientific literature recommends eating between 1.6 and 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight a day to support recovery and maintain or build muscle mass, Cox said.\n\nA person who weighs 60 kilograms would aim to eat 120 grams of protein each day, for example.\n\nIf you're struggling to eat enough protein, the trainers recommended educating yourself on which foods are high in protein, using protein powder if necessary, and not being afraid to order double protein in a restaurant.\n\nTo lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat, known as a calorie deficit. But building muscle requires being in a calorie surplus. That's why it can be hard to lose weight without shedding muscle instead of fat.\n\nYou can achieve it though by tracking macronutrients (protein, fats, and carbohydrates), Lygdback said . You don't have to weigh out your food at every meal, but it might be helpful to track your meals for a few days to get a sense of what 30 grams or protein, or 500 calories of rice looks like, for example, he said.\n\nChicken, rice, and broccoli is the staple gym bro diet. But you don't need to eat that to reach your goals, he said. Just make sure you have enough protein, while eating in an overall calorie deficit. \"You want to make sure to keep the protein high enough, and the carbs and fat low enough,\" he said.\n\nLygdback recommended cutting your daily calories by 10 to 20%. \"You don't want to go too extreme,\" he said.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported on how to calculate your macros depending on your weight and activity levels.",

    "title": "I'm delivering for Uber Eats after decades in corporate marketing. It's helped me make money — and stay humble.",
    "description": "Jay Mandel spent decades in the corporate world in marketing roles before turning to Uber Eats last fall. It pays the bills and is humbling, he said.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jay Mandel, a 48-year-old marketing professional who also works for Uber Eats in the New York City area. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI worked most of my career in corporate America in digital marketing.\n\nThe highlight of my career was my eight years at MasterCard, where I worked my way up to lead global social media as a vice president. I've also worked at IBM. More recently, I've worked as a marketing consultant and an adjunct professor, but this hasn't generated enough income. Right now, I'm raising money to build my own company.\n\nThe idea of starting gig work came from my therapist, who said it would do wonders for me to see how others live.\n\nI avoided it for several months. I went to Columbia University. I have a master's degree. I talked to people that I love, and they were like, \"You shouldn't have to resort to this.\"\n\nEventually, in October, I delivered my first Uber Eats order.\n\nEarly on, I got the feeling that I was invisible to most people. For one order, I had to go pick up a cake. It turned out the bakery didn't have the cake the customer wanted, so I spent 20 minutes on the phone with the customer while I spoke with the bakery to find something else that would work.\n\nWhen I finally made the delivery, the woman who ordered the cake had a blank look on her face — no \"thank you,\" no extra tip, or anything. In my past jobs, putting in extra effort usually resulted in some sort of recognition. With delivery work, I haven't felt that a lot of times.\n\nThen I realized that these companies charge so much money for these deliveries. It shouldn't be the customer's responsibility to tip.\n\nI also don't always feel like I have a choice about which orders I can take. Sometimes, it doesn't work for me to pick up or drop off in the Bronx, and I usually don't want to pick up McDonald's orders.\n\nI've done deliveries for Uber Courier, which involves delivering items between regular people. In one case, it was a backpack. Another time, it was a charger. It's a really valuable service, and I wish that Uber leaned into more of those deliveries.\n\nI use the money I earn from Uber — often a few hundred dollars a week — to make sure that my kids have a great weekend, like going out to dinner.\n\nOverall, my experience working for Uber Eats has been humbling. I don't see myself as any better than other delivery people. I try my best to smile and be the bright moment in someone else's day. I also have fun, get to visit new restaurants, and see neighborhoods I would never go to otherwise.\n\nIt's so tough to figure out how common my experience is as someone turning to gig work to pay the bills while still nurturing professional ambitions. The unemployment numbers don't capture people like me who do gig work. I never thought I'd struggle as much as I have financially, and it feels like more of my friends than not are in my situation.\n\nI don't view my employment situation as a result of my actions. Whether it's Uber Eats or teaching as an adjunct, this is part of a large system over which I have no control.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Meet a millennial who pivoted from a corporate marketing career to owning his own business. It came with a pay cut but offered more flexibility.",
    "description": "Lloyd Fisher shared what his career change, from corporate marketing to starting his own small landscaping business, has been like.",
    "fullText": "Lloyd Fisher was ready for a career change — leaving behind about a decade doing marketing in the corporate world to become his own boss.\n\nJob cuts and decisions beyond his control helped ignite the pivot, and in December 2023, the Georgia resident launched Oak Avenue Landscaping.\n\nFisher, who is in his 30s, enjoys working for himself without being tied down to one employer. He doesn't think he will apply for a full-time corporate role again since it wouldn't be fulfilling anymore, as his views of career success have shifted.\n\nHis net income in the first two years of business was less than what he made at his last job, but he enjoys the control he now has and doing something he's passionate about.\n\n\"It's not a paycheck, it's not a means to an end. It's something that has just given me a different type of satisfaction and just purpose,\" he said.\n\nFisher said he had his severance to fall back on while he got his new career off the ground.\n\nHe said his first year in business involved a lot of investing in vehicles and equipment, affecting his overall profit. He said startups typically invest most of their profits back into their businesses in the first few years of operating. He also had to figure out the ins and outs of being a business owner, including pricing.\n\n\"There were things that I had definitely underbid in my first year, where I learned this is exactly how you need to be pricing these things and accounting for different variables,\" he said.\n\nHis offered services range in price, from a couple of hundred dollars for landscape design to thousands for new lawns or garden bed makeovers. Some of the services could cost six figures.\n\nAs of December 22, Fisher made about $52,000 in net income in 2025, nearly six figures in gross profit, and had about $37,000 in expenses.\n\nHis net income exceeded his 2024 earnings, but was less than the six-figure salary at his last job. He doubled his revenue to about $430,000 as of December 22, 2025. A large amount of that has gone toward subcontractors. He's hoping to lessen that cost one day, aiming to build out his own team as he expands.\n\n\"It's definitely given me enough to sustain the family and also just put back into the business as much as I want,\" he said.\n\nHis business uses fully electric equipment and focuses on sustainability. Fisher, who moved to the US from South Africa in 2013, said his passion for people caring about their outdoor space in an environmentally friendly manner started when he moved to Atlanta from New York in 2017. \"It's a city in a forest; there is just so much natural beauty here,\" he said.\n\nFisher said he already had \"a feeling of restlessness just to get it started\" before the last job cut. He took on a \"passion project\" of landscaping on the side, where he could leverage his marketing skills and try to help generate more leads.\n\nHe watched videos on YouTube to learn about how to create a self-charging trailer for his equipment, and researched plants, hardscaping, and masonry online. Beyond studying, he said he went through trial and error in his garden. He said he dove headfirst into running the business, using what he learned during the passion project, and as time went on.\n\nFisher wished he had known before making the career pivot just how much patience is needed to start a business. He suggested that anyone else looking to run their own business learn how to be uncomfortable because it comes with a lot of variables that you can't always plan for.\n\nHe said starting a business idea as a side hustle could be beneficial because people would still have another stream of income to fall back on and support this goal. He suggested having at least a few months of financial stability before pivoting to doing your business full time.\n\nHowever, he finds the downside of a side gig is that it can slow down the process of building up a new venture.\n\n\"Looking back on it now, I feel like I would've got started sooner and up to speed a lot faster if I'd just gone all in on the one thing,\" Fisher said.\n\nHe said he enjoys developing relationships with clients, which helps him feel like he's part of the community in Georgia.\n\nHe said operating a small business can be lonely, particularly with all the obstacles that can come with it. \"No one really understands the different challenges that you're going through every single day and all those different ways that you need to overcome those challenges,\" he said.\n\nHe said his wife helps him see the positive side when things are stressful, is helpful in navigating issues, and has been supportive of making the career pivot.\n\nFisher doesn't work alone. He has one full-time employee, his lead crew member, and used to have a laborer. He also works with an installation team for large projects. He said he's still using his marketing background to help with leads and sales.\n\nFisher has enjoyed spending time with family or taking time away without feeling guilty about it. He said his family from South Africa was able to visit in the summer.\n\n\"Even though it was a very busy season, I've got such a great team that I was able to lean on them, and they were here for over a month,\" he said.\n\nFisher said he also took his kids to visit Disney in Florida for the first time. He said he didn't feel guilty about spending that time away \"because I wasn't looking over my shoulder to see if my manager was approving the vacation days.\"\n\nBeing a business owner allows him to have some flexibility and feel more liberated with his schedule.\n\n\"If there's some days where I'm feeling stressed out and want to go play a round of golf, I can do that,\" he said. \"I know what work I need to be doing that day, and if I'm taking care of my responsibilities, then there's no specific timeframe that needs to happen with them.\"\n\nFisher also now has more time to develop another venture focused on marketing. He said he has made some money and is planning to focus more on the agency, which he started last year, \"now that more systems are in place for the landscaping business.\"\n\nIn 2026, he hopes to generate more profit, add more kinds of services, educate more people in the Atlanta area about the pros of all-electric landscaping, and work with more commercial clients so larger entities can leverage sustainable landscaping practices.",

    "title": "Why Democrats are gearing up to oppose a bill to curtail stock trading in Congress",
    "description": "\"This bill is a scam. It is not a congressional stock trading ban,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The House is set to vote on a bill to significantly curtail congressional stock trading in the coming weeks. Democrats say it's a scam.\n\n\"This bill is a scam. It is not a congressional stock trading ban,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told Business Insider. \"It is written precisely for the wealthiest members of Congress.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Committee on House Administration passed a bill called the \"Stop Insider Trading Act.\" Backed by House GOP leadership, the bill would ban sitting members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children from buying new stocks in publicly traded companies.\n\nIt would be the most significant change to stock trading rules in over a decade. Yet the bill falls far short of other long-standing proposals on the issue.\n\nMost significantly, it allows lawmakers to hold onto their existing stock holdings, a provision that Republicans have insisted on in the name of ensuring that financially successful people aren't deterred from serving.\n\n\"The focus of the bill is not to make elected officials poor,\" Republican Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the committee, said at the bill's markup on Wednesday. \"The focus is to prevent them from benefiting off their insider information.\"\n\nThe bill also allows lawmakers to sell their existing stocks, as long as they disclose the sale at least seven days before.\n\nDemocrats have also taken issue with several other provisions in the bill, including one that allows lawmakers' family members to trade stocks on behalf of another person.\n\nSteil said on Wednesday that the provision was intended to allow family members whose jobs involve stock trading to continue doing so.\n\nBut Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York dubbed the provision the \"grandma loophole,\" because family members can \"freely trade stocks on behalf of their parents or grandparents with a member of Congress in line to inherit the estate.\"\n\n\"This is a loophole so big, you could fly a Qatari jet right through it,\" Morelle said.\n\nAt the Wednesday markup, Democrats offered a slew of amendments to fix what they saw as problems with the bill, including broadening the scope of who's prohibited from trading, adding a divestiture requirement, striking a provision that allows lawmakers to reinvest stock dividends, and even replacing the bill wholesale with a separate Democratic-backed stock trading ban.\n\nAll of them were voted down, and the bill ultimately cleared the committee without Democratic support.\n\nSteil contended that Democrats were making a \"Goldilocks argument\" in their opposition to his bill, and that it represented the best chance at passing any new restrictions this Congress.\n\n\"The porridge is too hot, the porridge is too cold,\" Steil said. \"They may try to allow perfection to be the enemy of the good.\"\n\nDemocrats countered that the bill simply does not meet the definition of a stock trading ban.\n\n\"There's no porridge in the bowl,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, a Texas Democrat who's moved to divest from her own significant stock holdings since coming to Congress last year. \"It doesn't have any real teeth. There's not a meal to be had here.\"\n\nDespite the years-long efforts by a bipartisan coalition to bring a stock trading ban to the floor, the issue appears likely now to be fracturing along party lines.\n\nMorelle told reporters that he plans to file a \"discharge petition,\" a legislative maneuver to force a vote on a bill if it garners signatures from a majority of the chamber, for a separate bill that would include stronger stock trading restrictions and also apply those restrictions to the president and vice president.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate bipartisan discharge petition on a bill that does not include the executive branch is languishing, with Democratic leadership opposing that effort.\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas, one of the Republicans who had been part of the bipartisan group, told Business Insider that he was satisfied with Steil's bill, even if it wasn't as strong as the bill he's long pushed for.\n\n\"It's a really good bill,\" Roy said. \"If you'd asked me when I set out down this road five years ago that we'd get that? It's a good bill.\"\n\nAnd at least one Democrat — Rep. Josh Riley of New York — said that he plans to support the GOP-backed proposal.\n\n\"I would love to see a bill that completely drains the swamp, and gets everybody to divest investments, and the whole thing,\" Riley told Business Insider. \"I also came here to get stuff done, and this bill is something we can get done, and it's going to make really meaningful progress.\"",

Each had two different massage therapists,\" investigators wrote. \"During the massages, the undercover detectives were solicited by the massage therapists.

Investigators said Mandarin Chinese translators were used in both interviews.\n\nHuang, per court documents, asked for a lawyer after she was read her Miranda rights. Chao, however, said she was referred by a friend in California to come work at the business, and that she and Huang had only worked at the business for a couple of days.\n\n\"Chao denied performing sexual acts for money,\" read a portion of the court documents.\n\nBoth Chao and Huang are accused of Maintaining a House of Prostitution, which is a felony under Arizona law.\n\nArea where the incident happened\n\nInformation for this article was gathered from relevant court documents.",

We propose a novel mechanism whereby banks use portfolio opacity to meet this objective. Specifically, banks choose opaque portfolios to secure cheap long-term funding while trading off insolvency and illiquidity. We show that while opacity lowers deposit rates, it also leaves depositors with only noisy information about the bank’s solvency, making them cautious about keeping their funds in the bank—particularly when interest rates are high. We show that opacity raises bank profits, sometimes at the cost of exposure to high probability of illiquidity. In particular, in high-rate environments, banks adopt excessive opacity to further reduce deposit rates—at the cost of more frequent early failures.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to Philip Bond, Mike Burkart, Leonardo D’Amico, Douglas Diamond, Thierry Foucault, Todd Keister, Martin Oehmke, Guillermo Ordonez, Cecilia Parlatore, Anatoli Segura, Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi, Victoria Vanasco, Ernst-Ludwig von Thadden and Zhen Zhou for useful comments.

    "title": "Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos tries to solve his movie problem",
    "description": "Netflix made streaming movies at home a big part of its pitch. Now, as it tries to buy Warner Bros. and its giant movie business, things are changing.",
    "fullText": "Netflix spent a lot of time arguing that the future of movies was watching them at home, not in theaters.\n\nNow Netflix wants to buy a movie studio that puts movies into theaters. So it's started saying that watching movies in theaters is good, sometimes.\n\nThat's the messaging Netflix has been trying to make ever since it announced plans to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in December. But that messaging hasn't been satisfying to some people who care a lot about the future of movies in theaters.\n\nWhich is why Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared in The New York Times on Friday, talking about how much he likes the business of putting movies into theaters. Again, it's an idea he's been talking about since he announced the (proposed) Netflix/WBD deal on December 5.\n\nSarandos did say one thing he thinks is new and important: A commitment to keep all future Warner Bros. movies in theaters for at least 45 days:\n\nThat 45-day commitment won't mean much to most people. But Sarandos definitely thinks it matters — \"I'm giving you a hard number.\"\n\nThe very abbreviated backstory: Sarandos and Netflix have spent years fighting the idea of a theatrical \"window\" — the amount of time movies spend exclusively in theaters before they move to platforms like streaming services, rentals, and purchases. Their general argument: If people want to watch movies at home — that is, on Netflix — they should get to do that.\n\nNetflix has periodically had to soften that stance to accommodate high-profile movies and talent, which is why you could see Martin Scorcese's \"The Irishman\" in theaters for a few weeks before it came to Netfix in 2019, and why \"Barbie\" director Gretg Gerwig's \"Narnia\" will be in Imax theaters for a couple weeks this fall before it comes to Netflix. Netflix has also periodically debated its streaming-only/mostly stance internally.\n\nBut externally, Sarandos has been a huge promoter of the idea that the future of movies is at home — which happens to align with the fact that moviegoing has been in decline for years. That's not just because of Netflix, but because the internet gives people lots of other things to do besides going to theaters.\n\nNow, as he prepares to buy WBD, Sarandos has had to change his tune. The shortest version of his new one: We weren't in the business of putting movies into theaters, but if we buy WBD, we will be, so we'll do that.\n\nBut that hasn't convinced lots of people that a business built on streaming is going to become one that cares about theaters.\n\nIn part, that's because Sarandos also said things like \"our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members because that's what they're looking for,\" when announcing the deal. He's also said he hopes \"windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker\" — which reasonable people believe means he intends for movies to spend less time in theaters.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount, the Hollywood studio that would like to buy WBD instead, has made a commitment to putting movies in theaters, and honoring \"healthy traditional windows\" as part of its talking points.\n\nSo now, Sarandos has planted a 45-day flag. Whether that mollifies Hollywood or anyone else is an open question.",

    "title": "I tried Amazon's Zoox. It's unlike any robotaxi out there.",
    "description": "Zoox's robotaxis do not have a steering wheel and are bi-directional. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee described the experience as like a theme park ride.",
    "fullText": "Of all the robotaxis I've tried, Amazon's Zoox feels different.\n\nZoox — founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon four years later — is a robotaxi company that has limited operations in Las Vegas and San Francisco with about 50 vehicles between the two major cities. The company has said Austin and Miami are next on the map.\n\nThe service is considerably smaller than its competitor, Waymo, and that limitation was acutely felt in my experience hailing a Zoox on a Thursday night in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nHowever, the rider experience itself felt more akin to an amusement-park-ride-slash-party-bus than an average ride-hail service in an everyday car, which makes Zoox a true differentiator against the emerging players in the robotaxi race.\n\nThe company doesn't bulk order vehicles from automakers to retrofit them with sensors the same way Waymo or Uber does. Instead, Zoox designed a vehicle solely for robotaxi operations and builds the cars out of a factory in Hayward, California.\n\nThe robotaxi doesn't have a steering wheel or brake pedal — only seats inside the vehicle. The car is also bi-directional, meaning the Zoox's \"front\" goes both ways.\n\nThis helps the vehicle navigate tight spaces and avoid the need to execute U-turns or three-point turns.\n\nHowever, riders will mainly feel the difference once they step inside the Zoox.\n\nA chime plays as the robotaxi's doors slide open — almost like a grand entrance to the Zoox experience.\n\nThe interior reminded me of one of those immersive Disneyland rides or even a party-themed Gondola lift.\n\nInside, there are four seats — two on each side of the car, facing each other. I found that it encourages a social experience if you're bringing along multiple riders.\n\nThe headliner — or the roof — of the robotaxi has starlights which reminded me of the inside a Rolls-Royce or limousine. That touch felt especially appropriate for the Vegas scene, but it also seemed to add to the overall social experience Zoox is going for. It feels like a party inside the car.\n\nSurprisingly, the seats were comfortable. The photos and videos I've seen of the Zoox made me think the seats would feel like a bus or subway seat, but they have a plush touch to them.\n\nI don't see myself falling asleep inside the vehicle, simply because you're forced to sit upright and can't lie back in the seats, but they're comfortable enough for a 30- to 45-minute ride.\n\nAnother surprise: There's plenty of leg room that provides enough space between you and another rider in front of you. I went on a Zoox ride with a company spokesperson facing me, and space was not an issue.\n\nI tried a Zoox facing forward and backward inside the car.\n\nThere have been some reports of riders feeling nauseous when they face backward. I didn't experience that, but that could just be unique to me.\n\nThe Zoox app tells riders which way to face if they are prone to motion sickness.\n\nOutside the flashy headliner, there's little else inside the car. There are four wireless phone chargers, two small armrests, and four touchscreens by each of the seats, which allow riders to control the cabin temperature, change the music, and call for rider support.\n\nZoox is in a pilot stage of its operation in Las Vegas, working with fewer than 50 robotaxis inside the city. The service is free for now and limited to a handful of preset destinations.\n\nI hailed a Zoox from one of the stops, the Luxor Hotel, and was given a 25-minute wait time. The real wait-time was 37 minutes.\n\nThose two factors alone — limited destinations and long wait times — make Zoox less of a serious choice for day-to-day travel and more like a novelty experience to try once.\n\nThe rider experience also has room for improvement.\n\nFor all the effort Zoox put into creating a social in-car experience, the company has yet to provide riders with the option to connect to their Spotify or Apple Music. For now, passengers hear a curated music service from Stingray Music — similar to an iHeartRadio program.\n\nThe ride itself was mostly smooth. There was one moment that stuck out while the Zoox was going down the Strip.\n\nTraffic was heavy at night, and the Zoox attempted to make a lane change while it was stopped behind a line of cars waiting at a red light.\n\nThe robotaxi began to move into the right lane, possibly to navigate around the traffic and transition to a less-congested lane. As it began to enter the right lane, with the body of the car now at a diagonal, the Zoox suddenly stopped. The car hesitated, lurched a little bit forward, and paused again. About 10 seconds later, the car straightened out and remained in the current lane.\n\nZoox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter a nearly 35-minute ride, I was dropped off at AREA15, a Vegas entertainment hub that was one of the closest stops to my hotel.\n\nA couple who had just taken a ride before me was trying to hail another Zoox to get back to their hotel at Excalibur.\n\nThe outside temperature was around 40 degrees.\n\nWe both resorted to calling an Uber.",

    "description": "Justine Tello shares the lessons she learned from leaving public relations for teaching, then pivoting to running a small business with her spouse.",
    "fullText": "In July 2024, five years into my career, I made a drastic job switch that I would soon come to regret.\n\nFollowing about a year of disenchantment at my workplace, I left my job at a public relations agency to become a high school English teacher. I took a nearly 36% pay cut.\n\nI wasn't concerned about my paycheck because I desired a more meaningful and impactful role. I soon found myself underprepared and overwhelmed by the switch, and I left my teaching role after my first semester.\n\nAt first, I relied on my savings, my family's support, and my meager earnings as a part-time yoga teacher. My then-boyfriend and I got engaged and were married six months later.\n\nNow, we co-own a small HVAC and electrical company, where I lead the communications and marketing strategy.\n\nI loved getting to know the students and having the opportunity to mentor some of them. I learned many new skills while preparing lessons and grading papers.\n\nWhen it came to my career and my goals, the position didn't align with what I had historically wanted, and I didn't accept the job with a strategy in mind — I accepted it to pursue something new, whether I was prepared for it or not.\n\nTruthfully, I switched careers because I was dissatisfied with my original place of work, feeling stagnant in my personal growth, and lacking interest in my clients' missions. Instead of reframing my perspective or setting a new career goal, I sought a quick escape.\n\nAfter a year of reflection, I've identified three crucial mistakes that led to my unsatisfying career change.\n\nIn my final year at my PR agency, I found myself more easily discouraged by problems that were smaller than I initially perceived, or by those that had been resolved yet still lingered in my mind, like a delayed promotion, company layoffs, and a dissonant relationship with a supervisor.\n\nThese were challenging, but for the most part, I believe that the company and my managers handled problems well, and things began to smooth out over time.\n\nUnfortunately, my attitude toward my workplace remained negative after a handful of poor, back-to-back experiences. Although I was working with several amazing team members and continued to take on tasks I enjoyed, my dissatisfaction with my workplace persisted.\n\nI was burned out and a little lonely. I had been working remotely for over four years, which takes a toll on an extrovert like me, despite spending many evenings and weekends with friends and family. I longed for a position that included in-person connections, and I latched onto the idea that I could only solve my issues by switching to a new workplace.\n\nI halfheartedly applied to new PR jobs, but nothing panned out. I applied for a position as a high school English teacher on the recommendation of a family member, not because teaching was my ultimate passion, but because people are, and it felt like a way to contribute something meaningful.\n\nThe offer letter was framed as a call to something greater, and it felt like I would be filling a role that desperately needed someone. While I longed to have a positive impact on their lives, I also felt an obligation to accept the position.\n\nIf I could step back in time to the middle of my discontent in my PR role, I would try to reframe my perspective and approach my job with a different attitude. Every job can be impactful and meaningful if approached with the perspective of doing your best for yourself and for others.\n\nIf I still found my PR job no longer a fit and longed to have a greater impact on the world, the next step shouldn't have been to bail, but rather to determine clear career goals that aligned with my personal values and mission.\n\nI tried to pursue a shiny, new calling rather than develop a solid career plan. It didn't work out because I gave significant weight to one over the other, but the two can fit hand in hand.\n\nIt's better to approach a career change intentionally and with an overarching goal, rather than latching onto a new idea and pursuing it blindly. Oftentimes, it's frightening to define our goals and a solid plan, because we feel that once we decide on a direction, we can never change our path. That's inaccurate.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would've drawn up a clear plan — perhaps including multiple potential pathways — before switching fields. If the desire to teach high school English was lying dormant somewhere inside my heart, it surely would've made itself known in a new-career-ideas brainstorm.\n\nI would recommend that anyone looking to discover their true passion or calling jot down a mix of their skills and interests, and then research which jobs align with both. If a new career of interest arises, pursue it intentionally by identifying existing or gaining new relevant experience and by connecting with people in the field.\n\nI quit my teaching role because of long work hours, emotional exhaustion, and a sense that I was operating in a silo. A few other teachers occasionally offered me encouragement or advice, but I was still required to create curricula from scratch and develop my lessons on my own.\n\nWhile I would like to change some of my past career choices, I don't regret the lessons I learned and the students and coworkers I met.\n\nI'm grateful to have had the opportunity to discover more about myself through this process — to see where I can change my attitude, set new goals, and achieve greater things in the future. Every failure is a learning experience, and I'll try to make this one count.",

    "description": "Hope...",
    "fullText": "The spectacle of Nicolás Maduro’s capture has drawn attention away from the quieter imposition of systems and power networks that constitute colonial rule.\n\nAccusations of neocolonialism against the United States following Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela are not wrong—but they are focused on the wrong thing. The spectacle of Nicolás Maduro’s capture has drawn attention away from the quieter installation of systems and power networks that constitute colonial rule. If we ignore those systems now, Venezuela could slide into a colonial state that US policymakers and citizens will hardly be able to see, let alone contest.\n\nColonialism is not defined by spectacle but by the imposition of infrastructures of power, and history shows that private companies have been at the forefront of constructing this influence. The imperial 19th century offers a warning: Some of the most exploitative power imbalances of the colonial world began not with conquest but with private corporate investment.\n\nThe abduction of Maduro was a blatant violation of a globally recognized norm: territorial sovereignty. Governments around the world have condemned the operation as illegal. That condemnation, however, is largely rhetorical. There is no global litigator of international law. International law relies on collective enforcement, and Venezuela is demonstrating how thin that protection can be when confronted with overwhelming power.\n\nThe Trump administration is acting as if the postwar international order never existed. Actions in Venezuela, alongside Donald Trump’s broader hegemonic declarations about the Americas and Greenland, suggest a return to a world before international law—a world governed by imperial prerogative. This isn’t even neocolonialism; it’s simply colonialism. The danger of the “neo” qualifier is that it risks distancing the present from a past that is reasserting itself with unsettling familiarity.\n\nThe difference between war and colonialism lies in durability: the establishment of long-term control through structures of governance. This control can appear limited or indirect. Colonialism announces itself not only through occupation but also through legal, economic, and administrative rule. At its height, the British Empire ruled vast territory without blanket military occupation. Control was typically exercised indirectly through trade monopolies, legal authority, and administrative influence, with force deployed selectively rather than continuously.\n\nUnderstanding colonialism this way clarifies what to look for in Venezuela—and, crucially, where our outrage should be directed.\n\nHistory suggests several warning signs of durable colonial control. First is the injection of the colonizer’s legal systems. This can occur at a high level, through the enforcement of norms surrounding human rights or transnational crime (such as the illicit drug trade), or at a lower level, through the restructuring of domestic legal regimes governing contracts, property, or due process. Second is control over key economic sectors. In the 19th century, Britain repeatedly reshaped colonial economies by redirecting trade, reorganizing labor, and privileging extractive industries, which entrenched imperial authority while appearing commercially neutral. These economic transformations did more to stabilize empire than any military campaign.\n\nThird, empire was also administered from within. British officials embedded themselves in local courts and political systems, exercising authority through advisory roles and indirect oversight rather than overt annexation, echoing the advisory role the administration has hinted at for Venezuela.\n\nWhile colonialism and empire are often treated as the remit of the state, chartered companies typically led the way. This wasn’t just because they were convenient; profit-seeking institutions were structurally aligned with the economic logic of empire. Private corporations, granted monopolies of trade, were often the first imperial actors on the ground. They signed treaties, raised military forces, and enforced their own law—initially over employees and then eventually over entire populations. For overstretched empires, particularly Britain during its near-constant wars with France, this was a cost-effective means of expansion.\n\nThe first warning sign of colonialism, then, is not invasion but corporate entry. The most important place to look for colonialism in Venezuela is not, for instance, the placement of naval vessels but the decisions of oil companies. President Trump’s declaration that the US oil industry will “rebuild” Venezuela’s oil infrastructure, alongside his support for Delcy Rodríguez—a long-standing oil industry ally—as interim president, positions US companies for deep incursion into not just Venezuela’s oil economy but also its governance writ large. It would place a dominant industry tightly linked to political authority under US corporate direction.\n\nAlready, the response to Trump’s push for oil company investment in Venezuela, the warning signs are appearing. While CEO of ExxonMobil Darren Woods said Venezuela was “uninvestable,” he followed up with the assertion that “significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system, there has to be durable investment protections.” ExxonMobil’s involvement is conditional on, among other factors, the Trump administration’s ability to pressure Venezuela to rewrite laws governing its oil industry. In terms of promises Trump can make to the oil executives, changes to Venezuela’s legal governance of the industry is much cheaper and easier than promising security or subsidizing infrastructure construction. The leverage on offer is not tanks or troops, but the law.\n\nFor the left, this distinction matters. Focusing outrage on the spectacle of intervention or the legality of Maduro’s kidnapping risks missing the more durable threat: the embedding of private commercial actors in governance itself. Historically, it was these arrangements, not dramatic seizures of power, that stabilized colonial rule and rendered it difficult to reverse.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nThe risk is compounded by a lack of transparency. Despite the long relationship between the US oil industry and American grand strategy, shifting Venezuelan diplomacy to private companies alters what information is available to the public. The privatization of diplomacy makes intervention harder to see and harder to contest. Even policymakers may find themselves excluded from decisions that shape long-term commitments.\n\nHistory also shows where this path leads. Governance is expensive. The protection of trade is costly if done both independently or dependent on state support. Chartered companies were frequently insolvent. One of the earliest corporate bailouts occurred in the 17th century, when the British East India Company required parliamentary support to continue operating. Despite their aptitude for profit-seeking, companies could not finance the administrative and infrastructural burdens they assumed on behalf of empire.\n\nAllowing companies such as the US oil industry to lead the reconstruction of a strategically vital sector is therefore likely to fail in one of two ways. Either the state will provide substantial financial support, or it will intervene directly to protect and administer corporate interests. Both outcomes deepen colonial power and redirect profit and agency away from the Venezuelan people. Early indications suggest the administration is prepared to pursue the former, with reports circulating that Trump may subsidize oil companies’ efforts in Venezuela. The robust naval activity of the past several weeks, however, also does not rule out the latter.\n\nThe stakes for the US public are huge. Financially, the United States risks committing itself to a multibillion-dollar investment in another nation’s industrial infrastructure. Politically, it risks escalating adversarial competition. Morally, it risks becoming like the empire it claimed to leave behind in 1776.\n\nThe danger is not that Americans will choose colonialism but that it will be built inconspicuously, through contracts and corporate governance, before anyone is asked to consent.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes you need a little assistance when making a big business decision. Fortunately, the best consulting firms in the country are here to help.\n\nBusiness Insider teamed up with Plant-A Insights, a leading insights and technology company that publishes business rankings in cooperation with world-class media brands, to find the 300 top management consulting firms in America. The list includes giants of the industry as well as a slew of more specialized and boutique firms.\n\nThe list is based on a large-scale survey of around 25,000 professionals who have worked with consulting firms, who evaluated them on factors like industry and practice area expertise, as well as client satisfaction. Other reputational measures, like the firms' placement in other industry rankings, were also factored in. The full methodology can be found at the bottom of this article.\n\nAmerica's Top Management Consulting Firms 2026, a collaboration between Business Insider and Plant-A Insights Group, recognizes the best management consultancies in the United States. The ranking highlights companies that excel in providing their expertise across multiple industries and practice areas. The results are based on a comprehensive study combining extensive desk research with a large-scale survey of over 25,000 U.S. working professionals with direct experience working with management consulting firms.\n\nTo be eligible for consideration, a firm had to provide consulting and advisory services to companies located within the United States. An initial list of over 15,000 firms was screened and validated, resulting in a final list of 2,200 firms for evaluation, categorized across 15 industries and 14 practice areas. This list was further validated with support from data analytics company Aniline.\n\nEligible firms were evaluated in a nationwide survey of over 25,000 respondents that took place between August 2025 and October 2025. This included more than 18,000 respondents who recently worked with the firms on a project and over 7,000 individuals who were a part of the selection committees that hired them.\n\nRespondents evaluated their experience working with consulting firms across three areas: Industry Expertise, Practice Area Expertise, and Client Satisfaction\n\nAn overall score for each consultancy was calculated by combining the Industry Score, Practice Area Score, and the Client Satisfaction Score using a proprietary scoring model. Firms also received bonus points for being featured in other credible industry rankings, serving as a proxy for sustained industry recognition. The 300 highest-scoring management consulting firms were recognized by Business Insider and Plant-A Insights Group as America's Top Management Consulting Firms 2026.\n\nThe exclusion of a company from this ranking is not a reflection on its quality or performance and is not disputed.\n\nCritical Mention media monitoring platform Onclusive was utilized to investigate whether management consulting firms were implicated in a wide range of significant issues within the past two years (Dec 1, 2023 — Dec 1, 2025). This included a review of financial misconduct (such as fraud, accounting scandals), legal and regulatory actions (like major lawsuits, settlements, or investigations by the SEC or DOJ), and workplace and labor violations (including discrimination or harassment lawsuits). Any management consultancy found engaging in such practices was subsequently excluded from the final ranking list.

    "description": "OpenAI leads enterprise AI adoption among US businesses, outpacing Anthropic and Google. Ramp data shows rising paid usage in December 2025.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is crushing it with business users and is far ahead of rivals such as Anthropic and Google in the enterprise AI market, according to new data this week.\n\nThat's a contrast to some of the hand-ringing that's gone on since Google's Gemini chatbot began gaining on ChatGPT a few months ago.\n\nThe new data comes from Ramp, a startup that helps companies pay their bills. Ramp analyzes corporate card and bill-paying activity on its platform from more than 50,000 US businesses to track billions of dollars spent on AI services each month.\n\nThe latest numbers cover December 2025. The report shows that OpenAI regained momentum among US businesses, posting its strongest growth in months as overall corporate adoption of AI continued to accelerate.\n\nThe share of US businesses paying for AI products and services rose to 46.6% in December, up 1.6 percentage points from November. That was the largest month-over-month increase since mid-2025, Ramp data shows.\n\nMuch of that growth was driven by OpenAI. Business adoption of OpenAI products climbed two percentage points to 36.8%, reversing a short-lived slowdown in the fall and reaching a new record high. Ramp's line-item data shows gains in both enterprise chat subscriptions and API spending, suggesting broader OpenAI usage across office workers and technical teams.\n\nIt's unclear how many current paid users OpenAI has, but the company said in November 2025 that it had 1 million business customers.\n\nThe rebound underscores OpenAI's continued dominance in the enterprise AI market at a time when companies are moving beyond experimentation. Rather than trial use, December's growth reflects recurring spend tied to everyday business functions, including software development, research, finance, sales, and customer support.\n\nCompetitors continued to gain ground, though at a slower pace. Anthropic's adoption rose to 16.7%, with growth concentrated among technology companies making heavy use of APIs.\n\nGoogle's AI adoption increased to 4.3%, a figure Ramp notes likely understates usage because many businesses access Gemini for free through Google Workspace plans.\n\nThese Ramp numbers also exclude business use of free AI tools, in which no paid transaction occurs, and when employees use personal accounts with AI companies to complete work tasks. This means the data likely underestimates actual AI adoption rates.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Microsoft promised consumers won't foot the bill for its data centers. Our interactive map shows where its facilities are located.",
    "description": "Business Insider found where 44 of Microsoft's data centers are located as of 2024. It promised this week consumers won't be on the hook for them.",
    "fullText": "As backlash intensifies against data centers nationwide, Microsoft says it has a plan.\n\n\"We'll pay our way to ensure our datacenters don't increase your electricity prices,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, wrote in a blog post one day after President Trump said in a Truth Social post that he does not want Americans to \"pick up the tab\" for data center electricity costs. Microsoft, he said, was \"first up.\"\n\nThe announcement comes amid an unprecedented data center construction boom across the US. Developers filed permits for 1,240 data centers in the US as of 2024 — roughly quadruple the level in 2010, according to a 2025 Business Insider investigation.\n\nWith it has come concerns over rising consumer electricity costs and grassroots opposition to construction buildouts.\n\nMicrosoft filed permits for 44 data centers as of the end of 2024, Business Insider found, the fifth highest count in our analysis. Half of Microsoft's permitted facilities are among the very largest in the analysis — the 322 massive data centers that we estimated consume 40 megawatts of electricity or more each.\n\nTake a look at where Microsoft's data centers are found:\n\nTwenty-four of Microsoft's data centers are located in Virginia as of 2024, followed by Texas with eight, and Illinois and Iowa each with four, according to Business Insider's count.\n\nMicrosoft's data centers are extremely electricity-intensive, Business Insider's analysis suggests. Its most power-intensive facility as of 2024 is in Maricopa County, Arizona, according to the analysis.\n\nAmazon's 177 data centers are on pace to command the highest electricity demand in Business Insider's analysis at between 30 and 48 terawatt-hours a year. Microsoft — with only around a quarter of Amazon's facilities — claims the next-highest spot.\n\nWhen reached in 2025, a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged that its data centers \"do not always run at 100% of their installed capacity.\" Amazon disputed Business Insider's methodology, and QTS declined to comment. Google and Meta did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nIf all of Microsoft's 44 permitted facilities come online, their electricity demand could reach between 16 and 25 terawatt-hours a year, according to Business Insider's estimate. The midpoint of that range is about as much electricity as 1.8 million US homes based on average annual use.\n\nIf every permitted facility in Business Insider's dataset comes online, their electricity demand could reach between 149.6 terawatt-hours and 239.3 terawatt-hours annually, Business Insider's investigation found.\n\nThe low end of Business Insider's estimate is roughly equivalent to the state of Ohio's electricity needs in 2023, and on the high end, is nearly as much power as the entire state of Florida used that same year. A 2024 federal report projects demand could reach levels at the higher end of Business Insider's estimates by 2026.\n\nThe location of data centers has sparked a surge in community outcry, with neighboring residents concerned about their impact on rising electricity prices. Data centers' extreme electricity demand frequently requires utilities to build out new grid infrastructure. Utilities often socialize the investment costs, shifting billions of dollars of costs to all ratepayers, including residential customers, a Business Insider investigation found.\n\n\"Utilities can fund discounts to Big Tech by socializing their costs through electricity prices charged to the public,\" a 2025 Harvard Law study of regulatory proceedings about utility rates for data centers found.\n\nTo ensure Microsoft's data centers do not increase residential electricity bills, Smith, Microsoft's president, wrote that the tech giant plans to ask utilities and regulators to set the company's rates high enough to cover its data centers' electricity costs.\n\nSmith pointed to Microsoft's recent support of new electricity rates that charge \"very large customers,\" such as data centers, for the costs incurred to provide them with electricity. Smith also said that when grid infrastructure improvements were necessary to serve its data centers, the company would pay for those improvements.\n\n\"We believe the long-term success of AI infrastructure requires that tech companies pay their own way for the electricity costs they create,\" Smith wrote.\n\nThe promise comes amid a broader affordability push from President Trump, including plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest rates.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Some people aspire to homeownership. Others would rather spend their hard-earned money on experiences and purchases that make them happy.\n\n\"Am I crazy for thinking the housing market is cooked and that I'd rather live a little before locking myself into a mortgage?\" one Reddit user wrote on a thread about choosing between buying a house and traveling. \"How bad is it, really, to delay buying property in my situation?\"\n\nA poster in another thread echoed their skepticism. \"I live in a rent-controlled apartment right now. I put $1400 per month into my cash savings fund. I take international trips multiple times a year, in addition to pursuing various fun hobbies and local excursions. I treat my grandparents. I treat my parents,\" they said. \"Is buying a home really worth the lifestyle cut? I can't fathom that it is.\"\n\nEven as price growth slows — and falls in some cities — buying a home still feels unaffordable for many people, in part because mortgage rates remain high and down payments are still steep. Redfin reported in October that the average down payment hit a record $70,000 in August.\n\nWhile some people are cutting back on discretionary spending to afford a home purchase, many have accepted that buying isn't realistic, at least for now, and are redirecting what would have gone into a house fund toward trips and other small luxuries that fit their budgets today.\n\nJustin Ghio, 36, and his wife rent a four-bedroom home with a pool in San Diego for $3,895 a month, where they have lived with their twin 9-year-old daughters for the past four years.\n\nGhio told Business Insider that renting is far more affordable than buying a home in their neighborhood. Redfin data shows that San Diego's median home sale price was $916,750 as of November.\n\nIn 2020, the couple searched for a home in the city and made offers on four different properties. But even with a combined income of about $225,000 — including his job as a talent director and his wife's work as an esthetician — they were outbid each time.\n\nGhio said they were initially disappointed to pause their homebuying plans, but he now feels relieved they didn't stretch their budget to compete.\n\n\"I didn't have to spend extra money on a down payment to keep my mortgage rate attainable,' Ghio said. \"Because of that, I was able to allocate my funds more freely to a wedding that checked all the boxes for what my wife was looking for.\"\n\nIf you're not saving up for homeownership, what are you spending your money on instead?

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOwning a home might be the American dream, but Kevin O'Leary thinks too many people are rushing into a nightmare.\n\nIn a Facebook post shared alongside his Fox Business interview in November, the \"Shark Tank\" investor gave blunt advice to young adults debating whether to rent or buy. When asked outright which path to take, O'Leary didn't hesitate: \"Rent.\"\n\nHis reasoning? \"Start by renting until you start a family and keep it small, 1,500 feet or less if you've got the average salary of $70,000 annually,\" he wrote. \"Once you decide to have a child, you gotta expand a little bit, get that second bedroom and also have an office in the house. Then you buy a home.\"\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nIn the accompanying video, he doubled down, warning buyers not to jump into homeownership unless they plan to stay put for at least five years. \"The issue around a home, if you're gonna buy and go through expenses of buying it, paying all the commissions and all the taxes and everything else, you gotta be there for five years,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThat five-year rule is a common benchmark among financial experts. Closing costs, property taxes, realtor commissions, and interest-heavy mortgage payments make it difficult to build any real equity in the first few years. If you sell too soon, you may walk away with little to nothing—sometimes even a loss.\n\nO'Leary hinted at another reason for the wait: stability. \"There's a good chance you'll be there for five years, assuming the marriage lasts,\" he added dryly, suggesting that homeownership should follow—not precede—big life decisions like starting a family.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nFor singles or couples still figuring it out, his advice is clear: rent something manageable, don't overextend, and keep your housing budget in line with your income. At a $70,000 salary, even modest homes can stretch affordability—especially with current mortgage rates hovering around 7%.\n\nInstead of viewing renting as \"throwing money away,\" O'Leary frames it as a strategic placeholder. It buys time, flexibility, and lets young adults figure out where they want to live long term, what kind of space they actually need, and whether buying makes sense in their city.",

    "description": "While major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citi, warned that a 10% credit card cap would reduce access to credit, some CEOs applaud the plan.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders have mixed reviews of President Donald Trump's new plan for credit cards.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said on Friday he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Congress, not the president, has the power to implement such a cap. Similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nMajor banks, including JPMorgan Chase, UBS, and Citi, warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; others in the financial sector applauded the plan.\n\nHere is how business leaders have responded so far\n\nKlarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski backs Trump's plan.\n\nSiemiatkowski told CNBC in an interview on Monday that traditional credit cards are built to encourage consumers to put most of their spending on credit, and then carry big balances at steep interest rates. That dynamic, he said, pushes people to borrow more than they should and results in higher losses, especially among lower-income borrowers.\n\n\"I think Trump is wise here and is proposing something that makes a lot of sense,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC on Monday.\n\n\"Capitalism is great, but anarchy is not,\" Siemiatkowski added regarding consumer protection.\n\nIn another interview with CNN, Siemiatkowski also said that credit card rewards like cash back and airline miles largely benefit wealthier consumers while lower-income cardholders shoulder more of the costs.\n\nJPMorgan's CFO said that Trump's plan could upend the company's business model.\n\n\"It's a very competitive business, but we wouldn't be in it if it weren't a good business for us,\" said Jeremy Barnum during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"And in a world where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge.\"\n\nJPMorgan said on its fourth-quarter earnings call that debit and credit card sales volume rose roughly 7% year over year and described the business as central to its retail-focused offerings.\n\nThe CEO of JPMorgan also weighed in on Trump's credit card proposal.\n\nJamie Dimon told investors on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that reducing card interest rates could adversely affect customers with lower credit scores by limiting access to credit.\n\n\"If it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic,\" Dimon said.\n\n\"This is a mistake, President,\" Bill Ackman, the billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, wrote on Friday on X in a now-deleted post.\n\n\"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid,\" Ackman added.\n\nAckman said in another post on Saturday that although Trump's goal is one that's \"worthy and important,\" the rate cap is not the way to achieve it.\n\n\"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nThe SoFi CEO believes that his business and consumers could stand to benefit from Trump's credit card rate cap.\n\n\"If this is enacted — and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is — we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending,\" Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X. \"Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap.\"\n\n\"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void — one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto added.\n\nNoto also said that personal loans could be an alternative to addressing debt, though that would make underwriting discipline and borrower education \"even more important.\"",

Since then, she's quadrupled her former corporate income and built a seven-figure net worth, thanks to diligent saving and prudent investing.\n\nHer income is split roughly evenly between two main revenue streams: About 50% comes from brand partnerships. The other half comes from digital products, including her expense tracker and financial independence calculator, which provide recurring monthly income. More recently, she's added affiliate income and YouTube AdSense, which made up about 10% of her income last year.\n\nHere's how Allocca says creators can make money online in 2026.\n\nAllocca focused on creating the kind of content that she personally would want as a woman navigating money in her 20s: easy-to-understand, actionable advice.\n\n\"It was so, so simple and straightforward,\" she said. \"And I do think that really resonated with people.\"\n\nHer advice to aspiring creators: make content that fills a gap you've personally experienced.\n\n\"The people who are most successful create content that fills a gap they've identified on their own,\" she said. \"They're forging their own style and niche instead of seeing what works for someone else and trying to recreate it.\"\n\nAllocca says she approaches content as if she's making it for herself. \"If I wanted to learn more about this topic, how would I want to consume it?\" she said. \"That's what I'm making — because if I want to consume it in this way, there's going to be, hopefully, thousands of other girls who want to consume the same thing.\"\n\nDigital products now account for a significant portion of Allocca's income. She said she's brought in over $1 million selling budgeting templates and other tools.\n\nShe attributes that success to authenticity: \"I don't sell products that I don't use.\"\n\nThat approach helps with trust and accountability.\n\n\"If I'm going to tell my audience to do something or look at something a different way or track their expenses, I'm also sharing myself doing it,\" she said. \"I'm not selling something I don't actually do.\"\n\nAnother key to Allocca's success is paying attention to trends and adapting accordingly.\n\n\"There's this idea that the life cycle of a creator is two or three years before you taper off,\" said Allocca, who's noticed a pattern of creators growing quickly, then losing momentum as they shift focus to side projects and stop prioritizing content. \"I've made a really concerted effort to keep my content front and center and the main focus of my business, so that I don't taper off, and part of that is changing how I say things and adapting to what's trending, and what people care about.\"\n\nFor example, during the pandemic, she focused on recession fears. When the job market boomed, she pivoted to career content. As inflation rose and layoffs followed, she leaned into budgeting and cutting expenses.\n\n\"Over the last year or so, we've seen a huge shift to anti-consumerism and spending less, so I've focused my content a lot around shopping, buying better, and how to spend less and live on less,\" she said. \"Keeping a pulse on those trends has helped a lot with diversifying my brand, but also remaining relevant.\"",

    "fullText": "When companies file for bankruptcy, often it isn't because they're not cash flow positive.\n\nBankruptcies can happen simply because a company can't generate the cash needed to service its debt. In many cases, if you took that debt away, the business itself would actually be successful.\n\nThat's the argument FAT Brands CEO Andy Wiederhorn made on Jan. 12 at the ICR conference in Orlando.\n\n“We've been talking about restructuring this debt for 18 months to two years with our note holders,” Wiederhorn said, according to Nation's Restaurant News. “It has not been a very constructive negotiation…We’re looking at avenues to lower the debt and make it practical. I wish I could say that this would go quickly and get resolved, but it may take a couple of rounds.”\n\nThe company warned late last year that it might have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after a key lender called its note. Wiederhorn's comments made it clear that the situation is more complicated than it appears on the surface.\n\nFAT Brands owns a number of big-name restaurant brands, including Johnny Rockets, Ponderosa Steakhouse, Great American Cookie, and the Twin Peaks restaurant concept, which is owned by a subsidiary.\n\nThe company shared the details of its latest financial problem in a 10-K filing with the SEC.\n\n“On November 25, 2025, FAT Brands Inc. received a notice of acceleration (the “Acceleration Notice”) from UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee under the Base Indenture, dated July 10, 2023 by and between the company’s subsidiary, FB Resid Holdings I, LLC FB Resid and UMB, relating to fixed rate secured notes issued by FB Resid. The Acceleration Notice stated that UMB, pursuant to Section 9.2 of the FB Resid Indenture, acting at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative under the FB Resid Indenture, accelerates and declares the outstanding principal amount of the FB Resid Notes to be immediately due and payable,” the company wrote.\n\nIn practical terms, the filing said that UMB delivered to Fat Brands a “Notice of Event of Default” with respect to the FB Resid Indenture, stating that an “Event of Default had occurred pursuant to Section 9.2 of the FB Resid Indenture. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the FB Resid Notes is $158.9 million, or $110.0 million net of FB Resid Note,” it shared.\n\nSimilar notices were sent to four other subsidiaries of FAT Brands.\n\nFAT Brands has a complicated financial structure.\n\n\"While a trustee has declared FAT Brands’ $1.26 billion in debt immediately due, Wiederhorn stated on Tuesday that the debt is not guaranteed by the parent company as a whole. Instead, the total liability is spread across five securitization trusts, involves multiple layers of investors, and is tied to individual brands,\" NRN reported.",

    "title": "A top economist thinks Trump's big affordability push will do more harm than good",
    "description": "Mark Zandi told Business Insider that the idea to cap credit card interest would hurt borrowers, while Trump's mortgage plan could raise home prices.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has floated some big ideas to make life more affordable for everyday Americans in the last week, but one veteran economist has his doubts that they'll make much of a difference.\n\nIn fact, he sees the plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest as potentially doing more harm than good.\n\nTrump revealed plans to bring down mortgage rates and make credit card debt cheaper. For mortgages, he said he had directed \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion of mortgage bonds, while his plan for credit cards entails capping interest at 10% for a year.\n\nThe president framed both plans as being in the interest of US consumers, but Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi thinks that both moves could end up having the opposite effect.\n\nZandi spent much of 2025 sounding the alarm over Trump's policies, which he said could push the US toward a recession, and he's remained pessimistic so far in 2026.\n\nZandi posted on X that the news of Trump's housing market plan has already pushed fixed mortgages down by 10 to 20 basis points. While that sounds like good news for borrowers and is likely exactly what Trump wants to see, the sudden dip in rates could ultimately drive home prices up.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this will do little to make homebuying more affordable, as while the lower rates will support housing demand, given the severe housing shortage, it will also result in higher house prices, all else equal,\" he said.\n\nZandi also warned that Trump's intention to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pile up mortgage bonds could pose further complications. He said it would effectively weaken a safeguard imposed on the two mortgage giants following the 2008 housing market crash that was meant to keep them from posing a systemic risk to the economy.\n\nZandi also said he had issues with Trump's credit card idea.\n\nHe told Business Insider that while he sees little chance that Trump's plan for a cap on credit card interest rates would clear legal hurdles, the move would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.\n\n\"Only consumers with high credit scores would avoid having their credit lines reduced or eliminated altogether,\" he said. \"That's because banks and other credit card lenders simply won't be able to profitably extend credit cards at a 10% rate to many Americans.\"\n\nZandi predicted that higher-income households would benefit from lower rates middle and lower income people would be shut out.\n\nAnalysts at UBS echoed Zandi's perspective on credit card rate caps, arguing that caps on credit card interest could harm not just lower-income consumers but the broader economy, as it would mean less spending. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman responded with a similar argument, stating that he thinks such a move would be a mistake.",

    "description": "Jimmy Donaldson, the world’s most popular YouTuber and founder of $5 billion business Beast Industries, claims he doesn’t “technically” have enough money to buy McDonald’s in the morning.",
    "fullText": "Some successful entrepreneurs sitting atop billion-dollar businesses say they may look rich on paper, but take a peek into their bank accounts, and they’re actually cash poor. Social media mogul Jimmy Donaldson, known to his 460 million YouTube followers as MrBeast, claims he’s just as broke as everyone else despite running a $5 billion entertainment empire.\n\n“I’m borrowing money. That’s how little money I have,” Donaldson told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning.”\n\nThe 27-year-old entrepreneur has said that he keeps less than $1 million for himself, despite being a billionaire and owning more than half of his $5 billion company Beast Industries. Aside from his nine-figure Amazon deal and popular YouTube channel with 107 billion lifetime views, Donaldson hit the ultra-rich club—at least on paper—from a slew of successful businesses. He’s launched ventures including multimillion-dollar chocolate brand Feastables; Lunchly, a Lunchables-esque packaged food product; MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant that only allows for pickup and drop-off; and production company MrBeast LLC, which helps manufacture his viral videos.\n\nThrough his assets, Donaldson is projected to be worth at least $2.6 billion—although he emphasized it’s not a fat wad of cash burning a hole in his pocket. Forbes has also estimated that his annual earnings reached $85 million between April 2024 and April 2025, a far cry from the typical American salary of $62,088 a year. However, that doesn’t mean he’s splurging on luxuries and only flying private. Donaldson claimed he’s actually in the red.\n\n“It’s funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,” Donaldson explained. “They’re like, ‘You’re a billionaire!’ I’m like, ‘That’s net worth.’ I have negative money right now.”\n\n“I wake up, I just work…I’m just so busy working I don’t really think about my personal bank account,” Donaldson continued. “I’m just laser-focused on making the greatest videos as possible, and building the business as big as possible.”\n\nDonaldson rakes in eight-figure earnings and runs a $5 billion business, yet still claims to be broke. So where is all of his money going? Right back into his business ventures, the YouTube star says.\n\n“I personally have very little money because I reinvest everything (I think this year we’ll spend around a quarter of a billion on content). Ironically I’m actually borrowing $ from my mom to pay for my upcoming wedding,” Donaldson wrote on X in response to a post heralding him as the only billionaire under 30 who didn’t inherit their wealth.",

    "description": "America's biggest bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer outlined the impact of a rate cut on its credit card business on Tuesday, warning that such a move could have detrimental effects on the bank's lending business.\n\n\"It's a very competitive business, but we wouldn't be in it if it weren't a good business for us. And in a world where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge,\" Jeremy Barnum, the CFO, told analysts and shareholders during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\n\"Clearly beyond that, you know, the way we actually respond would have a lot to do with the details. And I just don't think we have enough information at this point,\" Barnum added, saying a dramatic shift in lenders' card interest rates could lead to negative consequences for consumers — \"especially the people who need it the most.\"\n\nOn Friday, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post that he would call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year, starting on January 20. Lawmakers from both parties have criticized card interest rates, which have sat around 20% in recent years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nCongress would typically need to approve such a cap, which would eat into banks' profits.\n\nJamie Dimon, the firm's CEO, who was also on the call, said reducing card interest rates could adversely affect customers with lower credit scores by limiting access to credit. \"If it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic,\" Dimon added.\n\nThe bank's cards business is central to its retail-focused offerings. Debit and credit card sales volume rose 7% from a year earlier, with card services sales totaling about $360 billion for the quarter, according to its earnings presentation.\n\nRevenue in the consumer and community banking division climbed 6% year over year to $19.4 billion, which JPMorgan said was driven in part by higher net interest income from card services as revolving balances grew.\n\nNow, JPMorgan is in the process of taking over the Apple card from Goldman Sachs, which previously supported the tech giant's credit card offering. The transition, JPMorgan has said, is expected to take up to two years to complete.\n\nRepresentatives for Chase previously directed Business Insider to a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America, which said they support Trump's goal of helping Americans access affordable credit, but warned of reduced credit availability.\n\n\"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the bank said.\n\nThe idea ignited a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including JPMorgan. Trump's move continued a series of swipes against big businesses, including banks.",

    "fullText": "The stink of the way the Green Bay Packers ended the 2025 season is still in the air, but eventually, we're all going to have to move on.\n\nThe way the Packers lost to the Bears in the Wild Card round, blowing a 21-3 halftime lead, will go down in history as one of the worst playoff losses not just in Packers' history, but in the history of the NFL. For the Packers, it's absolutely right up there with the 2014 NFC Championship game.\n\nTime heals all wounds, though, and sooner or later fans are going to start getting excited for the 2026 season.\n\nFor the players on the team, that time has already come. They don't have the luxury of wallowing in pity because their preparations this offseason will play a big role in what they're able to accomplish in 2026.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are a lot of question marks for this team heading into 2026. There are players that will be lost in free agency, there's not a first round pick to work with in the NFL Draft, and heck, head coach Matt LaFleur may not even be the coach next year. It's trending that way, but anything can happen.\n\nDespite the recent heartbreak and despite the uncertainties, it's worth noting that several Packers seemed optimistic about how things will look in 2026. Many of them had a chance to speak at locker cleanout on Monday, and the vibe can best be described as \"unfinished business\".\n\n“Yeah, he told me that,” star defensive end Micah Parsons said when it was brought up that defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley believes he'll break the NFL's sack record next season, per Matt Schneidman of The Athletic. “He’s putting a lot of pressure on me. I’m not scared of those challenges, either. They know I’m coming. I had a little fun with Myles (Garrett). He talked about (how) he’s going to put the trophy, the Defensive Player of the Year trophy, in the training room so we can look at it (Parsons and Garrett train together in the offseason). I said, ‘You know what, don’t worry. The light’s bright, but the sun always sets, too, so we’re coming.’ It’s always great that you’ve got a coach like that. Me and Haf has a great relationship … he’s another guy I can’t wait to have another year with.”\n\nNotably, Parsons is speaking like Hafley will be back in 2026, but head coach Matt LaFleur seemed to believe that the defensive coordinator will be a head coach somewhere next season.\n\n\"I fully anticipate Hafley's going to do a great job on the interview and I fully anticipate him getting one of these,\" LaFleur said Sunday, according to PackersWire.\n\n“Nah, Haf ain’t going nowhere,\" Parsons said on Monday.\n\nThe Packers, unfortunately, lost star tight end Tucker Kraft in early November to a torn ACL. To that point, he was having an elite season and was clearly becoming one of the rising superstars in the NFL.\n\nIn just eight games, Kraft caught 32 passes for 489 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nHe was on-pace for an All-Pro season, and it's worth noting that he does feel good about where he'll be recovery-wise at the start of 2026.\n\n“My timeline, I’m not in a race or anything like that. It happened. By the time Week 1 rolls around, I’ll be 10 months post-surgery and hopefully bulletproofed by then,” Kraft said. “I already feel pretty good. My progress so far has been great. Some would say even ahead of schedule. So, not trying to blow anything out of proportion. I’m not even 10 weeks in yet, but it’s feeling good so far. Everything’s going great. I’m in good hands here.”\n\nIf Kraft comes back healthy in 2026, there's reason to believe he can be an All-Pro.",

    "description": "The refrain on Brian Rolapp from NFL insiders was: smart, good business sense, not a golf guy.",
    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A guess is that Brian Rolapp, the newish PGA Tour CEO, will be at the SoFi Center up the road from here Tuesday night, when Tiger Woods's TGL team takes on Steve Cohen's other New York team in the second week of the second season of the made-for-TV golf league. He was on hand last week, for the season opener. Does it matter that this is indoor, nighttime golf, a game that has been played outdoors by day for centuries? It does not. Rolapp has his eye on the real prize: In the first week, about 700,000 live viewers watched on ESPN and its broadcast cousins. Decent. Maybe the second week will be better.\n\nCome Wednesday night, Rolapp will likely be at The Breakers, the gilded five-star hotel across the intracoastal waterway from here, for a Tiger Woods birthday bash for 300. If he knows anything about Woods, he knows this kind of event is torture for him, but Woods will be there, a smile on his face, raising money for his philanthropy, the TGR Foundation. If it's important to Woods, it's important to Rolapp. Woods is a member of the PGA Tour policy board, the Tour's Enterprise Board (the for-profit arm) and the chairman of the Tour's Future Competition Committee. In addressing these matters and more - the Genesis Invitational, the Hero World Challenge - Rolapp and Woods will be the greatest Zoom buddies. Does it matter if he could not tell Chris Como from Matt Killen, to cite two of Woods's instructors from recent years? It does not.\n\nA longish preamble to a tea-leaf read of what's going on here, in this whole path-back-to-the-Tour thing, with Brian Rolapp's name and likeness all over it. When Rolapp was named the PGA Tour's new CEO, shortly after last year's U.S. Open, the refrain among people who knew him from the NFL was this: Smart, good business sense, not a golf guy. Turns out that last part, originally meant as a dis, is actually an asset (depending on your view of Monday's news). Brian Rolapp's most significant task is to get people to watch PGA Tour events, in person and, much more significantly, on any screen of their choosing. If getting Brooks Koepka back in the fold is going to help Rolapp in this cause, then he's going to do anything he can to get him back in the fold. There's no reason for him to worry about how Koepka took the LIV Golf money when he could, how he hurt the PGA Tour by leaving, how annoyed rank-and-file players will be by this easy path back. He wants the eyeballs that Koepka will bring. Full stop.\n\nIn his effort to bring back Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm (both U.S. Open winners) and Cameron Smith (winner of both the '22 Players Championship and Open Championship), the same logic will apply.\n\nWhatever happened, happened. We want 'em back.\n\nMonday's news is the opening salvo. Rolapp said in August that his goal is not \"incremental change. It's significant change.\" This is, really, the antithesis of how Augusta National and the Masters works, where the leaders there despise the word change and take all their direction from the word improvement. Golf doesn't have a tradition of \"significant change.\" Rolapp might not know and surely does not care.\n\nWhen the LIV-Tour war first heated up in the summer of ‘22, Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said, \"I am not naive; if this is an arms race and if the only weapons here are dollar bills, the PGA Tour can’t compete.\" That sounded deeply true at the time. Rolapp is here to tell you: Dollar bills are not the only weapons in the LIV-PGA Tour battle. The PGA Tour offers something LIV Golf does not and that is the freedom to make your own schedule. The door to Koepka's return began with that.\n\nAs Rolapp tries to find a path back to the PGA Tour for Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith, the same logic will apply. DeChambeau has flourished under LIV and has some bad PGA Tour memories. With Smith, it's hard to know what he cares about. Rahm could be open to the play-where-you-want argument. But he'd have to leave a mountain pile of Saudi money to do it.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the Saudis just walking away from LIV Golf. Walking away is not in their cultural business makeup. They're too rich and too smart and too ambitious. But Rolapp is going to do everything he can here to weaken LIV Golf. Working with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and a few other key figures, he will surely pave some kind of narrow path back to the PGA Tour for Talor Gooch, Tyrrell Hatton and Joaquin Niemann and a very few other LIV players who have won on the PGA Tour.\n\nAs for Sergio Garcia, Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed, all winners of major events, I'm guessing Rolapp has less interest in them or he would have expanded the terms in Monday's news. Mickelson is 55 and he has expressed such disdain for the PGA Tour it's hard to imagine him coming back. Woods has never been fond of Sergio Garcia so it's not likely he pushed Rolapp to make it easy for him to return. Patrick Reed's rules debacles made him a PGA Tour outsider. As for Dustin Johnson, whoever knows with him? He can play in the Masters forever. His father-in-law is Wayne Gretzky. He has all the jet skis he needs.\n\nRolapp cannot kill LIV Golf, as the NFL helped kill off the USFL in 1986. But he can weaken it. He can diminish its star power and the appeal of the international series for emerging golf talent. If he can weaken it enough, then LIV Golf and the PGA Tour might be able to some kind of meeting of the minds, where the two leagues co-exist.\n\nIn the meantime, the CEO of the PGA Tour is screaming his unspoken message: I don't care about what happened. I want to fix what's broken now.\n\nMichael Bamberger welcomes your comments at Michael.Bamberger@Golf.com\n\nThe post What Brooks Koepka coup reveals about PGA Tour’s new leader appeared first on Golf.",

    "description": "Oscar Rachmansky, 24, was selling sneakers as a side hustle when he spotted a business opportunity that would become a multimillion-dollar company.",
    "fullText": "Whenever an idea pops into Oscar Rachmansky's head, he whips out a notebook or whatever scrap of paper is closest and writes it down. It's a habit you might expect from a Gen Xer or elder millennial clinging to analog comfort. Rachmansky is neither.\n\nHe's 24, and the company he founded about five years ago generated $40 million in sales revenue in 2025 (confirmed from documents reviewed by Business Insider).\n\nGoing against the grain is kind of Rachmansky's thing.\n\nWhen he was 4, he opened a sunflower seed stand while the other kids sold lemonade. As a teenager, he dropped out of college to pursue a business opportunity that he's since developed into a multimillion-dollar company.\n\nRachmansky launched OS Group in 2019, before he'd turned 20. The company is a B2B wholesaler of branded footwear and streetwear that he bootstrapped from the ground up, he said.\n\nWhat started with sneaker sales out of his bedroom has turned into a team of 30 employees distributing about 25,000 items a month from a large New Jersey warehouse. Rachmansky says he always thought he'd run his own business someday. He just didn't expect it to involve so many sneakers.\n\nGrowing up, Rachmansky was a sports kid who imagined himself running a sports agency one day. \"I certainly wasn't at all interested in fashion, sneakers, or anything of the sort,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nStill, he began buying and selling sneakers in high school as a side hustle. As he learned the resale market, one thing stood out. \"No one was paying attention to the B2B side of this industry,\" he said. \"And that's what powers the entire market.\"\n\nHe launched his B2B company shortly after enrolling at McGill University. His first resale client quickly revealed how fragmented the supply chain was, with retailers jumping through hoops just to source inventory, he said. The inefficiency was obvious. So was the scale.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit. The resale market froze. Rachmansky said he wasn't making any money and briefly considered walking away. \"I was like, well, maybe it wasn't meant to be, maybe I should just keep studying and figure out what happens.\"\n\nCollege, however, never felt like the long-term plan. Within his first month at McGill, he said he opened his notebook and wrote a prediction: \"This is going to be my first and last year of college.\"\n\nRachmansky dropped out of McGill and reinvested the roughly $30,000 he'd earned from his sneaker side hustle into expanding OscarSoles — now OS Group. \"I knew that the industry was growing, and I just wanted to go all in,\" he said.\n\nAt first, the company operated with more hustle than infrastructure.\n\n\"The first warehouse that we had, we didn't even have offices,\" said Isaac Murov, one of OS Group's original employees, who joined the company in 2021. \"We actually made cubicles out of Nike Air Force boxes, so we could have a little bit of privacy,\" he added.\n\nMurov met Rachmansky through a mutual friend, and the two hit it off quickly. \"He was always a very bright individual, and I think I gravitated toward him for that exact reason,\" Murov said.\n\nEven as the resale market cooled after the pandemic, OS Group continued to grow. Rachmansky credits his team above all else. \"We've been really, really intentional with our hiring,\" he said, focusing on people with good attitudes who are coachable and fast.\n\nThat growth came with its own learning curve, though. For the first several years, Rachmansky said, he worked 15-hour days. \"I've always kind of associated output with input — more hours equals better output,\" he said. Eventually, however, he learned that working harder wasn't always the same as working smarter. An early focus on hiring people who added value and growth to the team helped him see that.\n\nThe company's hustle culture was also shaped early on by Rachmansky's willingness to do whatever the job required. \"He always led by example,\" Murov said. \"Whether that was packing boxes in the back, he was never really above that.\"\n\nToday, Rachmansky wants to take OS Group beyond footwear and past pure transaction volume. His goal is to turn the company into a long-term operating partner, offering services like financing, logistics, and software using the infrastructure OS Group has already built internally. \"We really see ourselves as growing into a real operating partner for this industry,\" he said, with the ambition of building \"the entire B2B ecosystem.\"\n\nRachmansky no longer works 15-hour days and says he has a better work-life balance. \"A fear that motivates me is not being able to do everything that I want to do with my life,\" Rachmansky said, adding that he hopes to travel",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Monday that he'll impose a tariff of 25% on any country that does business with Iran.\n\n\"Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nIt's unclear how the tariff will be implemented or which countries could be affected. The White House did not provide additional information when reached by Business Insider.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China and the United Arab Emirates are Iran's major trading partners.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to reach a trade deal with China after both countries backed down from a tariff war in 2025. According to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the trade volume between China and Iran reached $13.37 billion in 2024, with China exporting $8.93 billion worth of goods to Iran and importing around $4.44 billion from the country. More recent data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity shows that China exported $456 million and imported $208 million from Iran in October 2025.\n\nTrump's targeting of Iran comes as the country is experiencing mass protests against its government. Iran's crackdown on protesters has left hundreds dead and thousands arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.\n\nTrump has expressed support for the protesters and threatened the possibility of US involvement.\n\n\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. \"The USA stands ready to help!!!\"\n\nTrump's announcement also comes as the Supreme Court is expected to rule this week on the legality of the tariffs his administration has imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1970s-era law typically used by the President to impose sanctions.\n\nScott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury, said in a petition to SCOTUS that the federal government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion in tariffs to American businesses should the duties be ruled unconstitutional.\n\nTrump also wrote in a post on Truth Social on Monday morning that \"if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED.\"",

    "description": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions about consumer behavior, efficiency, and labor this year, analysts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The restaurant industry is grappling with big questions this year.\n\nDiners these days are more value-conscious, more selective, and more willing to stay home; and costs, along with competition, continue to rise for operators.\n\nAs big chains and local independents try to protect sales or regain their footing, analysts who spoke to Business Insider said the year ahead will come down to whether restaurants can do more with less, without losing what made people want to dine out in the first place.\n\nThese are the biggest questions shaping the restaurant industry's next chapter.\n\n\"Consumers are looking for value, but they're also cutting back on frequency — restaurants across the spectrum have to improve quality and the dining experience while controlling costs to maintain all-important same-store sales metrics,\" Asit Sharma, analyst for The Motley Fool, said. \"That's a difficult challenge against a backdrop of food and wage inflation.\"\n\nOperators are trying to understand their customers' restaurant and dining behaviors better in order to determine what they value most, and adjust their strategy accordingly, Michael Della Penna, the chief strategy officer at the digital advertising research firm InMarket, said.\n\n\"Restaurants think their biggest competition is the restaurant down the street,\" Della Penna said. \"In reality, competition today is far broader and more fragmented. Consumers aren't just choosing between restaurants anymore — they're deciding whether to eat out at all.\"\n\nMany brands are using limited-time offers or collectible promotions to drive repeat visits, app downloads, and loyalty program sign-ups, in attempts to connect more deeply with their customers, Evert Gruyaert, the restaurants and food service leader at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nStarbucks' viral collectible Bearista cup and Chipotle's protein snack cup launch are prime examples.\n\nHowever, Gruyaert said, the question is bigger than a simple limited-time offer. Restaurant operators are trying to identify why their brand resonates with consumers, which means aligning with a broader mission.\n\n\"Something that remains always relevant is: how do we do the right thing around, for instance, sustainability? How do we source more of our ingredients locally?\" he said. \"Because that has a cost efficiency, but it also plays into some expectations from our consumers.\"\n\n\"Restaurants are very hesitant to increase menu prices much more than they feel is reasonable,\" Moutray said. \"However, they still have to make the math work, right?\"\n\nSo, whether restaurants are adopting more technology — be it AI or other automation — or seeking alternative solutions to reduce costs, Moutray said efficiency is an \"ongoing battle\" for the industry.\n\nAI has become a buzzword in the restaurant space, but it remains an integral part of the conversation, Moutray said.\n\n\"You're seeing a lot of new technologies that are helping to speed up service, and make life a little bit more efficient, and hopefully improve the bottom line well,\" Moutray said.\n\nVoice AI integration is being continuously implemented at drive-thrus, and back-end systems are being overhauled for inventory and staffing purposes. New consumer-facing tech stacks are being rolled out, but it's not yet clear what the gold standards across the industry will be.\n\n\"Five years from today, whether it's a Michelin-starred restaurant with a single location, or a burgeoning brand capitalizing on the latest food trend, the average restaurant will be much more analytics-driven versus today,\" Sharma said.\n\n\"Labor, labor, labor,\" is top of mind for restaurants because of the industry's high turnover, Gruyaert said.\n\nExpectations from talent are also changing, Gruyaert said. The minimum wage continues to increase, and workers are seeking more flexibility in their jobs, which creates more competition among restaurants.\n\n\"So, the question is: how do you keep funneling that pipeline of talent and keep people close to you as a brand?\" Gruyaert said.\n\nMoutray said the industry will likely continue to see more consolidation this year as companies look to cut costs.\n\nSharma said smaller steakhouse chains with high fixed costs and operational inefficiencies are most at risk for closures and consolidations due to relentless beef inflation, coupled with their lack of purchasing power with suppliers, which he said \"creates a profit real headwind, and these models will get sorely tested in 2026.\"\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. Some brands, such as Jollibee, are looking to go public — and more may be on the horizon.\n\n\"You still have a lot of focus on closures, but the reality is that we still have a lot of folks who are opening, as well,\" Moutray said.\n\nWith high labor, food, and packaging costs, many restaurant brands are closely monitoring their bottom lines while investing in upgrades.\n\n\"Slimmer profit margins are translating into lower free cash flow, but whether it's upgraded point of sales systems with rich data analytics for independent restaurants, or kitchen automation for chains, it's clear that technology investments will be critical for improving restaurant-level and overhead margins in the coming years,\" Sharma said.\n\nSharma said fast casual chains that can monitor inventory levels at restaurants in real time, and react quickly and efficiently through centralized ingredient kitchens, like Cava, have \"a real edge in this cost environment.\"\n\nSimilarly, quick-service restaurants with consistent, simple menus like Chick-fil-A, along with comfort food concepts that have low overhead and tech stacks purpose-built to accommodate digital orders, like Wingstop, are likely to see financial gains this year, Sharma said.\n\nUltimately, the questions facing the industry boil down to one key issue: growth.\n\nEach of the analysts who spoke to Business Insider said that's the core issue facing restaurants this year, as consumer tastes change, food and labor prices increase, and technology continues to advance.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing it's all about is how do you drive growth in this environment?\" Gruyaert said. \"That's the big question.\"",

    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said late Sunday that the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice. He described the move as a part of a broader effort to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nProminent economists and business leaders are reacting as the news hit markets at the start of the trading week. They weighed in on how the DOJ move affects the Fed's independence, a question also raised by Sen. Thom Tillis. On Sunday, the Republican said he would oppose nominees for the Fed.\n\n\"If there were any remaining doubt about whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\n\nHere's what leaders in economics and business are saying:\n\nProminent economist Mohamed El-Erian called for Powell's resignation months ago to protect the Fed's independence amid the feud with Trump.\n\nOn Sunday, El-Erian wrote on X that the inquiry into Powell is damaging for the US central bank.\n\n\"For those of us who value the operational autonomy of central banks, the risk is that this situation could expose deeper issues — further undermining the credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile,\" wrote El-Erian, who is a former co-chief investment officer at Pimco.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raised concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"Question to all those who said Trump would be better for the economy: is attacking the Fed's independence what you had in mind?\" wrote the prominent Democratic donor on X.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, attributed the gold price surge to fresh record highs on Sunday evening to the investigation into Powell.\n\n\"I am not a fan of Powell, but I agree with him on Trump's motivation,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\nIn April, Schiff said Trump's next Fed Chair pick would be a \"loyal soldier.\"\n\nMichael A. Gayed, a renowned investment manager, said direct action against a sitting Fed Chair is \"without modern precedent,\" in an edition of his Lead-Lag substack report published on Sunday evening.\n\nThe inquiry into Powell raises questions about whether the long-standing boundaries between fiscal power, prosecutorial authority, and monetary independence are beginning to blur, Gayed said. The concern was less about any single case and more about the future precedent it may establish.\n\n\"Should investors conclude that future Fed officials could face legal consequences for policy decisions that conflict with political priorities, the incentive structure governing monetary policy could change,\" said Gayed.\n\nThat shift could increase inflation risk premiums and weaken confidence in long-duration financial assets tied to stable policy expectations, he added.",

    "description": "Michael Burry, the investor from \"The Big Short,\" said return on invested capital is the \"measure to beat all measures\" when looking at AI companies.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

    "title": "We asked over 150 software engineers about vibe-coding. Here's what they said.",
    "description": "167 software engineers responded to Business Insider's vibe-coding survey. Over 45% reported \"keeping up\" with AI tools. Almost 17% feel behind.",
    "fullText": "AI has radically changed what coding looks like. We asked software engineers how they felt about it.\n\nAndrej Karpathy coined the term \"vibe-coding,\" or the creation of code using AI. The term has since gained traction among developers worldwide and was named Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025.\n\nLess than a year after his post, Karpathy wrote that he had \"never felt this much behind as a programmer.\"\n\nWe asked developers: When it comes to vibe-coding, do you feel ahead, behind, or like you're keeping pace?\n\n167 software engineers responded to our survey. The biggest cohort — 75 engineers, or 46.9% — said that they were \"keeping up.\" 30 engineers said they felt ahead of the curve, while 27 felt behind.\n\n28 engineers (or 17.5% of respondents) said that they were opting out of using AI code editing tools entirely. These engineers wrote that the tools weren't advanced enough, or that they took too long to learn how to use. None of the 28 agreed to speak on the record after Business Insider reached out.\n\nWhile the survey isn't scientific, the results offer insight into how software engineers are feeling about their rapidly changing industry.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight engineers told Business Insider how they feel about AI code editors. All found them helpful in some form, though their usages ranged from one-off tools to lifesavers.\n\nRyan Shah sometimes wonders: \"Did I really need to learn how to write code?\"\n\nThe 23-year-old AI consultant from Atlanta recently graduated with a degree in computer information technology. Now he uses Cursor and Google's Antigravity, paired with Claude Opus 4.5, which he said was at \"midlevel engineer status.\"\n\nShah said he doesn't regret his software engineering courses, though. They taught him to \"read\" code, he said, a skill that, coupled with his vibe-coding proficiencies, keeps him from being \"the first one laid off.\"\n\nJavanie Campbell swung the other way: He warned that over-reliance on vibe-coding tools will put your career in danger.\n\n\"For people who turn to the LLM as the God or the expert, they will be replaced,\" said the 35-year-old CEO of DevDaysAtWork, who is based in Jamaica.\n\nAmong software engineers, there's a debate brewing: Just how bad will the effects of AI code editors be on jobs? Some say they will shrink the industry's workforce; others call them tools, not replacements for engineers.\n\nThe first time Ryan Clinton tried vibe-coding, he got scared for his job. He's not fearful anymore, he said.\n\nClinton's engineering level won't be affected, said the 46-year-old software developer from Nashville. More experienced engineers work on \"architecture and design,\" he said, while more junior staffers code. At this point of AI coding, human intervention is also still routinely necessary.\n\n\"You want to make sure it makes sense,\" he said. \"Only an idiot would randomly click 'yes' and commit it.\"\n\nBarry Fruitman is more worried — but not for himself. At 56, the Android developer from Toronto doesn't think the job market will feel the effect until five to 10 years out.\n\n\"Today, I think the threat is overstated, and hopefully it will stay that way until I retire,\" he said.\n\nEd Gaile said AI tools have doubled, if not tripled, his productivity.\n\nThe 55-year-old Appfire principal solutions architect from Atlanta was impressed by the decrease in context switching that vibe-coding tools brought.\n\n\"I wish I had this 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\nFor AI code editors, the word \"productivity\" still looms large. Many people feel that they're saving time by using these tools. Others cite the additional time spent reviewing and correcting lines of code.\n\nA July METR study added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe study asked experienced developers to complete a series of tasks. Study participants working without AI's help spent 10% more time coding — but those with AI assistance spent 20% more time reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI, waiting on AI, or being idle. Ultimately, the study found that the AI-assisted developers were less productive.\n\nShawn Gay, a 54-year-old R&D manager from El Paso, Texas, spends time keeping up with the industry's changes. He said he felt behind the curve.\n\n\"I have decades of experience, so I feel like it's a huge effort to try to change the way my brain thinks about software,\" Gay told Business Insider.\n\nGus De Souza said that he saved time on coding, but spent more time reviewing the AI-generated code. The real productivity gains were in troubleshooting, said the 48-year-old software architect from Kitchener, Ontario.\n\nWhat even is a vibe-coder? While the term has grown to encompass most forms of AI-assisted coding, Karpathy's X post first defined it as when developers \"fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.\"\n\nLara Fraser, a data analyst and epidemiologist from Sarasota, Florida, doesn't consider herself a vibe-coder.\n\nFraser codes in R and uses tools like ChatGPT and Claude to assist. She's tried other tools, but found high rates of hallucination. The model generation also matters, Fraser said: GPT 5.1 was great, but 5.2 was a \"disaster.\"\n\nFor Fraser, vibe-coding depends on the programmer's skill. Anyone can create an app, but not everyone can maintain it.\n\n\"Inevitably, something's going to break,\" she said. \"Can you fix it? If you can't, you're a vibe-coder.\"",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sgt. Dimko Zhluktenko, an ISR drone team leader in Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces. He deployed in 2025 near Pokrovsk, a key city that Russia said it captured in early December.\n\nBusiness Insider has verified his role in the Ukrainian armed forces. The article has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore the full-scale war, I was a software engineer, working for companies in San Francisco, New Zealand, and Germany.\n\nToday, I lead a team of five to six Ukrainian drone operators. Our task is to use high-flying drones to provide reconnaissance data to our troops and commanders.\n\nWith our intelligence, artillery such as HIMARS and drone strike teams can target Russian equipment and soldiers, often before they can even reach the front lines.\n\nWe were redeployed to the Pokrovsk area in August because the fighting there had become so intense. Because drone operators are priority targets in the war, we would spend our dayslong rotations in houses and underground bunkers outside the city.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the weather was sunny and ideal for flying.\n\nBut the end of October was a disaster for us. Ukraine turns foggy in the autumn, with thick and low clouds that can stack from 100 meters to 300 meters above the ground.\n\nThese are so thick that no infrared camera or thermal camera can see through them, and caused many days to be completely no-go for flying for our types of drones.\n\nAt the time, the Russians took advantage of the clouds, using them to cover their advance on foot and in vehicles. Given the weather, the number of personnel they sacrificed to take the city, and our limited resources, there was eventually no viable way for us to defend Pokrovsk forever.\n\nUkraine is dependent on drone warfare. It has carried us through the terrible and scary times of these Russian assaults, and it has changed the face of war. For the entire summer of 2025, for example, I saw a tank only twice on the battlefield.\n\nDrones are cheap and effective, and if we had an infinite number of drones, we would have been working 24/7 to fight the Russians in Pokrovsk.\n\nBut we don't have infinite drones, so in the meantime, we need other strike tools and resources, such as more artillery fire and troops. War is complex, and drones cannot be its only solution.\n\nIn normal conditions, we fly our drones four times a day, with each flight lasting about three to four hours and sometimes into the night. It's tiring, but worth it, because you can make an enormous difference for Ukrainian defenders. We can spot where Russian forces are moving, denying them the element of surprise, and scout for assets such as air defenses and artillery for commanders to strike.\n\nRecon drone operators like us rely heavily on visual navigation. We study Pokrovsk so closely that, even when our drone is being spoofed, we can determine our flying location simply by the shape of the terrain or landmarks.\n\nWhen the foggy season comes, we try to make the most of any good visibility. Sometimes, you can get lucky and perform five flights in a five-day rotation.\n\nHowever, there were days when we found ourselves sitting in a house, just waiting for the weather to clear.\n\nYou can try to fly under the clouds, but going low means our bulky drones are more easily spotted and destroyed. Since we have limited tools, we try to preserve them and not use them recklessly.\n\nStill, on days with strong winds, there's a chance that the clouds may break slightly and give you glimpses of the battlefield. Sometimes, when visibility is bad but not impossible to work with, we must risk flying in such weather, especially if our troops are defending against a major assault.\n\nIn late summer, the situation in Pokrovsk was becoming increasingly problematic, both on the ground and in the sky. Back in the day, we would help long-range artillery focus on the Russian rear.\n\nI began to notice that Russia's tactics were making an impact around September.\n\nAcross the warzone, their strategy is to find our limit and overwhelm it with the smallest number of soldiers needed to seize our positions.\n\nIt is simple mathematics. Initially, they would send around 10 soldiers. If that wasn't enough, they would send 20. Then they would try 30.\n\nDay by day, they increase the number of troops and equipment. Their goal is to create a situation where we don't have enough drones to counter the amount of attacking infantry.\n\nTo eliminate an assault of 50 guys, all spread out, we'd need at least 150 drones and artillery, which is difficult for us to organize with our limited resources.\n\nWhen we were working in Pokrovsk, there were already areas of the city where the Russians had advanced, so the fighting area was porous and undefined.\n\nIf we had more troops, we could have held out for much longer and performed more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nIf we had more recon drones, our team could have flown over Pokrovsk nonstop, working despite the clouds.\n\nWith more first-person-view strike drones, our pilots could continue to find and attack the Russians closer to the ground.\n\nBut we don't have enough. So, we need other strike tools besides FPV drones, even though they account for about 80% of our kills on Russians.\n\nIronically, some of these tools have disappeared because warfare has changed so much. Mortars might have helped, but we mostly stopped using them — the battlefield is now so transparent that it is a suicide mission to ride around close to the front line in your pickup truck with a mortar.\n\nWhat we definitely need is artillery ammunition. Last year, some HIMARS units I worked with were rationed to four strikes a week.\n\nOther artillery units were limited to just three artillery shells a day. We would find them a target, and they would say: \"We don't have any more for today. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe weather in this season means it is still what drone pilots call our \"low season.\" At the same time, the terrain is now not too muddy, so it is the perfect time for Russians to attack.\n\nThis month, I am redeploying to Dnipro.

The state's rich and powerful, worth more than $1 billion, would face a one-time 5% tax on their assets if the plan gets approved.\n\nThe proposal, which aims to address a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit, has prompted plenty of grumbling among the California elite.\n\nAs Business Insider first reported, some have already taken action, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nPage converted his secretive family office out of California in late December and incorporated it in Delaware, according to my colleague Hugh Langley's exclusive reporting. Page also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures. He lists principal office addresses outside of California for those entities.\n\nSeparately, an entity tied to both Brin and Page moved out of California at the end of 2025.\n\nThe timing of these moves is crucial. If the ballot measure is approved in November, it would take effect retroactively for residents living in California as of January 1, 2026. Hence, the rush to move assets before the end of the year.\n\nBrin and Page are two of the richest people on the planet, with a combined net worth north of half a trillion dollars, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a very different tone. He said he's \"perfectly fine\" with the tax and gave no indication he plans to leave Silicon Valley, even if it costs him.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman called the proposal \"horrendous\" for innovation, warning that poorly designed wealth taxes don't raise reliable revenue — they push money and talent elsewhere.\n\nAlex Spiro, the celebrity lawyer who represents several billionaires, sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom last month warning that the tax would drive capital and innovation out of California.\n\nEarlier this month, White House AI Czar David Sacks predicted Austin would overtake San Francisco as the American tech hub. His social media post ricocheted throughout tech and venture circles, drawing cheers from anti-coastal contrarians and sharp pushback from traditionalists.\n\nWhere do you stand on the proposed billionaire's tax in California?

    "description": "Why Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is on investors’ radar today Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is drawing attention as investors reassess its recent share performance, business mix, and current valuation signals, using the latest financial metrics as a fresh reference point. See our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway. At a share price of US$499.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is drawing attention as investors reassess its recent share performance, business mix, and current valuation signals, using the latest financial metrics as a fresh reference point.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAt a share price of US$499.10, Berkshire Hathaway’s short term share price return has been relatively steady, while a 1 year total shareholder return of 12.75% and 5 year total shareholder return of 113.76% point to momentum that has built up over time.\n\nIf Berkshire’s mix of insurance, rail and utilities has you thinking about portfolio balance, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist with fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.\n\nWith Berkshire trading at US$499.10, showing a 36% intrinsic discount estimate and sitting only slightly below analyst targets, you have to ask: is there still mispricing here, or is the market already banking on future growth?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is trading on a P/E of 16x at a last close of US$499.10, which points to a valuation that sits below several reference points investors often watch.\n\nThe P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so you are essentially seeing how many dollars the market is paying for each dollar of recent earnings. For a diversified group like Berkshire, with insurance, rail and utilities alongside a wide spread of operating businesses, P/E is a quick way to stack its earnings price tag against peers and against an estimated fair level.\n\nOn one side, Berkshire screens as good value versus a peer average P/E of 26.9x and an estimated fair P/E of 18.7x. This suggests the current 16x multiple sits below levels the market could move towards. On the other side, it shows as slightly expensive relative to the broader US diversified financials industry on 15x, which hints that investors are paying a small premium to that industry for Berkshire’s earnings profile despite the recent drop in profit margins from 28.9% to 18.1% and a low 9.7% return on equity.\n\nCompared with the sector, that mix is important. The 16x P/E undercuts peers on 26.9x quite sharply, yet it still edges above the 15x industry average. This frames Berkshire as cheaper than similar companies used in the peer set but somewhat dearer than the wider diversified financials group.\n\nExplore the SWS fair ratio for Berkshire Hathaway\n\nResult: Price-to-Earnings of 16x (UNDERVALUED)\n\nHowever, weaker net income growth, lower profit margins, and a modest 9.7% return on equity could challenge the idea that Berkshire’s current P/E offers clear value.",

    "description": "From Davos and the Super Bowl to Burning Man and St. Barts, see the predictable social calendar billionaires follow and how much it all costs.",
    "fullText": "Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed.\n\nThe world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences.\n\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider.\n\nEach year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said.\n\n2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars.\n\nHere's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them.\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs.\n\nThis year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed \"A Spirit of Dialogue.\" While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccess to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public.\n\nApartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog.\n\nNFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on.\n\nThese billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,\" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nHost committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash.\n\nThe most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year.\n\nAs Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires.\n\nOprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee \"The Nickel Boys\" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful \"Hamnet,\" and James Cameron, director of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires.\n\nEach year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters.\n\nThe tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members.\n\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave.\n\nThe general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system.\n\nEvery year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nDubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters.\n\nWhile the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers.\n\nThe event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission.\n\nWhile billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup,\" Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nThe soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market.\n\nWhile the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool.\n\nThere will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal.\n\nPrivate jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.\n\nSince 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.\n\nThe conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995.\n\nLast year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced.\n\nThe vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nBurning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades.\n\nGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019.\n\nLast year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years.\n\nStill, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way.\n\nThis year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project.\n\nThe coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys.\n\nThe 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons.\n\nLast year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million.\n\nIn the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800.\n\nOctober presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections.\n\nFirst, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there.\n\nShortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit.\n\nLast year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nA painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps.\n\nWhile the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs.\n\nFormula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures.\n\nThe various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names.\n\nLast year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll.\n\nThree-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options.\n\nWhile Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year.\n\nLast year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club.\n\nFor those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"",

    "description": "You can bet on anything from sports to Labubus now, but prediction markets are also a valuable tool for investors, Danny Moses told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "You can bet on pretty much anything these days. From sports to the weather to the price of a Labubu, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi have offered people a new way to gamble.\n\nAccording to Danny Moses, one of the investors from \"The Big Short,\" they've also offered investors a useful tool to help navigate markets.\n\nMoses, who was among the investors betting against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, isn't surprised by the prediction-market boom, and he thinks investors need to be watching these markets closely to stay on top of their game.\n\n\"I think it's great to scan through all the prediction markets out there, certainly economics and business-related, because it actually will get you thinking about things you might have been missing,\" he told Business Insider in an interview before the new year.\n\nMoses isn't too focused on short opportunities these days, despite being famous for his role in Michael Lewis's now-iconic saga of the housing crash. But he thinks that prediction markets can serve to provide valuable info for bullish and bearish investors alike.\n\nHe pointed to the recent example of popular fintech stock SoFi Technologies being listed as having a 38% chance of being added to the benchmark index in 2026, something that could be a likely catalyst for the stock, which is up 93% in the last year.\n\n\"If you're short SoFi and you weren't thinking about the possibility of it being added to the S&P 500, like we just saw happen to Carvana recently, that's something you need to be aware of,\" Moses said.\n\nThat's not the only way prediction markets could help investors make smarter decisions. Moses said he thinks there may be circumstances where they can offer a more appealing risk-reward than investors might get from traditional derivatives. He cited crypto as an example.\n\n\"Will bitcoin trade below $70,000 in the first quarter of 2026?\" he mused. \"Well, if I own bitcoin, and it's a much cheaper way to bet, if it's an eight cent possibility, so call it twelve to one, I might be getting a better market, or I might want to buy that rather than buying a put option on crypto.\"\n\nIn his view, it's early days for prediction markets. Their usefulness will grow as a predictive tool for hedging traditional investments as well as gauging the likelihood of market-moving events. And as they grow, expect more prominent players to participate, he said.\n\n\"I think institutions are going to start using prediction markets more, and as institutions use it, you're going to see a lot more activity,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Global Ripple Effects of Corporate Tax Reforms\n\n Sebastian Dyrda, \n\n Guangbin Hong, \n\n Muhammad Ali Sajid \n\n & Joseph B. Steinberg \n\n Working Paper 34627\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34627\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nWe study international spillovers of corporate tax reforms in a fragmented global tax regime. Using firm-level evidence on the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and a quantitative general-equilibrium model, we illustrate how multinational enterprises (MNEs) propagate local policy shocks throughout the global economy. Our framework emphasizes two key intrinsic properties of intangible capital: non-rivalry and mobile ownership. We find the TCJA generated positive outward spillovers: First, it boosted U.S. MNEs’ intangible investment, raising their foreign subsidiaries’ output. Second, it increased tangible investment of foreign MNEs’ U.S. subsidiaries, incentivizing them to expand intangible investment at home. Conversely, a Global Minimum Tax (GMT) implemented by the rest of the world generates negative inward spillovers for the United States, even if U.S.-parented MNEs are exempt. These findings illustrate that there is no such thing as a purely domestic corporate tax policy.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe are grateful to the International Tax Policy Forum for financial support of this project.

    "fullText": "Salad bar-style buffet chains have suffered financial distress since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSalad buffet restaurant chain Souper Salad has declined from about 150 locations to just three.\n\nFormerly defunct Sweet Tomatoes plans to open two locations after going out of business during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe rise of salad bar restaurant chains in the 1980s accelerated in the 1990s and early 2000s, as the restaurant concept became popular.\n\nSalad bar buffet restaurant chains Sweet Tomatoes and its sister Souplantation, which were founded in San Diego, and Dallas-based Souper Salad both launched in 1978. Another popular chain, Fresh Choice launched in California in 1986.\n\nI remember the beginning of the salad dining craze in the early 1980s, as I dined at a casual restaurant called The Salad Bar along Sacramento's K Street mall in 1982.\n\nUnfortunately, the restaurant did not last long, but other restaurants chains with salad bars, such as Sizzler and Wendy's, filled the void until the industry prospered.\n\nSouper Salad had expanded to over 150 locations by the early 2000s, but industry headwinds and a downturn in consumer confidence led to a 2011 bankruptcy filing and continued restaurant closings, according to Nation's Restaurant News.\n\nThe restaurant chain only has three locations today in Lubbock, Pasadena, and El Paso, Texas.\n\n6703 Slide Road, Lubbock, Texas\n\n5822 Fairmont Parkway, Pasadena, Texas\n\n8900 Viscount Blvd., El Paso, Texas Source\n\nFresh Choice filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 24, 2012, according to PacerMonitor, and shut down its 20 remaining locations in December 2012.\n\nSweet Tomatoes and Souplantation's owner filed Chapter 11 in 2016, and then four years later, the buffet restaurant chain filed for Chapter 7 liquidation and permanently closed down its 97 locations, after the Covid-19 pandemic had forced a shut down, according to Nation's Restaurant News.\n\nSweet Tomatoes announced a comeback in 2025, as new owners ST Three LLC said they would open new locations in Tucson, Ariz., and Fort Myers, Fla., Gulfshore Business reported.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic devastated the salad bar/buffet dining concept in 2020, as buffet-style restaurants shut down across the nation as the pandemic forced strict health requirements upon restaurants and consumers became frightened of the thought of eating at such establishments.\n\nAfter Fresh Choice disappeared in 2012, another salad restaurant concept launched in Gilbert, Ariz., in 2013 — Salad and Go's fast-food drive-thru chain that rose to over 140 restaurant locations by May 2025.",

    "description": "Vince McMahon's wrestling business model may be monopolistic, but according to this WWE Hall of Famer, the McMahons' tactics were just good for business.",
    "fullText": "For many years, WWE was the definition of a professional wrestling monopoly, with its complete dominance of the professional wrestling market, industry-shaping practices, and strict closed-door policy to outside promotions. While the wrestling scene has since diversified, some may argue that the McMahon dynasty's ruthless business practices were a good thing — one of those advocates being WWE Hall of Famer Dory Funk Jr.\n\nFunk Jr. was interviewed on a recent episode of News4Jax's \"Going Ringside,\" and amidst questions about his decades-long career in the professional wrestling business, Funk Jr. was asked about Vince McMahon's total takeover of the professional wrestling business. Funk Jr., coming from a pre-WWE era of several, individual, fragmented promotions, praised McMahon's business tactics.\n\n\"Yeah, Vince bought everything. It was good for the business,\" Funk Jr. admitted.\n\nWhile Funk Jr. approved of McMahon's business model, he did not dismiss the importance of rival promotions to the professional wrestling ecosystem. While he did not name any specific competitors, Funk Jr. reasoned that the emergence of new companies — both those working with and against WWE — broaden the professional wrestling world, and contribute to its overall success.\n\n\"And then, other, new companies would come along, and be working with Vince, or working against him. It was good for the wrestling business,\" Funk Jr. elaborated.\n\nFunk Jr. confirmed he keeps up with professional wrestling in the present day, though to what extent the Hall of Famer follows the current product is unclear. He applauded modern wrestling as \"good business,\" and praised today's talents for their work ethic.\n\n\"Everybody works hard to give the fans what they would like to see,\" Funk Jr. concluded. \"And...I see the fans very, very eager to get behind professional wrestling.\"\n\nWhile Funk Jr. is advanced in his years, he still contributes to the professional wrestling world through limited in-ring activities and his wrestling school.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Linda Kemp, 84, works at her son's law firm and lives below the poverty line. She recently moved to be closer to her son and can't retire.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Linda Kemp, 84, who mails letters at her son's law firm in Florida. Kemp said the work helps her stay current on her bills, and she is grateful to her son for the opportunity to hold a job. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMost of my life I've been a caregiver to my children. I've had seven children, and they're now all over the planet. I have one in Australia, three in California, one in Hawaii, one in Ohio, and one here in Florida. My first marriage, I had four children, and the second marriage — which was only a common law marriage — I had three.\n\nWith my second husband, we built a house. When we split up, I freaked out a little.\n\nMy husband paid all the bills and gave me money to do the grocery shopping. I wasn't the main breadwinner, and I wasn't bringing in any money aside from selling some art that I made, which doesn't add up to enough to raise my children. We didn't live in luxury, but we were able to live comfortably. When he left, he gave the house to me.\n\nI managed to buy a house with the money I got from the house we built, but it was too big. I invested and reinvested in property, and each time I did that, I made more money. It helped me keep going once the kids had grown up. Today, they call it flipping. I managed to live comfortably, and I don't care about gold or fancy clothes.\n\nI designed a small, one-story house just for me. When I got older, I had four solar panels installed.\n\nPeople always have arguments over money. It's the downfall of man. Forget the darn money and be happy.\n\nI went back to school and got a degree in graphic design, which was the closest thing to art where I can make a living. I have always been an artist. I became computer literate and then got a job as a graphic designer. I worked at that company for a few years, designing software. I was in my 50s when that job ended.\n\nI made my lifestyle very economical. I'm an environmentalist, so I like to leave a very small footprint on the planet. It got to the point that it was just too much to handle taking care of five acres of farm with fruit trees, so I decided to sell the house.\n\nIn my retirement years, I was a chair of the Sierra Club where I lived and got involved in a lot of community affairs and historic preservation projects. I had friends who would go kayaking every week, and it was a very lovely and economical way to live.\n\nI moved to a home near Jacksonville just a few weeks ago. It's a little over 100 miles from where I was. It's not by the ocean, and it's in an area that blew up with developments everywhere. It's in a development where my son had lived in a golf club. He bought a bigger house in the same golf club about a mile up the road from where I am. It's a bit of a transition, and I'm not yet comfortable with everything here yet.\n\nMy son is an attorney, and so is his wife. They have three kids, and maybe five years ago, he asked me if I wanted to work for him by doing the mail. I was retired at the time. I figured it was a job I could do at home on a computer.\n\nWhen my son's dad left, he was 15 years old, and it was just us two left at home. At that point, it was us against the world. My job as a graphic designer helped him through college. since we introduced the job above He stood on his own after that and stayed in school to get a law degree.\n\nI was doing okay on my own after that and lived a conscious life of simplicity. At my age 84, it felt good that my son wanted to keep a close eye on how I was doing in my old age and for me to move closer to him. The decision was based on my 5-year-old granddaughter running up to hug me whenever I saw her. Who could want any more than that?\n\nI go online in the morning, and I have a line from the sheriff's office sending out a list of all the bookings from the night before. So they send out the names and addresses of all the people who have been booked. He does mainly DUI cases. I send them all a letter my son made asking them if they need an attorney. I address the envelopes, stamp them, and get them in the mail before the post office closes.\n\nI would probably do it for nothing if he asked me to because I enjoy it. It keeps me active, keeps my hands moving on the typewriter every day, and makes me get up and do something. I live by myself and have no male friends. I've had a few women friends, but lately they've all drifted away. I was pretty active in my past community because I'm an artist and involved with art gallery events, and I'm hoping I can become active in my new community.\n\nMondays are very busy because it's three days worth of bookings from the weekend. I probably work from around 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Mondays. On Tuesdays, I may work for six hours, Wednesday for three or four hours, and Thursday and Friday for two or three hours. I do basically 20 hours a week.\n\nI'm not paying any rent at this house, as it belongs to my son. I pay the utilities, and I'll need to pay for someone to cut the grass and shrubs because you can't have any weeds in the neighborhood. My whole income comes from what my son pays me and Social Security.\n\nMy son's my landlord, so he's not going to kick me out. He wants me here, and he doesn't ask for anything except that I work. He had only one request for me, which was to watch my grandchildren once a month so he and his wife could go out on a date. I said, \"Once a month? Why don't you go out once a week?\"\n\nI recently injured myself unexpectedly. I had a vein in my right wrist blow out, which has affected my hand. Still, I'm in pretty good health, although I take seven pills every day. Whatever the doctors tell me, I do it. You can't fight Mother Nature. I'm not wasting my life in the gym either.\n\nI look pretty good for my age. When I tell them how old I am, they think I was 60. My mother lived to be 93, and I'm going for 100.\n\nI haven't quite landed on what I'm going to focus on in the future. I just need to assess the situation around me. I think working 20 hours a week is very comfortable for me because that gives me half the time to be a creative person. I've done all kinds of painting, printmaking, and jewelry making. Whatever I do next, it probably will be some kind of entrepreneur job where I'm my own boss, if I still have the energy to do that.\n\nIt's just like starting all over again. It feels like I just graduated from college.",

    "description": "Michelle Hu, owner of Étoile, shares how learning from her failed beauty tech app led to Étoile's over $9 milion revenue last year.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michelle Hu, a 30-year-old business owner based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first business died as quickly as it started.\n\nIn 2017, I was working as an investment banking analyst at Citi when I launched Mei, a beauty app where users could filter through and book appointments with makeup artists, hair stylists, and more. It was a one-year process of trying to scale and pouring in about $30,000 in the process, but we ultimately never launched.\n\nIn the meantime, I was selling handmade acrylic makeup holders online under the brand name Étoile. Mei failed, but I saw Étoile gaining traction on its own. I realized it could take off — and it did.\n\nTwo years later, I quit my job and went all in on Étoile. I transformed it into a world for beauty enthusiasts, crafting accessories that elevate daily rituals. We made over $9 million in revenue last year and recently launched our products in nearly 30 Anthropologie stores across the US.\n\nHere's what I learned from my failed business that helped me the second time around.\n\nI was so in love with the beauty industry that I jumped right in with Mei, but I had no tech background and no idea what really went into building an app. I remember thinking the idea of creating this techy business app sounded cool, but it just wasn't a fit for my skill set or interests. I had no business creating an app.\n\nWhen time's got hard, and the app required more time, energy, and money than I bargained for, I didn't have the passion for my product to drive me. Starting Étoile, a consumer product business, felt a lot more aligned with me.\n\nI learned it's important to start a business in an industry you love, because when things get difficult, you need the passion to fuel you. I'm not passionate about tech, but I am passionate about designing products. That passion fuels me to work through the hurdles.\n\nI now realize that I never had product-market fit with Mei. Most people text or DM to book makeup artists or hairstylists, and I learned the hard way that it's difficult to change consumer behavior.\n\nMy initial vision for Étoile was for it to be an \"everything store\" for beauty, featuring items such as ring lights and vanity tables. However, our customer base was fragmented.\n\nThat's when I took what I learned from Mei and scaled back on items that weren't driving a significant amount of revenue, focusing on what worked: our travel range of products. Since then, we've developed a strong customer base that's excited about our product. I can feel the difference between having headwinds in the business versus having tailwinds.\n\nWhen we hit that product-market fit magic, everything seemed to move a lot more efficiently in the business.\n\nI think the biggest financial mistake I made was not vetting the people we chose to build the app. It sounds silly because it seems so obvious, but I think I was just so new to the world of business and thought, \"If they've made one app before, then they can make any app.\"\n\nWe hired college students from around the world and basically threw money at them without meeting them or vetting them. We couldn't afford people with a strong portfolio, so we just filtered through others who were just as scrappy as us. I didn't realize there was such a big scope of different app developers.\n\nI've always lived by the saying, \"move fast and break things,\" but when you're spending so much money to hire people, do more research.\n\nI think hiring is still a tricky one. The thing that helps is that we have a much bigger budget than we did with Mei. The people we choose to work with have a strong portfolio of brands that they've previously worked with. I think bigger budgets have allowed for better opportunities.\n\nWhen I shut down Mei, I had to admit that things weren't working and even learn to be OK with failure.\n\nAt the start of Étoile, I held onto our product strategy so tightly, even when it wasn't working. My thought process was that we had our products ready to go, stored in a warehouse, and marketed to our audience, so I thought it would be a bad look to pull back on them, even when they weren't working.\n\nWhen I finally made the shift and pulled back on items like mirrors and tables, the business made a complete 180. It reaffirmed that it's important to admit when things aren't working and not to have so much pride when it comes to my business.\n\nDo you have a story to share about lessons learned from a failed business? If so, please contact the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Chrissy Traore, 41, who opened See & Be Kitchen with her husband Ben Salif Traore in Cairo, New York, about 40 miles from Albany, New York. When their business expanded quickly, they began running parts of it out of shipping containers on their property. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBen and I met while I was a chef and he was a baker. We worked at the same restaurant — they had a bakery and a restaurant right next door, and I was their pizza chef and he was their head baker. I had to mix my pizza dough in his mixer and that's kind of how we met.\n\nBefore, I worked on Madison Avenue in marketing and brand strategy, and in 2008, the economy crashed and my job crashed too. When that happened, I moved into food. I took a job on an ice cream truck and just fell in love with food work.\n\nI was in the food industry in various ways in New York City from about 2008 until 2017.\n\nWhile working in the industry, I was unhappy with the way that they treated employees. I was in management at the time, so I could see the full round numbers.\n\nI thought, \"There has to be a better way, but it's not my job to change this business owner or this business.\"\n\nBen and I talked a lot about it, and we were going upstate frequently — I was working at a place upstate as their first chef.\n\nI said, \"We should really move upstate.\" It's more our speed. We like the outdoors. We like having space. The quality of life is better. We love farming and being close to what's happening on the ground, literally. In 2017 we said, let's get out of the city.\n\nWe didn't have a ton of money, and we had to be scrappy and thoughtful about how we deployed the resources that we had saved. We wanted a place where we could live and work, so we wanted property and land — that was important to us.\n\nWe found a property in Cairo, New York, and it had been a bar and a hotel, so it was already grandfathered in on DOH, and had some structures there. We have 11 acres, and the house was practically falling apart, so we could afford it. We paid $189,900, and that was it. We went all in.\n\nWe knew we wanted to open our own place and we were trying to discover what that was. We knew it would involve Ben's bread and my cooking.\n\nWe started renovating the property and doing farmers markets, and that's how we got to know the community that we were in.\n\nWe came in quietly, like, \"Let's see what's already here and get to know people before we just bash them over the head with what we do.\" Let's see what they want, because ultimately we're entering a community that's not necessarily ours yet.\n\nWe were moving from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, and part of the reason we moved out was we saw that happening. People were moving in and they would say, \"We need to fix this. This is broken.\" And I'm like, \"What is broken? This is a wonderful community. Please stop.\"\n\nSometime in 2018, we turned into See & Be. Then, from there, we really got some traction at farmers markets.\n\nWe were doing porch pickups — people could pick up their orders at a local massage therapist's house — so we had started operating, but we didn't have a physical space yet.\n\nWe were still building out the cafe in the very small already existing structure on our property. We had one oven, with one proofer, a little cooktop that I would do the sandwiches on, and a coffee station with this beautiful wooden bar that people could sit at. And we opened that in February of 2019. Ben baked everything; I ran the front of house.\n\nWe had a five-year plan and it went into overdrive. Soon, we needed more space, and I could not get a building up fast enough. With traditional buildings, we looked at it and we thought it was going to take a year and a half to two years. We couldn't do that. We needed space like tomorrow.\n\nI had worked for a company while in Brooklyn that was actually my first shipping container job. That was at the DeKalb Market, and it was all built out of shipping containers.\n\nI realized there was no way to get a building through the planning board and everything quickly enough — but I could get a shipping container.\n\nI looked at Ben and I said, \"The fastest way we can do this is to get a shipping container.\" And he said, \"Are you kidding?\" I said, \"No.\"\n\nWe really bootstrapped our business from day one. We had a $10,000 investment in building out the space over time. We costed it out, and we could afford it with what we had already made in the business.\n\nWe got our approval and I was so excited. I posted it on our Facebook page and we got over 4,000 interactions. We couldn't not open.\n\nOur first shipping container was a regular shipping container — a 40' by 20' high cube. We placed it on wooden rail ties, which was not great — those degraded over the years, especially with heavy usage.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as scrappy: \"Well, we did the cafe, we can do this ourselves. So why would I pay to have a spray foam? We'll do that ourselves.\" That was terrible idea.\n\nI think we bought every spray foam insulation canister in a 200-mile radius of here from Home Depot and Lowe's. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just trying to figure it out. The walls were uneven and it worked, but it wasn't a great solution.\n\nThen we pushed out of that shipping container and needed even more space. At that point, we needed more cold storage. I started doing more research into shipping containers and came across decommissioned reefers.\n\nThey're pre-insulated and have steel walls. And unlike a regular shipping container that has a wood floor, this has a steel flat floor. So it's already food-ready.\n\nWe bought the first container for $6,000 painted and delivered. And then we spent another couple thousand dollars in spray foam. God only knows how much the labor was, because we did it ourselves and that took forever.\n\nWe have running water and electric in the containers, but most of the mixing happens in our original building.\n\nThat following year, as our business grew and began to quickly scale, we kept outgrowing our space and needing more and more room. Once we saw how quickly we could get a shipping container in place — about a month — it was easy to go, \"OK, well, gee, trucks can double my space in a month.\"\n\nThe second container was much faster and easier to set up. I bought that directly through a broker at the port. We paid $8,500 for that one.\n\nWhen we installed the second container, we leveled the ground, put in concrete pillars, and the cranes came in and moved the original container and did that whole process. Then, with the third container, it was very easy to attach it because the ground was already graded and leveled.\n\nIt cost about $7,500 to $15,000 per container at the end of the day, because we had to get the crane to get them moved, and we had to get them welded together.\n\nIt's always funny when someone comes up to the building for the first time, and they're just like, \"What is this? Where is the bakery?\" And then they knock on a shipping container door.\n\nPeople are always shook to see that it's a real production. They think we're winging this or pretending because there's these shipping containers. But when you walk in, you forget you're in a shipping container.",

    "title": "I run alcohol-free nightlife events in NYC. Most of my guests aren't sober — they just don't want to drink.",
    "description": "Sam Bail, the founder of Bright Nights Social, told Business Insider that demand is booming for her alcohol-free nightlife events in New York.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "We took a long, international flight on Singapore Airlines' business class. For my family, the best part was the food, but I had issues with the seat.",
    "fullText": "When I booked a family trip from Copenhagen to Singapore, I knew we were facing a 13-hour overnight flight.\n\nFlying with my husband and our 7-year-old son meant comfort wasn't just a luxury — it was a necessity. So, we splurged on business class, using points to bring the cost down to something we could justify.\n\nHere's what it was like — the highs, the lows, and the key thing that made it worthwhile.\n\nA deal popped up on discount search engine seats.aero that seemed too good to pass up: Singapore Airlines business-class seats from Copenhagen to Singapore, bookable through Air Canada's Aeroplan program, for just 80,000 points per person.\n\nSingapore Airlines has a reputation for having one of the best business-class experiences in the world, and the thought of spending 13 hours in lie-flat comfort — especially with a child — was incredibly appealing.\n\nWe transferred our American Express points to Air Canada and booked the seats, paying only about $100 per person in taxes and fees.\n\nThat flight, which could easily cost over $15,000 for three passengers, cost us just over $300 out of pocket.\n\nWhen we boarded the Airbus A350-900, the first thing I noticed was how wide the seats looked. At about 28 inches wide, there was plenty of room for my husband and me, and our son could stretch out without feeling cramped.\n\nEven better, the seats were equipped with numerous compartments — small storage areas for headphones, snacks, books, and charging devices.\n\nAs a parent, I loved being able to keep things organized instead of digging through one overflowing bag the entire flight.\n\nI loved that you could control the seatback setup either directly on the screen or with a pull-out remote. That flexibility made it simple for all of us to watch what we wanted.\n\nThe complimentary noise-canceling headphones were another highlight. They blocked out the hum of the cabin, allowing me actually to enjoy a movie without distraction.\n\nThe food turned out to be one of the highlights of the flight. I started with stuffed chicken paired with potatoes and mushrooms — a flavorful and surprisingly restaurant-quality dish.\n\nWe also tried the oriental-style braised beef cheek, which was tender and rich.\n\nBeyond the formal meal service, there was also an \"anytime\" menu. At any point during the flight, you could order a sandwich, a bowl of egg-noodle soup, or a variety of small snacks.\n\nWe didn't lean on it this time, but as a parent, I loved knowing it was there in case my son got hungry outside of meal times.\n\nAnother unexpected perk: I was able to order a proper latte in the morning. Usually, I avoid airplane coffee altogether, but this was actually good — smooth, not burnt-tasting, and served with a bit of flair in a real mug.\n\nIt felt like a small luxury, but after hours in the air, it made a big difference.\n\nFor me, one downside was the way the seat converted into a bed.\n\nInstead of just reclining with a button, we had to stand up and have the flight attendant flip our seats over. Not great when you're already half-asleep.\n\nAnd once it was a bed, the surface felt surprisingly firm. Since I have back problems, this was not ideal, and it was challenging to find a comfortable position.\n\nHowever, it was certainly better than sleeping upright.\n\nThe lie-flat seat sort of forces your legs into a diagonal position, which can make it difficult to relax during such a long flight.\n\nMy husband and I both found ourselves shifting around trying to get comfortable.\n\nFor our son, though, it was perfect. The smaller frame of a 7-year-old fit right into the angled nook, and he slept soundly while we tossed and turned.\n\nWould I pay cash for this flight? Probably not — the angled footwell and hard bed weren't quite worth the usual five-figure price tag.\n\nHowever, this flight was absolutely worth spending points on.\n\nThe wide seats, smart storage, strong entertainment system, tasty meals, and polished service all combined to make the journey manageable — especially with a child in tow.\n\nAnd arriving in Singapore rested enough to start exploring right away was the ultimate payoff.",

    "title": "Trump calls to ban Wall Street from buying homes, but industry insiders say the business model has already moved on",
    "description": "Industry insiders say Trump's call to ban big investors is out of sync with how those players actually buy homes.",
    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "fullText": "America’s distilleries have faced a perfect storm of economic and market headwinds that has pushed many out of business in recent years.\n\nFirst, many Americans are drinking less, especially younger ones.\n\n\"Young adults in the U.S. have become progressively less likely to use alcohol over the past two decades, with the percentages of 18- to 34-year-olds saying they ever drink, that they drank in the past week and that they sometimes drink more than they shouldall lower today. At the same time, drinking on all three metrics has trended up among older Americans while holding fairly steady among middle-aged adults,\" according to a Gallup poll.\n\n62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, down from 72% two decades ago.\n\nConversely, drinking has increased among adults aged 55 and older.\n\nYoung adults are also drinking less frequently and are less likely to drink to excess.\n\nIn addition, distilleries continue to feel the effects of tariffs imposed during President Donald Trump’s administration, which have increased production costs and contributed to a sharp drop in U.S. whiskey exports to key markets like the EU.\n\n“We’re very worried about what tariffs could do to our industry,” said Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, reported WKYT.\n\nTake those two challenges together, and it's not surprising that American distilleries, including Artisan Distillery & Craft Bar, have decided to close their doors.\n\nThose impacts are already being felt.\n\nAmerican Whiskey exports to the EU, the U.S. spirits industry’s largest export market, have tumbled by 33% and cost $300 million since the EU’s 25% retaliatory tariff went into effect on June 22, 2018, according to a new report released by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on the two-year anniversary.\n\nThe EU levied the destructive tariff in response to U.S. tariffs on EU steel and aluminum.\n\n“American distillers enjoyed two decades of unparalleled growth in the EU prior to the implementation of these retaliatory tariffs,” said Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). “This report makes clear that these tariffs took the wind out of the sails for American Whiskey exports to our top export market, which has resulted in a loss of more than a quarter of a billion dollars of sales.”\n\nArtisan Distillery & Craft Bar became famous for its Spike Vodka, a spirit made with nopal instead of the traditional fermented cereal grains or potatoes. Later, the distillery added gin, whisky, moonshine, and a tequila-like agave liquor and branched out to brewing beer.",

    "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 was indisputably a sales hit after its June 2025 launch, but a new report indicates that the hybrid console's success may not match up to the original Switch's first holiday season.\nAccording to The Game Business, Switch 2 sales in the United States were down by around 35% from November to December compared to Switch 1 sales during the same period in its launch year of 2017. This statistic tracks with an earlier report from Circana revealing that November 2025 was the worst month for hardware sales in the US since 1995.\nThe Switch 2 didn't fare much better in European countries, with UK sales having a reported fall of 16% compared to the Switch 1 in Holiday 2017. In France, Switch 2 unit numbers for its inaugural year are reportedly over 30% lower than what the Switch 1 achieved during its first year.",

    "description": "I sampled first and business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela. From the seats to the food and lounge access, here's how the two experiences compared.",
    "fullText": "I spent six hours and $630 on the fastest train in America.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela is the express option for travelers in the Northeast with only business and first-class seating. In August 2025, the route got a fresh new fleet called the NextGen Acela. In addition to a futuristic look and modern amenities, the train has a top speed of 160 miles per hour, making it the fastest train in the US.\n\nIn September 2025, I booked round-trip tickets between my home in New York City and Washington, DC, on the NextGen Acela. I got a taste of both classes.\n\nSince the Acela doesn't have coach seating, business class is the standard ticket.\n\nMy first-class ticket included a meal, priority boarding, attendant service, and lounge access at the train station.\n\nI waited for my business-class train to Washington, DC, on the floor of NYC's Penn Station. The waiting room was full, and it would have cost me $50 to access the Metropolitan Lounge, which is complimentary for first-class passengers.\n\nSince I held a first-class ticket for my ride home from Washington, DC, I had access to the Metropolitan Lounge at Union Station. Other passengers can pay $35 to enter the space.\n\nThe lounge was quiet and calm. There were couches, comfy chairs, tables, and colorful works of art on the walls. I especially appreciated the espresso and beverage station, snack bins stocked with a variety of treats — all of which were complimentary — and the clean bathroom.\n\nAfter relaxing in the lounge, I waltzed into the priority boarding lane for my first-class ride to New York. There were fewer than a dozen people in front of me.\n\nUnlike when I rode in business class, where I was toward the back of a long line, I had several minutes to get situated on board before the train departed.\n\nAboard the Acela train, I quickly caught on that blue meant business class and red meant first class. From the headrests to the bathroom doors, the matching colors made it easy to tell which car I was in.\n\nAnother key difference was the layout. There were two rows of seats on either side of the aisle in business class, while first class had a single row of seats on one side of the aisle.\n\nDuring my business-class ride, I grabbed a bite in the café car, where passengers can purchase grab-and-go meals from a self-service station, as well as snacks, drinks, and quick hot meals prepared by an attendant. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which I thought tasted pretty decent for a microwaved meal, and brought it back to my seat.\n\nIn first class, I received attendant service and had a menu of complimentary meals to choose from.\n\nI selected the chicken dish, which consisted of a charred thigh paired with roasted squash, verde sauce, a hard roll, and a Key-lime pie in a jar.\n\nIt was the most delicious and satisfying meal I'd ever had on an Amtrak train.\n\nSave for the color of the door, the bathrooms in each class are the same, an Amtrak representative told Business Insider. I was impressed by how clean, spacious, and high-tech they were.\n\nThese bathrooms featured automatic doors, lights to indicate when the space was in use, and ample room to stretch. I also appreciated the touch-free faucets, soap dispensers, and hand dryers.\n\nAfter my back-to-back three-hour journeys on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train, I expected to be thrilled to get off the rails. But my experiences were so comfortable that I was in no rush to exit. When we pulled into NYC's Penn Station, I let other passengers get off first while I soaked up a few more minutes in my first-class seat.",

    "description": "USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, a defense official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",
