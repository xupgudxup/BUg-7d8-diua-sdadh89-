    "description": "While many stars walked the 2026 Grammys red carpet in eye-catching looks, others, like Heidi Klum and Shaboozey, missed the mark with their outfits.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are always full of head-turning moments, from A-list performances to jaw-dropping red carpet looks.\n\nThe 2026 Grammys, held at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday, were no exception, particularly when it came to the fashion that celebrities wore.\n\nThe best-dressed stars included nominees Olivia Dean and Sabrina Carpenter, but others wore outfits that fell flat.\n\nTake a look at the outfits that missed the mark at the 2026 Grammys.\n\nNominated for best dance pop recording for \"Midnight Sun,\" Larsson walked the red carpet in a custom Kevin Germanier set in bright yellow. The bikini-style top had one strap that crossed her chest, while the low-waisted skirt flowed to the floor and had a subtle train.\n\nThe set had a beautiful silhouette and color, but it worked better when she wore it to perform at the Grammys premiere ceremony with an additional waistpiece. Without the accessory, it just felt like it was missing something.\n\nA full dress instead of a two-piece set could have felt more elevated for the red carpet.\n\nRosé made her Grammys debut in a black minidress custom-designed by Giambattista Valli Couture. The strapless look had white draping that hugged her hips and flowed out into two trains that flanked her sides.\n\nThe dress was dramatic and striking, but Rosé's accessories didn't live up to the gown's hype. She wore black sheer tights, black heels from Le Silla, minimal jewelry, and a blond bob. If she had chosen more dramatic styling, the look would have been stronger.\n\nThe Blackpink star was nominated for song of the year, record of the year, and best pop duo/group performance for \"APT\" with Bruno Mars.\n\nKlum's latex dress hugged her figure, literally, with the dress showing the outline of her entire body. The strapless neckline and midi-length hem looked ripped, and she paired the dress with coordinating pumps.\n\nOverall, the outfit felt more like a costume than a high-fashion moment. A different fabric might have made the dress' deconstructed look feel more intentional.\n\nThe musician arrived in a houndstooth suit that featured shades of tan, brown, blue, orange, yellow, burgundy, and more. There were too many colors to appreciate the pattern and his matching tie.\n\nFoxx also wore a large top hat with a wide, circular brim. His suit and statement accessory felt like they were fighting to be the focus of his look.\n\nShe attended the 2026 Grammys in puffy trousers, a cropped leather jacket, a white blouse, and oversize brooches. Celine designed her look.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a bit too sharp and serious for the music celebration. It would have worked better at a fashion-focused event.\n\nThe musician donned a custom Andrew Kwon design. It had velvet straps, a cutout across the chest, and a floor-length skirt that extended into a short train.\n\nBecause her dress was so plain, it would have been nice to see Beer add some flashy diamond accessories and maybe wear her hair in a sleek updo.\n\nEilish, who was nominated for record and song of the year, wore a sustainable look designed by Hodakova.\n\nIt consisted of a black jacket and skirt with belt details. Eilish also wore a white blouse under the jacket and another around her shoulders. Calf-high white socks, black heels, a black purse, and an \"ICE Out\" pin completed the bold outfit.\n\nStill, because so much of the outfit was black, it was difficult to see the individual pieces. The look might have stood out more if the jacket and skirt had been styled differently.\n\nShe wore a Caroline's Couture design, which was strapless with a bedazzled print, a sweetheart neckline, and a full skirt. The latter was shorter in the front and longer in the back.\n\nThough it was pretty, the gown looked like a 2016 style. Teigen might have benefited from wearing a more modern look.\n\nBalenciaga designed her strapless, floor-length dress. It included a simple corset top, a skirt covered in long feathers, and elbow-length leather gloves.\n\nIts oversize design overwhelmed McRae, and its dark coloring was too harsh for her youthful style.\n\nThey each wore Louis Vuitton designs made from the same black satin fabric and crystal straps.\n\nTheir looks worked individually, but together, they blended too closely. The same outfits in different colors might have added a more unique touch to their overall look.\n\nShe hit the red carpet in a white Atelier Biser ensemble. It had off-the-shoulder sleeves, a long train, and all-over feathers.\n\nFrom the shoulders up, Kesha looked stunning. However, her gown's fabric was so thick that the dress ended up wearing her.",

    "description": "Grammy Award winners like Bad Bunny, Olivia Dean, and Billie Eilish made comments about immigration and spoke out against ICE onstage.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are music's biggest night. This year, they were also a night when music's biggest stars made pointed political statements.\n\nAs President Trump's immigration crackdown rages on amid nationwide protests, musicians used their time on the Grammys stage to make their feelings known.\n\nThe biggest moment of the night came when Bad Bunny dedicated his album of the year award for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" — the first all-Spanish album in history to triumph in the prestigious category — to \"all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, he used another speech to directly criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ICE out,\" the Puerto Rican singer said while accepting the award for best música urbana album.\n\nThe chart-topping superstar, who's also set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show next week, continued his speech by emphasizing the humanity of his fellow Latinos and Puerto Ricans.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\n\"The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love,\" he added.\n\nDuring an in-audience bit with Grammys host Trevor Noah, Bad Bunny clarified that Puerto Ricans are Americans.\n\n\"If things keep getting bad here in America, can I come live with you in Puerto Rico?\" Noah joked.\n\n\"Trevor, I have news for you,\" Bad Bunny replied. \"Puerto Rico is part of America.\"\n\nBad Bunny previously told i-D magazine that he decided to skip the mainland on his latest tour because he didn't want ICE agents waiting outside his concerts.\n\n\"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US. But specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an unincorporated territory of the US… People from the US could come here to see the show. Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world. But there was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nOther winners echoed Bad Bunny's message at the ceremony on Sunday, including London native and \"Nice to Each Other\" singer Olivia Dean, who spoke about her immigrant roots while accepting the award for best new artist.\n\n\"I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant,\" Dean said. \"I'm a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated.\"\n\nLater in the evening, Billie Eilish followed suit when she accepted song of the year for \"Wildflower,\" a ballad from her latest album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft.\"\n\n\"No one is illegal on stolen land,\" Eilish said onstage.\n\n\"It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,\" she added. \"I feel like we just need to keep fighting and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people do matter.\"\n\nEven more Grammy attendees wore \"ICE out\" pins to the ceremony, including Eilish, her brother and producer Finneas O'Connell, Carole King, Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, and Kehlani, who won best R&B performance during the Grammys premiere ceremony.\n\n\"I really wanted to say fuck ICE,\" Kehlani told The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet. \"We're too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of statement in our country. It's brainless to me.\"",

    "description": "The 68th Grammy Awards took place on Sunday. Artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga delivered standout performances, while others fell flat.",
    "fullText": "The 68th annual Grammy Awards yielded plenty of headline-worthy moments, including political statements from stars like Bad Bunny and Olivia Dean, heartfelt tributes to icons like D'Angelo and Ozzy Osbourne, and big wins for Grammy darlings like Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nStill, the vast majority of Sunday's ceremony was dominated by live performances. Several entertainers outshone their peers with showy concepts or scene-stealing vocals, while others proved less than impressive.\n\nKeep reading for a rundown of the best and worst performances.\n\n\"Apt.\" has been inescapable for over a year, dominating Billboard's global 2025 charts, so it runs the risk of sounding stale in 2026. Thankfully, Rosé and Bruno Mars breathed new life into their duet on the Grammys stage, delivering a rock-infused rendition to open the ceremony with a bang.\n\nSabrina Carpenter loves giving her live performances a theme, whether it's descending from the heavens and kissing aliens at the VMAs in 2024, donning a black belt and hitting karate-inspired choreography on \"Saturday Night Live\" last year, or cosplaying as a baggage handler at the Grammys on Sunday.\n\nThe specific role she inhabits hardly matters, because Carpenter always sells it. The song she performed, \"Manchild,\" makes no reference to planes or airports, but as usual, she committed to the bit — with a smile on her face, a spring in her step, and pitch-perfect vocals.\n\nAddison Rae did not have the strongest vocals among the Grammy performers, but vibrato and falsetto are not what have made her a star. Her debut album, \"Addison,\" earned just as much attention for its hypnotic pop music as for Rae's savvy rollout, which featured eye-catching visuals (watch the music video for \"Aquamarine,\" you won't be disappointed) and a flair for theatrics.\n\nRae is a born performer, and she proved exactly that on Sunday by hanging off the back of a truck, wearing a sparkly purple trenchcoat, and singing \"Fame Is a Gun.\" Camp!\n\nFor many pop music lovers, Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" was the highlight of 2025. As such, many fans were desperate to see Gaga's weirdness and wonder showcased at the Grammys.\n\nThose fans had their wish granted. Not only did Gaga win a handful of awards, including best pop vocal album and best dance pop recording for \"Abracadabra,\" but she also gave the standout performance of the night.\n\nTyler, the Creator didn't give a predictable or static performance like many of his fellow nominees. Instead, he blended \"Thought I Was Dead\" from album of the year hopeful \"Chromakopia\" with \"Sugar on My Tongue\" from its follow-up album \"Don't Tap the Glass\" into one dynamic production, complete with elaborate set pieces and a surprise cameo from Regina King.\n\nBest new artist nominee Alex Warren seemed to suffer from playback issues when he took the stage on Sunday, but even perfect execution wouldn't have improved his performance much.\n\nWarren sang last summer's big hit \"Ordinary,\" just as he did on the \"Love Is Blind\" season eight reunion, and then again on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" and then at the 2025 American Music Awards, and then again at the 2025 VMAs… you get the picture. The ballad was already boring and dry upon release. Now, there's truly no juice left to squeeze from it.\n\nLola Young is fresh, fun, and, yes, messy — that's what makes her an interesting artist on the rise. Unfortunately, her debut Grammys performance was traditional, slow, and snoozy.\n\nIt makes sense that Young would want to showcase her vocal prowess on music's biggest night, but by transforming her now-Grammy-winning hit \"Messy\" into a piano ballad, she stripped it of the quirks that helped it go viral in the first place.\n\nNot long after delivering a Grammys highlight, Mars returned to the stage for a paint-by-numbers performance of his newest No. 1 hit, \"I Just Might,\" which lacked the novelty and energy of his duet with Rosé.",

She wore a mesh gown in shades of tan and brown, with gold flower stems attached across the chest and waist. It was designed by Paolo Carzana.\n\nShe also carried a gilded book and a red anthurium flower, which matched her vibrant hair color.\n\nKehlani took home awards in the best R&B performance and best R&B song categories. She was also one of the best-dressed stars on the red carpet.\n\nShe wore a form-fitting gown by Valdrin Sahiti. The black design was see-through, covered in glitter, and floor-length. It featured a halter neckline and a triangle cutout across its bodice.\n\nSabrina Carpenter looked like a princess in her sheer gown. The custom Valentino dress featured a sweetheart neckline with cape sleeves, a floral lace bodice, and a tiered, floor-length skirt. The piece was covered in delicate sparkles from top to bottom.\n\nCarpenter was nominated for album, song, and record of the year, among other categories.\n\nTyla arrived in a glittering Dsquared2 gown. The sleeveless piece was decorated with sequins down its tan bodice and feathers across its skirt and train.\n\nTyla, who was nominated for the best African music performance award, wore the gown with tan heels and a Pandora diamond choker necklace.\n\nLeon Thomas won the 2026 Grammy for best traditional R&B performance and was nominated for multiple others, including best new artist.\n\nOn the red carpet, he looked sharp in an all-black outfit. It comprised a tailored blazer with a diamond brooch, oversize pleated trousers, and a leather hat.\n\nThe best new artist nominee chose a sleeveless white gown designed by Alaïa for the Grammys.\n\nIt had a plunging neckline that dipped below her belly button, and an asymmetrical skirt that was short on one side and long on the other.\n\nOlivia Dean went classic for her first Grammy Awards. The best new artist nominee wore a black-and-white Chanel gown.\n\nThe sleeveless design had a black lace bodice, feathered fringe at the waist, and a full skirt that revealed her two-toned heels.",
