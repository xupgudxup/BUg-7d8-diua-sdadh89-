    "fullText": "Former ESPN host Sage Steele mocked the musicians who criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Grammys because, she said, they are too ignorant to opine.\n\nOn Sunday, several prominent musicians slammed ICE amid the ongoing and sometimes violent raids by the agency and Border Patrol. Last month, agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in separate incidents in Minneapolis, where the Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 immigration agents, who have detained children and arrested asylum-seekers. According to an internal memo, ICE officials told its agents that they do not need a judicial warrant to enter people’s homes.\n\nAt the Grammys on Sunday night, several musicians spoke out against ICE. While accepting the award for Best Música Urbana Album, Bad Bunny, who will perform during the Super Bowl halftime show, said, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out!”\n\nKehlani, who won Best R&B Performance, told the Grammys crowd, “F*ck ICE.”\n\nOn Monday’s Jesse Watters Primetime on Fox News, Steele, a former SportsCenter host, ripped the anti-ICE sentiment.\n\n“I only watched for about 15 minutes, but it was enough to really set the tone for what I knew what it would ultimately be,” she said. “And I gotta tell you, none of us should be surprised at this point, but it is still disappointing.”\n\nSteele went on to reference a refrain by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who in 2018 ripped LeBron James for criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\n“Keep the political comments to yourselves,” Ingraham said at the time. “Shut up and dribble.”\n\n“And I’d liken it to what the great Laura Ingraham said years ago,” Steele said. “‘Shut up and dribble.’ It isn’t because we didn’t want to hear athletes’ opinions on things. Maybe here or there, but it’s because we learned that they don’t tend to base it in fact. They base it on TikTok news or left-wing media narratives instead of the facts. If you go on fact, and give me your opinion from there, then fine. And that’s exactly what the Hollywood elites are choosing not to do as well, and it was an incredibly pathetic, but not surprising display by all of those on that stage yesterday.”\n\nSteele later added, “This is why, shut up and dribble, shut up and sing, because you’re super talented, but you don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n\nA Fox News poll released last week shows that 59% of American voters believe ICE has been “too aggressive” in its tactics. Meanwhile, a plurality (46%) of Americans want the agency abolished, according to a YouGov survey last month.\n\nThe post Former SportsCenter Host Tells Anti-ICE Musicians to ‘Shut Up’ Because ‘You Don’t Know What You’re Talking About’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny will perform during the halftime show at Super Bowl LX on Sunday afternoon in Santa Clara.",
    "fullText": "NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, despite significant criticism from plenty in Washington, is all for Bad Bunny’s halftime show this week at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGoodell was asked directly about Bad Bunny on Monday when he met with reporters ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium, and said plainly that he believes the Puerto Rican superstar will be able to “unite people” in the way that Super Bowl halftime performers of the past have.\n\n“Listen, Bad Bunny is, and I think that was demonstrated last night [at the Grammys], one of the great artists in the world. That’s one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said.\n\n“But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that. I think artists in the past have done that, I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.”\n\nRoger Goodell is asked whether or not there will be any ICE enforcement operations at the Super Bowl and also addresses Bad Bunny's remarks about ICE at last night's Grammy Awards. pic.twitter.com/FxGcbiIbZP\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny was the top global artist on Spotify for the fourth time in his career last year, and he won two Grammy awards on Sunday night, including Album of the Year, for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.”\n\nQuickly after Bad Bunny was announced as the Super Bowl halftime show, plenty in President Donald Trump’s administration criticized the decision. Trump said he had “never heard of him,” and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson (R-La.) called it a “terrible decision” in October. Johnson, however, then suggested that 83-year-old Lee Greenwood, famous for “God Bless the USA” do the show instead.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would be “all over” the Super Bowl.\n\n“They suck, and we’ll win,” Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson about her message to the NFL, via ESPN. “They won’t be able to sleep at night because they don’t know what they believe. And they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”\n\nBad Bunny has been extremely outspoken about Trump and ICE. He mocked Trump in his “NEVAYoL” music video, where he had a Trump-like voice apologizing to immigrants, and he even declined to hold any concerts on his current world tour in the United States because “f***ing ICE could be outside [the concert].” He called out ICE after winning a Grammy award during an acceptance speech on Sunday night, too.\n\n“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans ... The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that’s more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.”\n\nBad Bunny says \"ICE OUT\" at the #Grammys and receives a massive standing ovation:\n\n\"We are not savage, we are not animals, we are not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.… pic.twitter.com/IFzvguqdCR\n\n— Variety (@Variety) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny is Puerto Rican, which makes him an American citizen.\n\nThe Bay Area Host Committee told local officials on Monday that there are no planned ICE operations for Super Bowl LX, according to The Athletic. Goodell was asked about that directly on Monday, but he sidestepped the ICE of it all. Security preparations, he said, are moving forward as normal.\n\n“Security is obviously one of the things we focus on the most,” Goodell said. “It’s a tier one level event that involves unique assets at the federal level, the state level and the local level all working together. I see no change in that in the preparations for the Super Bowl … The federal government is a big part of that, including this administration and every other administration before that.”",

    "description": "Despite having record-breaking careers, artists like Kendrick Lamar,  Lady Gaga, Drake, and Madonna have never won the Grammy for album of the year.",
    "fullText": "Save for his debut, all of Kendrick Lamar's studio albums have been contenders for the biggest Grammy Award: \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" \"Damn,\" \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers,\" and most recently, \"GNX.\" He also received nominations as a featured artist on Beyoncé's \"Lemonade\" and as the curator and lead performer on the \"Black Panther\" soundtrack.\n\nHe has won best rap album several times, record of the year, and song of the year — not to mention a Pulitzer Prize — but never album of the year.\n\nLady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" won best pop vocal album at the 2026 Grammys, but lost the top prize to Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" She had previously been nominated in the category for \"Love for Sale\" (a collaborative album with Tony Bennett), \"Born This Way,\" \"The Fame Monster,\" and \"The Fame.\"\n\nMariah Carey has been named Billboard's top-selling female artist of all time. As of writing, she boasts 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, the most of any solo artist, and is the only person to top the chart in four separate decades.\n\nYet Carey has lost all three of her bids for album of the year. She received her first nomination in 1991 for her self-titled LP but lost to Quincy Jones.\n\nShe was later nominated for \"Daydream\" in 1996 and \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" in 2006, but lost to Alanis Morissette and U2, respectively.\n\nJust two albums in Drake's record-breaking catalog have been up for album of the year: \"Views\" in 2017 and \"Scorpion\" in 2019. They lost to \"25\" by Adele and \"Golden Hour\" by Kacey Musgraves, respectively.\n\nAlthough Drake has criticized the ceremony's relevance — both onstage and on social media — he resumed submitting his music for consideration with the 2022 album \"Her Loss,\" which received four nods, but only in rap categories.\n\n\"4:44\" is the only album in Jay-Z's legendary discography that has been up for album of the year. He lost that bid to Bruno Mars.\n\nHowever, Jay-Z has also been nominated for his work on other people's albums, including Lil Wayne's \"Tha Carter III,\" Lamar's \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City,\" Ye's \"Donda,\" and three albums by his wife, Beyoncé, finally winning for \"Cowboy Carter.\"\n\nIn 2024, Jay-Z openly criticized the Recording Academy during his acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.\n\nRihanna has largely pivoted to business ventures in the last decade, but for several years, she was a hit-making machine.\n\nDuring Rihanna's reign over the charts, only \"Loud\" was nominated for album of the year.\n\nHer eighth and most acclaimed album to date, \"Anti,\" wasn't up for the award despite collecting six other nominations in 2017, including best urban contemporary album.\n\nJanet Jackson's first set of Grammy nominations came in 1987, including an album of the year nod for \"Control.\" It lost to Paul Simon's \"Graceland.\"\n\nNone of Jackson's solo albums have been nominated since, though she did receive a nod as a producer and featured artist on her brother's \"HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I.\" That year, Alanis Morissette won for \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nBjörk has only received nods in genre-specific categories — most recently best alternative music album for \"Fossora\" in 2023 — but has lost all 16 of her nominations.\n\nEminem received his first nod for album of the year in 2001 for \"The Marshall Mathers LP,\" but lost to \"Two Against Nature\" by Steely Dan.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, in 2003 for \"The Eminem Show\" and in 2011 for \"Recovery,\" but lost to Norah Jones and Arcade Fire, respectively.\n\nBruce Springsteen is one of the biggest winners in Grammy history with 20 awards, but he has still never won album of the year.\n\nThe Boss has been nominated just twice: in 1985 for \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and in 2003 for \"Rising.\" (Shockingly, he got no love for \"Born to Run\" or \"Nebraska.\")\n\nLauryn Hill took home the biggest Grammy Award in 1999 for \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\" becoming the first hip-hop artist to do so.\n\nMany of Madonna's groundbreaking albums, including \"Like a Prayer,\" \"Erotica,\" and \"Confessions on a Dance Floor,\" never received a nod for album of the year — or, for that matter, a nod in any of the high-profile general-field categories.\n\nNirvana received just five Grammy nominations during Kurt Cobain's lifetime, and none were in the \"Big Four\" categories.\n\nThe groundbreaking band won just one award: best alternative music performance for \"MTV Unplugged in New York,\" bestowed nearly one year after Cobain's death.\n\nIncredibly, Prince lost both of his bids for album of the year. \"Purple Rain\" was bested by Lionel Richie's \"Can't Slow Down\" in 1985, while \"Sign o' the Times\" lost to U2's \"The Joshua Tree\" in 1988.\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Let's Dance\" lost to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" in 1984.\n\nMany of Bowie's most inventive and beloved albums, including \"Hunky Dory,\" \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,\" and \"Station to Station,\" didn't get any Grammy nominations at all.\n\nMarvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" has been hailed as the best album of all time, but it didn't get a chance to compete for album of the year.\n\nGaye only won two Grammys in his lifetime — best R&B vocal performance and best R&B instrumental performance for \"Sexual Healing\" in 1983 — but was never nominated in a major category. He was posthumously given the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Pink Floyd's seminal concept record lost to Christopher Cross, who swept the \"Big Four\" categories in 1981 with his self-titled album.\n\nCross became the only artist in Grammys history to win all four general-field awards on the same night and remained the only artist to do so for nearly four decades until Billie Eilish joined the ranks in 2020. He never won another.\n\nMeanwhile, Pink Floyd never received another nomination for album of the year. The band only took home one award for best rock instrumental performance.\n\nOnly one album by the top-selling British band has ever been up for album of the year: \"Some Girls\" in 1979. It was their first-ever Grammy nomination, and they have yet to compete for the top prize again.\n\nIn fact, The Rolling Stones have only won four Grammys to date — including best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds\" in 2025 — and none in a major category.\n\nElton John received his first nod for album of the year in 1971 for his self-titled LP, but lost to Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\"\n\nHe has been nominated two more times, for \"Caribou\" in 1975 and \"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\" in 1976, but lost to Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon, respectively.\n\nBefore her death in 2018, Aretha Franklin, the renowned \"Queen of Soul,\" won 18 Grammys out of 44 nominations.\n\nFranklin was also honored with the Recording Academy's Grammy Legend Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award, and the MusiCares Person of the Year award in 1991, 1994, and 2008, respectively. Five of her songs, including her beloved cover of Otis Redding's \"Respect,\" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nDespite these accolades, Franklin never received a nomination in a general-field category like album, record, or song of the year. She received just two nominations for best R&B album for \"A Rose Is Still A Rose\" and \"So Damn Happy,\" but lost both.\n\nElvis Presley only won three Grammy Awards: best sacred performance for \"How Great Thou Art,\" best inspirational performance for \"He Touched Me,\" and best inspirational performance (non-classical) for \"How Great Thou Art.\"\n\nPresley was nominated for record of the year twice (for \"A Fool Such As I\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\"), but never for song or album of the year.",

    "fullText": "Celebrations didn't stop after the 2026 Grammys concluded on Sunday night.\n\nFollowing the awards ceremony inside the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, stars like Justin Bieber, Teyana Taylor, Tate McRae, and more headed to glamorous after-parties.\n\nWhile some of them remained in their stunning red-carpet looks, others changed into statement outfits on the way there.\n\nHere's what they wore, from a leather dress and a see-through trench coat to a casual hoodie.\n\nBieber was spotted outside the W Magazine party with his friend and fellow artist Billie Eilish.\n\nHe ditched the oversize Balenciaga suit he wore at the Grammys, though. For the second half of the evening, he wore blue jeans with a teal zip-up hoodie. He seemed to have ditched the shirt underneath.\n\nEilish, who took home the song of the year Grammy for \"Wildflower,\" removed a few outer pieces of her Hodakova ensemble after the awards ceremony. What remained was her black skirt, leather belt, and oversize jacket.\n\nShe spent time with Rosé, who was nominated for three Grammys this year, at the W Magazine party. The \"APT.\" musician had changed into a sparkling, strapless dress with a bow on its neckline.\n\nWhen she arrived at the W Magazine party, Stewart was wearing dark satin pants with a chocolate-brown sweater embellished with feathers.\n\nThe look was cozy and elevated by her pointed gold heels.\n\nShe wore a long-sleeved, floor-length dress for the W Magazine event. The dress was form-fitting, covered in sparkles, and featured a matching scarf around her neck, which added to its drama.\n\nShe also wore sunglasses and carried a heart-shaped mirror bedazzled with jewels.\n\nShe was photographed at the W Magazine party wearing a sleeveless, figure-hugging gown.\n\nIt had a structured bodice of black lace and a silky, floor-length skirt that wrapped into a knot around her waist.\n\nLovato let the dress do all the talking, adding no accessories.\n\nThe \"Sports Car\" singer was photographed wearing black latex at the W Magazine party.\n\nHer sleeveless dress hugged her body, reached her ankles, and had a deep sweetheart neckline. She wore it sans accessories and styled her hair in loose waves.\n\nMcRae was nominated for her first Grammy this year in the best dance pop recording category.\n\nThe \"KPop Demon Hunters\" group won their first Grammy — the best song written for visual media award — on Sunday night.\n\nThey also hit the W Magazine after-party, where each member wore a unique outfit that reflected their individual style.\n\nAudrey Nuna donned a puffy gray suit, Ejae wore a seafoam-green gown covered in sequins, and Rei Ami sported a corseted red-and-lilac gown.\n\nBalvin, who was nominated for the best música urbana album Grammy this year, attended Universal Music Group's after-party in a classic black tuxedo.\n\nOne standout accessory, though, made all the difference. Atop his tie, the musician wore a necklace that appeared to be crafted from diamonds and various gemstones.\n\nThe \"Heated Rivalry\" stars weren't at the Grammy Awards, but they did stop by the star-studded after-party.\n\nFrançois Arnaud did so in black trousers, a see-through blouse, and a leather jacket, while Connor Storrie stood beside him in a gray plaid suit and a mustard-yellow tank top.\n\nThe best new artist nominee arrived at the W Magazine party in a leather suit that comprised skinny trousers and a cropped jacket. The latter had crystal buttons and a unique wave shape.\n\nBeneath his jacket, Sombr wore a lace shirt with long sleeves and a high neckline. It was the perfect outfit to complement the sparkling Valentino suit he wore earlier in the evening.",

    "fullText": "If Trevor Noah really wanted a response from Donald Trump on his mocking question of “What are you going to do about it?” during the Grammys on Sunday night, the former Apprentice host just gave it to him, maybe.\n\nAs he has with so many critics, those who poke fun at him and almost anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump is threatening to take Noah to court.\n\nTrevor Noah Takes Shots At Nicki Minaj, Donald Trump’s Epstein Association & More During Grammys Show\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nAlex Warren Shares What He Heard During Grammy Audio Glitch: \"This Would Only Happen To Me\"\n\n“It looks like I’ll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty,” the notoriously thin-skinned Trump posted online Sunday, not long after the Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny dominated the 68th annual Grammy Awards on CBS. “Ask Little George Slopadopolus, and others, how that all worked out. Also ask CBS! Get ready Noah, I’m going to have some fun with you!”\n\nProving that he loves to watch and loves to remind everyone who has already kissed the ring and written the checks, POTUS’ long, enraged and uppercase-strewn post on his Truth Social platform denounced the music industry’s big night and Noah’s last turn as Grammy host. No surprise, it was all because of a bipartisan crack by the ex-Daily Show host about that past presidential pal and deceased pedophile Epstein — as you can see here:\n\nTrevor Noah takes another jab at Donald Trump #Grammys: “Song of the Year — that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein’s island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton” pic.twitter.com/quUWEpX4NL\n\n— Deadline (@DEADLINE) February 2, 2026\n\nGenerating a roar from the music crowd over his swipe at Trump, Noah’s quip of “what are you going to do about it?” was born out of the reality that 2026 is going to be his final time hosting the Grammys after several years fronting the shindig.\n\nTrump didn’t give a toss about any of that.\n\n“Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island,” Trump digitally raged. “WRONG!!! I can’t speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight’s false and defamatory statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”\n\nThe remarks by Noah and the reaction by Trump comes just a couple of days after the MAGA Overlord’s Department of Justice dumped millions of redacted pages and hundreds of thousands of black-barred images from the long-delayed and much-anticipated Epstein Files. Still, with speculation that there is much more not out there despite congressional demands, Trump’s name comes up various times in what was released on January 30, including some pretty horrific allegations and new details. Among those also mentioned are L.A. Olympics boss Casey Wasserman, Elon Musk, ex-POTUS Clinton, Melania docu director Brett Ratner, Bill Gates (and some “Russian girl”), Jay-Z, the now-former Prince Andrew of Windsor, Harvey Weinstein, and of course Epstein’s right-hand lady and current federal convict Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile admitting he knew Epstein back in the roaring ’80s and ’90s, Trump always has denied he got up to anything inappropriate with or via him. As accusations against the one-time openly philandering Trump have been made by alleged Epstein victims and others (as well as cringy video of Trump and Epstein and correspondence between the two), little has made it to the courts connecting him to the horrors of sex trafficking and more.\n\nSuspicion of how deep Trump really went with Epstein, who died in 2019 by what was termed suicide in police custody has become a benchmark for Democrats and others – even when the likes of Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers have also been caught in the ugly web. The massive files release of January 30 even found Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche having to insist more than once the DOJ wasn’t and hadn’t been covering up for POTUS — to almost no avail.\n\nHaving started on CBS when Trump hero Richard Nixon was in the White House in 1973, tonight was the last time the Grammys will be seen on the now David Ellison-owned network.\n\nStarting in 2027, the ceremony will be broadcast on ABC as part of the Grammys’ 10-year deal with Disney, which was announced last year. As the Oscars leave ABC for YouTube in 2029, the Grammys will air on ABC, Hulu and Disney+ from next year all the way to 2036 – when a then 90-year-old Trump will almost certainly not be president, maybe.\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "description": "While many stars walked the 2026 Grammys red carpet in eye-catching looks, others, like Heidi Klum and Shaboozey, missed the mark with their outfits.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are always full of head-turning moments, from A-list performances to jaw-dropping red carpet looks.\n\nThe 2026 Grammys, held at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday, were no exception, particularly when it came to the fashion that celebrities wore.\n\nThe best-dressed stars included nominees Olivia Dean and Sabrina Carpenter, but others wore outfits that fell flat.\n\nTake a look at the outfits that missed the mark at the 2026 Grammys.\n\nNominated for best dance pop recording for \"Midnight Sun,\" Larsson walked the red carpet in a custom Kevin Germanier set in bright yellow. The bikini-style top had one strap that crossed her chest, while the low-waisted skirt flowed to the floor and had a subtle train.\n\nThe set had a beautiful silhouette and color, but it worked better when she wore it to perform at the Grammys premiere ceremony with an additional waistpiece. Without the accessory, it just felt like it was missing something.\n\nA full dress instead of a two-piece set could have felt more elevated for the red carpet.\n\nRosé made her Grammys debut in a black minidress custom-designed by Giambattista Valli Couture. The strapless look had white draping that hugged her hips and flowed out into two trains that flanked her sides.\n\nThe dress was dramatic and striking, but Rosé's accessories didn't live up to the gown's hype. She wore black sheer tights, black heels from Le Silla, minimal jewelry, and a blond bob. If she had chosen more dramatic styling, the look would have been stronger.\n\nThe Blackpink star was nominated for song of the year, record of the year, and best pop duo/group performance for \"APT\" with Bruno Mars.\n\nKlum's latex dress hugged her figure, literally, with the dress showing the outline of her entire body. The strapless neckline and midi-length hem looked ripped, and she paired the dress with coordinating pumps.\n\nOverall, the outfit felt more like a costume than a high-fashion moment. A different fabric might have made the dress' deconstructed look feel more intentional.\n\nThe musician arrived in a houndstooth suit that featured shades of tan, brown, blue, orange, yellow, burgundy, and more. There were too many colors to appreciate the pattern and his matching tie.\n\nFoxx also wore a large top hat with a wide, circular brim. His suit and statement accessory felt like they were fighting to be the focus of his look.\n\nShe attended the 2026 Grammys in puffy trousers, a cropped leather jacket, a white blouse, and oversize brooches. Celine designed her look.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a bit too sharp and serious for the music celebration. It would have worked better at a fashion-focused event.\n\nThe musician donned a custom Andrew Kwon design. It had velvet straps, a cutout across the chest, and a floor-length skirt that extended into a short train.\n\nBecause her dress was so plain, it would have been nice to see Beer add some flashy diamond accessories and maybe wear her hair in a sleek updo.\n\nEilish, who was nominated for record and song of the year, wore a sustainable look designed by Hodakova.\n\nIt consisted of a black jacket and skirt with belt details. Eilish also wore a white blouse under the jacket and another around her shoulders. Calf-high white socks, black heels, a black purse, and an \"ICE Out\" pin completed the bold outfit.\n\nStill, because so much of the outfit was black, it was difficult to see the individual pieces. The look might have stood out more if the jacket and skirt had been styled differently.\n\nShe wore a Caroline's Couture design, which was strapless with a bedazzled print, a sweetheart neckline, and a full skirt. The latter was shorter in the front and longer in the back.\n\nThough it was pretty, the gown looked like a 2016 style. Teigen might have benefited from wearing a more modern look.\n\nBalenciaga designed her strapless, floor-length dress. It included a simple corset top, a skirt covered in long feathers, and elbow-length leather gloves.\n\nIts oversize design overwhelmed McRae, and its dark coloring was too harsh for her youthful style.\n\nThey each wore Louis Vuitton designs made from the same black satin fabric and crystal straps.\n\nTheir looks worked individually, but together, they blended too closely. The same outfits in different colors might have added a more unique touch to their overall look.\n\nShe hit the red carpet in a white Atelier Biser ensemble. It had off-the-shoulder sleeves, a long train, and all-over feathers.\n\nFrom the shoulders up, Kesha looked stunning. However, her gown's fabric was so thick that the dress ended up wearing her.",

    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are music's biggest night. This year, they were also a night when music's biggest stars made pointed political statements.\n\nAs President Trump's immigration crackdown rages on amid nationwide protests, musicians used their time on the Grammys stage to make their feelings known.\n\nThe biggest moment of the night came when Bad Bunny dedicated his album of the year award for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" — the first all-Spanish album in history to triumph in the prestigious category — to \"all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, he used another speech to directly criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ICE out,\" the Puerto Rican singer said while accepting the award for best música urbana album.\n\nThe chart-topping superstar, who's also set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show next week, continued his speech by emphasizing the humanity of his fellow Latinos and Puerto Ricans.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\n\"The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love,\" he added.\n\nDuring an in-audience bit with Grammys host Trevor Noah, Bad Bunny clarified that Puerto Ricans are Americans.\n\n\"If things keep getting bad here in America, can I come live with you in Puerto Rico?\" Noah joked.\n\n\"Trevor, I have news for you,\" Bad Bunny replied. \"Puerto Rico is part of America.\"\n\nBad Bunny previously told i-D magazine that he decided to skip the mainland on his latest tour because he didn't want ICE agents waiting outside his concerts.\n\n\"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US. But specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an unincorporated territory of the US… People from the US could come here to see the show. Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world. But there was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nOther winners echoed Bad Bunny's message at the ceremony on Sunday, including London native and \"Nice to Each Other\" singer Olivia Dean, who spoke about her immigrant roots while accepting the award for best new artist.\n\n\"I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant,\" Dean said. \"I'm a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated.\"\n\nLater in the evening, Billie Eilish followed suit when she accepted song of the year for \"Wildflower,\" a ballad from her latest album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft.\"\n\n\"No one is illegal on stolen land,\" Eilish said onstage.\n\n\"It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,\" she added. \"I feel like we just need to keep fighting and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people do matter.\"\n\nEven more Grammy attendees wore \"ICE out\" pins to the ceremony, including Eilish, her brother and producer Finneas O'Connell, Carole King, Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, and Kehlani, who won best R&B performance during the Grammys premiere ceremony.\n\n\"I really wanted to say fuck ICE,\" Kehlani told The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet. \"We're too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of statement in our country. It's brainless to me.\"",

    "description": "The 68th Grammy Awards took place on Sunday. Artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga delivered standout performances, while others fell flat.",
    "fullText": "The 68th annual Grammy Awards yielded plenty of headline-worthy moments, including political statements from stars like Bad Bunny and Olivia Dean, heartfelt tributes to icons like D'Angelo and Ozzy Osbourne, and big wins for Grammy darlings like Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nStill, the vast majority of Sunday's ceremony was dominated by live performances. Several entertainers outshone their peers with showy concepts or scene-stealing vocals, while others proved less than impressive.\n\nKeep reading for a rundown of the best and worst performances.\n\n\"Apt.\" has been inescapable for over a year, dominating Billboard's global 2025 charts, so it runs the risk of sounding stale in 2026. Thankfully, Rosé and Bruno Mars breathed new life into their duet on the Grammys stage, delivering a rock-infused rendition to open the ceremony with a bang.\n\nSabrina Carpenter loves giving her live performances a theme, whether it's descending from the heavens and kissing aliens at the VMAs in 2024, donning a black belt and hitting karate-inspired choreography on \"Saturday Night Live\" last year, or cosplaying as a baggage handler at the Grammys on Sunday.\n\nThe specific role she inhabits hardly matters, because Carpenter always sells it. The song she performed, \"Manchild,\" makes no reference to planes or airports, but as usual, she committed to the bit — with a smile on her face, a spring in her step, and pitch-perfect vocals.\n\nAddison Rae did not have the strongest vocals among the Grammy performers, but vibrato and falsetto are not what have made her a star. Her debut album, \"Addison,\" earned just as much attention for its hypnotic pop music as for Rae's savvy rollout, which featured eye-catching visuals (watch the music video for \"Aquamarine,\" you won't be disappointed) and a flair for theatrics.\n\nRae is a born performer, and she proved exactly that on Sunday by hanging off the back of a truck, wearing a sparkly purple trenchcoat, and singing \"Fame Is a Gun.\" Camp!\n\nFor many pop music lovers, Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" was the highlight of 2025. As such, many fans were desperate to see Gaga's weirdness and wonder showcased at the Grammys.\n\nThose fans had their wish granted. Not only did Gaga win a handful of awards, including best pop vocal album and best dance pop recording for \"Abracadabra,\" but she also gave the standout performance of the night.\n\nTyler, the Creator didn't give a predictable or static performance like many of his fellow nominees. Instead, he blended \"Thought I Was Dead\" from album of the year hopeful \"Chromakopia\" with \"Sugar on My Tongue\" from its follow-up album \"Don't Tap the Glass\" into one dynamic production, complete with elaborate set pieces and a surprise cameo from Regina King.\n\nBest new artist nominee Alex Warren seemed to suffer from playback issues when he took the stage on Sunday, but even perfect execution wouldn't have improved his performance much.\n\nWarren sang last summer's big hit \"Ordinary,\" just as he did on the \"Love Is Blind\" season eight reunion, and then again on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" and then at the 2025 American Music Awards, and then again at the 2025 VMAs… you get the picture. The ballad was already boring and dry upon release. Now, there's truly no juice left to squeeze from it.\n\nLola Young is fresh, fun, and, yes, messy — that's what makes her an interesting artist on the rise. Unfortunately, her debut Grammys performance was traditional, slow, and snoozy.\n\nIt makes sense that Young would want to showcase her vocal prowess on music's biggest night, but by transforming her now-Grammy-winning hit \"Messy\" into a piano ballad, she stripped it of the quirks that helped it go viral in the first place.\n\nNot long after delivering a Grammys highlight, Mars returned to the stage for a paint-by-numbers performance of his newest No. 1 hit, \"I Just Might,\" which lacked the novelty and energy of his duet with Rosé.",
