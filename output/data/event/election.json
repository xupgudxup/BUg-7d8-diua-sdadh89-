    "fullText": "The Netherlands’ House of Representatives advanced a legislative proposal on Thursday to introduce a 36% capital gains tax on savings and most liquid investments, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe legislation reached the 75-vote threshold required to advance, with 93 lawmakers voting in favor of it, according to the House tally.\n\nUnder the proposal, savings accounts, cryptocurrencies, most equity investments and gains made from interest-bearing financial instruments are subject to the tax, whether or not the assets are sold.\n\nCritics say the bill will drive capital out of the Netherlands and into jurisdictions with more favorable tax laws, as investors seek a flight to safety from confiscatory taxation.\n\nThe Dutch Senate must also pass the bill before it is signed into law, which will take effect in the 2028 tax year, if it is passed, but many investors in the crypto community are already sounding the alarm and predicting capital flight from the country.\n\nInvestors say the tax is out of touch and will backfire\n\n“France did this in 1997 and saw a massive exodus of entrepreneurs leaving the country,” Denis Payre, co-founder of logistics company Kiala said.\n\nCrypto market analyst Michaël van de Poppe said the proposal is “the dumbest thing I've seen in a long time.”\n\n“The number of people willing to flee the country is going to be bananas,” he added, echoing the calls of other industry analysts and executives.\n\nAn investor starting with 10,000 euros ($11,871) who contributes 1,000 euros per month over 40 years would end up with about 3,320,000 euros by the end of the 40 years, according to Investing Visuals.\n\nHowever, the new 36% tax reduces the total amount after 40 years to about 1,885,000 euros, a difference of 1,435,000 euros, Investing Visuals said.\n\nCrypto industry and tech executives in the United States voiced similar concerns about California’s proposed wealth tax on billionaires.\n\nThe proposal outlined a 5% tax on an individual’s net worth above the $1 billion threshold, igniting a torrent of backlash and tech entrepreneurs announcing that they were leaving the state of California.\n\nMagazine: Best and worst countries for crypto taxes — plus crypto tax tips",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump dropped a new riff on his election lies by telling troops that he won the popular vote in 2016 “by a lot” — thereby inventing millions of votes he did not win.\n\nTrump has spent years falsely claiming that the 2020 election was “rigged” against him and/or “stolen” from him, despite the fact that Biden defeated Trump in an electoral landslide that has been reaffirmed over and over by state officials from Trump’s own party and dozens of court decisions.\n\nBut he won the 2016 election despite losing the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.\n\nThe president departed the White House Friday afternoon en route to Fort Bragg ahead of a long weekend at his Mar-a-lago resort. In Texas, he gave a speech to military families that included many familiar touches — and one new one.\n\nDuring an introduction, Trump flatly declared that he won the popular vote “by a lot” — and without the qualifiers he has used in the past:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And he was responsible, along with Laura Trump. Laura is fantastic. Born here and loves the area, but they work together.\n\nBut Michael Watley, if he’s here, I don’t know. Michael, Michael. Michael, will you come here for a second, please? He’s running for the Senate. And if he gets in, you’re going to be taken care of.\n\nIf he doesn’t get in, we’re going to be stripping the military like they always do, the Democrats. This is a man who was the head of North Carolina. And so he did so well that I said. Who was that guy that did so well?\n\nBecause when it came time to picking the head of the Republican Party, I picked him. And you saw what happened in the last election. We won at a landslide. We won every swing state, all seven swing states.\n\nWe won by millions of votes, the popular vote.\n\nYou know, the first time I won, but they say I didn’t win the popular vote, you know I did. I won it by a lot, but they said I didn’t.\n\nSo every time they’d introduce “Donald Trump, who didn’t won the popular vote,” but he, you know, whatever.\n\nThis — I was always — I said, I don’t ever want that to happen again. But we did. We won everything.\n\nAnd this is a man that was in charge of this state. He did so well here. There was nobody else that I even considered to run the RNC. That’s the whole country.\n\nAnd we had a big, big victory just recently that you know very well — a victory like they’ve never seen. So I’d just like you to say a couple of words, Michael. Congratulations.\n\nThe post Trump Drops Brand-New Election Whopper In Riff To Troops — Invents Millions of Votes He Never Got first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a bill requiring proof of U.S. citizenship in the November midterm",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a bill requiring proof of U.S. citizenship in the November midterm elections, which Democrats denounced as a ploy to hurt their chances in a contest that will determine control of Congress.\n\nThe SAVE America Act ‌is the latest version of legislation that first emerged during the 2024 presidential campaign, driven by President Donald Trump's false claims that large numbers of people in the country ‌illegally have been voting in federal elections.\n\nA similar measure passed the House twice - last April and in 2024 - with support from a handful of Democrats. But it died in the Senate.\n\nThe House vote on the bill comes barely ​a week after Trump called for Republicans to \"take over\" elections in more than a dozen locations. The bill would require proof of citizenship when registering to vote in the midterms and would impose criminal penalties on election officials who register anyone without the required documentation.\n\nRepublicans have also added a photo ID requirement for subsequent federal elections for people casting ballots at the polls or via mail-in ballots. They cite polls including a Pew Research Center survey showing that 83% of voters, including 71% of Democrats, back photo ID for voters.\n\nREPUBLICANS WORRIED OVER SPECIAL ELECTION LOSSES\n\nDemocratic Party leaders say the legislation ‌attempts to suppress the vote and undermine their electoral chances at ⁠a time when they are favored by independent analysts to take control of the House. Republicans have been jarred by a string of Democratic special election wins, including one for the Texas state Senate viewed as a wake-up call.\n\n\"Republicans are trying to lay the ground to undermine midterm elections ⁠that I think they feel concerned about losing on the merits,\" said Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who likened the citizenship requirement to the poll taxes once used in Southern U.S. states to dissuade voting by Blacks and poor Whites.\n\nIf passed by the House, the bill would face long odds in the Republican-led Senate, where it would need Democratic support to meet a 60-vote margin for passage. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer ​has ​denounced it as \"Jim Crow 2.0.\"\n\nIt is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Independent groups on ​the left and the right, as well as state election officials, have ‌found such voting to be extremely rare.\n\nThe left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law has warned that the SAVE America Act could deny the vote to millions of U.S. citizens who lack ready access to passports, birth certificates and other documents that prove their citizenship.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise described the citizenship requirement as a \"real common sense\" standard to protect Americans.\n\n\"Everybody understands what that means,\" Scalise told reporters on Tuesday. \"If someone is stealing your vote, then they're nullifying your vote.\"\n\nDemocracy advocates say the legislation is also part of a larger struggle between the Trump administration and state governments that has included the withholding of federal funds, the deployment of National Guard troops and the FBI search of a county election office in Georgia.\n\n\"We have ‌checks and balances in place that include state and local officials acting as a check against federal ​overreach,\" said Mai Ratakonda, program director of election protection at States United Democracy Center, a nonpartisan group that works ​to safeguard free and fair elections. \"That's what the federal government is trying to undermine.\"\n\nRepublican ​leaders say the legislation is necessary to revive public confidence in the election system and accuse Democrats of opposing it because they want non-citizens who ‌entered into the United States under President Joe Biden to vote illegally.\n\n\"There's ​only one logical reason the Democrats are opposing ​this. They want people to participate in elections who are not supposed to. That's what the wide-open border was about,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats say any decline in electoral confidence has resulted from Trump's repeated false claims about non-citizen voting and a stolen 2020 election.\n\n\"Republicans have created distrust in the elections by making claims ​of non-existent fraud,\" U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told ‌ABC News in a recent interview. He described the SAVE America Act as a \"voter suppression\" law.\n\nRepublicans are also readying a second, broader election bill, called the Make ​Elections Great Again Act, which would mandate the use of paper ballots, restrict mail-in ballots and prohibit ranked-choice voting in federal general elections. It was examined ​at a hearing before the House Administration Committee on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against a House GOP-drafted bill to require people to show documented proof of citizenship before registering to vote and to show ID to cast a ballot, a top priority of the Trump administration.\n\nMurkowski, a prominent centrist Republican, said the Constitution empowers states to manage federal elections for Senate and the House seats, and warned that imposing sweeping federal requirements on local election officials a few months before Election Day would threaten the integrity of the midterm elections.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed. Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that,” Murkowski wrote in a statement posted to social media.\n\n“Once again, I do not support these efforts,” she announced.\n\nShe said the Constitution “clearly” provides states with the authority to regulate the time, place and manner of holding federal elections.\n\nShe argued that “one-size-fits-all” mandates from Washington seldom work in her home state.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said.\n\n“Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this,” Murkowski added.\n\nThe House is expected to pass the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act — or the SAVE America Act — on Wednesday. It has passed a similar version of the legislation, previously known as the SAVE Act, multiple times in the past few years.\n\nMurkowski’s statement comes as Senate conservatives led by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) are pressing Senate GOP leaders to reinterpret the Senate’s filibuster rule to make it easier to pass the law.\n\nLee made a presentation to the Senate GOP conference Tuesday afternoon arguing that Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) should require Democrats actively hold the floor with round-the-clock speeches if they want to block the elections bill.\n\nThune, however, is leery of deploying that strategy, because it could tie up the Senate floor for weeks.\n\nAnd Democrats, if they regain control of Congress and the White House, could also require Republicans to engage in continuous floor debate to block Democratic legislative priorities.\n\nThe SAVE America Act would also require states to conduct reviews of voting rolls to purge inactive voters, something critics say would prevent some infrequent voters from participating due to possibly faulty data.\n\nSenate Democrats have lambasted the SAVE America Act as legislation that would make it tougher for minority and low-income voters to participate in elections.\n\n“Let’s be clear, the SAVE Act is not about securing our elections. It is about suppressing voters. The SAVE Act seeks to disenfranchise millions of American citizens, seize control of our elections, and fan the flames of election skepticism and denialism,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, vowing Democrats will block the legislation.",

    "fullText": "Speaker Mike Johnson failed to reinstate a ban on lawmakers’ ability to challenge President Donald Trump’s tariffs when three Republicans crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.\n\nThe House sank a procedural vote on Tuesday that contained language blocking votes in the chamber that object to Trump’s tariffs through July. The move opens the door for Democrats to move forward with forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs, in a blow to the administration.\n\nWith razor-thin margins in the House, three Republicans – GOP Reps. Thomas Massie, Don Bacon and Kevin Kiley – were enough to sink the vote. Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote to advance legislation with his current margin.\n\nThe Senate has passed at least three resolutions rebuking Trump’s tariffs, but routinely ran into resistance in the House where members were blocked from forcing votes on the matter.\n\nBacon said in a statement posted to X, “I don’t like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs.”\n\nThe Nebraska congressman went on to say, “tariffs have been a ‘net negative’ for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying. Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch. It’s time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility.”\n\nGOP leaders had argued that lawmakers should allow the Supreme Court time to weigh in.\n\nSpeaker Johnson acknowledged the challenges he faces holding together his razor-thin majority after the failed vote.\n\n“Look, this is life with a small majority. I mean, you know, I need unanimity every day, and we didn’t get it tonight,” he told reporters.\n\n“The vast majority of the House Republicans agree wholeheartedly with the president, and we’re going to give him the latitude to continue his trade policy,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Moderate House Republicans worried about this year’s midterm elections appear ready to finally break with President Donald Trump over his signature economic policy.\n\nIn a bid to protect Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly introduced procedural rules banning members from bringing up resolutions challenging the president’s crushing tariffs on products from dozens of U.S. trading partners.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson planned to ask the House to extend the ban through August. But this time, key Republicans signaled they would likely vote against the measure, Punchbowl reported.\n\n“American consumers pay the tariffs and thus it is a big tax,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told the outlet. “I support giving these authorities back to Congress.”\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley of California also told Punchbowl that he had “made it clear” he was not in favor of extending the blockade.\n\nWith full attendance, two Republican defectors would be enough to sink Johnson’s proposed extension, opening the door to a flood of Democratic resolutions challenging the increasingly unpopular tariffs.\n\nThe vote is likely to be close, as some Republicans are still holding out hope the Supreme Court will strike down the tariffs, easing voters’ concerns while sparing them a confrontation with the president, according to Punchbowl.\n\nThe duties are a form of import tax paid by American companies, which must either eat the additional costs or pass them along to consumers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the bulk of the costs fall on foreign producers and middlemen, when in fact Americans “pay one way or the other—via higher prices or less choice,” the opinion editors of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal wrote last week.\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro acknowledged in December that U.S. manufacturing was down thanks to the tariffs, which have also contributed to higher prices and led to intense trade volatility.\n\nTariffs were also at the center of an international scandal last month after the president threatened to impose duties on products from countries that opposed his efforts to seize Greenland, an autonomous region of a fellow NATO country, Denmark.\n\nHe ultimately dropped the threat after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte talked him down during a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIf Johnson’s procedural vote fails, Democrats are likely to force votes as early as this week on resolutions to overturn Trump’s tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, followed by resolutions aimed at tariffs on Brazilian products and products from other global trade partners.\n\nThe Canada vote in particular would be a difficult one for Republicans and would require the White House’s intervention, Johnson told Puck.\n\nWhile Trump could ultimately veto any resolution reining in his trade wars, a rebuke from Congress would nevertheless be politically damaging.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she opposes President Trump's SAVE Act, an election bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote nationwide, saying states run elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against the SAVE Act, a sweeping election bill backed by President Donald Trump that would require proof of citizenship to vote nationwide.\n\nIn doing so, she reminded her colleagues that they roundly claimed to oppose new federal election laws as recently as Joe Biden’s presidency.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed,” Murkowski said in a statement. “Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that. Once again, I do not support these efforts.”\n\n“Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the ‘times, places, and manner’ of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,” she added.\n\nUnder current law, all U.S. voters must attest under oath that they are citizens, with criminal penalties for lying. Beyond that, states can set their own rules.\n\nThe SAVE Act would bar states from registering people to vote unless they provide documents or evidence proving U.S. citizenship. It would also require all Americans to present ID when they go to vote.\n\nThe legislation, introduced by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has 48 GOP co-sponsors, and Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to pass it in recent days. Even if it gains a majority of the Senate, it is subject to the 60-vote threshold, and Democrats have vowed to block it.\n\nWhile Trump and other SAVE Act backers say it’s designed to protect election integrity, Murkowski said it would do the opposite.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said. “Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this.”\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Democrats passed the For the People Act through the House, seeking to establish an aggressive set of federal rules to bolster voting rights and ban partisan gerrymandering. A majority of senators supported a slimmed-down version, called the Freedom to Vote Act, but it died because of a Republican-led filibuster.\n\nAt the time, Senate Republicans vehemently opposed the measure, saying election rules must be left to states.\n\n“This is not a federal issue,” McConnell told reporters in January 2022 when the bill came before the Senate. “It ought to be left to the states. There’s nothing broken around the country. The system upheld very well during an intense stress during the latter part of the previous Congress. There’s no rational basis for federalizing this election, and, therefore, there’s no point in having a debate in the U.S. Senate about something we ought not do.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's call for a snap election had rattled markets and triggered a sharp selloff in Japanese government bonds.",
    "fullText": "Japan's bond market is back under scrutiny after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory pushed government bond yields higher, even as stocks surged to record highs.\n\nOn Sunday, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party secured a decisive win in the general election, giving Takaichi a clear mandate and room to pursue her fiscal agenda.\n\nThat agenda includes increased government spending on defense and social welfare, alongside tax cuts — policies markets have long debated for their impact on Japan's already heavy public debt burden.\n\nFollowing Takaichi's win, Japanese equities surged nearly 6% to record highs on optimism around fiscal support for growth.\n\nBonds, however, moved in the opposite direction. Two-year Japanese government bond yields climbed to their highest level in three decades, while benchmark 10-year yields also rose. Bond prices fall when yields rise.\n\nLonger-dated bonds sent a more mixed signal. Japan's longest-maturity debt — typically the most sensitive to concerns about fiscal sustainability — erased mostly early yield spikes. Yields on 30-year bonds were little changed on the day around midday in Japan, after surging to record highs last month.\n\nJapanese bond yields matter far beyond the country's borders because of Japan's outsize role in global capital flows. Years of ultra-low yields have allowed domestic and foreign investors to borrow cheaply and leverage bets on higher-yielding assets such as US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nThat dynamic has refocused attention on how markets are pricing Japan's fiscal and debt risks under Takaichi's leadership.\n\n\"A bigger mandate is likely to fuel concerns about the potential path of spending plans, warranting renewed weakness in JGBs and the Yen, unless the BoJ were to shift towards faster rate hikes,\" wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Saturday before the polls.\n\nThe Goldman analysts wrote that they expect volatility as markets digest the news.\n\nLast month, Takaichi's call for a snap election rattled global markets and triggered a sharp sell-off in Japanese government bonds, as investors worried her fiscal agenda could further strain public finances.\n\nAnalysts at the time warned the move could serve as a cautionary signal for other heavily indebted governments, as rising bond yields risk pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.\n\nTakaichi has since sought to reassure markets. She said she would pursue a sustainable and responsible fiscal policy and would not rely on deficit-covering sovereign bond issuance to fund a two-year suspension of the food consumption tax.\n\nJapanese government bond yields could still rise further, driven by concerns about increased government spending on areas such as defense and AI, according to Min Joo Kang, a senior economist at ING.\n\nNot all analysts agree that the postelection bond sell-off will last. Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research, excluding Japan, said Takaichi's strong election win gives her the political room to avoid messy policy trade-offs and make clearer, more sustainable decisions about government spending.\n\nHe also pointed to Japan's external balance sheet as a key buffer, arguing that domestic investors can redirect capital back into local markets.\n\n\"Japan's significant holdings of foreign assets (as the world's second largest net creditor) puts it in pole position to re-allocate back home to Japanese assets to the benefit of JPY, JGBs and equities,\" Varathan wrote.",

    "description": "Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a president repeatedly declaring inflation beaten while rarely acknowledging the strain many Americans say they still feel.\n\nIn five speeches on the economy since December, Trump asserted that inflation had been beaten or was way down almost 20 times and said prices were falling almost 30 times, assertions at odds with economic data and voters' daily experiences. Much of the remaining time was spent on grievances and other issues, including ​immigration, whether Somalia was a country, and attacks on opponents.\n\nTaken together, the speeches portray a president struggling to reconcile his central claim — that he has fixed the cost-of-living crisis — with inflation near 3% over the past year and voters’ lived experience of paying more for grocery staples. The price of ground beef, for example, ‌is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\n\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.\n\n\"He can't continue to make claims that are demonstrably ‌false, particularly at the expense of Republicans who are in competitive House districts or Senate races,\" said Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist. Trump \"must be disciplined and focused,\" he added.\n\nOne source close to the White House said the president needed to hit the issue of affordability harder and through personal visits to critical districts.\n\n\"He needs to bring the message out because the message is not resonating,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the issue.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Trump’s focus on illegal immigration in his speeches is directly connected to his argument that people in the country illegally have an adverse impact on the economy. Desai said it causes “public services being overburdened, business activity disrupted by crime, housing markets flooded, and workers’ wages depressed.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed that much work remains to clean up the economic mess he says his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, left him, Desai added.\n\nTRUMP VEERS OFF MESSAGE TO RAIL ABOUT IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Reuters analysis found that Trump - when not declaring inflation beaten - devoted nearly half his speaking time to grievances and other issues.\n\nIn about five hours of speaking time, he spent roughly two hours straying into ⁠about 20 topics unrelated to prices, the Reuters review found. When he veered off message, his top issue was illegal immigration, ‌which he spent a total of about 30 to 40 minutes talking about.\n\nIn the speeches he insulted Somali Americans in Minnesota, who voted against him in the 2024 election. He referred to Somalia as \"not even a country\" - and in four speeches he disparaged Somali-born Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nA progressive, high-profile Democrat and Muslim, Omar has been a frequent Trump critic, especially over his immigration policies.\n\n\"Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,\" Omar said last month, the ‍day after a man sprayed a foul-smelling liquid on her at a town hall event.\n\nTrump also talked about men in women's sports, Venezuela, Iran, the Islamic State militant group, Greenland, Ukraine and Russia, military recruitment, his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, U.S. weaponry, his exaggerated claim to have ended eight wars, and even how much a Fox News anchor likes him.\n\nTRUMP'S MEANDERING WORRIES STRATEGISTS\n\n\"Inflation is stopped. Incomes are up. Prices are down,\" Trump said in an Iowa speech on January 27.\n\nOnly twice in the five speeches did Trump acknowledge that prices are still too high, but he blamed them on Biden. Trump was elected in 2024 because of voter unhappiness with Biden's handling of inflation - which spiked to over 9% in 2022 - and illegal immigration.\n\nDemocrats caused prices \"to be too high,\" Trump told a rally ​in Pennsylvania on December 9. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nIn the same speech he called the term \"affordability\" a Democratic \"hoax\". After a public backlash, he has ceased saying that in more recent speeches.\n\nIn four of the speeches Trump repeatedly and haphazardly switches topics, often when he is in the middle of talking about the economy, the Reuters review found.\n\nFour Republican strategists ‌interviewed by Reuters said Trump's meandering style - which he proudly calls \"the weave\" - risked drowning out his core economic argument that he has brought inflation and prices down.\n\nSpeaking to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 21, Trump spent the first 22 minutes on topic, then suddenly, for the next 22 minutes, insulted Europeans, said they would be speaking German if it wasn’t for America, called NATO ungrateful, and decried the “crooked” media before pivoting back to the U.S. economy.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said voters want to hear what Trump is doing to lower costs. \"But they have no memory of what Trump says about economic issues because of the volume of his own rhetoric.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the White House's thinking said Trump was likely to use his State of the Union address on February 24 as the kickoff for more intense domestic travel to amplify his message on affordability.\n\nFor many Americans, the economy still feels unforgiving. Prices remain high, even though the inflation rate has inched down since Trump took office, from 3% to 2.7%. A lower inflation rate does not mean prices are decreasing - just that they are growing at a slower pace, economists stress.\n\nIn the 12 months through December 2025, food costs were up over 3%, while average hourly earnings were up only 1.1% year over year. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in December, up from 4% when Trump took office in January 2025, according to government data.\n\nIn ⁠some of the speeches Trump correctly identifies a drop in prices for a few everyday goods, including eggs and gas. The cost of eggs fell about 21% in December from a year earlier after ​being 60% higher during Trump's first months back in office. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.\n\nBut the cost of an average grocery basket has risen. The price of coffee, beef, and some fruits, ​among other items, has risen in the past year.\n\nTrump does offer solutions in his speeches, including his tax cuts that kicked in last month that will produce greater savings for tens of millions of families; the scrapping of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments; his plan to reduce mortgage interest rates; a proposal to lower housing prices; and deals with health insurance companies to reduce drug prices.\n\nMost economists expect U.S. households and the economy at large to benefit in the months ahead from the tax cuts. But Trump's more recent proposals are unlikely to have a ‍significant impact on the cost of living between now and November, some economists told Reuters. One ⁠of Trump's ideas - to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for a year - could even backfire since it could limit access to credit for lower-income families, some economists have warned.\n\nMike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates for the House of Representatives, said Trump and Republicans were helping working families. \"Voters are seeing this clear contrast, and the best is yet to come.\"\n\nSome 35% of Americans approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a January 25 Reuters/Ipsos poll, up slightly from 33% in December. But it is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office a year ago.\n\nFormer economic officials in previous administrations say Trump is falling into the same trap Biden did in 2024 when confronted with persistently high inflation.\n\nBiden kept claiming the U.S. economy was strong and urged voters to look at other economic data. That strategy failed badly and Democrats were punished at the polls.\n\nThe officials agreed it was important for presidents to show voters they understood their economic pain, especially in an election year.\n\n\"We ‌definitely talked past people on inflation,\" Jared Bernstein, the head of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.\n\n\"What we typically did was to say, 'A new report just came out on jobs, it's very strong,' and that was all true. But the fact is that there wasn't much we were ‌able to do in terms of the price level.\"",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy.\n\nThe question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.\n\nHow has the Takaichi trade impacted Japanese markets?\n\nWhy are investors concerned about Japan's debt burden?\n\nHow might Takaichi's electoral victory affect policy direction?\n\nWhat are Takaichi's key economic stimulus policies?\n\nSince she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen.\n\nVoters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996.\n\n\"The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,\" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.\n\nTakaichi, a devotee of the \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance.\n\nShe came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms.\n\n\"The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,\" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. \"Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion.\"\n\nWith polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment.\n\nBut prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food.\n\nThe yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide.",

    "fullText": "BANGKOK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Voters in Thailand came out in numbers on Sunday for a general election defined by a three-way battle between conservative, progressive and populist camps, with no single party expected to secure a clear majority and prolonging the spectre of political instability.\n\nPrime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul ​set the stage for the snap election in mid-December, amid a raging border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, in what analysts said was a move timed by the ‌conservative leader to cash in on surging nationalism.\n\nAt that point, he had been in power for less than 100 days, taking over after the ouster of premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the populist Pheu Thai party over the Cambodian crisis.\n\nPheu ‌Thai, backed by the billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself went to jail just days after his daughter's removal, is down but not out, according to surveys.\n\n\"We have done everything that we can,\" Anutin told reporters, after casting his vote in his Bhumjaithai Party's stronghold of Buriram city, northeast of Bangkok. \"We hope the people will have confidence in us.\"\n\nBut it is the progressive People's Party, with its message of structural change and reforms to Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, that led most opinion polls during the campaign season.\n\n\"This election is about whether Thailand will get out of its rut, whether Thailand ⁠will break out of its political instability and economic doldrums that ‌have persisted,\" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.\n\n\"My preliminary conclusion, I'm afraid to say, is that it will not break out.\"\n\nA steady stream of voters walked into polling stations across Bangkok in the hours after polls opened, among them Suwat Kiatsuwan, a 44-year-old company worker.\n\n\"I don't ‍want the same people anymore,\" he said, after casting his ballot. \"If we vote for the same as before, nothing will change. We were going nowhere.\"\n\nPolls closed at 5 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) and preliminary results were expected within a few hours.\n\nAlthough it has taken the fight to Anutin's Bhumjaithai Party and Pheu Thai, People's Party may not have enough support to win a parliamentary majority on its own - raising the risk ​of repeating its predecessor's fate.\n\nIn a survey conducted during the final week of the campaign that was released on Sunday, the National Institute for Development Administration projected Bhumjaithai would be ‌the winner with between 140 and 150 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, ahead of 125-135 for the People's Party.\n\nMove Forward, the forerunner of the People's Party, won the last election in 2023 only to be blocked from forming a government by a military-appointed Senate and conservative lawmakers, opening the door for Pheu Thai to take over.\n\nThis long-standing tussle between the powerful royalist-conservative establishment and popular democratic movements has created prolonged periods of uncertainty, punctuated by street protests, bouts of violence and military coups.\n\nThai voters will also be asked during the vote to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 charter, a military-backed document that critics say concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, including a powerful senate that is chosen through an indirect selection process with limited ⁠public participation.\n\nThailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, with most of the ​changes following military coups.\n\nIf voters back the drafting of a new national charter, the new government and lawmakers can ​start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.\n\n\"I believe that the party that wins in the next election will have an outsized influence on the direction of constitutional reform, whether we move away from the junta-drafted constitution or not,\" said Napon Jatusripitak of ‍the Bangkok-based Thailand Future think-tank.\n\nBhumjaithai's rise on surging ⁠nationalism unleashed by the Thai-Cambodia conflict - alongside the decline of Pheu Thai after its travails last year - has triggered a rash of defections and reshaped political battlegrounds, including vote-rich agrarian belts.\n\nSome political parties have responded by drawing into their camps well-known local figures, including those from rival groups, aiming to capture personal loyalty networks that are key to ⁠winning in the hinterland.\n\nThe reform-minded People's Party has also changed its playbook, diluting the progressive movement's anti-establishment stance and bringing in outside talent to convince voters that it has what it takes to run a government.\n\nFormer Prime Minister ‌Abhisit Vejjajiva has thrown himself into the mix, leveraging his personal appeal to revive his once moribund Democrat Party, which could emerge as a key force in ‌post-election coalition talks.\n\n(Additional reporting by Thomas Suen, Minh Nguyen and Napat Wesshasartar; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)",

    "description": "The video posted by Trump depicting the Obamas as apes is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights in the midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Black History Month, 2026 style.\n\nPresident Trump posted a video Thursday to his social media site that contains animated images depicting former President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nThe White House took down the post Friday, and after first calling it nothing more than a meme, they dubbed it a mistake by a staffer. Sure.\n\nBut while the justifiable outrage over this overt racism spins itself into a brief media circus (because we all know something else will come along in about three minutes), let's look a bit deeper into why this video is more than an affront to everything America stands for, or should stand for, anyway.\n\nIt's no accident that the images of the Obamas are embedded deep inside a video about voter fraud conspiracies from the 2020 election (which are untrue, if I need to say it again). This video is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights and voting access in the midterms.\n\n\"Absolutely, there's a connection to the vote,\" Melina Abdullah told me Friday. She's a professor at Cal State L.A. and co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.\n\n\"This is about more than just about the Obamas,\" added Brian Levin, a professor emeritus at Cal State San Bernardino and founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. \"It's about people that are [perceived as] undermining our elections and our democracy.\"\n\nI caught Levin the day after he turned in a chapter about authoritarianism for a new book, which happens to look at how discrimination and the imposition of social hierarchies ties in with power.\n\nLet me summarize. Vulnerable groups are smashed down as dangerous and not fit to be full citizens, so a smaller group of elites can justify power by any means to protect society from these lowly and nasty influences.\n\nLet me make that messaging even simpler: Black and brown people are bad and shouldn't be allowed to participate in democracy because they don't deserve the right.\n\nHow does that play out at the ballot box?\n\nAll that talk about voter identification and election integrity is really about stopping people from voting — people who legally have the right to vote. Those who are least likely to be able to obtain proof of citizenship — which might require a passport or birth certificate, along with the money and know-how to get such documents — are often Black or brown people. They are often also poor, or poorer, and therefore have less time and money to put into obtaining documents, and also live in urban areas where they share polling places.\n\nIs it such a stretch to imagine some kind of federal oversight at those types of polling places, turning away — or simply intimidating away — legal voters who have long made up a strong bloc of the Democratic base?\n\nLet's hope that never happens. But the current undermining of the legitimacy of Black and brown voters is, Levin and Abdullah said, systemic and concerning.\n\nTrump's latest video is \"part of a floodgate of bigotry and conspiracy that relates to elections and immigrants and Black people and it's important to condemn the manner in which these puzzle pieces are put together to label African Americans and immigrants as a threat to democracy with respect to the vote,\" Levin said.\n\nThe premise of the video in question is that Democrats have engaged in a complicated and decades-long scheme to steal elections. It's presented as a documentary, and the images of the Obamas have been weirdly inserted as almost a subliminal flash near the end.\n\nIf you've missed the white supremacist postings that have now become commonplace on official government communications such as those from the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security, let me assure you that Levin is right and this primate video is indeed part of a \"firehose\" of white nationalist rhetoric coming not just from Trump, but from the federal government as a whole.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, for example, has turned its focus toward punishing diversity, equity and inclusion. Just this week, another federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, began a probe against Nike for allegedly discriminating against white people in hiring.\n\n\"It has been not even a dog-whistling, but a Xeroxing of the exact kind of terms that I've been looking at on white supremacists' and neo-Nazi websites for decades,\" Levin said.\n\nIt's not my place or intent to warn Black people about racism, because that would be ludicrous and insulting, but I'll warn the rest of us because in the end, authoritarianism targets everyone. This video is a clear statement that Trump's vision of America is one in which every non-white group, every vulnerable group really, is a second-class citizen.\n\n\"He's enabling an entire group of people who want to take this country back to a time when rampant violent white supremacy was enabled in the law,\" Abdullah said. \"What they mean is recapturing an old-school, oppressive racism that is pre-1965, pre-Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nThat message, Levin said, has \"a resonance with a decent part of his base,\" and when fed ceaselessly into the system, can have violent outcomes.\n\nLevin uses the example of when Trump tweeted during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" a phrase with a violent and racist history.\n\nLevin said Black people have always been the primary targets of hate crimes in the United States, but after that tweet, it was some of the \"worst days\" for violence aimed by race.\n\n\"When a high transmitter, like a president, circulates imagery with regard to prejudice, it creates these stereotypes and conspiracy theories, which then are the groundwork for further conspiracy theories and aggression,\" he added.\n\nAbdullah said she worries that even if the voter crackdown isn't officially sanctioned, those empowered conspiracy theorists will take action anyway.\n\n\"So the people who are so-called monitoring, self-appointed monitors ... this is who's going to be pulling people out of voter lines, and so this is what he's whipping up intentionally,\" she said.\n\nKeep your eye on the ball, folks, because the far-right Republicans running the show are laser-focused on it. The midterm elections have to go their way for them to remain in power.\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that outcome is to only allow voters who see things their way.\n\nGet the L.A.

    "description": "Indiana Rep. Sheila Klinker, 87, says this is her last election. She faces Republican Tracy Brown in a race that apparently defies political bitterness.",
    "fullText": "LAFAYETTE, IN — It hasn't been uncommon for longstanding state Rep. Sheila Klinker to face the occasional challenger through her 44 years of elections to represent Lafayette at the Indiana Statehouse. But this year she faces Tracy Brown, a Republican challenger with a long history of election victories.\n\nKlinker, a Democrat who had been a state representative since 1982, says this is her last election. Absolutely her last, the 87-year-old Lafayette representative insisted Friday.\n\n\"I thought maybe I might be able to do one more time without anybody running after me,\" Klinker joked.\n\nBrown is a candidate, but before he faces Klinker, he'll have to win the GOP primary in May, where he faces Oscar Alvarez, who ran against Klinker two years ago. Klinker defeated Alvarez by capturing more than 61% of the vote.\n\nWith eight years as Tippecanoe County sheriff and 12 years as Tippecanoe County commissioner, Brown has worked with lawmakers.\n\n\"What goes on in Indianapolis does impact us here locally,\" Brown said. \"That makes the work done by our local delegation really, really important.\"\n\nPlans to take his experiences of law enforcement and experiences as policy making as a commissioner to Indy.\n\n\"I want to use the perspective I've gained to serve this district,\" Brown said.\n\nKlinker and Brown have been friends for decades and worked together in their roles as public servants.\n\n\"If I had to have an opponent, I would rather it would be Tracy Brown than somebody else,\" Klinker said. \"Tracy and I have been friends for a long time. I feel like we're still friends even though we're opponents.\"\n\n\"This is something that I've pondered and thought about for years,\" Brown said, noting he's discussed it with Klinker.\n\nBrown, 63, declined to comment whether Klinker has the stamina to serve another two years.\n\n\"I've learned things from Sheila over the years. The way she shows up. The way she recognizes people,\" Brown said. \"Those are all things you expect of your elected officials.\"\n\nAsked whether she had the endurance for another two years of public service, Klinker said, \"The folks will tell you that I am at places where the others are not. I go to everything.\"\n\n\"I like what I do, so I work hard at it,\" she said. \"I still really enjoy it.\n\n\"I'll run this time, and then that will be it,\" she said, admitting some have said she said swore off running in 2024. \"I mean it this time.\n\n\"I do have the energy to do it,\" she said. \"I have been blessed with good health.\"\n\nIf Klinker and Brown square off in the fall election, don't expect snarky partisan sniping.\n\n\"I want to show you can do this in the right way,\" Brown said, \"and it doesn't have to be bitter, and it doesn't have to be hateful.\"\n\nThat's the Tippecanoe County way of governance between Democratic and Republican public officials.\n\n\"We get work done on a done on a daily basis together,\" Brown said.\n\n\"It's been an interesting career,\" Klinker said. \"The nice thing about it is it's not like Washington, D.C.

    "description": "Hikaru Fujita, who’s running in Sunday’s parliamentary election, is a standout in a country where expectant mothers rarely enter national politics.",
    "fullText": "For weeks, Hikaru Fujita, a candidate in Japan’s parliamentary elections on Sunday, wrestled with a secret. She was pregnant with her first child — a joyous milestone for her and her husband.\n\nBut Ms. Fujita, 35, a Harvard-educated former diplomat, worried that publicizing her pregnancy could hurt her campaign. In late January, she set aside her fears, announcing on social media that she had been “blessed with new life.”\n\n“I wanted to show that even pregnant women could run,” Ms. Fujita, from Nagano Prefecture, said in an interview. “I wanted to send a message to the younger generation.”\n\nOn social media, many people celebrated Ms. Fujita’s news, while others suggested that she should pursue a career as a housewife instead, and that a maternity leave would be a waste of taxpayers’ money.\n\nWith her revelation, Ms. Fujita, who is running for a seat in the powerful House of Representatives as a candidate for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, is testing Japan’s patriarchal system. She is one of a record number of women running for parliamentary seats on Sunday; 313 out of 1,285 candidates, or almost a quarter.\n\nDespite the election last fall of Sanae Takaichi as prime minister — the first woman to serve in that role — women remain significantly underrepresented in Japanese politics. They occupy only about 16 percent of seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nExpectant mothers rarely enter national politics; only a handful have run in local elections over the years. Many point to rampant workplace discrimination against young mothers. There is even a Japanese word for it: matahara, or maternity harassment.\n\nMs. Takaichi, a hard-line conservative from the same party, has avoided speaking out in public on gender issues. But she traveled to Nagano this week to campaign for Ms. Fujita. She is hoping the Liberal Democrats can pick up enough seats in the election to gain a majority and push through her agenda.\n\n“There is no one more incredible than her,” Ms. Takaichi said in Nagano. “Please give her strength.”\n\nMs. Fujita previously worked on issues like economic security and North Korea’s missile program for Japan’s foreign affairs ministry; she has also worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company. She said she was motivated to run after watching homes and fields in Nagano empty out as people left for cities. She also feels that Japan’s political system has become too fragmented and bureaucratic.\n\nOn the campaign trail, she has offered policies aimed at winning over women and families, including addressing gender pay gaps and expanding child care. She has also made a point of taking time to rest. Her campaign slogan is “Trying her best without overworking herself.”\n\nShe has frequently deployed her husband, Tomohiro Fujita, as her surrogate; he has taken time off from his job as a physics professor to help lead the campaign. He often appears alongside her, wearing a white beanie emblazoned with a Japanese word for husband.\n\nMs. Fujita said the negative comments about her candidacy were “discouraging, disappointing.” But she said she was trying to tune them out.\n\n“It affects me a little bit,” she said in the interview. “But at the end of the day, all these comments are invisible.”\n\nStill, she has occasionally encountered traditional attitudes on the campaign trail. Men often do not make eye contact with her during meetings, she said, instead looking at her husband.\n\n“I didn’t feel comfortable about it, but I also feel that they don’t do it on purpose — they do it unconsciously,” Ms. Fujita said.\n\nHer husband said that men appeared to be “nervous sitting in front of a powerful woman — they are uneasy.”\n\n“They feel more comfortable talking to me,” he said.\n\nMs. Fujita said she hopes her campaign can help challenge conceptions about who can wield power in Japanese society.\n\n“If I fail, I worry there will be fewer opportunities for younger women,” she said. “My job is to run a strong campaign but also to stay healthy and safe.”\n\nHisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.",

    "description": "Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye for 2026 NFL MVP by one vote, 24-23 in the closest MVP race in 22 years, however it was odd first-place nods for Justin Herbert and Josh Allen that might have made the difference.",
    "fullText": "Why Justin Herbert's first-place MVP vote is odd twist to Matthew Stafford victory over Drake Maye originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL was very close to having co-league MVP quarterbacks for the second time ever and first time in 22 years. Instead, the Rams' Matthew Stafford's margin of victory -- one first-place vote -- over the Patriots' Drake Maye (24-23) will go down as the closest decision in league history.\n\nNot since the Colts' Peyton Manning and the late Titans great Steve McNair tied 16-16 and shared MVP in 2003 has there been such a narrow call. Stafford edging Maye was the most expected result at Thursday's Associated Press NFL Honors ceremony, but it still came with controversy considering where the three other first-place votes went.\n\nWhile 47 of the 50 AP voters, which includes national beat reporters and television analysts such as Tom Brady, had a natural split between Stafford and Maye -- much like Josh Allen beating Lamar Jackson for 2024 MVP -- three went in a different direction. Two voters thought Allen should repeat and gave him a follow-up first-place love. But one inexplicably threw away their most valuable vote on Justin Herbert.\n\nMORE:How Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye in closest race since 2003\n\nThere was some logic to Allen's season with the Bills being worthy of some recognition, given it was more efficient than his winning year in many ways. But Herbert's year with the Chargers shouldn't have had a real case.\n\nHerbert wasn't even one of the five finalists \"nominated\" at the 2026 NFL Honors. Stafford, Maye and Allen were joined by Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who both didn't get any first place votes.\n\nBefore the AP reveals on Friday how all 50 voters ranked their top five from first to fifth, the Herbert voter outed himself -- it was former Pro Football Focus analyst Sam Monson.\n\nI was the Justin Herbert vote.\n\nThe guy had the worst offensive line in the NFL all season and despite that he was working miracles in almost every single game.\n\nStafford's OL became 2/5ths as bad as Herbert's for 5 minutes and he became a turnover howitzer.\n\nHe embodied 'value'.\n\n— Sam Monson (@SamMonsonNFL) February 6, 2026\n\nHerbert did have to deal with a broken-down offensive line with both top offensive tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt going down with season-ending injuries. He was sacked 54 times and the Chargers gave up 60 as a team.\n\nBut Maye also was sacked a ton, 47 times, with his rookie left tackle Will Campbell battling inexperience and injury. Maye led the league in completion percentage (72.0), yards per pass attempt (8.9) and passer rating (113.5). He also rushed for 450 yards.\n\nStafford led the league with his 4,709 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes while averaging 7.9 yards per attempt and rating 109.2.\n\nHerbert's numbers weren't close to either. He averaged 7.3 yards per attempt and rated 94.1. He threw for only 26 TDs with 13 interceptions while passing for fewer than 4,000 yards (3,727 yards). Those kind of mediocre numbers lack both efficiency and profilic nature, two things that count most in the history of the award, with MVP really being \"the best quarterback in the league award\".\n\nMORE:Matthew Stafford says he’s not retiring in 2026 NFL MVP Speech\n\nEvery quarterback that wins MVP has a favorable support system. Herbert might have been let down by his team, but in the end, MVP is an award for individual performance. Had Herbert put up transcendent numbers with those challenges, it's one thing. But one cannot blame Stafford or Maye for having better all-around support systems and taking full advantage.\n\nHerbert didn't deserve that vote, or even a fifth-place one.",

He seems to have great tools but an uncanny ability to stay off of the field (just eight games in a season-plus in the White Sox system). In 2025, he was assigned to Kannapolis but was … wait for it … injured. He lasted just eight games of ACL rehab before hitting the IL-60 again.\n\nAldrin Batista\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 SSS Prospect Vote ranking 6\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.2 years\nOverall 2025 stats 2-0 ▪️ 7 games (2 starts) ▪️ 14 IP ▪️ 5.79 ERA ▪️ 17 K ▪️ 7 BB ▪️ 1.429 WHIP ▪️-1.2 WAR\n\nBatista was our No. 6-voted player in last year’s poll and top righthander — and then disaster struck, as he started the third Dash game of the season on April 6 and then was out more than four months with a stress fracture in his right (pitching) elbow. His return in late August was iffy, with three poor relief appearances of five. But he ended the season with a scoreless (two-inning) “opener” start, which hopefully reverses the curse for 2026.\n\nRyan Burrowes\nSecond Baseman\nAge 21\n2024 SSS Prospect Vote ranking 23\n2025 SSS Prospect Vote ranking N/R\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -2.0 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Low-A/High-A) 111 games ▪️ 6 HR ▪️ 39 RBI ▪️ .255/.342/.355 ▪️ 47-of-53 (88.7%) SB ▪️ 39 BB ▪️ 110 K ▪️ .976 FLD%▪️ 1.1 WAR\n\nIt feels like Burrowes has been around forever, and he’s still only 21 years old (and playing at a level significantly younger than his age). His first taste of High-A ball went pretty well, as his baserunning seems to have no trouble translating at any level. The hit tool is solid, although he continues to struggle with contact — a no-no for a speed-over-power guy.\n\nCaden Connor\nLeft Fielder\nAge 25\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -2.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA/AAA) 126 games ▪️ 7 HR ▪️ 64 RBI ▪️ .272/.358/.366 ▪️ 13-of-16 (81.3%) SB ▪️ 60 BB ▪️ 81 K ▪️ .982 FLD%▪️ 1.9 WAR\n\nLike Ryan Galanie, it’s hard to know what to make of Connor. The end of the 2025 season, at Charlotte, marked the first time in his pro career that he’s not played old for his level. But aside from a dip in July, Connor hit well all season and didn’t get dunked underwater at Charlotte. Theoretically with a weak White Sox outfield, the sky’s the limit for him in 2026.\n\nReudis Diaz\nRight-handed relief pitcher\nAge 20\n2025 high level ACL (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -2.1 years\nOverall 2025 stats 1-1 ▪️ 1 SV▪️ 21 games (4 finishes) ▪️ 27 2/3 IP ▪️ 2.28.ERA ▪️ 18 K ▪️ 8 BB ▪️ 1.084 WHIP ▪️1.2 WAR\n\nWho? You’re forgiven for being unfamiliar with an extremely young arm who hasn’t yet gotten out of rookie ball, but our No. 77 prospect a year ago (then a starter, repeating the DSL and killing it) made a successful adjustment Stateside. He’ll return to starting in 2026, likely getting his feet wet in Arizona and getting a promotion to Low-A in the second half of the season.\n\nRyan Galanie\nFirst Baseman\nAge 25\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +1.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA) 119 games ▪️ 11 HR ▪️ 94 RBI ▪️ .276/.327/.422 ▪️ 14-of-17 (82.4%) SB ▪️ 35 BB ▪️ 79 K ▪️ .995 FLD%▪️ 1.1 WAR\n\nIt’s been a slow but steady climb for this 13th-rounder in 2023. The good news here is, with the caveat that Galanie has always competed older than his level, Galanie has found some footing. While his power/slugging numbers are merely OK, he drove in 94 runs in 2025. He disappeared a bit in the playoffs for Birmingham (just four hits in six games, with five walks as well) but started every game in the march to a second consecutive Southern League title for the Barons.\n\nJairo Iriarte\nRight-Handed Relief Pitcher\nAge 24\n2025 SSS Top Prospect Vote Ranking 19\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -4.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Rookie/AAA) 3-3▪️ 1 SV ▪️ 37 games (5 starts, 9 finishes) ▪️ 48 IP ▪️ 7.13 ERA ▪️ 50 K ▪️ 37 BB ▪️ 1.917 WHIP ▪️ -0.8 WAR\n\nThe 2025 season was an utter disaster for Iriarte, who went from prospective South Side rotation member to lost in space. The righty, who made his brief debut in the majors in 2024, both lost the plate and misplaced his strikeout power. The Brian Bannister Pitching Lab has its work cut out here, for sure.\n\nJavier Mogollón\nShortstop\nAge 20\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.4 years\nOverall 2025 stats 51 games ▪️ 5 HR ▪️ 19 RBI ▪️ .220/.347/.387 ▪️ 15-of-21 (71.4%) SB ▪️ 30 BB ▪️ 56 K ▪️ .971 FLD%▪️ 1.0 WAR\n\nAn ascending star just one year ago, we have to tap the breaks a bit on Mogollón after a lackluster first full season of minors ball. While still young for his level and managing to keep his head above water in a new league every season of his career, Mogollón’s undeniable hitting in Rookie ball fell off significantly with the Cannon Ballers. However, how much of that was due to battling injury is undetermined, as Mogollón was shelved for what turned out to be the season on July 2.\n\nYobal Rodriguez\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 18\n2025 high level DSL White Sox (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -1.5 years\nOverall 2025 stats 0-3 ▪️ 13 games (10 starts) ▪️ 30 1/3 IP ▪️2.97 ERA ▪️ 33 K ▪️ 13 BB ▪️ 1.022 WHIP ▪️ 1.2 WAR\n\nRodriguez is a rare DSL pitcher, not for his relatively light innings load, but as a primary starter — and at just 17 years old (Yobal turns 18 on February 9). Inasmuch as it’s tough to project anyone out of the DSL, especially pitchers, you could hardly have hoped for more from him in his pro debut.\n\nColby Shelton\nShortstop\nAge 23\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level +1.6 years\nOverall 2025 NCAA stats 45 games ▪️ 7 HR ▪️ 35 RBI ▪️ .377/.458/.606 ▪️ 6-of-9 (66.7%) SB ▪️ 21 BB ▪️ 24 K ▪️ 2.7 WAR\n\nShelton is more of a slugger than a speedster, with the usual caveats about whether he will stick at shortstop. His credentials are impressive, playing full-time in the SEC in all three of his college years (one at Alabama, two with Georgia). Given the crowded field for the White Sox at shortstop, Shelton’s defensive ability will mean very little provided he can keep clubbing.\n\nPast South Side Sox Prospect votes\n\nHere is how 2018 wrangled out — all 42 picks.

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s approval rating polls released at the start of 2026 indicate a gradual decline in public support for the President. One year into his second term, the data suggest that voter confidence has softened, even as his presidency continues to provoke strong reactions on both ends of the political spectrum.\n\nThe polling data from early 2026 shows a decline in support for President Donald Trump as midterm elections near. Multiple surveys conducted in late January reveal a consistent trend: more Americans now disapprove of his job performance than approve.\n\nTrump’s approval rating is currently mired in the upper 30s to low 40s, while his disapproval consistently registers above 50%. This negative shift comes after a year of big policy moves and political upheaval. This includes a protracted government shutdown and aggressive federal budget cuts, as well as the controversial domestic deployment of U.S. troops (via Democrat & Chronicle).\n\nA New York Times survey puts his support at 41%, with 56% opposed. The Economist shows a similar 38% to 56% split. Meanwhile, pollsters like Rasmussen and Morning Consult show a slightly tighter race, with approvals at 46%. Others, like Pew Research Center and American Research Group, report a starker deficit, with unfavorable ratings reaching 61% and 63%, respectively. This broad spectrum of Donald Trump’s approval rating polls points to a challenging political environment for the White House.\n\nAnalysts suggest this dip is rooted in more than just policy disputes. A detailed Pew Research Center study from late January probed deeper into public trust, finding widespread skepticism. According to their report, “more Americans express little or no confidence in Trump than say they are extremely or very confident in him.” This deficit of confidence spans critical areas, including his leadership, mental fitness, selection of advisors, and commitment to democratic values and ethics.\n\nThe post Donald Trump’s New Approval Rating Polls Show Major Changes appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.",
    "fullText": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.\n\nThe incident started Sunday night when Morgan Thompson posted a video recounting what she says was a comment Texas state Rep. James Talarico made to her in a private conversation in January: that he called his onetime opponent, former US Rep. Colin Allred, a “mediocre Black man.”\n\nTalarico’s campaign released a statement from the candidate on Monday calling Thompson’s claims “a mischaracterization of a private conversation,” going on to explain, “I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre — but his life and service are not.” Thompson acknowledged that she didn’t have a recording and that they had previously agreed to treat their conversation as off the record.\n\nBut the accusation slammed Talarico’s campaign on Monday, sending aides into a flurry and prompting Allred — who dropped out of the Senate race when Rep. Jasmine Crockett decided to make a last-minute entry — to endorse her in the intense race, despite frustrations he had in December that she had chased him out of the race by getting in. It also renewed the questions about identity politics and electability that have riven the primary and the Democratic Party more broadly.\n\nThompson alleges that Talarico, who is White, said: “I signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman.”\n\nTalarico, in his statement denying the exact wording as Thompson relayed it, said, “I understand how my critique of the Congressman’s campaign could be interpreted given this country’s painful legacy of racism, and I care deeply about the impact my words have on others.”\n\nIn an interview on Monday evening, Allred told CNN he felt the campaign’s statement is “an admission that he said what he said,” and expressed surprise that he hadn’t heard from Talarico directly.\n\n“I responded not just on my behalf, but on behalf of Black candidates around the country that even if you run six points ahead of your presidential candidate, you’re still called ‘mediocre,’” Allred said, referring to his results in the 2024 Senate race as compared to Kamala Harris in the state. (Allred outperformed Harris by about five points.)\n\nThompson told CNN that she had been turned on to Talarico’s campaign by a friend last fall and preferred him over Allred. After attending an event of his in Dallas, she started using her social media following to boost him. Talarico’s staff reached out about her video from the rally, she said, and was soon feeding her information like fundraising numbers and clips from his “Jubilee” online debate to help.\n\n“It was like a symbiotic kind of thing. I wasn’t paid by the campaign at all,” Thompson said, though, “I was in constant communication with the campaign.”\n\nThompson said the relationship started to break down after she got a fundraising text for Talarico, signed by the Democratic strategist James Carville, who has been urging Democrats to start moving away from identity politics. Thompson said she saw that as an implicit critique of Black women, and that when she raised her frustrations with the campaign, an aide offered her to have a conversation with Talarico — either on camera for her to post, or “off the record,” as what was meant to be a private conversation.\n\nShe says she opted for the less formal conversation, without a recording. But she says she remembers the exchange, which took place backstage before a town hall in Plano on January 12, very well. Thompson said she raised concerns about the association with Carville and suggested that maybe he was chasing a big name, prompting Talarico to say, “So you’re concerned about me being a sell out?” She said she told him he was overlooking the racial dynamics he’d tipped into, prompting him to say, “I have blind spots.”\n\nCampaign spokesman JT Ennis confirmed the association with Thompson — “the Talarico campaign works with lots of creators in Texas to keep them updated on the campaign,” he said — and that they did speak before the Plano event. But Ennis told CNN Talarico does not recall making either of those statements, and that his version was backed up by an aide whom both said was in the room but was not made available for an interview.\n\nThe conversation turned, Thompson said, when she mentioned to Talarico online chatter she was seeing from people wishing he had run for governor instead — an option he had considered before launching the Senate run and was urged to reconsider when Crockett jumped into the race late.\n\n“That is when he said, ‘I signed up to run against a mediocre black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman,’” Thompson said, “That is a direct quote.”\n\nThompson also accused Talarico’s campaign of trying to silence her, claiming that her Instagram account had disappeared and her Threads account had been suspended within minutes of when she posted a video about her claims. Thompson does not know how this would have happened, she acknowledged, given that no one on the campaign has her password, but “It’s just too many factors in play. It’s just too many abnormalities. The timing of it was so fast.”\n\nAs for Thompson’s claims about the social media accounts being closed, Ennis said, “No. We do not have that kind of power, nor would we ever do that.”\n\nShortly after Thompson’s video went viral, Allred posted his own video ripping Talarico.\n\n“Let me just give you some free advice, James,” Allred said. “If you want to compliment Black women, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.”\n\nHe also suggested Talarico, a Presbyterian seminarian, was getting unfair attention for his discussion on the campaign trail of Christianity and how Democrats can make inroads with religious voters.\n\n“We don’t need you,” he said. “You’re not saying anything unique. You’re just saying it looking like you do.”\n\nThe Senate primary is March 3. Allred is also on the ballot that day, in a House primary against Rep. Julie Johnson that he entered after leaving the Senate race.",

    "fullText": "Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee (D) has won the special election runoff for late Rep. Sylvester Turner’s (D-Texas) seat, according to a Decision Desk HQ projection.\n\nMenefee defeated former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards (D) in the Saturday runoff, after they were the top two vote-getters in the November primary.\n\nThe Lone Star State’s 18th Congressional District, which voted overwhelmingly blue in the 2024 presidential race, was long expected to stay in Democratic hands — but the runoff delayed Democrats from being able to add to their numbers in the House for months.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a 218-213 majority, with four vacancies. Menefee’s win will, at least temporarily, narrow that gap.\n\nSixteen candidates ran to fill the remainder of Turner’s term in the House after he died in March, though none received a majority of votes. Turner, who was first elected to Congress in November 2024 and died last year, had himself succeeded the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D), after she died the July prior.\n\nMenefee will serve the remainder of Turner’s term, but will then run again for a full term for the seat in March after the district was redrawn last year. Edwards and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) have also filed to run in that primary.",

    "fullText": "More than 5,200 members of the United Educators of San Francisco voted overwhelmingly to authorize the union’s leadership to call a strike as teachers push for more public education funding.\n\nThe union, which represents San Francisco Unified School District workers such as educators, nurses, counselors, and psychologists, voted in favor by 97.6% to pave the way for a potential strike.\n\n“Our community is standing with us in our fight for the consistent classroom teachers, special education supports, and stable programs our students and families need and deserve,” UESF wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.\n\nThe post said the school district was placing money into savings accounts and contracting out work to traveling psychologists or non-district special education support staff.\n\nThe last time San Francisco educators went on strike was in 1979, according to the union. The strike lasted for seven weeks.\n\nThe union didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday via email.\n\nIn a post on Sunday, the San Francisco Unified School District's Superintendent Maria Su said they \"remain committed to negotiating in good faith with UESF and working toward an agreement that supports our students, educators, and school communities.\"\n\nA special Board of Education meeting is scheduled for Wednesday that will focus on labor negotiations, which includes a resolution that would allow the superintendent to make \"necessary operational decisions in the event of a strike,\" the post said.\n\nThe strike authorization vote came on the same day as educators in Southern California also signaled they were gearing up to head to the picket lines to demand better pay and working conditions.\n\nUnited Teachers Los Angeles members also gave their leadership authorization to call a strike. Another union — Local 99 of Service Employees International Union — that represents educators in Southern California is also scheduled to vote on whether to authorize a strike starting on Monday.\n\nA.

    "description": "Bitcoin fell toward $83,000 as the U.S. entered a partial shutdown, with traders leaning defensive ahead of a House vote expected Monday.",
    "fullText": "Crypto prices remained under pressure on Friday as the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown after lawmakers missed a midnight funding deadline, adding another layer of uncertainty to a market already struggling to find buyers.\n\nBitcoin traded around $83,559, up about 1% on the day but down roughly 6.8% over the past week, according to the price screen.\n\nEther sat near $2,686, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours and 9% on the week. XRP changed hands near $1.72, down about 1.6% on the day and close to 10% lower over seven days.\n\nThe shutdown itself looks short. The Senate passed a funding package, but the House is out until Monday, so the government will still hit a technical lapse over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Saturday that it would operate with \"very limited staff\" from Jan. 31 onward due to the shutdown.\n\nThat timing matters for risk assets because it lands right into thin weekend liquidity and a heavy headline cycle, which may pressure bitcoin and the broader crypto market over the weekend.\n\nThere is also a clean crypto angle here that is not just “risk off.” Prediction markets have spent the past 24 hours showing how messy the definition of “shutdown” can get.\n\nTraders on Polymarket and Kalshi were forced to think like lawyers. The government can be “shut” on paper at 12:01 a.m. and still look normal to most people for two days. That gap between legal status and real-world impact is exactly where contract wording and settlement rules start to bite.\n\nFor crypto, the shutdown headline is more of a sentiment stress test than a direct economic shock. It keeps traders cautious, pushes people toward smaller position sizes, and makes dips feel heavier because buyers do not want to step in front of a weekend news tape.",

    "description": "While the Senate advanced a package of spending bills, the House won't be back in town to vote until late Monday.",
    "fullText": "The US federal government is shutting down again, but it won't be like last time.\n\nFunding for a slew of federal agencies runs out at midnight late on Friday, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill failed to send a series of bills to fund those agencies to President Donald Trump's desk in time.\n\nEven though the Senate passed a series of bills to fund the government on Friday, the House is not set to vote on them until late Monday at the earliest, meaning the shutdown will last at least a few days.\n\nSome parts of the federal government have already been funded, meaning that the shutdown, even if it drags out, is only partial.\n\nAdditionally, it's unlikely that this shutdown will last as long as the one that began in October, which stretched for 43 days and became the longest government shutdown in American history.\n\nIn October, funding for the entire federal government was being held up, and the shutdown was far-reaching. This time, some parts of the federal government would remain operational.\n\nThat's because Congress has already passed a series of spending bills that fund agencies and programs through September 30.\n\nAmong those programs are SNAP and WIC, which were notably affected by the previous shutdown. Additionally, national parks would likely remain open, veterans would continue to receive benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and staff on Capitol Hill would continue to be paid.\n\nBut plenty of other government agencies and programs would be affected if the shutdown drags out, including the Department of Defense (including troops), the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNotably, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would remain operational, even though it's funded via the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThat's because DHS received $190 billion in funding via the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July, including $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP.\n\nUnlike in the fall, lawmakers in both parties are working together to try to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\n\nThe odds of a shutdown first rose following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats vowed to oppose a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and CBP, until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of six funding bills, including the DHS bill, and they had been stitched together into one package in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate has now passed a reformulated version of that package, with DHS funding continuing for only two weeks to allow for a renegotiation.\n\nIt's unclear as of now whether that package will pass the House when lawmakers return to the lower chamber next week.",

    "fullText": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin is one of the many California-based billionaires pouring millions into donations ahead of the state's proposed wealth tax.\n\nBrin, along with other tech executives, venture capitalists, and philanthropists, donated a combined $35 million to ballot measure committees in January, supporting affordable housing ballots in California, per a disclosure seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe disclosure was filed by the coalition \"Building a Better California.\"\n\nBrin was the largest contributor in the filing, donating $20 million. Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.\n\n“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”\n\nLaura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”\n\nRachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.\n\n“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”\n\nIn the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”\n\nRachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.\n\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”\n\nJulia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.\n\n“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”\n\nFrom the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.\n\n“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”\n\nBut she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.\n\n“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”\n\nTahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.\n\nTahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.\n\nBut feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.\n\nShe believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”\n\nAJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.\n\n“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”\n\nAJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.\n\n“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”\n\nThey are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.\n\n“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.\n\nPhil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.\n\nIn principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.\n\nPhil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”",

    "fullText": "The Bill Belichick snub led to another compelling storyline regarding the role of Hall of Fame G.M. Bill Polian in the outcome. A day later, an important point of clarification has emerged.\n\nPolian, after saying he voted for Belichick before saying he can't say with 100 percent certainty whether he did, says he did indeed vote for his former New England nemesis.\n\n“I voted for coach Belichick in the Hall of Fame selection meeting,” Polian said in an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio, after explaining he was reading from a prepared statement. “The Pro Football Hall of Fame has confirmed that fact through the auditors of the selection process. Again, I’ll state that I never said that I believe that Coach Belichick should quote, wait a year, close quote, for enshrinement. This has been confirmed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, numerous selectors who were in the room, and my vote for coach Belichick. As a Hall of Fame member and selector, I realize the import of what we do. I’ve always tried as a selector to make these difficult choices with the utmost of objectivity. I’ve said on SiriusXM Radio and numerous other media outlets that I believe Coach Belichick to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, my vote confirms that.”\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter. Not enough of the voters voted for Belichick. At least 11 of 50 failed to include Belichick among three selections from a group that included Belichick, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig, and L.C. Greenwood.\n\nFrom those five choices, who would be your three? And is there any way Belichick wouldn't be one of them?",

    "description": "Here's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.",
    "fullText": "Why Bill Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer after controversial vote: 'Six Super Bowls isn't enough?' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBill Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history and the only head coach with six Super Bowl wins, but that isn't enough to make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nIn his first year of eligibility, the former New England Patriots coach was not elected to Canton, as he did not reach the 40 votes necessary to earn an election. Belichick will remain on the ballot moving forward, but he will not be part of a prestigious group to earn a first-ballot election.\n\nBelichick's NFL coaching career ended on a sour note, but he still has 302 regular season wins, third most all-time, and 31 playoff wins, which is the most all-time. Belichick's six Super Bowls are two more than second place, and his nine Super Bowl appearances are three more than second place.\n\nHere's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best Patriots of all time\n\nAccording to ESPN, Belichick didn't get enough votes necessary to make the Hall of Fame due to his baggage in the NFL. ESPN reports that Belichick's roles in both Spygate and Deflategate kept him out on first try, as some voters may think Belichick should wait at least a year as some sort of punishment.\n\n\"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a veteran Hall voter said, via ESPN. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"\n\nAdditionally, the voting process for coaches is different than the process for players. Belichick is one of five owners, executives, coaches and players competing for up to three available spots separate from teh 15 modern-era finalists, forcing each voter to pick three of those five.\n\nAlong with Belichick, the other four finalists include Patriots owner Robert Kraft, former quarterback Ken Anderson, former running back Roger Craig and former defensive end L.C. Greenwood.\n\nESPN writer and Hall of Fame voter Mike Sando explained the difficult process of voting for these players, saying that they have an extremely high bar to clear.\n\nI'm a HOF voter who saw Belichick as slam-dunk. I don't know anything about voting results, but if this is true, and we'll find out officially next week, the question is, how could this happen?\n\nBefore I list possibilities, understand this:\n\nBelichick, Kraft, Craig, Anderson &… https://t.co/V8okBDsReH\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 27, 2026\n\nMORE: Who is on the Mount Rushmore of Boston sports?\n\n\"Spygate\" was a Patriots cheating scandal from the 2007 season. Then-New York Jets head coach, and former Patriots assistant, Eric Mangini tipped off the NFL to the Patriots illegally videotaping Jets' defensive signals on the sidelines.\n\nThe NFL ultimately fined Belichick $500,000, the Patriots $250,000, and forced New England to forfeit its 2008 first-round pick.\n\nMORE: What was Bill Belichick's record without Tom Brady\n\nWhen Belichick found out he did not make the Hall of Fame, the veteran coach was understandably upset. ESPN reports that Belichick was \"puzzled\" and \"disappointed\" by his omission from the Hall this year, as he believes he was left out due to \"politics\"instead of accomplishments.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick reportedly asked an associate. \"What does a guy have to do?\"\n\nMORE: The 10 longest-tenured coaches in NFL history\n\nHere are the hall-of-fame coaches who were elected to the Hall on first ballot.\n\nBoth Halas and Lambeau were elected to the Hall of Fame as part of the first ever induction class, so they weren't first-ballot in the same way the other three were. Shula is the all-time wins leader, while he, Landry and Noll have a combined eight Super Bowl titles and 15 Super Bowl appearances.\n\nMORE: Breaking down the worst losses of Bill Belichick's career\n\nThere are 50 Hall of Fame voters that comprise of NFL writers and a media members. Among the voters are foremr Indianapolis Colts GM Bill Polian, who works for SiriusXM NFL radio and reportedly believes Belichick should wait a year to be inducted.\n\nThe full list of NFL Hall of Fame voters can be found here.\n\nBill Belichick has six Super Bowl victories, which is the most all-time among NFL coaches. Only Tom Brady has more Super Bowls as a player, and six of his seven came with Belichick as his head coach.\n\nBill Belichick is 73 years old, but is still coaching as he is about to enter his second season as North Carolina's head coach.",

    "description": "Senate Democrats say they won't vote for a bill to fund DHS after the deadly ICE shooting, threatening to imperil a broader government funding effort.",
    "fullText": "Just days ago, it looked like the US would avoid a repeat of the government shutdown that took place in the fall.\n\nThen, federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the span of just a few hours following the shooting on Saturday, the odds that the government will shut down later this week rose from roughly 10% to the high 70s on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.\n\nThat's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\n\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. \"Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"\n\nThere are only two ways out of this:\n\nBut even if lawmakers go with the second option, a short shutdown through the weekend is likely.\n\nTo avoid a government shutdown after midnight late Friday evening, the Senate would need to pass the six-bill package, which funds DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things.\n\nThose six bills have already passed the House, and they've been stitched together into one larger package in the Senate.\n\nThe GOP may control the upper chamber, but they can't ignore Democrats. Due to the Senate's 60-vote \"filibuster\" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one.\n\nDemocrats are only opposed to the DHS bill, and Schumer has called on Republicans to work with Democrats to separate out the bills. But the GOP has balked so far at that idea.\n\nFurthermore, even if the bills are separated, the House would have to vote on them again to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nThe House is out of session until next week, meaning a shutdown at least until then is highly likely.\n\nJust months ago, the federal government shut down for 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad.\n\nFor one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30.\n\nSNAP and WIC payments would be unaffected, Capitol Hill staffers would still get paid, and national parks would likely remain open.\n\nAdditionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward.\n\nIn the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding.\n\nThat means it's plausible that the Senate would separate out the other five bills, the House would re-pass those bills next week, and the partial shutdown would only last a few days.\n\nStill, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. It also funds the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThat raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time.\n\nAdditionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.\n\nWhile the current DHS funding bill contains an additional $10 billion for ICE, the agency also received roughly $75 billion in funding via the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" in July.\n\nUnless lawmakers were to agree to rescind that funding — extremely unlikely given GOP control of Congress — that money's here to stay.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump may still dominate the news cycle, but inside the White House, the foundations of his power are weakening—and he knows it, according to Trump’s biographer.\n\nOn the latest episode of Inside Trump’s Head, author Michael Wolff described a White House increasingly gripped by anxiety as the president enters a pivotal midterm year burdened by collapsing polls, international resistance, self-inflicted crises that refuse to fade, and growing alarm among aides that Trump is losing interest in the presidency.\n\n“If you lose Donald Trump’s interest, you lose Donald Trump,” Wolff said.\n\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s not interested in bureaucracy. He’s interested in unfettered attention.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, the daily work of governing—incremental wins, trade-offs, and detail—bores Trump, draining his energy at a moment when political discipline matters most.\n\nThat disengagement has become increasingly visible on the world stage. After heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos expecting to be treated as an untouchable strongman, Trump instead encountered coordinated resistance from allies who, Wolff argued, are no longer content to maneuver quietly around him.\n\n“Trump’s virtue to voters is that no matter what happened, he looked strong,” Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.\n\n“Now he cannot take Greenland, he cannot take Canada, he cannot do any of the things that he has huffed and puffed and said he will do.”\n\nWolff said the same pattern is playing out at home, where the administration has struggled to contain the fallout in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal immigration officers this month, further inflaming protests and political backlash.\n\n“This has now become a very, very complicated situation,” Wolff said.\n\nFor Trump, Minneapolis represents the kind of crisis he finds hardest to manage: one that can’t be bullied into submission or drowned out by spectacle.\n\n“He cannot threaten his way out of it,” Wolff said.\n\n“He can’t seem to generate a new headline to get himself out of it,” he continued. “The headlines that are generated are bad headlines.”\n\nThat dynamic, Wolff argued, points to a broader problem for Trump as the midterms approach. Governing, he said, demands a tolerance for incremental progress, which is at odds with Trump’s appetite for dominance and immediate results.\n\n“The work of the presidency does not inspire him,” Wolff said.\n\n“If it becomes complicated, that has to be pushed to the side.”\n\nAs Trump disengages, Wolff went on to say, the president has increasingly turned to performative conflict, including high-profile lawsuits and public feuds with powerful institutions. Once effective at projecting strength, those tactics now risk reinforcing the impression of a leader struggling to maintain control.\n\n“There’s only so many times you can sue people for $5 billion or $20 billion,” Wolff said. “You look foolish.”\n\nWith a little over nine months until the midterm elections, Wolff framed the moment as a genuine inflection point—not just for Republicans, but for Trump himself.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a pivotal campaign,” Wolff said.\n\n“Conceivably one of the most important campaigns ever waged. This is potentially, in November, the end of Donald Trump.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

Adam Schiff (D-Ca.) declared Sunday he’s “not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating” as deadly sweeping Immigration and Custom Enforcement raids led by the Trump administration have sparked political and public backlash.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Schiff made the statement after moderator Kristen Welker asked him if he’s “prepared to vote against Department of Homeland Security funding if it means partially shutting down the government, again, coming on the heels of an incredibly long shutdown.”\n\nPolitics: Democrats Consider Partial Government Shutdown To Curb ICE\n\nTelling Welker straight up that “Democrats are not going to fund that,” he continued, “The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding. It will be a Republican decision. They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”\n\nThe California senator noted Democrats are hoping “some of the Republicans in the Senate may see those scenes in the streets and be as repelled as we are, and vote against that continuation of violence also.”\n\nHe added: “If they don’t, it will be their decision whether they couple that funding for these ICE agents and Border Patrol agents with all these other government agencies.”\n\n“[Republicans] will make the decision. They’re in the majority if they want to shut down the government so they can perpetuate this violence,” Schiff said.\n\nPolitics: Sworn Witness Accounts Of Alex Pretti Killing Differ Sharply From DHS\n\nSchiff went on to vow he’s “not going to be a part of it.”\n\n“And I think anyone who votes to give them more money to do this will share in the responsibility and see more Americans die in our cities as a result.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker asked Schiff what the “exact impact” would be if legislators withhold funding now, considering “Republicans have already passed $170 billion in extra DHS funding through what they’ve dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Well, it would certainly, I hope, stop it from becoming even worse,” he responded. “They have thrown so much money at these agencies. They don’t know what to do with it. And there is no question that when we actually get a chance to do oversight again, which I hope will happen after this November, you are going to find all kinds of corruption [with] how that money is going out.”\n\nPolitics: House Passes Bill Funding ICE — With Help From Democrats\n\nSchiff then told Welker he believes they will find that the money has been “wasted hand over fist.”\n\n“There is going to be enormous waste, fraud and abuse in DHS given how money is being spent without any kind of real oversight,” he said.\n\nWatch Schiff’s interview on “Meet the Press” below.\n\nTrump Takes Aim At ‘Corrupt’ Adam Schiff As Next Target In His Political Retribution Tour\n\nAdam Schiff Calls Out Trump For 'Flip-Flopping' On Abortion\n\nRep.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods and products exported to the US should Ottawa make a trade deal with China.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whom he called \"Governor Carney,\" against making a \"drop off\" deal with Beijing or face the levies.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,\" he added.\n\nCarney made an official visit to China last week — the first by a Canadian leader since 2017 — meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss economic and trade opportunities between the two countries.\n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, Ottawa and Beijing said they had committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment, as well as building cooperation in areas such as energy and agriculture.\n\nCarney also announced that Canada would now allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market on the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In return, he said Canada expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by March 1.\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was what Carney \"should be doing\" and that it was \"a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"\n\nTrump's changing tone comes days after Carney delivered an impassioned speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he opined on the changing face of global politics since Trump's election.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney, who did not explicitly name Trump, said, adding that \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nTrump did not miss the opportunity to snap back at Carney during his own speech at Davos, saying the prime minister \"wasn't so grateful.\"\n\n\"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

    "fullText": "It’s always interesting to see how a head coach votes during the final US LBM Coaches Poll, and for Notre Dame’s Marcus Freeman, he certainly tried to make a statement as shared by Tyler Horka.\n\nFor some odd reason, Alabama was still ranked ahead of the Irish, but not according to Freeman, who had the Crimson Tide a spot behind his team at No. 10. He also placed Brigham Young, a Notre Dame 2026 opponent who also was skipped over in the College Football Playoff at No. 11.\n\nThere was a big omission as well, as Freeman opted to leave USC out of his top-25 all-together. This was most likely a jab at the Trojans, who decided that they couldn’t play Notre Dame anymore due to the potential of missing out on the CFP. It was a weak eat out of the storied rivalry, and Freeman made sure they knew it as well.\n\nIt was fun to see how the Irish’s leader opted to vote in the final coaches poll, as he most likely didn’t have one of his staff members submit the picks.\n\nThis is Marcus Freeman’s final Coaches Poll ballot of the 2025 season, via @usatodaysports.\n\nOf note, out of 62 coaches…\n\n-He was one of 16 who had Notre Dame ranked ahead of Alabama.\n\n-He was one of 16 who did not rank USC. pic.twitter.com/T8em4buRBM\n\n— Tyler Horka (@tbhorka) January 21, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: See who Marcus Freeman omitted in his final coaches poll vote of 2026",

    "fullText": "Just months ago, Elon Musk seemed to swear off major political spending. That seems to be over now.\n\nThe tech titan has poured $10 million into a super PAC backing GOP Senate candidate Nate Morris in Kentucky, according to Axios and The New York Times.\n\nIt would be Musk's largest publicly known single contribution to a political candidate since the 2024 election, when he spent nearly $300 million and emerged as the GOP's largest donor.\n\nMorris, an entrepreneur and tech executive running on an \"America First\" platform, is running against two other candidates to succeed the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell. He's been backed by a slew of MAGA-aligned politicians and figures, though President Donald Trump has yet to make an endorsement in the race.\n\nOn an episode of Donald Trump Jr's \"Triggered\" podcast on Monday, Morris said that the super PAC contribution came after he had a \"terrific meeting\" with Musk last week.\n\n\"He got excited about the race, and I think he was excited that I was a business guy and entrepreneur, and decided to make a big contribution to the super PAC that's going to be helping our campaign,\" Morris said. \"We're so delighted to have Elon's support, and for him to go all-in on us.\"\n\nMusk has not yet publicly commented on the reported contribution, and spokespeople for Musk and his companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe world's richest man has also reported to have made major contributions to super PACs tied to House and Senate GOP leadership. It comes as he's appeared to largely mend his relationship with Trump.\n\n\"America is toast if the radical left wins,\" Musk wrote on X earlier this month in response to reports of those contributions. \"They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore.\"\n\nThe details of Musk's contributions will be publicly disclosed to the Federal Election Commission at the end of January.\n\nMore broadly, Musk appears to be re-engaging with American politics, posting about hot-button topics including immigration and his support for legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting.\n\nMusk spending big on an election would mark something of a reversal from the middle of last year.\n\nShortly before his feud with Trump erupted into public view, Musk declared that he was scaling back his political contributions.\n\n\"If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. \"I do not currently see a reason.\"\n\nThose comments came a month after he spent millions to support a GOP candidate in a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, only for that candidate to lose handily.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Letter signed by figures on right and left of party says UK should follow Australia’s example by enacting ban\n\nMore than 60 Labour MPs have written to Keir Starmer urging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, with peers due to vote on the issue this week.\n\nThe MPs, who include select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party, are looking to put pressure on the prime minister as calls mount for the UK to follow Australia’s precedent.\n\nStarmer has said he is open to a ban but members of the House of Lords are looking to force the issue when they vote this week on an amendment to the children, wellbeing and schools bill that would enact one within a year of the bill passing.\n\nThe vote could pit Labour peers against the prime minister, who is understood to want to wait to assess the evidence from the Australian ban, which came into force in December.\n\nIn the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”\n\nThey add: “Around the world, governments are recognising the severity of this crisis and taking action.” Noting existing or pending legislation in Australia, Denmark, France, Norway, New Zealand and Greece, they say: “We believe the onus must be placed on technology platforms, not parents, to prevent underage access. We would support a model similar to Australia’s that requires companies to take meaningful steps to enforce age limits.”\n\nThey conclude: “We urge the government to show leadership on this issue by introducing a minimum age for social media access of 16 years old.”\n\nThe signatories of the letter represent a wide spectrum of opinion within the party. They include Helen Hayes, the chair of the education select committee, and Florence Eshalomi, the chair of the housing and local government committee.\n\nOthers include Vicky Foxcroft, the former whip who helped lead the rebellion against the government’s proposed welfare cuts, and Catherine McKinnell, a former education minister. The letter has support from some on the left of the party such as Richard Burgon, and on the right such as the prominent “blue Labour” MP Jonathan Hinder.\n\nThe weight of Commons support for a ban will put further pressure on the prime minister, who has previously been sceptical about whether such a move would work, but who told MPs at a recent meeting that he would be open to one in theory.\n\nIn recent days, government figures have stressed they are concerned that a ban could force children on to the dark web, and they want to see more evidence before committing to enforcing one in the UK.\n\nOne source close to Starmer said: “In principle, Keir is in favour of a ban. We can all see the dangers and worry about what is happening to young people’s minds. But there are still big obstacles to overcome with implementation. We can already see that from Australia. We need to take our time and make sure we get this right.”\n\nA Downing Street figure suggested Starmer could give a ban his symbolic support soon, but the government would then take its time over implementation, “ironing out” any difficulties first.\n\nThey said: “It’s Keir’s direction of travel but there’s lots of hurdles to overcome first. We’re not going to rush into this.”\n\nLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: “There are strong arguments for banning under-16s from social media but there are also real concerns raised by the NSPCC and others about whether it pushes children to darker, less-regulated places on the internet.”\n\nThose arguments were reinforced over the weekend by Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after looking at suicide content online. Russell told the BBC’s Newscast he opposed what he called “sledgehammer-like techniques like bans”.\n\nThe prime minister’s position will be put to the test this week when peers vote on an amendment by the Conservative member John Nash to the children wellbeing and schools bill proposing enacting an age limit within 12 months of the bill’s passage.\n\nLabour has not said how it intends to vote on the issue yet but several peers are expected to support it regardless of whips’ instructions.\n\nThey include the former MP Luciana Berger, who has co-signed Nash’s amendment. She told the Guardian: “The proposal for raising the social media age limit for under-16s enjoys huge support – across the country and within the Labour party. Social media is catastrophically harming children and we must act now to protect them. I urge peers to back our amendment on Wednesday so we can give young people their childhood back.”",

    "description": "Despite midterm elections in November, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 to deliver double-digit returns over the next year.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 has usually performs poorly during midterm election years, declining by an average 18% at some point before November.\n\nThe stock market usually performs well after midterm elections (as policy uncertainty dissipates), returning an average of 14% during the next six months.\n\nWall Street's consensus estimate puts the S&P 500 at 8,085 by January 2027, which implies more than 16% upside from its current level of 6,940.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has delivered double-digit returns in three consecutive years. Wall Street expects the index to extend its streak in 2026, but midterm election years typically involve sharp declines.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has consistently performed poorly during midterm election years since it was created in 1957. Here are two facts investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has returned an average of 1% during midterm election years, but the index has declined by an average of 7% during those years when a new president sits in the White House.\n\nThe S&P 500 has suffered an average intra-year drawdown of 18% during midterm election years, meaning history says the index will drop 18% at some point in 2026.\n\nWhat explains that trend? Midterm elections create uncertainty, especially because the political party in power tends to lose seats in Congress. Investors are unsure where to put money because they are unsure whether the president will retain enough congressional votes to maintain the status quo. Uncertainty is poison to the stock market.\n\nHowever, policy uncertainty dissipates quickly after the midterm election results are finalized, and the stock market tends to deliver strong returns. In fact, Carson Research says the six-month period following a midterm election (i.e., November through April) is the strongest of the four-year presidential cycle. The S&P 500 has added an average of 14% in those six months.\n\nDoes that mean you should sell your stocks today and buy them back in November? Nope. Attempts to time the market often backfire. Famous fund manager Peter Lynch once said, \"Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, or trying to time the market, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\"\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has done quite well during some midterm election years. The index's return has ranged from up 38% to down 30%, and its largest intra-year decline has ranged from 4% to 38%. Most Wall Street analysts expect 2026 to be one of the better midterm election years.",

The platform can now fire a \"macro-scale laser\" optimized for \"mass Freedom dispensation\" that collapses an entire planet into a black hole.\nHelldivers players are now being asked to boot up the Democracy Space Station voting panel from their Galactic Map and choose one of three planets: Zagon Prime, Penta, or Valmox.",

    "fullText": "Moderators accuse social media firm of unfair dismissal after it fired hundreds in UK just before vote to form union\n\nTikTok moderators have accused the social media company of “oppressive and intimidating” union busting after it fired hundreds of workers in the UK, beginning the process just before they were due to vote on forming a union.\n\nThe moderators wanted to establish a collective bargaining unit to protect themselves from the personal costs of checking extreme and violent content, and have claimed TikTok is guilty of unfair dismissal and breaching trade union laws.\n\nAbout 400 moderators in London were fired before Christmas in a process initiated a week before the vote was due to take place.\n\nTikTok, which has about 30m monthly users in Britain, strongly denies a legal claim that has been lodged with an employment tribunal on behalf of three former workers, describing it as “baseless”.\n\nIt said the sackings were part of a global restructuring involving roles in the UK, and south and south-east Asia amid the increasing use of AI to automate the removal of posts that violate content rules, with 91% of transgressive content now removed automatically.\n\nBut John Chadfield, the national officer for tech workers at the Communication Workers Union, which represented about 250 of the affected moderators, said of the legal action: “This is holding TikTok to account for union busting.”\n\nHe added: “Content moderators have the most dangerous job on the internet. They are exposed to the child sex abuse material, executions, war and drug use. Their job is to make sure this content doesn’t reach TikTok’s 30 million monthly users. It is high pressure and low paid. They wanted input into their workflows and more say over how they kept the platform safe. They said they were being asked to do too much with too few resources.”\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said: “These changes were part of a wider global reorganisation, as we evolve our global operating model for trust and safety with the benefit of technological advancements to continue maximising safety for our users.”\n\nThe dispute began in August 2025, when the union had been poised to ballot several hundred of TikTok’s moderators and quality assurance agents from the trust and safety team, whose job was to vet posts for compliance with TikTok’s rules – including traumatic posts processed at high speed. TikTok announced a restructuring exercise that put members of the proposed bargaining unit at risk of redundancy, according to the legal claim.\n\nRosa Curling, a co-executive director of the tech justice non-profit Foxglove, which is backing the action, called TikTok’s treatment of its content moderators “appalling”.\n\nShe said by “laying off essential safety workers they are putting the platforms’ users at risk”, adding: “TikTok has made its position clear: union busting and trampling on our labour laws comes first – the safety of its users, including millions of children, and the wellbeing of its essential safety workers, comes last. We hope the employment tribunal will force them to change course.”\n\nAccording to TikTok, its increasing use of AI has reduced moderators’ exposure to graphic content by 76% in the past year.\n\nMichael Newman, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “This case is an important example of how individuals who band together can stand up to the might of big tech firms, and especially of how the fig leaf of AI cost savings should not be allowed to obscure vital safety concerns.”",

By the end of 2025, he had spent 88 days—one quarter of the year—at a golf course, according to the Trump Golf Tracker.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what Graham told prosecutors.\n\nThe more questions arise about Trump’s golf game, the more he seems to brag. In a Thanksgiving phone call with troops, he claimed to have won 38 golf titles.\n\nGolf writer Rick Reilly, who wrote the Trump book Commander in Cheat, said the real number was zero.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil landed an interview with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and one of the unusual moments came when the president talked of what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nThe president was claiming Harris would have continued what he called a “mess” of an economy under Joe Biden.\n\nTony Dokoupil’s First Week As ‘CBS Evening News’ Anchor Down Year Over Year; ‘World News Tonight’ Tops Viewers, ‘Nightly News’ Wins 25-54 Demo\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nNew 'CBS Evening News' Anchor Tony Dokoupil To Interview Donald Trump\n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now, if she got in. You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "Who was the Milwaukee area's top prep athlete last week? You tell us.\n\nYou can vote for the Piggly Wiggly Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Athlete of the Week until 3 p.m. Jan. 17. You don't have to be a subscriber to vote. Votes are limited to one per hour per device.\n\nArrowhead boys basketball's Trey Resch was the winner of last week's poll.\n\nHere are this week's nominees. If the poll does not display, refresh your browser.\n\nThe first-year competitive swimmer has dropped seven seconds on his 200-yard freestyle time and four seconds from his 100-yard freestyle time while providing a valuable boost to Tremper's 200 and 400 freestyle relay teams.\n\nFofana scored 30 points, along with seven rebounds and six assists, in an 80-68 win over Pius XI Catholic on Jan. 6.\n\nThe senior broke two school records in the 100- and 200-yard freestyle events in a meet with Cedarburg, including Zach Miller's 100 record (:49.48) by finishing in :49.29 and Adam Jajtner's 200 time (1:49.72) by finishing in 1:47.44. He also broke his own 200-yard individual medley record (2:02.48) at the Cedarburg Bulldog Invite on Jan. 10 by breaking two minutes with his time of 1:59.39.\n\nThe senior had a huge week during the Owls’ 3-0 week with wins over Riverside, previously unbeaten King and Hamilton. She totaled 57 points and 58 rebounds in the three wins, including a 20-point, 26-rebound performance in a 60-30 rout of Riverside on Jan. 7.\n\nThe forward was clutch for the Stars in victories last week over University School of Milwaukee and Arrowhead. Zizka tallied an assist on a goal in the third period to make it 2-0 in a 2-1 win over USM and then, in another 2-1 victory over Arrowhead, Zizka lit the lamp twice, including the game-winning goal at the 9:27 mark of the third period.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Vote for Piggly Wiggly high school athlete of the week for Jan. 5-10",
