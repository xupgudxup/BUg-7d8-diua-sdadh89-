    "description": "Sergey Brin, Max Levchin, Eric Schmidt, and others donated $35 million to ballot measure committees in January.",
    "fullText": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin is one of the many California-based billionaires pouring millions into donations ahead of the state's proposed wealth tax.\n\nBrin, along with other tech executives, venture capitalists, and philanthropists, donated a combined $35 million to ballot measure committees in January, supporting affordable housing ballots in California, per a disclosure seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe disclosure was filed by the coalition \"Building a Better California.\"\n\nBrin was the largest contributor in the filing, donating $20 million. Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Parents, teachers and young people share their views on whether social media restrictions would work in the UK\n\nPressure is mounting on the UK government to introduce a ban on social media for under-16s, after a decisive vote in House of Lords in favour of Australian-style restrictions.\n\nPeers backed a Tory-led amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill by 261 votes to 150, despite the government opposing the move. Ministers are already considering a ban as part of a consultation due to report by the summer and so the Lords amendment is unlikely to pass in the Commons. Starmer is also understood to want to wait until evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December, has been assessed, though the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has urged him to “just get on with it”.\n\nHere parents, teachers and young people share their views.\n\nLaura, a parent from East Dunbartonshire, says the scale of harmful content circulating on social media has left many families feeling powerless. Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.\n\n“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”\n\nLaura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”\n\nRachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.\n\n“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”\n\nIn the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”\n\nRachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.\n\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”\n\nJulia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.\n\n“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”\n\nFrom the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.\n\n“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”\n\nBut she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.\n\n“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”\n\nTahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.\n\nTahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.\n\nBut feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.\n\nShe believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”\n\nAJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.\n\n“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”\n\nAJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.\n\n“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”\n\nThey are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.\n\n“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.\n\nPhil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.\n\nIn principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.\n\nPhil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”",

    "description": "Polian addresses his vote on SiriusXM NFL Radio,",
    "fullText": "The Bill Belichick snub led to another compelling storyline regarding the role of Hall of Fame G.M. Bill Polian in the outcome. A day later, an important point of clarification has emerged.\n\nPolian, after saying he voted for Belichick before saying he can't say with 100 percent certainty whether he did, says he did indeed vote for his former New England nemesis.\n\n“I voted for coach Belichick in the Hall of Fame selection meeting,” Polian said in an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio, after explaining he was reading from a prepared statement. “The Pro Football Hall of Fame has confirmed that fact through the auditors of the selection process. Again, I’ll state that I never said that I believe that Coach Belichick should quote, wait a year, close quote, for enshrinement. This has been confirmed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, numerous selectors who were in the room, and my vote for coach Belichick. As a Hall of Fame member and selector, I realize the import of what we do. I’ve always tried as a selector to make these difficult choices with the utmost of objectivity. I’ve said on SiriusXM Radio and numerous other media outlets that I believe Coach Belichick to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, my vote confirms that.”\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter. Not enough of the voters voted for Belichick. At least 11 of 50 failed to include Belichick among three selections from a group that included Belichick, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig, and L.C. Greenwood.\n\nFrom those five choices, who would be your three? And is there any way Belichick wouldn't be one of them?",

    "description": "Here's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.",
    "fullText": "Why Bill Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer after controversial vote: 'Six Super Bowls isn't enough?' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBill Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history and the only head coach with six Super Bowl wins, but that isn't enough to make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nIn his first year of eligibility, the former New England Patriots coach was not elected to Canton, as he did not reach the 40 votes necessary to earn an election. Belichick will remain on the ballot moving forward, but he will not be part of a prestigious group to earn a first-ballot election.\n\nBelichick's NFL coaching career ended on a sour note, but he still has 302 regular season wins, third most all-time, and 31 playoff wins, which is the most all-time. Belichick's six Super Bowls are two more than second place, and his nine Super Bowl appearances are three more than second place.\n\nHere's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best Patriots of all time\n\nAccording to ESPN, Belichick didn't get enough votes necessary to make the Hall of Fame due to his baggage in the NFL. ESPN reports that Belichick's roles in both Spygate and Deflategate kept him out on first try, as some voters may think Belichick should wait at least a year as some sort of punishment.\n\n\"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a veteran Hall voter said, via ESPN. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"\n\nAdditionally, the voting process for coaches is different than the process for players. Belichick is one of five owners, executives, coaches and players competing for up to three available spots separate from teh 15 modern-era finalists, forcing each voter to pick three of those five.\n\nAlong with Belichick, the other four finalists include Patriots owner Robert Kraft, former quarterback Ken Anderson, former running back Roger Craig and former defensive end L.C. Greenwood.\n\nESPN writer and Hall of Fame voter Mike Sando explained the difficult process of voting for these players, saying that they have an extremely high bar to clear.\n\nI'm a HOF voter who saw Belichick as slam-dunk. I don't know anything about voting results, but if this is true, and we'll find out officially next week, the question is, how could this happen?\n\nBefore I list possibilities, understand this:\n\nBelichick, Kraft, Craig, Anderson &… https://t.co/V8okBDsReH\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 27, 2026\n\nMORE: Who is on the Mount Rushmore of Boston sports?\n\n\"Spygate\" was a Patriots cheating scandal from the 2007 season. Then-New York Jets head coach, and former Patriots assistant, Eric Mangini tipped off the NFL to the Patriots illegally videotaping Jets' defensive signals on the sidelines.\n\nThe NFL ultimately fined Belichick $500,000, the Patriots $250,000, and forced New England to forfeit its 2008 first-round pick.\n\nMORE: What was Bill Belichick's record without Tom Brady\n\nWhen Belichick found out he did not make the Hall of Fame, the veteran coach was understandably upset. ESPN reports that Belichick was \"puzzled\" and \"disappointed\" by his omission from the Hall this year, as he believes he was left out due to \"politics\"instead of accomplishments.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick reportedly asked an associate. \"What does a guy have to do?\"\n\nMORE: The 10 longest-tenured coaches in NFL history\n\nHere are the hall-of-fame coaches who were elected to the Hall on first ballot.\n\nBoth Halas and Lambeau were elected to the Hall of Fame as part of the first ever induction class, so they weren't first-ballot in the same way the other three were. Shula is the all-time wins leader, while he, Landry and Noll have a combined eight Super Bowl titles and 15 Super Bowl appearances.\n\nMORE: Breaking down the worst losses of Bill Belichick's career\n\nThere are 50 Hall of Fame voters that comprise of NFL writers and a media members. Among the voters are foremr Indianapolis Colts GM Bill Polian, who works for SiriusXM NFL radio and reportedly believes Belichick should wait a year to be inducted.\n\nThe full list of NFL Hall of Fame voters can be found here.\n\nBill Belichick has six Super Bowl victories, which is the most all-time among NFL coaches. Only Tom Brady has more Super Bowls as a player, and six of his seven came with Belichick as his head coach.\n\nBill Belichick is 73 years old, but is still coaching as he is about to enter his second season as North Carolina's head coach.",

    "description": "Senate Democrats say they won't vote for a bill to fund DHS after the deadly ICE shooting, threatening to imperil a broader government funding effort.",
    "fullText": "Just days ago, it looked like the US would avoid a repeat of the government shutdown that took place in the fall.\n\nThen, federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the span of just a few hours following the shooting on Saturday, the odds that the government will shut down later this week rose from roughly 10% to the high 70s on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.\n\nThat's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\n\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. \"Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"\n\nThere are only two ways out of this:\n\nBut even if lawmakers go with the second option, a short shutdown through the weekend is likely.\n\nTo avoid a government shutdown after midnight late Friday evening, the Senate would need to pass the six-bill package, which funds DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things.\n\nThose six bills have already passed the House, and they've been stitched together into one larger package in the Senate.\n\nThe GOP may control the upper chamber, but they can't ignore Democrats. Due to the Senate's 60-vote \"filibuster\" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one.\n\nDemocrats are only opposed to the DHS bill, and Schumer has called on Republicans to work with Democrats to separate out the bills. But the GOP has balked so far at that idea.\n\nFurthermore, even if the bills are separated, the House would have to vote on them again to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nThe House is out of session until next week, meaning a shutdown at least until then is highly likely.\n\nJust months ago, the federal government shut down for 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad.\n\nFor one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30.\n\nSNAP and WIC payments would be unaffected, Capitol Hill staffers would still get paid, and national parks would likely remain open.\n\nAdditionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward.\n\nIn the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding.\n\nThat means it's plausible that the Senate would separate out the other five bills, the House would re-pass those bills next week, and the partial shutdown would only last a few days.\n\nStill, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. It also funds the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThat raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time.\n\nAdditionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.\n\nWhile the current DHS funding bill contains an additional $10 billion for ICE, the agency also received roughly $75 billion in funding via the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" in July.\n\nUnless lawmakers were to agree to rescind that funding — extremely unlikely given GOP control of Congress — that money's here to stay.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump may still dominate the news cycle, but inside the White House, the foundations of his power are weakening—and he knows it, according to Trump’s biographer.\n\nOn the latest episode of Inside Trump’s Head, author Michael Wolff described a White House increasingly gripped by anxiety as the president enters a pivotal midterm year burdened by collapsing polls, international resistance, self-inflicted crises that refuse to fade, and growing alarm among aides that Trump is losing interest in the presidency.\n\n“If you lose Donald Trump’s interest, you lose Donald Trump,” Wolff said.\n\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s not interested in bureaucracy. He’s interested in unfettered attention.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, the daily work of governing—incremental wins, trade-offs, and detail—bores Trump, draining his energy at a moment when political discipline matters most.\n\nThat disengagement has become increasingly visible on the world stage. After heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos expecting to be treated as an untouchable strongman, Trump instead encountered coordinated resistance from allies who, Wolff argued, are no longer content to maneuver quietly around him.\n\n“Trump’s virtue to voters is that no matter what happened, he looked strong,” Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.\n\n“Now he cannot take Greenland, he cannot take Canada, he cannot do any of the things that he has huffed and puffed and said he will do.”\n\nWolff said the same pattern is playing out at home, where the administration has struggled to contain the fallout in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal immigration officers this month, further inflaming protests and political backlash.\n\n“This has now become a very, very complicated situation,” Wolff said.\n\nFor Trump, Minneapolis represents the kind of crisis he finds hardest to manage: one that can’t be bullied into submission or drowned out by spectacle.\n\n“He cannot threaten his way out of it,” Wolff said.\n\n“He can’t seem to generate a new headline to get himself out of it,” he continued. “The headlines that are generated are bad headlines.”\n\nThat dynamic, Wolff argued, points to a broader problem for Trump as the midterms approach. Governing, he said, demands a tolerance for incremental progress, which is at odds with Trump’s appetite for dominance and immediate results.\n\n“The work of the presidency does not inspire him,” Wolff said.\n\n“If it becomes complicated, that has to be pushed to the side.”\n\nAs Trump disengages, Wolff went on to say, the president has increasingly turned to performative conflict, including high-profile lawsuits and public feuds with powerful institutions. Once effective at projecting strength, those tactics now risk reinforcing the impression of a leader struggling to maintain control.\n\n“There’s only so many times you can sue people for $5 billion or $20 billion,” Wolff said. “You look foolish.”\n\nWith a little over nine months until the midterm elections, Wolff framed the moment as a genuine inflection point—not just for Republicans, but for Trump himself.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a pivotal campaign,” Wolff said.\n\n“Conceivably one of the most important campaigns ever waged. This is potentially, in November, the end of Donald Trump.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "description": "Sen. Adam Schiff also argued the money funded to DHS has been “wasted hand over fist.\"",
    "fullText": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Ca.) declared Sunday he’s “not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating” as deadly sweeping Immigration and Custom Enforcement raids led by the Trump administration have sparked political and public backlash.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Schiff made the statement after moderator Kristen Welker asked him if he’s “prepared to vote against Department of Homeland Security funding if it means partially shutting down the government, again, coming on the heels of an incredibly long shutdown.”\n\nPolitics: Democrats Consider Partial Government Shutdown To Curb ICE\n\nTelling Welker straight up that “Democrats are not going to fund that,” he continued, “The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding. It will be a Republican decision. They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”\n\nThe California senator noted Democrats are hoping “some of the Republicans in the Senate may see those scenes in the streets and be as repelled as we are, and vote against that continuation of violence also.”\n\nHe added: “If they don’t, it will be their decision whether they couple that funding for these ICE agents and Border Patrol agents with all these other government agencies.”\n\n“[Republicans] will make the decision. They’re in the majority if they want to shut down the government so they can perpetuate this violence,” Schiff said.\n\nPolitics: Sworn Witness Accounts Of Alex Pretti Killing Differ Sharply From DHS\n\nSchiff went on to vow he’s “not going to be a part of it.”\n\n“And I think anyone who votes to give them more money to do this will share in the responsibility and see more Americans die in our cities as a result.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker asked Schiff what the “exact impact” would be if legislators withhold funding now, considering “Republicans have already passed $170 billion in extra DHS funding through what they’ve dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Well, it would certainly, I hope, stop it from becoming even worse,” he responded. “They have thrown so much money at these agencies. They don’t know what to do with it. And there is no question that when we actually get a chance to do oversight again, which I hope will happen after this November, you are going to find all kinds of corruption [with] how that money is going out.”\n\nPolitics: House Passes Bill Funding ICE — With Help From Democrats\n\nSchiff then told Welker he believes they will find that the money has been “wasted hand over fist.”\n\n“There is going to be enormous waste, fraud and abuse in DHS given how money is being spent without any kind of real oversight,” he said.\n\nWatch Schiff’s interview on “Meet the Press” below.\n\nTrump Takes Aim At ‘Corrupt’ Adam Schiff As Next Target In His Political Retribution Tour\n\nAdam Schiff Calls Out Trump For 'Flip-Flopping' On Abortion\n\nRep.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods and products exported to the US should Ottawa make a trade deal with China.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whom he called \"Governor Carney,\" against making a \"drop off\" deal with Beijing or face the levies.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,\" he added.\n\nCarney made an official visit to China last week — the first by a Canadian leader since 2017 — meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss economic and trade opportunities between the two countries.\n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, Ottawa and Beijing said they had committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment, as well as building cooperation in areas such as energy and agriculture.\n\nCarney also announced that Canada would now allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market on the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In return, he said Canada expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by March 1.\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was what Carney \"should be doing\" and that it was \"a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"\n\nTrump's changing tone comes days after Carney delivered an impassioned speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he opined on the changing face of global politics since Trump's election.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney, who did not explicitly name Trump, said, adding that \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nTrump did not miss the opportunity to snap back at Carney during his own speech at Davos, saying the prime minister \"wasn't so grateful.\"\n\n\"Canada lives because of the United States.

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

He also placed Brigham Young, a Notre Dame 2026 opponent who also was skipped over in the College Football Playoff at No. 11.\n\nThere was a big omission as well, as Freeman opted to leave USC out of his top-25 all-together. This was most likely a jab at the Trojans, who decided that they couldn’t play Notre Dame anymore due to the potential of missing out on the CFP. It was a weak eat out of the storied rivalry, and Freeman made sure they knew it as well.\n\nIt was fun to see how the Irish’s leader opted to vote in the final coaches poll, as he most likely didn’t have one of his staff members submit the picks.\n\nThis is Marcus Freeman’s final Coaches Poll ballot of the 2025 season, via @usatodaysports.\n\nOf note, out of 62 coaches…\n\n-He was one of 16 who had Notre Dame ranked ahead of Alabama.\n\n-He was one of 16 who did not rank USC. pic.twitter.com/T8em4buRBM\n\n— Tyler Horka (@tbhorka) January 21, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: See who Marcus Freeman omitted in his final coaches poll vote of 2026",

    "fullText": "Just months ago, Elon Musk seemed to swear off major political spending. That seems to be over now.\n\nThe tech titan has poured $10 million into a super PAC backing GOP Senate candidate Nate Morris in Kentucky, according to Axios and The New York Times.\n\nIt would be Musk's largest publicly known single contribution to a political candidate since the 2024 election, when he spent nearly $300 million and emerged as the GOP's largest donor.\n\nMorris, an entrepreneur and tech executive running on an \"America First\" platform, is running against two other candidates to succeed the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell. He's been backed by a slew of MAGA-aligned politicians and figures, though President Donald Trump has yet to make an endorsement in the race.\n\nOn an episode of Donald Trump Jr's \"Triggered\" podcast on Monday, Morris said that the super PAC contribution came after he had a \"terrific meeting\" with Musk last week.\n\n\"He got excited about the race, and I think he was excited that I was a business guy and entrepreneur, and decided to make a big contribution to the super PAC that's going to be helping our campaign,\" Morris said. \"We're so delighted to have Elon's support, and for him to go all-in on us.\"\n\nMusk has not yet publicly commented on the reported contribution, and spokespeople for Musk and his companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe world's richest man has also reported to have made major contributions to super PACs tied to House and Senate GOP leadership. It comes as he's appeared to largely mend his relationship with Trump.\n\n\"America is toast if the radical left wins,\" Musk wrote on X earlier this month in response to reports of those contributions. \"They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore.\"\n\nThe details of Musk's contributions will be publicly disclosed to the Federal Election Commission at the end of January.\n\nMore broadly, Musk appears to be re-engaging with American politics, posting about hot-button topics including immigration and his support for legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting.\n\nMusk spending big on an election would mark something of a reversal from the middle of last year.\n\nShortly before his feud with Trump erupted into public view, Musk declared that he was scaling back his political contributions.\n\n\"If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. \"I do not currently see a reason.\"\n\nThose comments came a month after he spent millions to support a GOP candidate in a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, only for that candidate to lose handily.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Letter signed by figures on right and left of party says UK should follow Australia’s example by enacting ban\n\nMore than 60 Labour MPs have written to Keir Starmer urging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, with peers due to vote on the issue this week.\n\nThe MPs, who include select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party, are looking to put pressure on the prime minister as calls mount for the UK to follow Australia’s precedent.\n\nStarmer has said he is open to a ban but members of the House of Lords are looking to force the issue when they vote this week on an amendment to the children, wellbeing and schools bill that would enact one within a year of the bill passing.\n\nThe vote could pit Labour peers against the prime minister, who is understood to want to wait to assess the evidence from the Australian ban, which came into force in December.\n\nIn the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”\n\nThey add: “Around the world, governments are recognising the severity of this crisis and taking action.” Noting existing or pending legislation in Australia, Denmark, France, Norway, New Zealand and Greece, they say: “We believe the onus must be placed on technology platforms, not parents, to prevent underage access. We would support a model similar to Australia’s that requires companies to take meaningful steps to enforce age limits.”\n\nThey conclude: “We urge the government to show leadership on this issue by introducing a minimum age for social media access of 16 years old.”\n\nThe signatories of the letter represent a wide spectrum of opinion within the party. They include Helen Hayes, the chair of the education select committee, and Florence Eshalomi, the chair of the housing and local government committee.\n\nOthers include Vicky Foxcroft, the former whip who helped lead the rebellion against the government’s proposed welfare cuts, and Catherine McKinnell, a former education minister. The letter has support from some on the left of the party such as Richard Burgon, and on the right such as the prominent “blue Labour” MP Jonathan Hinder.\n\nThe weight of Commons support for a ban will put further pressure on the prime minister, who has previously been sceptical about whether such a move would work, but who told MPs at a recent meeting that he would be open to one in theory.\n\nIn recent days, government figures have stressed they are concerned that a ban could force children on to the dark web, and they want to see more evidence before committing to enforcing one in the UK.\n\nOne source close to Starmer said: “In principle, Keir is in favour of a ban. We can all see the dangers and worry about what is happening to young people’s minds. But there are still big obstacles to overcome with implementation. We can already see that from Australia. We need to take our time and make sure we get this right.”\n\nA Downing Street figure suggested Starmer could give a ban his symbolic support soon, but the government would then take its time over implementation, “ironing out” any difficulties first.\n\nThey said: “It’s Keir’s direction of travel but there’s lots of hurdles to overcome first. We’re not going to rush into this.”\n\nLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: “There are strong arguments for banning under-16s from social media but there are also real concerns raised by the NSPCC and others about whether it pushes children to darker, less-regulated places on the internet.”\n\nThose arguments were reinforced over the weekend by Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after looking at suicide content online. Russell told the BBC’s Newscast he opposed what he called “sledgehammer-like techniques like bans”.\n\nThe prime minister’s position will be put to the test this week when peers vote on an amendment by the Conservative member John Nash to the children wellbeing and schools bill proposing enacting an age limit within 12 months of the bill’s passage.\n\nLabour has not said how it intends to vote on the issue yet but several peers are expected to support it regardless of whips’ instructions.\n\nThey include the former MP Luciana Berger, who has co-signed Nash’s amendment. She told the Guardian: “The proposal for raising the social media age limit for under-16s enjoys huge support – across the country and within the Labour party. Social media is catastrophically harming children and we must act now to protect them. I urge peers to back our amendment on Wednesday so we can give young people their childhood back.”",

    "description": "Despite midterm elections in November, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 to deliver double-digit returns over the next year.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 has usually performs poorly during midterm election years, declining by an average 18% at some point before November.\n\nThe stock market usually performs well after midterm elections (as policy uncertainty dissipates), returning an average of 14% during the next six months.\n\nWall Street's consensus estimate puts the S&P 500 at 8,085 by January 2027, which implies more than 16% upside from its current level of 6,940.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has delivered double-digit returns in three consecutive years. Wall Street expects the index to extend its streak in 2026, but midterm election years typically involve sharp declines.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has consistently performed poorly during midterm election years since it was created in 1957. Here are two facts investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has returned an average of 1% during midterm election years, but the index has declined by an average of 7% during those years when a new president sits in the White House.\n\nThe S&P 500 has suffered an average intra-year drawdown of 18% during midterm election years, meaning history says the index will drop 18% at some point in 2026.\n\nWhat explains that trend? Midterm elections create uncertainty, especially because the political party in power tends to lose seats in Congress. Investors are unsure where to put money because they are unsure whether the president will retain enough congressional votes to maintain the status quo. Uncertainty is poison to the stock market.\n\nHowever, policy uncertainty dissipates quickly after the midterm election results are finalized, and the stock market tends to deliver strong returns. In fact, Carson Research says the six-month period following a midterm election (i.e., November through April) is the strongest of the four-year presidential cycle. The S&P 500 has added an average of 14% in those six months.\n\nDoes that mean you should sell your stocks today and buy them back in November? Nope. Attempts to time the market often backfire. Famous fund manager Peter Lynch once said, \"Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, or trying to time the market, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\"\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has done quite well during some midterm election years. The index's return has ranged from up 38% to down 30%, and its largest intra-year decline has ranged from 4% to 38%. Most Wall Street analysts expect 2026 to be one of the better midterm election years.",

    "fullText": "Moderators accuse social media firm of unfair dismissal after it fired hundreds in UK just before vote to form union\n\nTikTok moderators have accused the social media company of “oppressive and intimidating” union busting after it fired hundreds of workers in the UK, beginning the process just before they were due to vote on forming a union.\n\nThe moderators wanted to establish a collective bargaining unit to protect themselves from the personal costs of checking extreme and violent content, and have claimed TikTok is guilty of unfair dismissal and breaching trade union laws.\n\nAbout 400 moderators in London were fired before Christmas in a process initiated a week before the vote was due to take place.\n\nTikTok, which has about 30m monthly users in Britain, strongly denies a legal claim that has been lodged with an employment tribunal on behalf of three former workers, describing it as “baseless”.\n\nIt said the sackings were part of a global restructuring involving roles in the UK, and south and south-east Asia amid the increasing use of AI to automate the removal of posts that violate content rules, with 91% of transgressive content now removed automatically.\n\nBut John Chadfield, the national officer for tech workers at the Communication Workers Union, which represented about 250 of the affected moderators, said of the legal action: “This is holding TikTok to account for union busting.”\n\nHe added: “Content moderators have the most dangerous job on the internet. They are exposed to the child sex abuse material, executions, war and drug use. Their job is to make sure this content doesn’t reach TikTok’s 30 million monthly users. It is high pressure and low paid. They wanted input into their workflows and more say over how they kept the platform safe. They said they were being asked to do too much with too few resources.”\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said: “These changes were part of a wider global reorganisation, as we evolve our global operating model for trust and safety with the benefit of technological advancements to continue maximising safety for our users.”\n\nThe dispute began in August 2025, when the union had been poised to ballot several hundred of TikTok’s moderators and quality assurance agents from the trust and safety team, whose job was to vet posts for compliance with TikTok’s rules – including traumatic posts processed at high speed. TikTok announced a restructuring exercise that put members of the proposed bargaining unit at risk of redundancy, according to the legal claim.\n\nRosa Curling, a co-executive director of the tech justice non-profit Foxglove, which is backing the action, called TikTok’s treatment of its content moderators “appalling”.\n\nShe said by “laying off essential safety workers they are putting the platforms’ users at risk”, adding: “TikTok has made its position clear: union busting and trampling on our labour laws comes first – the safety of its users, including millions of children, and the wellbeing of its essential safety workers, comes last. We hope the employment tribunal will force them to change course.”\n\nAccording to TikTok, its increasing use of AI has reduced moderators’ exposure to graphic content by 76% in the past year.\n\nMichael Newman, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “This case is an important example of how individuals who band together can stand up to the might of big tech firms, and especially of how the fig leaf of AI cost savings should not be allowed to obscure vital safety concerns.”",

By the end of 2025, he had spent 88 days—one quarter of the year—at a golf course, according to the Trump Golf Tracker.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what Graham told prosecutors.\n\nThe more questions arise about Trump’s golf game, the more he seems to brag. In a Thanksgiving phone call with troops, he claimed to have won 38 golf titles.\n\nGolf writer Rick Reilly, who wrote the Trump book Commander in Cheat, said the real number was zero.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil landed an interview with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and one of the unusual moments came when the president talked of what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nThe president was claiming Harris would have continued what he called a “mess” of an economy under Joe Biden.\n\nTony Dokoupil’s First Week As ‘CBS Evening News’ Anchor Down Year Over Year; ‘World News Tonight’ Tops Viewers, ‘Nightly News’ Wins 25-54 Demo\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nNew 'CBS Evening News' Anchor Tony Dokoupil To Interview Donald Trump\n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now, if she got in. You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "The Associated Press announced the 2025 NFL All-Pro first and second teams. The Arizona Cardinals had only one player make one of the squads, and it is no surprise.\n\nFollowing his record-breaking season, tight end Trey McBride is a first-team All-Pro.\n\nHe was one vote short of joining Seattle Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua as the only unanimous first-team All-Pros. Forty-nine of the 50 voters gave McBride a first-place vote at tight end. The other went to San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle.\n\nMcBride finished the season with 126 receptions for 1,239 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe was second in the NFL in catches only to Nacua, who had 129. He set an NFL single-season record for receptions by a tight end, breaking Zach Ertz' 2018 mark of 116. He broke his own single-season franchise record for receptions by a tight end and set the franchise single-season record for receptions by anyone, beating DeAndre Hopkins' 2020 mark of 115.\n\nHis 1,239 yards are the most in a season in franchise history by a tight end. He was sixth in the NFL in receiving yards and tied for second in receiving touchdowns.\n\nHe was one of very few bright spots for the Cardinals in 2025, who went 3-14.\n\nThis will surely be the first of what could be many All-Pro nods for McBride in his career.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump laid into Republican Senator Susan Collins in an expletive-laden phone call after she voted against one of his top priorities.\n\nThe president reportedly made a “profanity-laced” call to the vulnerable Republican senator on Thursday, sources told The Hill. Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touched on canceling the election while also dismissing the prospect in a wide-ranging speech on Jan. 6.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans at the newly dubbed \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" he encouraged the lawmakers to campaign on his priorities to keep control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. He expressed confusion about the poor public opinion of his job performance, saying Republicans have the \"right policy.\"\n\nRiffing on tariffs during his speech, he said, \"if you have the wrong president, nothing's good.\"\n\n\"We found that out for four years... They had the worst policy and we have to even run against these people,\" he said. \"I won't say 'cancel the election, they should cancel the election,' because the fake news will say 'he wants the elections canceled, he's a dictator.' They always call me a dictator.\"\n\nTrump vs. the midterm blues: Can he get MAGA voters excited (and voting) in 2026?\n\nRepublicans currently hold the majority in both chambers of Congress, though the House's majority is shrinking with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's departure and unexpected emergencies with other GOP members.\n\nThe president's party often loses in midterm elections, though Trump in his speech rallied to break that trend. His political future depends on it, he said.\n\n\"You’ve got to win the midterms,” Trump said. “If we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be – they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”\n\nTrump was impeached twice in his first term by House Democrats, and the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nEvery House Representative and a third of Senators will be up for reelection on Nov. 3, 2026, when various local and state elections will also happen. That means any eligible U.S. citizen could vote in the midterm.\n\nMidterm elections usually see lower voter turnout compared to presidential election years. Though 2018, the midterms in Trump's first term, brought a jump in turnout at 53.4%, according to Census Bureau data. In 2022, the turnout was 52.2%. Compare those to the 2020 presidential election, a record-breaking year, which saw a turnout rate of 66.8%.\n\nOlder voters are more likely to turn out in non-presidential years and also more likely to vote Republican, according to Reuters. White voters and college-educated voters made up a larger portion of voters than nonvoters in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Zachary Schermele, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nHe also voted for Trump, but after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) implemented deep cuts to the federal agencies that manage America’s public lands in 2025, Zink is openly second-guessing his vote.\n\n“You won’t meet anyone more conservative than me, and I didn’t vote for this,” Zink told Politico (1). “You cannot fire our firefighters. You cannot fire our trail crews. You have to have selective logging, and water restoration, and healthy forests.”\n\nAcross Montana, the impact is already being felt. Hunters are running into overgrown trails, ranchers are watching as drought resilience and wildfire mitigation funds are frozen, and outfitters and guides — who brought in roughly $314 million to Montana in 2024 — are dealing with staffing cuts that have affected their business.\n\nAnd this isn’t just happening in Montana.\n\nVersions of this scenario are playing out across the west, with real consequences for rural jobs, small businesses and the cost of hunting and fishing on public lands.\n\nSince early 2024, the federal workforce that manages America’s public lands has shrunk by about 20%, dropping from 79,070 employees to 63,141 by September 2025, according to the Center for American Progress (2).\n\nThe cuts have hit these specific agencies the hardest (3):\n\nU.S. Forest Service: Approximately 3,400 jobs cut\n\nNational Park Service: Approximately 1,000 jobs cut\n\nBureau of Land Management: Approximately 800 jobs cut\n\nRoughly 97% of Bureau of Land Management employees work outside of D.C., often in small remote towns where federal agencies are among the biggest employers (4). When ranger stations close or seasonal crews disappear, the economic fallout can spread to local gas stations, restaurants and diners, as well as hotels and motels.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion in economic output in 2023, made up 2.3% of U.S. GDP and supported five million jobs (5). States like Montana, Alaska, Vermont and Hawaii rely on outdoor recreation at twice the national average. In Montana alone, the sector pumped $3.4 billion into the state economy in 2023 (6).",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — There are few signs that President Donald Trump’s supporters wanted the United States to become more embroiled in foreign conflicts ahead of its military actions in Venezuela — even as many Republicans show initial support for his military strike there, according to an Associated Press analysis of recent polling.\n\nMost Americans wanted the U.S. government to focus in 2026 on domestic issues, such as health care and high costs, rather than foreign policy issues, an AP-NORC poll conducted last month found. Meanwhile, polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. may take a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere, Republicans in polling last fall remained broadly opposed to the U.S. getting more involved in other countries’ problems.\n\nThere’s still room for public opinion to shift as Trump's administration clarifies its next steps for Venezuela. But it could be a challenging issue for the Republican president, particularly given Americans’ desire for the government to fix economic issues at home.\n\nForeign policy and drug trade weren’t high priorities for many Americans\n\nHeading into the new year, Americans were less likely to want the government to focus on foreign policy than they had been in recent years.\n\nAbout one-quarter of U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics — such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel or general involvement overseas — as something they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026, according to an open-ended AP-NORC question that asked respondents to share up to five issues they wanted the government to work on in the coming year. That was down from the prior two years, when roughly one-third of Americans considered foreign issues an important focus. Almost no one specifically named Venezuela.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges on Monday in New York. His capture followed U.S. strikes on boats that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on the issue of drug trafficking, it doesn’t register at the top of Americans' lists of issues for the government to focus on. Few Americans mentioned drug-related issues as a priority, and it was primarily a Republican issue. About 1 in 10 Republicans mentioned it, compared with hardly any Democrats or independents.\n\nInstead, Americans overall were more focused on domestic issues — including health care, economic worries and cost-of-living concerns — as top priorities for the government.\n\nMore Americans say the US should not run Venezuela\n\nAmericans are split about the U.S. capturing Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure. Republicans broadly approved of the action, while Democrats were largely opposed to it.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said that the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.\n\nIn December, a Quinnipiac poll found that about 6 in 10 registered voters opposed U.S. military action in Venezuela. Republicans were more divided: About half were in support, while about one-third were opposed and 15% didn’t have an opinion.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the US more involved in the world’s problems\n\nOnly about 1 in 10 Republicans wanted the U.S. to take a “more active role” role in solving the world’s problems, according to an AP-NORC poll from September. They were much less likely than Americans overall, or Democrats and independents, to say the U.S. should become more involved. Most Republicans, 55%, said the current U.S. role in global issues was “about right.”\n\nIt could be a tricky position for a president who ran on a promise of putting “America first” and ending the country’s involvement in “forever wars.” About 7 in 10 voters who backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election said that they wanted the U.S. to take a “less active” role in solving the world’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states.\n\nBut at least in that poll, which was conducted before the military operation that removed Maduro, Trump's supporters still were largely behind him: About 1 in 10 Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 felt he had deserted the “America First” promise, while the overwhelming majority felt he had kept it.",

    "fullText": "A surprise contender with a very familiar name could throw a huge monkey wrench in Vice President JD Vance’s bid for the 2028 GOP nomination for president.\n\nThe Independent reported that President Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., could be a popular White House choice for Republicans in three years.\n\nPresident Trump has spoken favorably of Vance as his potential White House successor. The president has said that a GOP ticket of Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in 2028 could be formidable.\n\nVance has also widely led in polls on the 2028 race.\n\nBut polls issued last year showed Vance’s lead shrinking and a surprise candidate coming on strong: Trump Jr.\n\nA McLaughlin & Associates poll in August had Vance at 36% support, with Trump Jr. far behind at 16%.\n\nBut that gap narrowed in a survey in October, with Vance at 38% and Trump Jr. at 20%.\n\nThen in November, a survey showed Vance slipping to 34% and Trump Jr. surging to 24.\n\nWhen asked in May if he would seek the White House, Trump Jr. said, “I don’t know. Maybe one day, you know, that calling is there.”\n\nTrump Jr.’s surge in the McLaughlin poll has led to speculation that were he to win the presidency, he would resign in favor of his father, who would then take the reins for a third term in the White House.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits anyone from being elected to more than two terms as president. President Trump is currently in his second term in the White House.\n\nAnd the 12th Amendment would prohibit President Trump from running as vice president on a ticket with his son.",

    "title": "FEC Obstructed from Enforcing Campaign Finance Laws for Last 250 Days",
    "description": "The Federal Election Commission needs its ability to function restored, without sacrificing its independence.",
    "fullText": "Since Thursday, the bipartisan Federal Election Commission hasn’t been able do its job. That’s because the independent agency, which oversees money in campaigns for federal office, no longer has the minimum four required members to do most business.\n\nThe loss of quorum is due to the resignation of a Republican appointee, coupled with President Trump’s unprecedented move in February to fire a Democratic appointee. Such a shortfall has only happened three other times in the FEC’s 50-year history, including twice during Trump’s first term.\n\nOrdinarily, the big question would be how fast the president and Congress will move to restore a full complement of commissioners so the agency can function. That is still important. But in light of the firing and the president’s other steps to exert control over the FEC and other independent agencies, there is now a much bigger issue: Will the FEC be able to continue as an independent watchdog at all? Because even worse than a dormant FEC is one that could be weaponized against the president’s opponents.\n\nThe FEC was created as part of the post-Watergate reforms that established our current system of campaign contribution limits and disclosure requirements. It is led by six commissioners, no more than three of whom can be from one party. When fewer than four seats are filled, the commission cannot carry out most of its important functions, including enforcing the law and issuing regulations and other legal guidance.\n\nThanks in part to its evenly divided leadership, the FEC is nobody’s idea of an aggressive watchdog, often deadlocking on partisan lines in important matters. That gridlock has exacerbated the effects of Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United, for instance, by making it easier for candidates to outsource key campaign operations to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money.\n\nBut even a dysfunctional FEC is still important. Among other things, the agency plays a vital role in collecting and disseminating campaign finance data, which is critical at a time when Trump and his Democratic opponents continue raising money at a rapid clip ahead of the 2026 midterms (and when a number of the president’s biggest donors have a hand in shaping policy in his administration).\n\nLoss of the FEC’s quorum won’t keep data from being collected and published, but the commission won’t be able to do anything to enforce reporting requirements against those who ignore them. It also can’t address novel legal issues that arise — for instance, in connection to online campaign activity, where significant reporting gaps remain.\n\nBut the loss of the FEC’s quorum may not even be the agency’s biggest challenge. In February, the president fired a sitting Democratic appointee, Ellen Weintraub (full disclosure: I worked for Weintraub from 2011 to 2014). This firing is the reason the FEC was down to only four commissioners before the latest resignation.\n\nTo be sure, Weintraub’s term at the commission had long expired and she was eligible to be replaced. But no president has ever removed an FEC commissioner from the opposing party without naming a replacement, usually selected by the opposition party’s congressional leaders. Her removal was part of a series of firings of Democratic commissioners at independent agencies who are supposed to be legally insulated from presidential removal — representing a major power grab by the White House.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the White House issued an executive order purporting to formally place all independent executive branch agencies under direct presidential control. The president subsequently issued an order that, among other things, directs the Election Assistance Commission — another federal agency that was modeled in key respects on the FEC — to illegally revise federal voter registration procedures. A federal court has blocked relevant parts of the order in a Brennan Center lawsuit challenging the move while the case proceeds.\n\nThe president’s assault on the independence of agencies like the Elections Assistance Commission and FEC flies in the face of Article I of the Constitution, which vests oversight over federal elections in the states and Congress. Congress in turn delegated oversight over federal campaign finance rules to the independent FEC with the goal — as we recently noted in a publicly filed comment to the agency — of ensuring that election-related complaints and questions would be handled free from partisan manipulation.\n\nThe record-breaking 2024 election showed the dire need for effective and scrupulously even-handed campaign finance regulation. At a bare minimum, the president and Congress should follow the practices of every president since the 1970s for filling opposing party seats on the commission. Nominees from both parties should also be asked whether they will explicitly commit to defending the FEC’s independence.\n\nUltimately, as frustrating as some of the FEC’s current failings are, the solution can never be to allow the agency to be weaponized for partisan ends. There has long been broad, bipartisan agreement on this point — and it’s more important than ever to reaffirm this commitment to fairness.",

    "fullText": "The US executed targeted, large-scale attacks in Venezuela's capital city, Caracas, overnight.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday American forces struck the country's military, turned off the lights in the city, and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for prosecution in New York.\n\nThe assault news has raised big questions. Here's what we know right now.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Trump revealed on Truth Social that the US military carried out a \"large-scale attack against Venezuela\" and that the leader had been captured and taken out of the country.\n\nThe US president didn't seek Congressional approval prior to the mission. Congress, however, was notified afterward.\n\nTrump told Fox News he watched the capture of Maduro play out in real time from a room inside his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida alongside military generals.\n\n\"I was told by real military people that there's no other country on Earth that can do such a maneuver,\" he shared during a phone interview with Fox News. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally, like I was watching a television show.\"\n\nTrump said the raid was \"extremely complex,\" more so than the Midnight Hammer operation against Iran's nuclear sites conducted last year. Maduro and his wife were taken to the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima.\n\nTrump said US assets involved included land, air, and sea, including a \"massive number\" of aircraft and troops. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, was based on months of intelligence-gathering, including watching Maduro's patterns of life, and involved all elements of the joint force, from space and cyber assets to traditional combat forces.\n\nThe assault involved 150 aircraft — fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, and helicopters and rotary aircraft — that provided \"layered effects\" to clear the way for the interdiction force to slip in with the \"element of surprise\" into downtown Caracas. Fighters and different drones covered the extraction.\n\nThere were no US personnel or equipment losses, Trump said; however, he did say that troops were hit, along with a helicopter that he said was hit \"pretty hard.\" Caine said the US responded to hostile fire with \"overwhelming\" force.\n\nTensions have been rising for months between Venezuela's Maduro regime and the Trump administration, which has ramped up its rhetoric while increasing military action nearby.\n\nThe US has blamed Venezuela for pushing deadly drugs into the country, as well as using its oil industry, which the Trump administration says the US built and intends to take back, to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nThe administration has labeled cartels and the Maduro regime terrorist organizations. Trump has also called Maduro an illegitimate leader.\n\nThe US has been launching attacks against alleged drug trafficking boats since September 2025, with over 100 people killed and others missing or captured.\n\nA massive US force presence, including warships and combat aircraft, has been in the Caribbean to combat narcotics trafficking and pressure Venezuela for months.\n\nMore recently, US forces began executing a blockade of oil tankers out of Venezuela in an effort to enforce American oil sanctions, hurting a key Venezuelan export and straining its economy.\n\nMaduro's government said that the purpose of the US attack on Venezuela was to \"seize Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals, in an attempt to forcibly break the nation's political independence.\"\n\nThe US has removed the leaders of sovereign states in the past. For instance, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Operation Iraqi Freedom, it captured Saddam Hussein after the Bush administration asserted the Iraqi president had weapons of mass destruction. Hussein was later convicted for crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court and executed in December 2006.\n\nA lack of evidence that Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction led to criticisms against the Bush administration's motives.\n\nMuch earlier, Panamanian military dictator Manual Noriega was also a target of American military forces during the US invasion of Panama from December 1989 to January 1990, partially prompted by his attempt to annul the results of the 1989 Panamanian general election. US courts had charged Noriega with drug smuggling and money laundering, and the Panamanian official was captured in January 1990 and taken to Miami, where he was convicted on most of the charges.\n\nBoth Noriega and Maduro were heads of state indicted by US federal courts, they were accused of using state power to facilitate drug trafficking, and the US could argue in both cases those actions taken against them were law enforcement.\n\nThe US has also conducted military action to kill prominent foreign figures. Exactly six years ago, US military personnel successfully assassinated Qasem Soleimani, a senior Iranian military officer, in a drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nThe US designated Soleimani a terrorist in 2005. In response to Soleimani's assassination in January 2020, Iran launched missiles against US military bases in Iraq, injuring 110 US troops.\n\nMaduro and his wife are on their way to New York. Pamela Bondi, US attorney general, said that Maduro had been charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices, as well as conspiracy against the US.\n\n\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said on X.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump posted a picture of Maduro in custody on Truth Social. The photo showed Maduro aboard USS Iwo Jima.\n\nThe president also added that US oil companies would be returning to Venezuela.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s bold claims that his policies delivered an unprecedented jobs boom for American-born workers are at odds with data showing a weaker market than under his predecessor.\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly boasted that all new job gains have gone to U.S.-born workers since he returned to office. “In the year before my election, all net creation of jobs was going to foreign migrants. Since I took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American-born citizens,” Trump said during an address to the nation last month. “One hundred percent.”\n\nAdministration officials have parroted that rhetoric, saying on X in November that what Trump “is doing for our workforce is nothing short of HISTORIC.”\n\n“While other Presidents allowed foreign workers to flood the job market, President Trump is working to ensure ALL jobs created go to our workers,” the U.S. Department of Labor’s X account posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s right-hand man, Vice President JD Vance, has been aggressively backing his government’s handling of the economy.\n\nJust last month, against the backdrop of pessimistic unemployment data, Vance graded Trump’s economic performance “A plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nHe has also praised the administration for “bringing jobs back to America.”\n\n“We had a policy in this country for 40 years of shipping American jobs overseas... There is going to be a massive exception to that 40-year trajectory of American decline, and that’s the second Trump admin,” he said in discussion with Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle in Washington, D.C.\n\nEconomists, however, are calling Trump’s bluff. Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Washington Post reported Friday that the labor market itself has weakened, leaving U.S.-born workers modestly worse off than they had been under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\n“The unemployment rate has been rising for both native-born and foreign-born adults,” Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Commerce Department economist, told the Post.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among native-born workers was higher in late 2025 than a year earlier. The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers rose from 3.9 percent in November 2024 to 4.3 percent in November 2025.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Trump’s claims that his immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers are “false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey.”\n\n“If anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years,” senior economist Ben Zipperer wrote in September.\n\nIn August, Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and undersecretary for economic affairs at the US Department of Commerce under Biden, accused the president of committing a “multiple-count data felony” in trumpeting a jobs boom for native-born Americans.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Post that “mindless nitpicking doesn’t change the simple fact that President Trump has done more for American workers than any president in history by cracking down on visa program abuses, successfully negotiating new trade deals, securing our border, and carrying out the largest mass deportation of illegal aliens.”\n\nRogers said those policies ensure “American-born workers can finally benefit from our new economic resurgence.”",

    "description": "Respondents to Business Insider's survey were split between in-person and virtual work. The virtual option won out by one vote.",
    "fullText": "We asked: Would you prefer a $240,000 in-office job or a $120,000 remote one?\n\nThe Business Insider readers who responded were split down the middle, with the lower-paying virtual job narrowly winning out by just one vote.\n\n365 readers answered Business Insider's informal survey following the debate's TikTok virality. 183 answered that they would choose the $120,000 remote gig, while 182 chose to go five days in-person for double the salary.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight respondents — four on each side — explained to Business Insider why they made their choices.\n\nWhile the reader survey isn't scientific, the results, and the reasons people gave us for why they voted the way they did, offer insight into how workers today view the tradeoffs.\n\nIn 2018, Arlton Lowry packed a bag and traveled from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Bali.\n\nThe 44-year-old owner of a digital product design agency spent seven weeks working remotely, waking up at 1 a.m. and scootering through paddy fields to a coworking space where he clocked in on Central Time.\n\nLowry voted for the remote option. That trip wouldn't be possible if his company wasn't remote-first, he said, and the flexibility is a benefit for his employees as well.\n\n\"If it wasn't for remote-based work, we probably wouldn't be able to attract and retain the talent that we have,\" he said.\n\nRespondents who chose the lower-salary remote option prized flexibility and the absence of a rigid corporate culture. It's about more than doing your laundry or squeezing in a workout, they said; it's about freedom.\n\nBetty Chen said she was tired of dealing with other people's egos. After corporate jobs at Autodesk and Cisco, Chen decided to go freelance before the pandemic. Now, the 49-year-old San Francisco resident does contract UX design and boards dogs in her home.\n\n\"I'm so much happier,\" Chen said. \"I did better working with animals, not doomscrolling. Touch grass.\"\n\nChen also enjoys not having to put on makeup. \"As a woman going into the office, there's another half hour of maintenance,\" she said.\n\nThose who chose the in-person option say that flexibility comes at the cost of organizational performance. American Edge Project CEO Doug Kelly said that there was a \"chemistry\" to bringing people together.\n\n\"I would rather pay people more to be on-site working with me,\" the 60-year-old Columbus, Ohio resident said. \"It increases the product that the company is making and the creativity overall.\"\n\nDominic Sharlette agreed: \"You have to be in the office to get great products made.\"\n\nSharlette is a 59-year-old health tech worker based in New York. He works five days in-person, and said he is happy that way. Jobs like customer service could be done remotely, he said, but work that's \"pushing innovation\" must be done face-to-face.\n\nThen there's the salary question. The prompt offered double the pay — $240,000 compared to $120,000 — for in-person attendance. For some, the money was enough.\n\nJennifer Rasmussen, a 44-year-old logistics worker from Fargo, North Dakota, likes her fully remote job. As she called me, her golden retrievers lay next to her. But the perks of $240,000 were too strong not to influence her vote.\n\n\"The quality of life for my entire family would improve with a salary at that level,\" she said.\n\nRasmussen's kids are still young. The money would help her family travel internationally or hire childcare and cleaning help. She could also save more money for retirement, she said.\n\nAmy Leonard, a 42-year-old community college teacher from San Jose, California, said she would choose the virtual job so she could move elsewhere. The Bay Area has a notoriously high cost of living. Leonard said that most of her money now went to basic expenses, such as gas and food.\n\n\"I could definitely take that, move somewhere else, and probably own a house instead of having to rent,\" Leonard said.\n\nIn her debate-sparking TikTok, influencer Tinx said that she could immediately guess the generation of the individual consider the half-salary remote option: Gen Z.\n\nIn the video, Tinx said that time in the office could do Gen Z some good. \"It'll make you all less weird,\" she said.\n\nPriya Chaudhari, a 20-year-old student at the University of Georgia, said that much of her generation actually preferred to be in-person. The in-office push was a \"rebound\" from an adolescence on screens, she said. Chaudhari and some of her friends have chosen to get off social media.\n\nChaudhari said she would opt for the $240,000 salary, citing the pay difference and her own extroversion. \"I really thrive off working with other people,\" she said.\n\nPedro Ochoa posed the question to his four-person team. The 45-year-old manager of business intelligence said the team was split generationally, with the younger colleagues opting for higher pay and the older colleagues choosing the remote work role.\n\nYounger workers see \"very hard outcomes for their careers,\" the Dallas resident said, so they want to claim as much income and experience as they can while they're still employed. Older workers care more about raising their families, he said.\n\nOchoa put himself in the latter camp. He'd take the remote option.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "title": "Kennedy Center reportedly changed rules before vote to add Trump’s name",
    "description": "Bylaws that would limit voting to Trump-appointed trustees appears to reveal long-held renaming plan",
    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center reportedly adopted bylaws earlier this year that would limit voting to Donald Trump-appointed trustees – a controversial move that appears to reveal the long-held plan to install Trump’s name to the center.\n\nThe bylaws, in a possible breach of the institution’s charter, were revised in May and specified that board members appointed by Congress, known as ex-officio members, could not vote or count towards a quorum, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe new rule was in force when the board voted unanimously on 18 December to add Trump’s name to the center, rebranding the building as the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe name change has since triggered a wave of protests. Artists have cancelled bookings and members of Congress have vowed to overturn the name change. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, is even suing to reverse it on the grounds that changing the center’s name requires an act of Congress.\n\nTrump took over as chair of the board in February, quickly purging sitting members, while installing his supporters – including his longtime foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell, whom he appointed as president of the center. Grenell had been a vocal tribune of Trump’s “America First” ideology, and was not afraid to ruffle feathers during past spells as ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence (he was the first openly gay person to lead the intelligence community).\n\nJust prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.\n\nThe center lists 34 presidentially appointed board members and 23 ex-officio members, who by law must include the mayor of Washington DC, head of the library of Congress, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The federal law underpinning the center’s establishment identified ex-officio members as among the venue’s trustees, charged with maintaining it as a memorial to President John F Kennedy, the Post reported.\n\nRoma Daravi, the center’s vice-president for public relations, told the Post that the rules had been changed in line with longstanding convention that ex-officio members did not vote: “The bylaws were revised to reflect this longstanding precedent and everyone received the technical changes both before the meeting and after revisions.”\n\nDaravi continued: “Some members (including ex officio) attended in person, others by phone, and no concerns were voiced, no one objected, and the bylaws passed unanimously.”\n\nEllen Aprill, a legal scholar at UCLA, told the paper that such voting right limits breached the center’s charter.\n\n“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.\n\nThe disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards. A record low audience of 3.01m watched this year’s broadcast of the annual honors awards – hosted by Trump himself – when it was screened by CBS, marking a stark 25% downturn from last year. The event included appearances from some of Trump’s favorite artists, including Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and George Strait.\n\nAs artists cancel bookings, Trump on social media on Tuesday posted a string of statements from supporters criticizing the Kennedy family’s supposed lack of support for the center. His posts on his Truth Social network started mere hours after the Kennedy family announced the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, who died aged 35, from leukemia.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "fullText": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Some Iowans are ringing in 2026 with a special election on the final Tuesday of the year, casting ballots for a state senator in a race that offers Republicans an opportunity to reclaim two-thirds control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrat Renee Hardman faces Republican Lucas Loftin in the special election for the state Senate seat representing parts of Des Moines’ suburbs. The seat is vacant after the Oct. 6 death of state Sen. Claire Celsi, a Democrat.\n\nFlipping the seat would give Republicans supermajority status once again, just months after a Democrat flipped a Republican seat in an August special election, giving Democrats 17 seats to Republicans' 33. Celsi's death left the Democratic caucus at 16.\n\nSenate Republicans left Des Moines last spring with a supermajority, which allows the party to easily confirm Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ appointments to state agencies and commissions. A Hardman win in Tuesday's election would limit Republicans’ power in the Senate as lawmakers prepare to return to Des Moines for the 2026 legislative session. Without a supermajority, Republicans would have to rely on support from at least one Democrat to approve Reynolds' nominees.\n\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans in the district by about 3,300 voters, 37% to 30%, but a holiday week special election may prove more volatile.\n\nAbout a third of registered voters in the district are affiliated with another party or register without a political party.\n\nCelsi won her 2024 reelection bid against a Libertarian competitor with 69% of the district electorate. But she earned a smaller majority of voters in 2022 – 58% — against a Republican, who earned 42% of the vote. That was similar to the share Republican President Donald Trump received in the district last year.\n\nHardman, who would be the first Black woman elected to the Iowa state Senate, is the CEO of nonprofit Lutheran Services of Iowa and a member of the West Des Moines City Council. Loftin, who started as a tree trimmer for Wright Service Corp. in 2007, has since transitioned to software and data project management for the environmental services company.\n\nSchoenbaum reported from Salt Lake City, Utah.",

Gonzalez/Gowens 18%, Gordon 14%, Batista/Cerela 7%, Diaz/Hodge/Mogollón/Ziehl 4%)\n\nAldrin Batista\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 6\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.2 years\nOverall 2025 stats 2-0 ▪️ 7 games (2 starts) ▪️ 14 IP ▪️ 5.79 ERA ▪️ 17 K ▪️ 7 BB ▪️ 1.429 WHIP ▪️-1.2 WAR\n\nBatista was our No. 6-voted player in last year’s poll and top righthander — and then disaster struck, as he started the third Dash game of the season on April 6 and then was out more than four months with a stress fracture in his right (pitching) elbow. His return in late August was iffy, with three poor relief appearances of five. But he ended the season with a scoreless (two-inning) “opener” start, which hopefully reverses the curse for 2026.\n\nJuan Carela\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2024 High Level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.5 years\nOverall 2024 MiLB stats (High-A/AA) 7-7▪️ 23 starts ▪️ 106 2⁄3 IP ▪️ 3.77 ERA ▪️ 114 K▪️ 45 BB ▪️ 1.238 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nCarela has mostly flown under the radar since being acquired from the Yankees in at the 2023 trade deadline. But he has forced his way into an increasingly crowded rotation situation at this point, punctuated by seven brilliant starts for Birmingham to end the 2024 season yielding a 3.58 ERA and 1.163 WHIP while being well underage for the level. Just as Carela was moving closer to Charlotte and/or possible MLB appearances, he blew out his arm last March and underwent TJS.\n\nReudis Diaz\nRight-handed relief pitcher\nAge 20\n2025 high level ACL (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -2.1 years\nOverall 2025 stats 1-1 ▪️ 1 SV▪️ 21 games (4 finishes) ▪️ 27 2/3 IP ▪️ 2.28.ERA ▪️ 18 K ▪️ 8 BB ▪️ 1.084 WHIP ▪️1.2 WAR\n\nWho? You’re forgiven for being unfamiliar with an extremely young arm who hasn’t yet gotten out of rookie ball, but our No. 77 prospect a year ago (then a starter, repeating the DSL and killing it) made a successful adjustment Stateside. He’ll return to starting in 2026, likely getting his feet wet in Arizona and getting a promotion to Low-A in the second half of the season.\n\nJacob Gonzalez\nSecond Baseman\nAge 23\n2024 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 9\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 24\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 134 games ▪️ 8 HR ▪️ 61 RBI ▪️ .232/.307/.345 ▪️ 17-of-20 (85.0%) SB ▪️ 48 BB ▪️ 86 K ▪️ .990 FLD%▪️ 3.1 WAR\n\nAfter the incredible first half/awful second of 2024, Gonzalez rebounded for a solid campaign, the final third of which came in Charlotte. However, his time in Charlotte, a hitter’s playground, was a significant step back on offense. He’s on the cusp of the bigs but has created questions whether he’ll produce at all with the stick on the South Side.\n\nLucas Gordon\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -1.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA) 3-11▪️ 24 starts ▪️ 107 2/3 IP ▪️ 3.59 ERA ▪️ 116 K ▪️ 42 BB ▪️ 1.161 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nSomehow still, in completing his third season as a pro, Gordon is still vastly underrated. All he has done is put up a career 2.80 ERA while taking on a significant workload each season. Sure, there’s no overpowering fastball there, but Gordon’s cup of coffee at Double-A (where he vastly improved his ERA, 2.11 over four starts) indicates that he may evade the wall that softer tossers hit once they are in the upper minors.\n\nRiley Gowens\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 26\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 7-6▪️ 27 starts ▪️ 132 IP ▪️ 3.44 ERA ▪️ 151 K ▪️ 49 BB ▪️ 1.189 WHIP ▪️ 2.0 WAR\n\n“Workhorse” is not the sexiest attribute for a prospect, but it’s no chopped liver adjective, either. And Gowens is just that, topping system starters with 27 starts, 132 innings and 151 Ks. And yet somehow he has evaded the praise handed to 2025 wunderkind Tanner McDougal, despite some obvious similarities. He should get the call to Charlotte to start 2026 and be on the short list, alongside McDougal, for first call-up for a start in the majors.\n\nLandon Hodge\nCatcher\nAge 19\n2025 high level Crespi Carmelite H.S. (Encino, Calif.)\nScouting grades (40-80 scale) Hit 45 ▪️ Power 40 ▪️ Run 50 ▪️ Arm 55 ▪️ Field 50 ▪️ Overall 40\n\nThis teammate of White Sox first-rounder (and SSS Top Prospect Vote No. 7 player) Billy Carlson made history simply by being drafted (fourth round, No. 107 overall). The very first pick of Day 2 of the draft was a somewhat curious one, given MLB’s ranking as the 164th-best talent available in the draft and the presence of much more enticing talents (as high as MLB’s No. 35 prospect) passed over on Day 1. Hodge has a killer arm (another characteristic he shares with Carlson) and has a solid hit tool that’s more average than power.\n\nJavier Mogollón\nShortstop\nAge 20\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.4 years\nOverall 2025 stats 51 games ▪️ 5 HR ▪️ 19 RBI ▪️ .220/.347/.387 ▪️ 15-of-21 (71.4%) SB ▪️ 30 BB ▪️ 56 K ▪️ .971 FLD%▪️ 1.0 WAR\n\nAn ascending star just one year ago, we have to tap the breaks a bit on Mogollón after a lackluster first full season of minors ball. While still young for his level and managing to keep his head above water in a new league every season of his career, Mogollón’s undeniable hitting in Rookie ball fell off significantly with the Cannon Ballers. However, how much of that was due to battling injury is undetermined, as Mogollón was shelved for what turned out to be the season on July 2.\n\nRikuu Nishida\nRight Fielder\nAge 24\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 28 \n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 115 games ▪️ 0 HR ▪️ 31 RBI ▪️ .273/.403/.308 ▪️ 40-of-52 (76.9%) SB ▪️ 75 BB ▪️ 69 K ▪️ .986 FLD%▪️ 2.6 WAR\n\nWhat other testament to Nishida’s flexibility can there be but to say in three years in our Top 100, his primary position has changed from left field to second base to right field. You won’t find a stranger profile in the White Sox system, as Nishida’s profile is one of extreme on-base ability and baserunning peskiness, at the expense of any power whatsoever. He was a seeming shoo-in for Charlotte at some point last summer, but stalled in Double-A.\n\nTyler Schweitzer\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 25\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 8-2 ▪️ 27 games (10 starts) ▪️ 99 2/3 IP ▪️4.61 ERA ▪️ 81 K ▪️ 41 BB ▪️ 1.344 WHIP ▪️ 0.8 WAR\n\nSchweitzer relieved in most of his games in 2025, but he remains a starter in our eyes given he was consistently paired with Tanner McDougal in Birmingham Barons starts. And in Birmingham, Schweitzer was divine: 1.27 ERA that included a long scoreless streak leading to a Charlotte promotion, 0.946 WHIP. However, everything the southpaw did as a Baron, he undid as a Knight (7.92 ERA, 1.740 ERA). While other gilded arms (Drew Thorpe, Grant Taylor) get to skip Charlotte entirely, Schweitzer was not so lucky. And that luck could prevent him from ever seeing the majors.\n\nGage Ziehl\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 high level Somerset (Yankees AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Low-A/High-A/AA) 7-6 ▪️ 22 games (21 starts, 1 finish) ▪️ 107 IP ▪️4.12 ERA ▪️ 90 K ▪️ 19 BB ▪️ 1.262 WHIP ▪️ 1.4 WAR\n\nZiehl was the return from the Yankees in the trade deadline swap of Austin Slater, and based on the nothing value of Slater this trade can’t possibly be a loss for the White Sox. The righty was a busy arm even before the trade, pitching at three levels for New York and settling at High-A for the White Sox. Pitching young for his level, Ziehl held his own pretty well.\n\nPast South Side Sox Prospect votes\n\nHere is how 2018 wrangled out — all 42 picks. Also, here is an archive of every article in the 2018 series.\n\nHere is how 2019 came together, all 50 picks, and the archive as well.\n\nHere is the 2021 wrap-up of just 35 picks due to flagging participation, along with the full archive.\n\nHere is the 2022 link to the 27-pick wrap, along with the full archive.\n\nRound 24 of voting was the last of 2023 (we did not do an actual wrap for the voting, but Jordan Sprinkle ended up being our final pick), and the full archive.\n\nIn 2024 Abraham Núñez was our 34th pick to end the series, and here is the wrap-up post and full archive of each profile.\n\nAnd last year, we did 31 picks, ending with Eric Adler.

The more you look at it, the more you will be horrified at what your tax money is doing and the fact that, if this is not reversed, your vote will mean nothing. The most obvious case example is the Somali voting bloc in Minnesota, a state that historically had zero Somalis, electing Ilhan Omar to the US Congress. The same is happening in Europe, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand,” he wrote in the post.\n\nMusk’s comments come at a time when immigration policies are a hotly debated topic both in the United States and globally. His assertion that these policies are being manipulated for political gain is likely to fuel further debate.\n\nThe tech mogul’s influence and reach, with millions of followers on social media, mean his views can have significant impact on public discourse.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that Musk’s claims are his personal views and are not supported by any provided evidence.\n\nThe impact of immigration on electoral outcomes is a complex issue and the subject of ongoing research and debate among experts.\n\nElon Musk Tells Joe Rogan: ‘Trump Actually Is Not Perfect, but He's Not Evil'\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "fullText": "BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia's protesting university students on Sunday collected signatures throughout the country for their request for an early parliamentary election that they hope would oust the autocratic government of President Aleksandar Vucic from office.\n\nBraving freezing weather, the students set up nearly 500 stands in dozens of cities, towns and villages in the Balkan country for residents to sign the election demand, which isn't a formal petition. Students have said that Sunday’s action was meant to put further pressure on Vucic and as a test of support.\n\nYoung protesters have been at the forefront of a nationwide movement against Vucic's populist rule in Serbia. More than a year of street protests first started in November 2024 after a train station disaster that killed 16 people.\n\nThe concrete canopy collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad was widely blamed on alleged rampant corruption and disregard of construction and safety rules during renovation work at the station. No one has been held responsible for the tragedy.\n\nVucic has refused to schedule an immediate early vote, but has suggested that it could be held sometime next year. Both parliamentary and presidential elections are otherwise due in 2027.\n\n“We have stands that serve to connect with the citizens,\" said Igor Dojnov, a student manning one of the points in central Belgrade.\n\nYouth-led protests during the past year have shaken Vucic more than ever during his 13-year-long tenure. Serbia's populist prime minister resigned in January, and Vucic later launched a crackdown on protesters that also drew international criticism.\n\nWhile street protests have subsided, discontent with Vucic's government is believed to be widespread.\n\nMilca Cankovic Kadijevic, a resident of Belgrade, said that she supported the students, because “I have a desire to live decently — me, my children and my grandchildren.\"\n\nVucic has formally promised to take Serbia into the European Union, but he has maintained close links with Russia and China, while facing accusations of clamping down on democratic freedoms and allowing corruption and organized crime to flourish.\n\nHe has denied this, and accused the protesters of attempting to orchestrate a “color revolution” under unspecified orders from the West. The term “color revolution” has been used to describe a series of mass protests at the beginning of the 21st century that sometimes led to the toppling of governments in the former Soviet Union states, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Asia.",

    "fullText": "PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Voters in Kosovo cast ballots on Sunday in an early parliamentary election in hopes of breaking a political deadlock that has gripped the small Balkan nation for much of this year.\n\nThe snap vote was scheduled after Prime Minister Albin Kurti's governing Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination, party failed to form a government despite winning the most votes in a Feb. 9 election.\n\nThe deadlock marked the first time Kosovo could not form a government since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008 following a 1998-99 war that ended in a NATO intervention.\n\nThe prime minister's party is again the favorite in the race, but it is unclear whether it will manage to muster a majority this time in the 120-member parliament, after other mainstream parties refused an alliance.\n\nAfter voting Sunday, Kurti urged Kosovo's 1.9 million voters to turn out in large numbers to grant “more legitimacy for our institutions.”\n\n“Once the election result is known, we will do our best to constitute a new parliament as soon as possible and to proceed with the election of the new government,” he said.\n\nAccording to Kosovo’s election laws, 20 parliamentary seats are automatically assigned to ethnic Serb representatives and other minority parties.\n\nAnother inconclusive vote would further deepen the crisis. Kosovo has not approved a budget for next year, sparking concern over the already poor economy in the country of 2 million people.\n\nLawmakers also are set to elect a new president in March as current President Vjosa Osmani’s mandate expires in early April. If this fails too, another snap election must be held.\n\nThe main opposition parties are the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Democratic Party of Kosovo. They have accused Kurti of authoritarianism and of alienating Kosovo’s U.S. and European Union allies since he came to power in 2021.\n\nLumir Abdixhiku from the Democratic League of Kosovo urged voters to \"move away from the gloom, the deadlock and the division that has accompanied us for these years.”\n\nA former political prisoner during Serbia’s rule in Kosovo, the 50-year-old Kurti has taken a tough stand in talks mediated by the European Union on normalizing relations with Belgrade. In response, the EU and the United States imposed punitive measures.\n\nKurti has promised to buy military equipment to boost security.\n\nNo reliable preelection polls have been published. Kurti's party at the previous election won around 42% of the votes while the two main rival parties had together around 40%. Analysts say that even the slightest changes in numbers on Sunday could prove decisive for the future distribution of power.\n\nIlmi Deliu, a 71-year-old pensioner from the capital, Pristina, said he hoped the election will bring a change or “we will end up in an abyss.”\n\n\"Young people no longer want to live here,” he said.\n\nTensions with restive ethnic Serbs in the north exploded in clashes in 2023 when scores of NATO-led peacekeepers were injured. In a positive step, ethnic Serb mayors this month took power peacefully there after a municipal vote.\n\nKurti has also agreed to accept third-country migrants deported from the United States as part of tough anti-immigration measures by the administration of President Donald Trump. One migrant has arrived so far, authorities have told The Associated Press.\n\nKosovo has one of the poorest economies in Europe. It is one of the six Western Balkan countries striving to eventually join the EU, but both Kosovo and Serbia have been told they must first normalize relations.",

The junta leader has proceeded to clamp down on the main opposition and dissent, critics say, leaving him with no major opposition among the eight other candidates in the race.",
    "fullText": "CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Guineans are voting Sunday to elect a new president in the country’s first election since a 2021 coup, as analysts say a weakened opposition will result in a likely win for junta leader Gen. Mamadi Doumbouya.\n\nSunday’s election is the culmination of a transition process that began four years ago after Doumbouya ousted President Alpha Condé. The junta leader has proceeded to clamp down on the main opposition and dissent, critics say, leaving him with no major opposition among the eight other candidates in the race.\n\nDespite Guinea’s rich mineral resources — including as the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, used to make aluminum — more than half of its 15 million people are experiencing record levels of poverty and food insecurity, according to the World Food Program.\n\n“This vote is the hope of young people, especially for us unemployed,\" said Idrissa Camara, an 18-year-old resident of Conakry, who said he has been unemployed since graduating from university five years ago. \"I’m forced to do odd jobs to survive. I hope this vote will improve the standard of living and the quality of life in Guinea,\" he added.\n\nThe election is being held under a new constitution that revoked a ban on military leaders running for office and extended the presidential mandate from five to seven years. That constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a September referendum despite opposition parties asking voters to boycott it.\n\nThe vote is the latest such election among African countries that have seen a surge in coups in recent years. At least 10 countries in the young continent have experienced soldiers forcefully taking power after accusing elected leaders of failing to provide good governance and security for citizens.\n\n“This election will open a new page in Guinea’s history and mark the country’s return to the league of nations,” said Guinea political analyst Aboubacar Sidiki Diakité. “Doumbouya is undoubtedly the favorite in this presidential election because the main opposition political parties have been sidelined and the General Directorate of Elections, the body that oversees the presidential election, is under the supervision of the government,” he added.\n\nIn addition to a weakened opposition, activists and rights groups say Guinea has since the coup seen civil society leaders silenced, critics abducted and the press censored. More than 50 political parties were dissolved last year in a move authorities claimed was to “clean up the political chessboard” despite widespread criticism.\n\nThere was heavy security in Conakry and other parts of Guinea with nearly 12,000 police officers among security forces mobilized and checkpoints set up along major roads. Authorities had said on Saturday that security forces “neutralized” an armed group with “subversive intentions threatening national security” after gunshots were heard in Conakry’s Sonfonia neighborhood.\n\nAcross polling stations, long queues of mostly young voters waited to cast their ballot while police officers closely monitored the process.\n\nA total of nine candidates are contesting the election, and Doumbouya’s closest challenger is the little-known Yero Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea party, who was education minister under Condé.\n\nTwo opposition candidates, former Prime Minister Lansana Kouyaté and former government minister Ousmane Kaba, were excluded on technical grounds while longtime opposition leaders Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya Toure have been forced into exile.\n\nWhile Baldé has hinged his campaign on promises of governance reforms, anti-corruption efforts and economic growth, Doumbouya has built his around major infrastructure projects and reforms launched since taking power four years ago.\n\nThe junta’s most important project has been the Simandou iron ore project, a 75% Chinese-owned mega-mining project at the world’s largest iron ore deposit which began production last month after decades of delays.\n\nAuthorities say that a national development plan tied to the Simandou project aims to create tens of thousands of jobs and diversify the economy through investments in agriculture, education, transport, technology and health.\n\n“In four years, he (Doumbouya) has connected Guinean youth to information and communication technologies,” said Mamadama Touré, a high school student wearing a T-shirt with Doumbouya’s image in the capital of Conakry, as he cited digital skills training programs put in place by the authorities.\n\nAbout 6.7 million registered voters are expected to cast ballots at roughly 24,000 polling stations nationwide, with results expected within 48 hours. There will be a runoff if no candidate wins a majority of the votes.\n\nIn Conakry, 22-year-old student Issatou Bah said he is still undecided about whether to vote in the election.\n\n“This is the third time I’ve voted in Guinea, hoping things will change. But nothing has changed,” said Bah, adding that he hopes the election will improve \"this country that has everything but struggles to take off.”",

Some said that virtual work protects their mental health, while others said that the doubled salary was an easy choice. In a variety of spin-off TikToks, commentators made their case for one vs. the other.\n\nIt's the latest round of the return-to-office debate that has raged since the COVID-19 pandemic. While companies place return-to-office mandates, some employees have realized that they prefer to skip the commute — even if it means a pay cut. Others need virtual work for at-home responsibilities, such as childcare.\n\nWe're asking readers which they'd prefer.

    "fullText": "The majority of Russians expect the war with Ukraine to end in 2026, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe survey of 1,600 Russians aged 18 and above found that 55% believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" is nearing its end. The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 Oregon high school football season has ended and Salem-Keizer area teams and athletes across all division are collecting accolades.\n\nThere were state champions, conference champions and memorable moments throughout the entire season. Countless athletes stood out on the gridiron as they represented their schools in quests for glory.\n\nHere are the nominees for the Statesman Journal’s football player of the year.\n\nHere’s information on the nominees. Vote for who you think deserves to win at statesmanjournal.com/sports. The poll closes at noon Friday, Jan. 2.\n\nSouth Salem’s junior quarterback led the state in 6A passing yards — his 3,214 yards were more than 400 yards ahead of the second-highest passer. The Saxons went 0-9, but Bowman set single-game state records in passing yards (692) and completions (48), both against Grants Pass.\n\nBowman was named to the all-state honorable mention list.\n\nCampos was West Salem’s workhorse running back this fall as the Titans fought to a 6-4 record and playoff appearance. Campos, a senior, finished the season with some of the best 6A individual tallies in the state. He was fifth in rushing yards (1,397) and seventh in rushing touchdowns (17) on 210 carries.\n\nCampos earned a bid to the all-state second-team offense.\n\nHawkins was a two-way playmaker for the Cougars as they completed an undefeated state championship season. Hawkins, a junior, played an integral role on both sides of the ball from wide receiver and defensive back. In the state championship game, Hawkins had 77 yards receiving and a touchdown.\n\nHawkins was awarded first-team all-state honors on offense (wide receiver) and defense (defensive back), the only Salem-area player across 6A/5A/4A to earn first-team bids on both sides of the ball. He also earned all-state second-team offense as a kick returner.\n\nHockett led the Buckaroos to a 2A state semifinal appearance, Special District 2 conference championship and an 8-3 overall record. Hockett was named the Statesman Journal Athlete of the Week Nov. 13 for a 213-yard, three-touchdown performance in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nAs a lead-blocking, versatile offensive weapon and lockdown, physical defender, Hinkle helped lead Cascade to a perfect season that ended in a 4A state championship. Hinkle, a senior, was integral on both sides of the ball for the Cougars.\n\nHinkle was awarded 4A defensive player of the year along with all-state first-team defense second-team all-state offense.\n\nKuenzi was the lead back for a Cascade team that marched through a perfect 13-0 season all the way to a 4A state title. Kuenzi, a senior, scored a whopping 34 touchdowns for the Cougars this fall and closed his senior season as one of the most dominant high school running backs in recent Oregon memory.\n\nKuenzi claimed 4A offensive player of the year and first-team all-state honors.\n\nKuenzi was a two-way lineman for the state title-winning Foxes this fall. The senior provided leadership and stability to a young, talented line that delivered all the protection, pressure and coverage necessary throughout Silverton’s march to the 5A championship.\n\nKuenzi was named to the all-state first team as a defensive lineman.\n\nMabry led the way as a senior on the offensive line for the Dragons this season. He excelled in all facets of the game from the position as he helped lead Dallas to a 7-4 season that ended in the 5A state quarterfinals.\n\nMabry was named 5A Special District 3’s offensive lineman of the year, and he earned a spot on the all-state first team roster.\n\nDayton’s senior running back led the charge throughout the Pirates' season that resulted in a 3A Special District 2 championship and a 9-1 overall record. Macias racked up 15 touchdowns and 1,149 yards (114.9 yards per game) this season.\n\nMakarenko was a key part of Sprague’s offensive line that acted as a strongpoint for the Olympians throughout the season. A senior center, he helped push Sprague to a 5-5 season that resulted in a 6A state playoff appearance.\n\nMakarenko was awarded a bid on the all-state honorable mention.\n\nMariano was the lead running back for the Cougars this fall. A senior, he led the Cougars to an 8-4 season that ended in the program’s first-ever 3A state semifinals. He scored 12 touchdowns in the Cougars’ first two playoff games and closes his Gervais career as one of the top football players in the school’s history.\n\nMay was a rock of a lineman for Cascade as the Cougars plowed through a 13-0 season and 4A state championship. A senior, May consistently provided leadership, experience and talent and stood out as one of the top offensive linemen in the Salem area across all levels.\n\nMay earned a spot on the all-state first-team offense.\n\nPhillips was the Vikings’ star running back this season who was untouchable in the backfield and uncatchable in the open field. A senior, he finished the season with 1,459 rushing yards and 21 rushing touchdowns, both being the fourth-highest 6A tallies in the state.\n\nPhillips earned all-state second-team offensive honors.\n\nRivers was a force to be reckoned with on the Dallas defense this season. At the 5A level, the Dragons' senior led the state of Oregon in sacks (11), was fifth in total tackles (99) and tied for third in forced fumbles (3). Rivers was an integral part of a dominant defense that gave up less than 14 points in eight different games this fall.\n\nRivers claimed a spot on the all-state defensive first team.\n\nSingleton was a two-way sensation for the Vikings from the wide receiver and defensive back positions this fall. The North Salem senior delivered 986 yards of total offense and nine touchdowns, while also grabbing two interceptions and 58 tackles.\n\nSingleton earned a spot on all-state second-team defense and offensive all-state honorable mention as a wide receiver and kick returner. He's one of two area players from 6A/5A/4A with three different bids to the all-state rosters.\n\nSilverton's junior Swiss army-knife of a player contributed to both sides of the ball in the Foxes' march to a 5A state championship. Teeney, a junior, fielded as a receiver, defensive back and even running back at times — contributing invaluable reps with the Foxes.\n\nTeeney booked a spot on the all-state defensive first-team lineup.\n\nUitto was a key part of Silverton’s 5A state championship march from the wide receiver and defensive back positions. Uitto, a senior, garnered 798 receiving yards and 13 receiving touchdowns this season, tallies good for fourth and second at the 5A level, respectively.\n\nUitto stamped his name on the all-state offensive first-team roster and earned a bid to the all-state honorable mention defense.\n\nWusstig was a two-way receiver/defensive back for West Salem that excelled in both. Wusstig, a senior, helped the Titans to a 6-4 record and playoff appearance and was consistently one of the most impactful players on any football field he stepped on.\n\nWusstig was named to the defensive all-state second team.\n\nLandon Bartlett covers high school sports and Oregon State for the Statesman Journal.

    "description": "Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.  The meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes the state's top lawmakers, is expected to be attended by Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and other team officials.  If the proposal is passed, the Chiefs could move swiftly in announcing plans to depart their 53-year-old home at the Truman Sports Complex for a stadium that could cost upwards of $2 billion.",
    "fullText": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.\n\nThe meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes the state's top lawmakers, is expected to be attended by Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and other team officials. If the proposal is passed, the Chiefs could move swiftly in announcing plans to depart their 53-year-old home at the Truman Sports Complex for a stadium that could cost upwards of $2 billion.\n\nThe state's proposal would allow for STAR bonds to be issued to cover up to 70% of the overall cost of the project. They would be paid off with state sales and liquor tax revenues generated in a defined area around around the sports complex.\n\nThe same bonding process was used to build Kansas Speedway and the surrounding shopping and entertainment district, known as The Legends, in Kansas City, Kansas — the area where a future stadium for the Chiefs is most likely to be built.\n\nThe area is also home to Children's Mercy Park, where Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer plays its home matches.\n\n“The state of Kansas is in active discussions with the Kansas City Chiefs about the prospects of building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas,” the Kansas Department of Commerce said last week. “No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come. We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”\n\nThe move by the Chiefs would be a massive blow to Missouri lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe, who have been working on a package of their own to prevent a second NFL franchise in a decade from leaving their borders. The Rams departed St. Louis for Los Angeles a decade ago in part because of their inability to secure funding to help replace The Dome at America’s Center.\n\nKehoe backed a special legislative session in June to authorize bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.\n\nThe special session came in response to Kansas lawmakers approving their bond package.\n\nThe Chiefs originally planned an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium in a joint effort with the Kansas City Royals, who are similarly planning to build a new facility to replace Kauffman Stadium — which sits a couple of hundred yards across a parking lot from Arrowhead Stadium — when the two teams' leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire in January 2031.\n\nBut after county voters soundly defeated a local sales tax extension last year, the Royals and Chiefs began work on separate plans.\n\nThe Royals will not be discussed by Kansas lawmakers Monday, but momentum appears to be building behind their own move across the state line. An affiliate of the club already has purchased the mortgage on a tract of land in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nQuinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, has been working to keep both franchises on the Missouri side of the state line. He said in a statement over the weekend that negotiations had continued with the Chiefs throughout last week.\n\n“We’ll reserve further comment until we hear from the Kansas City Chiefs,” Lucas said.\n\nHunt has long said his preference was to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, which was beloved by his father and team founder, the late Lamar Hunt. It is considered one of the jewels of the NFL, alongside Lambeau Field in Green Bay, and is revered for its tailgating scene and home-field advantage; it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium roar.\n\nThis summer, Arrowhead Stadium will host six World Cup matches, including matches in the Round of 32 and quarterfinals.\n\nThe Hunt family has warmed in recent years to the idea of leaving their own mark by building its replacement, though. Not only would a new, state-of-the-art stadium provide new revenue streams, through luxury seating and accompanying development, but a fixed or retractable roof would allow it to be used year-round. That would mean the potential to host concerts and events, college football bowl games, the Final Four and one of Lamar Hunt's long-held dreams: a Super Bowl.\n\nHanna reported from Topeka.

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn't rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.\n\nTrump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump's attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.\n\n“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.\n\nThe lawmakers' lawyers argue Trump can't prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",
