The Feb. 8 election is effectively a three-way contest between the ruling conservative Bhumjaithai party, the progressive People’s Party and populist Pheu Thai. Overall, roughly 60 parties are vying for the support of 53 million eligible voters, who will also decide whether to replace a military-drafted constitution that’s been in force since 2017 when the army ruled.",

    "description": "The video posted by Trump depicting the Obamas as apes is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights in the midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Black History Month, 2026 style.\n\nPresident Trump posted a video Thursday to his social media site that contains animated images depicting former President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nThe White House took down the post Friday, and after first calling it nothing more than a meme, they dubbed it a mistake by a staffer. Sure.\n\nBut while the justifiable outrage over this overt racism spins itself into a brief media circus (because we all know something else will come along in about three minutes), let's look a bit deeper into why this video is more than an affront to everything America stands for, or should stand for, anyway.\n\nIt's no accident that the images of the Obamas are embedded deep inside a video about voter fraud conspiracies from the 2020 election (which are untrue, if I need to say it again). This video is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights and voting access in the midterms.\n\n\"Absolutely, there's a connection to the vote,\" Melina Abdullah told me Friday. She's a professor at Cal State L.A. and co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.\n\n\"This is about more than just about the Obamas,\" added Brian Levin, a professor emeritus at Cal State San Bernardino and founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. \"It's about people that are [perceived as] undermining our elections and our democracy.\"\n\nI caught Levin the day after he turned in a chapter about authoritarianism for a new book, which happens to look at how discrimination and the imposition of social hierarchies ties in with power.\n\nLet me summarize. Vulnerable groups are smashed down as dangerous and not fit to be full citizens, so a smaller group of elites can justify power by any means to protect society from these lowly and nasty influences.\n\nLet me make that messaging even simpler: Black and brown people are bad and shouldn't be allowed to participate in democracy because they don't deserve the right.\n\nHow does that play out at the ballot box?\n\nAll that talk about voter identification and election integrity is really about stopping people from voting — people who legally have the right to vote. Those who are least likely to be able to obtain proof of citizenship — which might require a passport or birth certificate, along with the money and know-how to get such documents — are often Black or brown people. They are often also poor, or poorer, and therefore have less time and money to put into obtaining documents, and also live in urban areas where they share polling places.\n\nIs it such a stretch to imagine some kind of federal oversight at those types of polling places, turning away — or simply intimidating away — legal voters who have long made up a strong bloc of the Democratic base?\n\nLet's hope that never happens. But the current undermining of the legitimacy of Black and brown voters is, Levin and Abdullah said, systemic and concerning.\n\nTrump's latest video is \"part of a floodgate of bigotry and conspiracy that relates to elections and immigrants and Black people and it's important to condemn the manner in which these puzzle pieces are put together to label African Americans and immigrants as a threat to democracy with respect to the vote,\" Levin said.\n\nThe premise of the video in question is that Democrats have engaged in a complicated and decades-long scheme to steal elections. It's presented as a documentary, and the images of the Obamas have been weirdly inserted as almost a subliminal flash near the end.\n\nIf you've missed the white supremacist postings that have now become commonplace on official government communications such as those from the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security, let me assure you that Levin is right and this primate video is indeed part of a \"firehose\" of white nationalist rhetoric coming not just from Trump, but from the federal government as a whole.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, for example, has turned its focus toward punishing diversity, equity and inclusion. Just this week, another federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, began a probe against Nike for allegedly discriminating against white people in hiring.\n\n\"It has been not even a dog-whistling, but a Xeroxing of the exact kind of terms that I've been looking at on white supremacists' and neo-Nazi websites for decades,\" Levin said.\n\nIt's not my place or intent to warn Black people about racism, because that would be ludicrous and insulting, but I'll warn the rest of us because in the end, authoritarianism targets everyone. This video is a clear statement that Trump's vision of America is one in which every non-white group, every vulnerable group really, is a second-class citizen.\n\n\"He's enabling an entire group of people who want to take this country back to a time when rampant violent white supremacy was enabled in the law,\" Abdullah said. \"What they mean is recapturing an old-school, oppressive racism that is pre-1965, pre-Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nThat message, Levin said, has \"a resonance with a decent part of his base,\" and when fed ceaselessly into the system, can have violent outcomes.\n\nLevin uses the example of when Trump tweeted during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" a phrase with a violent and racist history.\n\nLevin said Black people have always been the primary targets of hate crimes in the United States, but after that tweet, it was some of the \"worst days\" for violence aimed by race.\n\n\"When a high transmitter, like a president, circulates imagery with regard to prejudice, it creates these stereotypes and conspiracy theories, which then are the groundwork for further conspiracy theories and aggression,\" he added.\n\nAbdullah said she worries that even if the voter crackdown isn't officially sanctioned, those empowered conspiracy theorists will take action anyway.\n\n\"So the people who are so-called monitoring, self-appointed monitors ... this is who's going to be pulling people out of voter lines, and so this is what he's whipping up intentionally,\" she said.\n\nKeep your eye on the ball, folks, because the far-right Republicans running the show are laser-focused on it. The midterm elections have to go their way for them to remain in power.\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that outcome is to only allow voters who see things their way.\n\nGet the L.A.

    "description": "Indiana Rep. Sheila Klinker, 87, says this is her last election. She faces Republican Tracy Brown in a race that apparently defies political bitterness.",
    "fullText": "LAFAYETTE, IN — It hasn't been uncommon for longstanding state Rep. Sheila Klinker to face the occasional challenger through her 44 years of elections to represent Lafayette at the Indiana Statehouse. But this year she faces Tracy Brown, a Republican challenger with a long history of election victories.\n\nKlinker, a Democrat who had been a state representative since 1982, says this is her last election. Absolutely her last, the 87-year-old Lafayette representative insisted Friday.\n\n\"I thought maybe I might be able to do one more time without anybody running after me,\" Klinker joked.\n\nBrown is a candidate, but before he faces Klinker, he'll have to win the GOP primary in May, where he faces Oscar Alvarez, who ran against Klinker two years ago. Klinker defeated Alvarez by capturing more than 61% of the vote.\n\nWith eight years as Tippecanoe County sheriff and 12 years as Tippecanoe County commissioner, Brown has worked with lawmakers.\n\n\"What goes on in Indianapolis does impact us here locally,\" Brown said. \"That makes the work done by our local delegation really, really important.\"\n\nPlans to take his experiences of law enforcement and experiences as policy making as a commissioner to Indy.\n\n\"I want to use the perspective I've gained to serve this district,\" Brown said.\n\nKlinker and Brown have been friends for decades and worked together in their roles as public servants.\n\n\"If I had to have an opponent, I would rather it would be Tracy Brown than somebody else,\" Klinker said. \"Tracy and I have been friends for a long time. I feel like we're still friends even though we're opponents.\"\n\n\"This is something that I've pondered and thought about for years,\" Brown said, noting he's discussed it with Klinker.\n\nBrown, 63, declined to comment whether Klinker has the stamina to serve another two years.\n\n\"I've learned things from Sheila over the years. The way she shows up. The way she recognizes people,\" Brown said. \"Those are all things you expect of your elected officials.\"\n\nAsked whether she had the endurance for another two years of public service, Klinker said, \"The folks will tell you that I am at places where the others are not. I go to everything.\"\n\n\"I like what I do, so I work hard at it,\" she said. \"I still really enjoy it.\n\n\"I'll run this time, and then that will be it,\" she said, admitting some have said she said swore off running in 2024. \"I mean it this time.\n\n\"I do have the energy to do it,\" she said. \"I have been blessed with good health.\"\n\nIf Klinker and Brown square off in the fall election, don't expect snarky partisan sniping.\n\n\"I want to show you can do this in the right way,\" Brown said, \"and it doesn't have to be bitter, and it doesn't have to be hateful.\"\n\nThat's the Tippecanoe County way of governance between Democratic and Republican public officials.\n\n\"We get work done on a done on a daily basis together,\" Brown said.\n\n\"It's been an interesting career,\" Klinker said. \"The nice thing about it is it's not like Washington, D.C.

    "description": "Hikaru Fujita, who’s running in Sunday’s parliamentary election, is a standout in a country where expectant mothers rarely enter national politics.",
    "fullText": "For weeks, Hikaru Fujita, a candidate in Japan’s parliamentary elections on Sunday, wrestled with a secret. She was pregnant with her first child — a joyous milestone for her and her husband.\n\nBut Ms. Fujita, 35, a Harvard-educated former diplomat, worried that publicizing her pregnancy could hurt her campaign. In late January, she set aside her fears, announcing on social media that she had been “blessed with new life.”\n\n“I wanted to show that even pregnant women could run,” Ms. Fujita, from Nagano Prefecture, said in an interview. “I wanted to send a message to the younger generation.”\n\nOn social media, many people celebrated Ms. Fujita’s news, while others suggested that she should pursue a career as a housewife instead, and that a maternity leave would be a waste of taxpayers’ money.\n\nWith her revelation, Ms. Fujita, who is running for a seat in the powerful House of Representatives as a candidate for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, is testing Japan’s patriarchal system. She is one of a record number of women running for parliamentary seats on Sunday; 313 out of 1,285 candidates, or almost a quarter.\n\nDespite the election last fall of Sanae Takaichi as prime minister — the first woman to serve in that role — women remain significantly underrepresented in Japanese politics. They occupy only about 16 percent of seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nExpectant mothers rarely enter national politics; only a handful have run in local elections over the years. Many point to rampant workplace discrimination against young mothers. There is even a Japanese word for it: matahara, or maternity harassment.\n\nMs. Takaichi, a hard-line conservative from the same party, has avoided speaking out in public on gender issues. But she traveled to Nagano this week to campaign for Ms. Fujita. She is hoping the Liberal Democrats can pick up enough seats in the election to gain a majority and push through her agenda.\n\n“There is no one more incredible than her,” Ms. Takaichi said in Nagano. “Please give her strength.”\n\nMs. Fujita previously worked on issues like economic security and North Korea’s missile program for Japan’s foreign affairs ministry; she has also worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company. She said she was motivated to run after watching homes and fields in Nagano empty out as people left for cities. She also feels that Japan’s political system has become too fragmented and bureaucratic.\n\nOn the campaign trail, she has offered policies aimed at winning over women and families, including addressing gender pay gaps and expanding child care. She has also made a point of taking time to rest. Her campaign slogan is “Trying her best without overworking herself.”\n\nShe has frequently deployed her husband, Tomohiro Fujita, as her surrogate; he has taken time off from his job as a physics professor to help lead the campaign. He often appears alongside her, wearing a white beanie emblazoned with a Japanese word for husband.\n\nMs. Fujita said the negative comments about her candidacy were “discouraging, disappointing.” But she said she was trying to tune them out.\n\n“It affects me a little bit,” she said in the interview. “But at the end of the day, all these comments are invisible.”\n\nStill, she has occasionally encountered traditional attitudes on the campaign trail. Men often do not make eye contact with her during meetings, she said, instead looking at her husband.\n\n“I didn’t feel comfortable about it, but I also feel that they don’t do it on purpose — they do it unconsciously,” Ms. Fujita said.\n\nHer husband said that men appeared to be “nervous sitting in front of a powerful woman — they are uneasy.”\n\n“They feel more comfortable talking to me,” he said.\n\nMs. Fujita said she hopes her campaign can help challenge conceptions about who can wield power in Japanese society.\n\n“If I fail, I worry there will be fewer opportunities for younger women,” she said. “My job is to run a strong campaign but also to stay healthy and safe.”\n\nHisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.",

    "description": "Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye for 2026 NFL MVP by one vote, 24-23 in the closest MVP race in 22 years, however it was odd first-place nods for Justin Herbert and Josh Allen that might have made the difference.",
    "fullText": "Why Justin Herbert's first-place MVP vote is odd twist to Matthew Stafford victory over Drake Maye originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL was very close to having co-league MVP quarterbacks for the second time ever and first time in 22 years. Instead, the Rams' Matthew Stafford's margin of victory -- one first-place vote -- over the Patriots' Drake Maye (24-23) will go down as the closest decision in league history.\n\nNot since the Colts' Peyton Manning and the late Titans great Steve McNair tied 16-16 and shared MVP in 2003 has there been such a narrow call. Stafford edging Maye was the most expected result at Thursday's Associated Press NFL Honors ceremony, but it still came with controversy considering where the three other first-place votes went.\n\nWhile 47 of the 50 AP voters, which includes national beat reporters and television analysts such as Tom Brady, had a natural split between Stafford and Maye -- much like Josh Allen beating Lamar Jackson for 2024 MVP -- three went in a different direction. Two voters thought Allen should repeat and gave him a follow-up first-place love. But one inexplicably threw away their most valuable vote on Justin Herbert.\n\nMORE:How Matthew Stafford beat out Drake Maye in closest race since 2003\n\nThere was some logic to Allen's season with the Bills being worthy of some recognition, given it was more efficient than his winning year in many ways. But Herbert's year with the Chargers shouldn't have had a real case.\n\nHerbert wasn't even one of the five finalists \"nominated\" at the 2026 NFL Honors. Stafford, Maye and Allen were joined by Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence and 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who both didn't get any first place votes.\n\nBefore the AP reveals on Friday how all 50 voters ranked their top five from first to fifth, the Herbert voter outed himself -- it was former Pro Football Focus analyst Sam Monson.\n\nI was the Justin Herbert vote.\n\nThe guy had the worst offensive line in the NFL all season and despite that he was working miracles in almost every single game.\n\nStafford's OL became 2/5ths as bad as Herbert's for 5 minutes and he became a turnover howitzer.\n\nHe embodied 'value'.\n\n— Sam Monson (@SamMonsonNFL) February 6, 2026\n\nHerbert did have to deal with a broken-down offensive line with both top offensive tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt going down with season-ending injuries. He was sacked 54 times and the Chargers gave up 60 as a team.\n\nBut Maye also was sacked a ton, 47 times, with his rookie left tackle Will Campbell battling inexperience and injury. Maye led the league in completion percentage (72.0), yards per pass attempt (8.9) and passer rating (113.5). He also rushed for 450 yards.\n\nStafford led the league with his 4,709 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes while averaging 7.9 yards per attempt and rating 109.2.\n\nHerbert's numbers weren't close to either. He averaged 7.3 yards per attempt and rated 94.1. He threw for only 26 TDs with 13 interceptions while passing for fewer than 4,000 yards (3,727 yards). Those kind of mediocre numbers lack both efficiency and profilic nature, two things that count most in the history of the award, with MVP really being \"the best quarterback in the league award\".\n\nMORE:Matthew Stafford says he’s not retiring in 2026 NFL MVP Speech\n\nEvery quarterback that wins MVP has a favorable support system. Herbert might have been let down by his team, but in the end, MVP is an award for individual performance. Had Herbert put up transcendent numbers with those challenges, it's one thing. But one cannot blame Stafford or Maye for having better all-around support systems and taking full advantage.\n\nHerbert didn't deserve that vote, or even a fifth-place one.",

He seems to have great tools but an uncanny ability to stay off of the field (just eight games in a season-plus in the White Sox system). In 2025, he was assigned to Kannapolis but was … wait for it … injured. He lasted just eight games of ACL rehab before hitting the IL-60 again.\n\nAldrin Batista\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 SSS Prospect Vote ranking 6\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.2 years\nOverall 2025 stats 2-0 ▪️ 7 games (2 starts) ▪️ 14 IP ▪️ 5.79 ERA ▪️ 17 K ▪️ 7 BB ▪️ 1.429 WHIP ▪️-1.2 WAR\n\nBatista was our No. 6-voted player in last year’s poll and top righthander — and then disaster struck, as he started the third Dash game of the season on April 6 and then was out more than four months with a stress fracture in his right (pitching) elbow. His return in late August was iffy, with three poor relief appearances of five. But he ended the season with a scoreless (two-inning) “opener” start, which hopefully reverses the curse for 2026.\n\nRyan Burrowes\nSecond Baseman\nAge 21\n2024 SSS Prospect Vote ranking 23\n2025 SSS Prospect Vote ranking N/R\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -2.0 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Low-A/High-A) 111 games ▪️ 6 HR ▪️ 39 RBI ▪️ .255/.342/.355 ▪️ 47-of-53 (88.7%) SB ▪️ 39 BB ▪️ 110 K ▪️ .976 FLD%▪️ 1.1 WAR\n\nIt feels like Burrowes has been around forever, and he’s still only 21 years old (and playing at a level significantly younger than his age). His first taste of High-A ball went pretty well, as his baserunning seems to have no trouble translating at any level. The hit tool is solid, although he continues to struggle with contact — a no-no for a speed-over-power guy.\n\nCaden Connor\nLeft Fielder\nAge 25\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -2.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA/AAA) 126 games ▪️ 7 HR ▪️ 64 RBI ▪️ .272/.358/.366 ▪️ 13-of-16 (81.3%) SB ▪️ 60 BB ▪️ 81 K ▪️ .982 FLD%▪️ 1.9 WAR\n\nLike Ryan Galanie, it’s hard to know what to make of Connor. The end of the 2025 season, at Charlotte, marked the first time in his pro career that he’s not played old for his level. But aside from a dip in July, Connor hit well all season and didn’t get dunked underwater at Charlotte. Theoretically with a weak White Sox outfield, the sky’s the limit for him in 2026.\n\nReudis Diaz\nRight-handed relief pitcher\nAge 20\n2025 high level ACL (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -2.1 years\nOverall 2025 stats 1-1 ▪️ 1 SV▪️ 21 games (4 finishes) ▪️ 27 2/3 IP ▪️ 2.28.ERA ▪️ 18 K ▪️ 8 BB ▪️ 1.084 WHIP ▪️1.2 WAR\n\nWho? You’re forgiven for being unfamiliar with an extremely young arm who hasn’t yet gotten out of rookie ball, but our No. 77 prospect a year ago (then a starter, repeating the DSL and killing it) made a successful adjustment Stateside. He’ll return to starting in 2026, likely getting his feet wet in Arizona and getting a promotion to Low-A in the second half of the season.\n\nRyan Galanie\nFirst Baseman\nAge 25\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +1.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA) 119 games ▪️ 11 HR ▪️ 94 RBI ▪️ .276/.327/.422 ▪️ 14-of-17 (82.4%) SB ▪️ 35 BB ▪️ 79 K ▪️ .995 FLD%▪️ 1.1 WAR\n\nIt’s been a slow but steady climb for this 13th-rounder in 2023. The good news here is, with the caveat that Galanie has always competed older than his level, Galanie has found some footing. While his power/slugging numbers are merely OK, he drove in 94 runs in 2025. He disappeared a bit in the playoffs for Birmingham (just four hits in six games, with five walks as well) but started every game in the march to a second consecutive Southern League title for the Barons.\n\nJairo Iriarte\nRight-Handed Relief Pitcher\nAge 24\n2025 SSS Top Prospect Vote Ranking 19\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -4.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Rookie/AAA) 3-3▪️ 1 SV ▪️ 37 games (5 starts, 9 finishes) ▪️ 48 IP ▪️ 7.13 ERA ▪️ 50 K ▪️ 37 BB ▪️ 1.917 WHIP ▪️ -0.8 WAR\n\nThe 2025 season was an utter disaster for Iriarte, who went from prospective South Side rotation member to lost in space. The righty, who made his brief debut in the majors in 2024, both lost the plate and misplaced his strikeout power. The Brian Bannister Pitching Lab has its work cut out here, for sure.\n\nJavier Mogollón\nShortstop\nAge 20\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.4 years\nOverall 2025 stats 51 games ▪️ 5 HR ▪️ 19 RBI ▪️ .220/.347/.387 ▪️ 15-of-21 (71.4%) SB ▪️ 30 BB ▪️ 56 K ▪️ .971 FLD%▪️ 1.0 WAR\n\nAn ascending star just one year ago, we have to tap the breaks a bit on Mogollón after a lackluster first full season of minors ball. While still young for his level and managing to keep his head above water in a new league every season of his career, Mogollón’s undeniable hitting in Rookie ball fell off significantly with the Cannon Ballers. However, how much of that was due to battling injury is undetermined, as Mogollón was shelved for what turned out to be the season on July 2.\n\nYobal Rodriguez\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 18\n2025 high level DSL White Sox (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -1.5 years\nOverall 2025 stats 0-3 ▪️ 13 games (10 starts) ▪️ 30 1/3 IP ▪️2.97 ERA ▪️ 33 K ▪️ 13 BB ▪️ 1.022 WHIP ▪️ 1.2 WAR\n\nRodriguez is a rare DSL pitcher, not for his relatively light innings load, but as a primary starter — and at just 17 years old (Yobal turns 18 on February 9). Inasmuch as it’s tough to project anyone out of the DSL, especially pitchers, you could hardly have hoped for more from him in his pro debut.\n\nColby Shelton\nShortstop\nAge 23\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level +1.6 years\nOverall 2025 NCAA stats 45 games ▪️ 7 HR ▪️ 35 RBI ▪️ .377/.458/.606 ▪️ 6-of-9 (66.7%) SB ▪️ 21 BB ▪️ 24 K ▪️ 2.7 WAR\n\nShelton is more of a slugger than a speedster, with the usual caveats about whether he will stick at shortstop. His credentials are impressive, playing full-time in the SEC in all three of his college years (one at Alabama, two with Georgia). Given the crowded field for the White Sox at shortstop, Shelton’s defensive ability will mean very little provided he can keep clubbing.\n\nPast South Side Sox Prospect votes\n\nHere is how 2018 wrangled out — all 42 picks. Also, here is an archive of every article in the 2018 series.\n\nHere is how 2019 came together, all 50 picks, and the archive as well.\n\nHere is the 2021 wrap-up of just 35 picks due to flagging participation, along with the full archive.\n\nHere is the 2022 link to the 27-pick wrap, along with the full archive.\n\nRound 24 of voting was the last of 2023 (we did not do an actual wrap for the voting, but Jordan Sprinkle ended up being our final pick), and the full archive.\n\nIn 2024 Abraham Núñez was our 34th pick to end the series, and here is the wrap-up post and full archive of each profile.\n\nAnd last year, we did 31 picks, ending with Eric Adler.

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s approval rating polls released at the start of 2026 indicate a gradual decline in public support for the President. One year into his second term, the data suggest that voter confidence has softened, even as his presidency continues to provoke strong reactions on both ends of the political spectrum.\n\nThe polling data from early 2026 shows a decline in support for President Donald Trump as midterm elections near. Multiple surveys conducted in late January reveal a consistent trend: more Americans now disapprove of his job performance than approve.\n\nTrump’s approval rating is currently mired in the upper 30s to low 40s, while his disapproval consistently registers above 50%. This negative shift comes after a year of big policy moves and political upheaval. This includes a protracted government shutdown and aggressive federal budget cuts, as well as the controversial domestic deployment of U.S. troops (via Democrat & Chronicle).\n\nA New York Times survey puts his support at 41%, with 56% opposed. The Economist shows a similar 38% to 56% split. Meanwhile, pollsters like Rasmussen and Morning Consult show a slightly tighter race, with approvals at 46%. Others, like Pew Research Center and American Research Group, report a starker deficit, with unfavorable ratings reaching 61% and 63%, respectively. This broad spectrum of Donald Trump’s approval rating polls points to a challenging political environment for the White House.\n\nAnalysts suggest this dip is rooted in more than just policy disputes. A detailed Pew Research Center study from late January probed deeper into public trust, finding widespread skepticism. According to their report, “more Americans express little or no confidence in Trump than say they are extremely or very confident in him.” This deficit of confidence spans critical areas, including his leadership, mental fitness, selection of advisors, and commitment to democratic values and ethics.\n\nThe post Donald Trump’s New Approval Rating Polls Show Major Changes appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.",
    "fullText": "With now just a month to go until Election Day, the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas has become so fraught that a TikToker’s accusations have roiled the race and prompted a major endorsement in the backlash.\n\nThe incident started Sunday night when Morgan Thompson posted a video recounting what she says was a comment Texas state Rep. James Talarico made to her in a private conversation in January: that he called his onetime opponent, former US Rep. Colin Allred, a “mediocre Black man.”\n\nTalarico’s campaign released a statement from the candidate on Monday calling Thompson’s claims “a mischaracterization of a private conversation,” going on to explain, “I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre — but his life and service are not.” Thompson acknowledged that she didn’t have a recording and that they had previously agreed to treat their conversation as off the record.\n\nBut the accusation slammed Talarico’s campaign on Monday, sending aides into a flurry and prompting Allred — who dropped out of the Senate race when Rep. Jasmine Crockett decided to make a last-minute entry — to endorse her in the intense race, despite frustrations he had in December that she had chased him out of the race by getting in. It also renewed the questions about identity politics and electability that have riven the primary and the Democratic Party more broadly.\n\nThompson alleges that Talarico, who is White, said: “I signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman.”\n\nTalarico, in his statement denying the exact wording as Thompson relayed it, said, “I understand how my critique of the Congressman’s campaign could be interpreted given this country’s painful legacy of racism, and I care deeply about the impact my words have on others.”\n\nIn an interview on Monday evening, Allred told CNN he felt the campaign’s statement is “an admission that he said what he said,” and expressed surprise that he hadn’t heard from Talarico directly.\n\n“I responded not just on my behalf, but on behalf of Black candidates around the country that even if you run six points ahead of your presidential candidate, you’re still called ‘mediocre,’” Allred said, referring to his results in the 2024 Senate race as compared to Kamala Harris in the state. (Allred outperformed Harris by about five points.)\n\nThompson told CNN that she had been turned on to Talarico’s campaign by a friend last fall and preferred him over Allred. After attending an event of his in Dallas, she started using her social media following to boost him. Talarico’s staff reached out about her video from the rally, she said, and was soon feeding her information like fundraising numbers and clips from his “Jubilee” online debate to help.\n\n“It was like a symbiotic kind of thing. I wasn’t paid by the campaign at all,” Thompson said, though, “I was in constant communication with the campaign.”\n\nThompson said the relationship started to break down after she got a fundraising text for Talarico, signed by the Democratic strategist James Carville, who has been urging Democrats to start moving away from identity politics. Thompson said she saw that as an implicit critique of Black women, and that when she raised her frustrations with the campaign, an aide offered her to have a conversation with Talarico — either on camera for her to post, or “off the record,” as what was meant to be a private conversation.\n\nShe says she opted for the less formal conversation, without a recording. But she says she remembers the exchange, which took place backstage before a town hall in Plano on January 12, very well. Thompson said she raised concerns about the association with Carville and suggested that maybe he was chasing a big name, prompting Talarico to say, “So you’re concerned about me being a sell out?” She said she told him he was overlooking the racial dynamics he’d tipped into, prompting him to say, “I have blind spots.”\n\nCampaign spokesman JT Ennis confirmed the association with Thompson — “the Talarico campaign works with lots of creators in Texas to keep them updated on the campaign,” he said — and that they did speak before the Plano event. But Ennis told CNN Talarico does not recall making either of those statements, and that his version was backed up by an aide whom both said was in the room but was not made available for an interview.\n\nThe conversation turned, Thompson said, when she mentioned to Talarico online chatter she was seeing from people wishing he had run for governor instead — an option he had considered before launching the Senate run and was urged to reconsider when Crockett jumped into the race late.\n\n“That is when he said, ‘I signed up to run against a mediocre black man, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman,’” Thompson said, “That is a direct quote.”\n\nThompson also accused Talarico’s campaign of trying to silence her, claiming that her Instagram account had disappeared and her Threads account had been suspended within minutes of when she posted a video about her claims. Thompson does not know how this would have happened, she acknowledged, given that no one on the campaign has her password, but “It’s just too many factors in play. It’s just too many abnormalities. The timing of it was so fast.”\n\nAs for Thompson’s claims about the social media accounts being closed, Ennis said, “No. We do not have that kind of power, nor would we ever do that.”\n\nShortly after Thompson’s video went viral, Allred posted his own video ripping Talarico.\n\n“Let me just give you some free advice, James,” Allred said. “If you want to compliment Black women, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.”\n\nHe also suggested Talarico, a Presbyterian seminarian, was getting unfair attention for his discussion on the campaign trail of Christianity and how Democrats can make inroads with religious voters.\n\n“We don’t need you,” he said. “You’re not saying anything unique. You’re just saying it looking like you do.”\n\nThe Senate primary is March 3. Allred is also on the ballot that day, in a House primary against Rep. Julie Johnson that he entered after leaving the Senate race.",

Menefee’s win will, at least temporarily, narrow that gap.\n\nSixteen candidates ran to fill the remainder of Turner’s term in the House after he died in March, though none received a majority of votes. Turner, who was first elected to Congress in November 2024 and died last year, had himself succeeded the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D), after she died the July prior.\n\nMenefee will serve the remainder of Turner’s term, but will then run again for a full term for the seat in March after the district was redrawn last year. Edwards and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) have also filed to run in that primary.",

    "description": "Bitcoin fell toward $83,000 as the U.S. entered a partial shutdown, with traders leaning defensive ahead of a House vote expected Monday.",
    "fullText": "Crypto prices remained under pressure on Friday as the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown after lawmakers missed a midnight funding deadline, adding another layer of uncertainty to a market already struggling to find buyers.\n\nBitcoin traded around $83,559, up about 1% on the day but down roughly 6.8% over the past week, according to the price screen.\n\nEther sat near $2,686, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours and 9% on the week. XRP changed hands near $1.72, down about 1.6% on the day and close to 10% lower over seven days.\n\nThe shutdown itself looks short. The Senate passed a funding package, but the House is out until Monday, so the government will still hit a technical lapse over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Saturday that it would operate with \"very limited staff\" from Jan. 31 onward due to the shutdown.\n\nThat timing matters for risk assets because it lands right into thin weekend liquidity and a heavy headline cycle, which may pressure bitcoin and the broader crypto market over the weekend.\n\nThere is also a clean crypto angle here that is not just “risk off.” Prediction markets have spent the past 24 hours showing how messy the definition of “shutdown” can get.\n\nTraders on Polymarket and Kalshi were forced to think like lawyers. The government can be “shut” on paper at 12:01 a.m. and still look normal to most people for two days. That gap between legal status and real-world impact is exactly where contract wording and settlement rules start to bite.\n\nFor crypto, the shutdown headline is more of a sentiment stress test than a direct economic shock. It keeps traders cautious, pushes people toward smaller position sizes, and makes dips feel heavier because buyers do not want to step in front of a weekend news tape.",

    "fullText": "The US federal government is shutting down again, but it won't be like last time.\n\nFunding for a slew of federal agencies runs out at midnight late on Friday, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill failed to send a series of bills to fund those agencies to President Donald Trump's desk in time.\n\nEven though the Senate passed a series of bills to fund the government on Friday, the House is not set to vote on them until late Monday at the earliest, meaning the shutdown will last at least a few days.\n\nSome parts of the federal government have already been funded, meaning that the shutdown, even if it drags out, is only partial.\n\nAdditionally, it's unlikely that this shutdown will last as long as the one that began in October, which stretched for 43 days and became the longest government shutdown in American history.\n\nIn October, funding for the entire federal government was being held up, and the shutdown was far-reaching. This time, some parts of the federal government would remain operational.\n\nThat's because Congress has already passed a series of spending bills that fund agencies and programs through September 30.\n\nAmong those programs are SNAP and WIC, which were notably affected by the previous shutdown. Additionally, national parks would likely remain open, veterans would continue to receive benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and staff on Capitol Hill would continue to be paid.\n\nBut plenty of other government agencies and programs would be affected if the shutdown drags out, including the Department of Defense (including troops), the State Department, the Treasury Department, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNotably, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would remain operational, even though it's funded via the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThat's because DHS received $190 billion in funding via the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July, including $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP.\n\nUnlike in the fall, lawmakers in both parties are working together to try to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\n\nThe odds of a shutdown first rose following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats vowed to oppose a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and CBP, until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of six funding bills, including the DHS bill, and they had been stitched together into one package in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate has now passed a reformulated version of that package, with DHS funding continuing for only two weeks to allow for a renegotiation.\n\nIt's unclear as of now whether that package will pass the House when lawmakers return to the lower chamber next week.",

    "fullText": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin is one of the many California-based billionaires pouring millions into donations ahead of the state's proposed wealth tax.\n\nBrin, along with other tech executives, venture capitalists, and philanthropists, donated a combined $35 million to ballot measure committees in January, supporting affordable housing ballots in California, per a disclosure seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe disclosure was filed by the coalition \"Building a Better California.\"\n\nBrin was the largest contributor in the filing, donating $20 million. Others donated large sums on various days in January, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and PayPal CEO Max Levchin, who donated $2 million and $1 million, respectively.\n\nOthers in the list include DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr.\n\nBrin's multimillion-dollar donation comes ahead of California's vote on a measure that would levy a one-time, 5% tax on billionaires in the state. The tax, due in 2027, would be imposed retroactively from January 1 this year.\n\nGroups like the one Brin donated to are part of a concerted push by billionaires to negate the need for the wealth tax, either by funding alternative programs or by funneling money into political action committees opposed to the measure.\n\nReactions to the potential tax have been mixed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he's \"perfectly fine\" with it, saying this month that Silicon Valley's talent pool was worth any taxes.\n\nHowever, other executives have taken a more defensive stance. Brin and Google's other cofounder, Larry Page, moved an LLC they are both tied to from California to Delaware in December.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said the tax would be \"horrendous\" for innovation. White House AI czar David Sacks said the tax, if enacted, would be akin to an \"asset seizure.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Palantir's chairman, Peter Thiel, donated $3 million to the California Business Roundtable in December, which has directly opposed the wealth tax.\n\nRepresentatives for the executives did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Parents, teachers and young people share their views on whether social media restrictions would work in the UK\n\nPressure is mounting on the UK government to introduce a ban on social media for under-16s, after a decisive vote in House of Lords in favour of Australian-style restrictions.\n\nPeers backed a Tory-led amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill by 261 votes to 150, despite the government opposing the move. Ministers are already considering a ban as part of a consultation due to report by the summer and so the Lords amendment is unlikely to pass in the Commons. Starmer is also understood to want to wait until evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December, has been assessed, though the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has urged him to “just get on with it”.\n\nHere parents, teachers and young people share their views.\n\nLaura, a parent from East Dunbartonshire, says the scale of harmful content circulating on social media has left many families feeling powerless. Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.\n\n“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”\n\nLaura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”\n\nRachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.\n\n“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”\n\nIn the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”\n\nRachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.\n\nWhen she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”\n\nJulia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.\n\n“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”\n\nFrom the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.\n\n“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”\n\nBut she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.\n\n“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”\n\nTahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.\n\nTahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.\n\nBut feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.\n\nShe believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”\n\nAJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.\n\n“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”\n\nAJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.\n\n“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”\n\nThey are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.\n\n“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.\n\nPhil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.\n\nIn principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.\n\nPhil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”",

    "description": "Polian addresses his vote on SiriusXM NFL Radio,",
    "fullText": "The Bill Belichick snub led to another compelling storyline regarding the role of Hall of Fame G.M. Bill Polian in the outcome. A day later, an important point of clarification has emerged.\n\nPolian, after saying he voted for Belichick before saying he can't say with 100 percent certainty whether he did, says he did indeed vote for his former New England nemesis.\n\n“I voted for coach Belichick in the Hall of Fame selection meeting,” Polian said in an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio, after explaining he was reading from a prepared statement. “The Pro Football Hall of Fame has confirmed that fact through the auditors of the selection process. Again, I’ll state that I never said that I believe that Coach Belichick should quote, wait a year, close quote, for enshrinement. This has been confirmed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, numerous selectors who were in the room, and my vote for coach Belichick. As a Hall of Fame member and selector, I realize the import of what we do. I’ve always tried as a selector to make these difficult choices with the utmost of objectivity. I’ve said on SiriusXM Radio and numerous other media outlets that I believe Coach Belichick to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, my vote confirms that.”\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter. Not enough of the voters voted for Belichick. At least 11 of 50 failed to include Belichick among three selections from a group that included Belichick, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig, and L.C. Greenwood.\n\nFrom those five choices, who would be your three? And is there any way Belichick wouldn't be one of them?",

    "description": "Here's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.",
    "fullText": "Why Bill Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer after controversial vote: 'Six Super Bowls isn't enough?' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBill Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history and the only head coach with six Super Bowl wins, but that isn't enough to make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nIn his first year of eligibility, the former New England Patriots coach was not elected to Canton, as he did not reach the 40 votes necessary to earn an election. Belichick will remain on the ballot moving forward, but he will not be part of a prestigious group to earn a first-ballot election.\n\nBelichick's NFL coaching career ended on a sour note, but he still has 302 regular season wins, third most all-time, and 31 playoff wins, which is the most all-time. Belichick's six Super Bowls are two more than second place, and his nine Super Bowl appearances are three more than second place.\n\nHere's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best Patriots of all time\n\nAccording to ESPN, Belichick didn't get enough votes necessary to make the Hall of Fame due to his baggage in the NFL. ESPN reports that Belichick's roles in both Spygate and Deflategate kept him out on first try, as some voters may think Belichick should wait at least a year as some sort of punishment.\n\n\"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a veteran Hall voter said, via ESPN. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"\n\nAdditionally, the voting process for coaches is different than the process for players. Belichick is one of five owners, executives, coaches and players competing for up to three available spots separate from teh 15 modern-era finalists, forcing each voter to pick three of those five.\n\nAlong with Belichick, the other four finalists include Patriots owner Robert Kraft, former quarterback Ken Anderson, former running back Roger Craig and former defensive end L.C. Greenwood.\n\nESPN writer and Hall of Fame voter Mike Sando explained the difficult process of voting for these players, saying that they have an extremely high bar to clear.\n\nI'm a HOF voter who saw Belichick as slam-dunk. I don't know anything about voting results, but if this is true, and we'll find out officially next week, the question is, how could this happen?\n\nBefore I list possibilities, understand this:\n\nBelichick, Kraft, Craig, Anderson &… https://t.co/V8okBDsReH\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 27, 2026\n\nMORE: Who is on the Mount Rushmore of Boston sports?\n\n\"Spygate\" was a Patriots cheating scandal from the 2007 season. Then-New York Jets head coach, and former Patriots assistant, Eric Mangini tipped off the NFL to the Patriots illegally videotaping Jets' defensive signals on the sidelines.\n\nThe NFL ultimately fined Belichick $500,000, the Patriots $250,000, and forced New England to forfeit its 2008 first-round pick.\n\nMORE: What was Bill Belichick's record without Tom Brady\n\nWhen Belichick found out he did not make the Hall of Fame, the veteran coach was understandably upset. ESPN reports that Belichick was \"puzzled\" and \"disappointed\" by his omission from the Hall this year, as he believes he was left out due to \"politics\"instead of accomplishments.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick reportedly asked an associate. \"What does a guy have to do?\"\n\nMORE: The 10 longest-tenured coaches in NFL history\n\nHere are the hall-of-fame coaches who were elected to the Hall on first ballot.\n\nBoth Halas and Lambeau were elected to the Hall of Fame as part of the first ever induction class, so they weren't first-ballot in the same way the other three were. Shula is the all-time wins leader, while he, Landry and Noll have a combined eight Super Bowl titles and 15 Super Bowl appearances.\n\nMORE: Breaking down the worst losses of Bill Belichick's career\n\nThere are 50 Hall of Fame voters that comprise of NFL writers and a media members. Among the voters are foremr Indianapolis Colts GM Bill Polian, who works for SiriusXM NFL radio and reportedly believes Belichick should wait a year to be inducted.\n\nThe full list of NFL Hall of Fame voters can be found here.\n\nBill Belichick has six Super Bowl victories, which is the most all-time among NFL coaches. Only Tom Brady has more Super Bowls as a player, and six of his seven came with Belichick as his head coach.\n\nBill Belichick is 73 years old, but is still coaching as he is about to enter his second season as North Carolina's head coach.",

    "description": "Senate Democrats say they won't vote for a bill to fund DHS after the deadly ICE shooting, threatening to imperil a broader government funding effort.",
    "fullText": "Just days ago, it looked like the US would avoid a repeat of the government shutdown that took place in the fall.\n\nThen, federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the span of just a few hours following the shooting on Saturday, the odds that the government will shut down later this week rose from roughly 10% to the high 70s on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.\n\nThat's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\n\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. \"Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"\n\nThere are only two ways out of this:\n\nBut even if lawmakers go with the second option, a short shutdown through the weekend is likely.\n\nTo avoid a government shutdown after midnight late Friday evening, the Senate would need to pass the six-bill package, which funds DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things.\n\nThose six bills have already passed the House, and they've been stitched together into one larger package in the Senate.\n\nThe GOP may control the upper chamber, but they can't ignore Democrats. Due to the Senate's 60-vote \"filibuster\" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one.\n\nDemocrats are only opposed to the DHS bill, and Schumer has called on Republicans to work with Democrats to separate out the bills. But the GOP has balked so far at that idea.\n\nFurthermore, even if the bills are separated, the House would have to vote on them again to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nThe House is out of session until next week, meaning a shutdown at least until then is highly likely.\n\nJust months ago, the federal government shut down for 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad.\n\nFor one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30.\n\nSNAP and WIC payments would be unaffected, Capitol Hill staffers would still get paid, and national parks would likely remain open.\n\nAdditionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward.\n\nIn the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding.\n\nThat means it's plausible that the Senate would separate out the other five bills, the House would re-pass those bills next week, and the partial shutdown would only last a few days.\n\nStill, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. It also funds the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThat raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time.\n\nAdditionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.\n\nWhile the current DHS funding bill contains an additional $10 billion for ICE, the agency also received roughly $75 billion in funding via the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" in July.\n\nUnless lawmakers were to agree to rescind that funding — extremely unlikely given GOP control of Congress — that money's here to stay.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump may still dominate the news cycle, but inside the White House, the foundations of his power are weakening—and he knows it, according to Trump’s biographer.\n\nOn the latest episode of Inside Trump’s Head, author Michael Wolff described a White House increasingly gripped by anxiety as the president enters a pivotal midterm year burdened by collapsing polls, international resistance, self-inflicted crises that refuse to fade, and growing alarm among aides that Trump is losing interest in the presidency.\n\n“If you lose Donald Trump’s interest, you lose Donald Trump,” Wolff said.\n\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s not interested in bureaucracy. He’s interested in unfettered attention.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, the daily work of governing—incremental wins, trade-offs, and detail—bores Trump, draining his energy at a moment when political discipline matters most.\n\nThat disengagement has become increasingly visible on the world stage. After heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos expecting to be treated as an untouchable strongman, Trump instead encountered coordinated resistance from allies who, Wolff argued, are no longer content to maneuver quietly around him.\n\n“Trump’s virtue to voters is that no matter what happened, he looked strong,” Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.\n\n“Now he cannot take Greenland, he cannot take Canada, he cannot do any of the things that he has huffed and puffed and said he will do.”\n\nWolff said the same pattern is playing out at home, where the administration has struggled to contain the fallout in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal immigration officers this month, further inflaming protests and political backlash.\n\n“This has now become a very, very complicated situation,” Wolff said.\n\nFor Trump, Minneapolis represents the kind of crisis he finds hardest to manage: one that can’t be bullied into submission or drowned out by spectacle.\n\n“He cannot threaten his way out of it,” Wolff said.\n\n“He can’t seem to generate a new headline to get himself out of it,” he continued. “The headlines that are generated are bad headlines.”\n\nThat dynamic, Wolff argued, points to a broader problem for Trump as the midterms approach. Governing, he said, demands a tolerance for incremental progress, which is at odds with Trump’s appetite for dominance and immediate results.\n\n“The work of the presidency does not inspire him,” Wolff said.\n\n“If it becomes complicated, that has to be pushed to the side.”\n\nAs Trump disengages, Wolff went on to say, the president has increasingly turned to performative conflict, including high-profile lawsuits and public feuds with powerful institutions. Once effective at projecting strength, those tactics now risk reinforcing the impression of a leader struggling to maintain control.\n\n“There’s only so many times you can sue people for $5 billion or $20 billion,” Wolff said. “You look foolish.”\n\nWith a little over nine months until the midterm elections, Wolff framed the moment as a genuine inflection point—not just for Republicans, but for Trump himself.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a pivotal campaign,” Wolff said.\n\n“Conceivably one of the most important campaigns ever waged. This is potentially, in November, the end of Donald Trump.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "description": "Sen. Adam Schiff also argued the money funded to DHS has been “wasted hand over fist.\"",
    "fullText": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Ca.) declared Sunday he’s “not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating” as deadly sweeping Immigration and Custom Enforcement raids led by the Trump administration have sparked political and public backlash.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Schiff made the statement after moderator Kristen Welker asked him if he’s “prepared to vote against Department of Homeland Security funding if it means partially shutting down the government, again, coming on the heels of an incredibly long shutdown.”\n\nPolitics: Democrats Consider Partial Government Shutdown To Curb ICE\n\nTelling Welker straight up that “Democrats are not going to fund that,” he continued, “The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding. It will be a Republican decision. They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”\n\nThe California senator noted Democrats are hoping “some of the Republicans in the Senate may see those scenes in the streets and be as repelled as we are, and vote against that continuation of violence also.”\n\nHe added: “If they don’t, it will be their decision whether they couple that funding for these ICE agents and Border Patrol agents with all these other government agencies.”\n\n“[Republicans] will make the decision. They’re in the majority if they want to shut down the government so they can perpetuate this violence,” Schiff said.\n\nPolitics: Sworn Witness Accounts Of Alex Pretti Killing Differ Sharply From DHS\n\nSchiff went on to vow he’s “not going to be a part of it.”\n\n“And I think anyone who votes to give them more money to do this will share in the responsibility and see more Americans die in our cities as a result.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker asked Schiff what the “exact impact” would be if legislators withhold funding now, considering “Republicans have already passed $170 billion in extra DHS funding through what they’ve dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Well, it would certainly, I hope, stop it from becoming even worse,” he responded. “They have thrown so much money at these agencies. They don’t know what to do with it. And there is no question that when we actually get a chance to do oversight again, which I hope will happen after this November, you are going to find all kinds of corruption [with] how that money is going out.”\n\nPolitics: House Passes Bill Funding ICE — With Help From Democrats\n\nSchiff then told Welker he believes they will find that the money has been “wasted hand over fist.”\n\n“There is going to be enormous waste, fraud and abuse in DHS given how money is being spent without any kind of real oversight,” he said.\n\nWatch Schiff’s interview on “Meet the Press” below.\n\nTrump Takes Aim At ‘Corrupt’ Adam Schiff As Next Target In His Political Retribution Tour\n\nAdam Schiff Calls Out Trump For 'Flip-Flopping' On Abortion\n\nRep.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods and products exported to the US should Ottawa make a trade deal with China.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whom he called \"Governor Carney,\" against making a \"drop off\" deal with Beijing or face the levies.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,\" he added.\n\nCarney made an official visit to China last week — the first by a Canadian leader since 2017 — meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss economic and trade opportunities between the two countries.\n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, Ottawa and Beijing said they had committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment, as well as building cooperation in areas such as energy and agriculture.\n\nCarney also announced that Canada would now allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market on the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In return, he said Canada expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by March 1.\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was what Carney \"should be doing\" and that it was \"a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"\n\nTrump's changing tone comes days after Carney delivered an impassioned speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he opined on the changing face of global politics since Trump's election.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney, who did not explicitly name Trump, said, adding that \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nTrump did not miss the opportunity to snap back at Carney during his own speech at Davos, saying the prime minister \"wasn't so grateful.\"\n\n\"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

He also placed Brigham Young, a Notre Dame 2026 opponent who also was skipped over in the College Football Playoff at No. 11.\n\nThere was a big omission as well, as Freeman opted to leave USC out of his top-25 all-together.

    "fullText": "Just months ago, Elon Musk seemed to swear off major political spending. That seems to be over now.\n\nThe tech titan has poured $10 million into a super PAC backing GOP Senate candidate Nate Morris in Kentucky, according to Axios and The New York Times.\n\nIt would be Musk's largest publicly known single contribution to a political candidate since the 2024 election, when he spent nearly $300 million and emerged as the GOP's largest donor.\n\nMorris, an entrepreneur and tech executive running on an \"America First\" platform, is running against two other candidates to succeed the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell. He's been backed by a slew of MAGA-aligned politicians and figures, though President Donald Trump has yet to make an endorsement in the race.\n\nOn an episode of Donald Trump Jr's \"Triggered\" podcast on Monday, Morris said that the super PAC contribution came after he had a \"terrific meeting\" with Musk last week.\n\n\"He got excited about the race, and I think he was excited that I was a business guy and entrepreneur, and decided to make a big contribution to the super PAC that's going to be helping our campaign,\" Morris said. \"We're so delighted to have Elon's support, and for him to go all-in on us.\"\n\nMusk has not yet publicly commented on the reported contribution, and spokespeople for Musk and his companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe world's richest man has also reported to have made major contributions to super PACs tied to House and Senate GOP leadership. It comes as he's appeared to largely mend his relationship with Trump.\n\n\"America is toast if the radical left wins,\" Musk wrote on X earlier this month in response to reports of those contributions. \"They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore.\"\n\nThe details of Musk's contributions will be publicly disclosed to the Federal Election Commission at the end of January.\n\nMore broadly, Musk appears to be re-engaging with American politics, posting about hot-button topics including immigration and his support for legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting.\n\nMusk spending big on an election would mark something of a reversal from the middle of last year.\n\nShortly before his feud with Trump erupted into public view, Musk declared that he was scaling back his political contributions.\n\n\"If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. \"I do not currently see a reason.\"\n\nThose comments came a month after he spent millions to support a GOP candidate in a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, only for that candidate to lose handily.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Letter signed by figures on right and left of party says UK should follow Australia’s example by enacting ban\n\nMore than 60 Labour MPs have written to Keir Starmer urging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, with peers due to vote on the issue this week.\n\nThe MPs, who include select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party, are looking to put pressure on the prime minister as calls mount for the UK to follow Australia’s precedent.\n\nStarmer has said he is open to a ban but members of the House of Lords are looking to force the issue when they vote this week on an amendment to the children, wellbeing and schools bill that would enact one within a year of the bill passing.\n\nThe vote could pit Labour peers against the prime minister, who is understood to want to wait to assess the evidence from the Australian ban, which came into force in December.\n\nIn the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”\n\nThey add: “Around the world, governments are recognising the severity of this crisis and taking action.” Noting existing or pending legislation in Australia, Denmark, France, Norway, New Zealand and Greece, they say: “We believe the onus must be placed on technology platforms, not parents, to prevent underage access. We would support a model similar to Australia’s that requires companies to take meaningful steps to enforce age limits.”\n\nThey conclude: “We urge the government to show leadership on this issue by introducing a minimum age for social media access of 16 years old.”\n\nThe signatories of the letter represent a wide spectrum of opinion within the party. They include Helen Hayes, the chair of the education select committee, and Florence Eshalomi, the chair of the housing and local government committee.\n\nOthers include Vicky Foxcroft, the former whip who helped lead the rebellion against the government’s proposed welfare cuts, and Catherine McKinnell, a former education minister. The letter has support from some on the left of the party such as Richard Burgon, and on the right such as the prominent “blue Labour” MP Jonathan Hinder.\n\nThe weight of Commons support for a ban will put further pressure on the prime minister, who has previously been sceptical about whether such a move would work, but who told MPs at a recent meeting that he would be open to one in theory.\n\nIn recent days, government figures have stressed they are concerned that a ban could force children on to the dark web, and they want to see more evidence before committing to enforcing one in the UK.\n\nOne source close to Starmer said: “In principle, Keir is in favour of a ban. We can all see the dangers and worry about what is happening to young people’s minds. But there are still big obstacles to overcome with implementation. We can already see that from Australia. We need to take our time and make sure we get this right.”\n\nA Downing Street figure suggested Starmer could give a ban his symbolic support soon, but the government would then take its time over implementation, “ironing out” any difficulties first.\n\nThey said: “It’s Keir’s direction of travel but there’s lots of hurdles to overcome first. We’re not going to rush into this.”\n\nLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: “There are strong arguments for banning under-16s from social media but there are also real concerns raised by the NSPCC and others about whether it pushes children to darker, less-regulated places on the internet.”\n\nThose arguments were reinforced over the weekend by Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after looking at suicide content online. Russell told the BBC’s Newscast he opposed what he called “sledgehammer-like techniques like bans”.\n\nThe prime minister’s position will be put to the test this week when peers vote on an amendment by the Conservative member John Nash to the children wellbeing and schools bill proposing enacting an age limit within 12 months of the bill’s passage.\n\nLabour has not said how it intends to vote on the issue yet but several peers are expected to support it regardless of whips’ instructions.\n\nThey include the former MP Luciana Berger, who has co-signed Nash’s amendment. She told the Guardian: “The proposal for raising the social media age limit for under-16s enjoys huge support – across the country and within the Labour party. Social media is catastrophically harming children and we must act now to protect them. I urge peers to back our amendment on Wednesday so we can give young people their childhood back.”",

    "description": "Despite midterm elections in November, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 to deliver double-digit returns over the next year.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 has usually performs poorly during midterm election years, declining by an average 18% at some point before November.\n\nThe stock market usually performs well after midterm elections (as policy uncertainty dissipates), returning an average of 14% during the next six months.\n\nWall Street's consensus estimate puts the S&P 500 at 8,085 by January 2027, which implies more than 16% upside from its current level of 6,940.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has delivered double-digit returns in three consecutive years. Wall Street expects the index to extend its streak in 2026, but midterm election years typically involve sharp declines.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has consistently performed poorly during midterm election years since it was created in 1957. Here are two facts investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has returned an average of 1% during midterm election years, but the index has declined by an average of 7% during those years when a new president sits in the White House.\n\nThe S&P 500 has suffered an average intra-year drawdown of 18% during midterm election years, meaning history says the index will drop 18% at some point in 2026.\n\nWhat explains that trend? Midterm elections create uncertainty, especially because the political party in power tends to lose seats in Congress. Investors are unsure where to put money because they are unsure whether the president will retain enough congressional votes to maintain the status quo. Uncertainty is poison to the stock market.\n\nHowever, policy uncertainty dissipates quickly after the midterm election results are finalized, and the stock market tends to deliver strong returns. In fact, Carson Research says the six-month period following a midterm election (i.e., November through April) is the strongest of the four-year presidential cycle. The S&P 500 has added an average of 14% in those six months.\n\nDoes that mean you should sell your stocks today and buy them back in November? Nope. Attempts to time the market often backfire. Famous fund manager Peter Lynch once said, \"Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, or trying to time the market, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\"\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has done quite well during some midterm election years. The index's return has ranged from up 38% to down 30%, and its largest intra-year decline has ranged from 4% to 38%. Most Wall Street analysts expect 2026 to be one of the better midterm election years.",

    "description": "Helldivers 2 prides itself on the concept of Managed Democracy, and in the latest example of crowdsourced decision-making, the game is asking players to choose a planet to blow up with a shiny new not-a-Death-Star superweapon. Fortunately, these planets aren't home to any brave Helldivers and are instead populated by the undemocratic factions that refuse to yield to Super Earth.\nThe latest twist in the Helldivers 2 saga kicked off last week when Super Earth announced that it was upgrading the Democracy Space Station with the Star of Peace weapon. The platform can now fire a \"macro-scale laser\" optimized for \"mass Freedom dispensation\" that collapses an entire planet into a black hole.\nHelldivers players are now being asked to boot up the Democracy Space Station voting panel from their Galactic Map and choose one of three planets: Zagon Prime, Penta, or Valmox.",

    "fullText": "Moderators accuse social media firm of unfair dismissal after it fired hundreds in UK just before vote to form union\n\nTikTok moderators have accused the social media company of “oppressive and intimidating” union busting after it fired hundreds of workers in the UK, beginning the process just before they were due to vote on forming a union.\n\nThe moderators wanted to establish a collective bargaining unit to protect themselves from the personal costs of checking extreme and violent content, and have claimed TikTok is guilty of unfair dismissal and breaching trade union laws.\n\nAbout 400 moderators in London were fired before Christmas in a process initiated a week before the vote was due to take place.\n\nTikTok, which has about 30m monthly users in Britain, strongly denies a legal claim that has been lodged with an employment tribunal on behalf of three former workers, describing it as “baseless”.\n\nIt said the sackings were part of a global restructuring involving roles in the UK, and south and south-east Asia amid the increasing use of AI to automate the removal of posts that violate content rules, with 91% of transgressive content now removed automatically.\n\nBut John Chadfield, the national officer for tech workers at the Communication Workers Union, which represented about 250 of the affected moderators, said of the legal action: “This is holding TikTok to account for union busting.”\n\nHe added: “Content moderators have the most dangerous job on the internet. They are exposed to the child sex abuse material, executions, war and drug use. Their job is to make sure this content doesn’t reach TikTok’s 30 million monthly users. It is high pressure and low paid. They wanted input into their workflows and more say over how they kept the platform safe. They said they were being asked to do too much with too few resources.”\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said: “These changes were part of a wider global reorganisation, as we evolve our global operating model for trust and safety with the benefit of technological advancements to continue maximising safety for our users.”\n\nThe dispute began in August 2025, when the union had been poised to ballot several hundred of TikTok’s moderators and quality assurance agents from the trust and safety team, whose job was to vet posts for compliance with TikTok’s rules – including traumatic posts processed at high speed. TikTok announced a restructuring exercise that put members of the proposed bargaining unit at risk of redundancy, according to the legal claim.\n\nRosa Curling, a co-executive director of the tech justice non-profit Foxglove, which is backing the action, called TikTok’s treatment of its content moderators “appalling”.\n\nShe said by “laying off essential safety workers they are putting the platforms’ users at risk”, adding: “TikTok has made its position clear: union busting and trampling on our labour laws comes first – the safety of its users, including millions of children, and the wellbeing of its essential safety workers, comes last. We hope the employment tribunal will force them to change course.”\n\nAccording to TikTok, its increasing use of AI has reduced moderators’ exposure to graphic content by 76% in the past year.\n\nMichael Newman, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “This case is an important example of how individuals who band together can stand up to the might of big tech firms, and especially of how the fig leaf of AI cost savings should not be allowed to obscure vital safety concerns.”",

We’re shocked! https://t.co/m8jo5294lS\n\n— Governor Newsom Press Office (@GovPressOffice) July 27, 2025\n\nThose clips spurred experts to question Trump’s frequent boasts of winning golf tournaments.\n\n“He can clearly step up to a ball and strike it, but when it comes to the short game, he looks like he’s going to be found out sooner or later,” coach Craig Normansell told the Daily Beast. “It certainly doesn’t look like the level of someone who’s won 18 club championships.”\n\nTrump certainly appears to be playing enough to prevent any rust. By the end of 2025, he had spent 88 days—one quarter of the year—at a golf course, according to the Trump Golf Tracker.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what Graham told prosecutors.\n\nThe more questions arise about Trump’s golf game, the more he seems to brag. In a Thanksgiving phone call with troops, he claimed to have won 38 golf titles.\n\nGolf writer Rick Reilly, who wrote the Trump book Commander in Cheat, said the real number was zero.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil landed an interview with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and one of the unusual moments came when the president talked of what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nThe president was claiming Harris would have continued what he called a “mess” of an economy under Joe Biden.\n\nTony Dokoupil’s First Week As ‘CBS Evening News’ Anchor Down Year Over Year; ‘World News Tonight’ Tops Viewers, ‘Nightly News’ Wins 25-54 Demo\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nNew 'CBS Evening News' Anchor Tony Dokoupil To Interview Donald Trump\n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now, if she got in. You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

Votes are limited to one per hour per device.\n\nArrowhead boys basketball's Trey Resch was the winner of last week's poll.\n\nHere are this week's nominees. If the poll does not display, refresh your browser.\n\nThe first-year competitive swimmer has dropped seven seconds on his 200-yard freestyle time and four seconds from his 100-yard freestyle time while providing a valuable boost to Tremper's 200 and 400 freestyle relay teams.\n\nFofana scored 30 points, along with seven rebounds and six assists, in an 80-68 win over Pius XI Catholic on Jan. 6.\n\nThe senior broke two school records in the 100- and 200-yard freestyle events in a meet with Cedarburg, including Zach Miller's 100 record (:49.48) by finishing in :49.29 and Adam Jajtner's 200 time (1:49.72) by finishing in 1:47.44.

Zizka tallied an assist on a goal in the third period to make it 2-0 in a 2-1 win over USM and then, in another 2-1 victory over Arrowhead, Zizka lit the lamp twice, including the game-winning goal at the 9:27 mark of the third period.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Vote for Piggly Wiggly high school athlete of the week for Jan. 5-10",

    "fullText": "The Associated Press announced the 2025 NFL All-Pro first and second teams. The Arizona Cardinals had only one player make one of the squads, and it is no surprise.\n\nFollowing his record-breaking season, tight end Trey McBride is a first-team All-Pro.\n\nHe was one vote short of joining Seattle Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Los Angeles Rams receiver Puka Nacua as the only unanimous first-team All-Pros. Forty-nine of the 50 voters gave McBride a first-place vote at tight end. The other went to San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle.\n\nMcBride finished the season with 126 receptions for 1,239 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe was second in the NFL in catches only to Nacua, who had 129. He set an NFL single-season record for receptions by a tight end, breaking Zach Ertz' 2018 mark of 116. He broke his own single-season franchise record for receptions by a tight end and set the franchise single-season record for receptions by anyone, beating DeAndre Hopkins' 2020 mark of 115.\n\nHis 1,239 yards are the most in a season in franchise history by a tight end. He was sixth in the NFL in receiving yards and tied for second in receiving touchdowns.\n\nHe was one of very few bright spots for the Cardinals in 2025, who went 3-14.\n\nThis will surely be the first of what could be many All-Pro nods for McBride in his career. He was also named a Pro Bowler for the second straight season.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump laid into Republican Senator Susan Collins in an expletive-laden phone call after she voted against one of his top priorities.\n\nThe president reportedly made a “profanity-laced” call to the vulnerable Republican senator on Thursday, sources told The Hill. Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump spoke to House Republicans as the party braces for impact in the 2026 midterms. He teased he can't cancel the election.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touched on canceling the election while also dismissing the prospect in a wide-ranging speech on Jan. 6.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans at the newly dubbed \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" he encouraged the lawmakers to campaign on his priorities to keep control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. He expressed confusion about the poor public opinion of his job performance, saying Republicans have the \"right policy.\"\n\nRiffing on tariffs during his speech, he said, \"if you have the wrong president, nothing's good.\"\n\n\"We found that out for four years... They had the worst policy and we have to even run against these people,\" he said. \"I won't say 'cancel the election, they should cancel the election,' because the fake news will say 'he wants the elections canceled, he's a dictator.' They always call me a dictator.\"\n\nTrump vs. the midterm blues: Can he get MAGA voters excited (and voting) in 2026?\n\nRepublicans currently hold the majority in both chambers of Congress, though the House's majority is shrinking with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's departure and unexpected emergencies with other GOP members.\n\nThe president's party often loses in midterm elections, though Trump in his speech rallied to break that trend. His political future depends on it, he said.\n\n\"You’ve got to win the midterms,” Trump said. “If we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be – they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”\n\nTrump was impeached twice in his first term by House Democrats, and the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nEvery House Representative and a third of Senators will be up for reelection on Nov. 3, 2026, when various local and state elections will also happen. That means any eligible U.S. citizen could vote in the midterm.\n\nMidterm elections usually see lower voter turnout compared to presidential election years. Though 2018, the midterms in Trump's first term, brought a jump in turnout at 53.4%, according to Census Bureau data. In 2022, the turnout was 52.2%. Compare those to the 2020 presidential election, a record-breaking year, which saw a turnout rate of 66.8%.\n\nOlder voters are more likely to turn out in non-presidential years and also more likely to vote Republican, according to Reuters. White voters and college-educated voters made up a larger portion of voters than nonvoters in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Zachary Schermele, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

    "fullText": "Terry Zink has spent his entire life in the woods.\n\nAs a 57-year-old third generation houndsman from Marion, Montana — a town tucked into the Flathead National Forest — Zink hunts mountain lions and bears while running a small archery target business.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nHe also voted for Trump, but after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) implemented deep cuts to the federal agencies that manage America’s public lands in 2025, Zink is openly second-guessing his vote.\n\n“You won’t meet anyone more conservative than me, and I didn’t vote for this,” Zink told Politico (1). “You cannot fire our firefighters. You cannot fire our trail crews. You have to have selective logging, and water restoration, and healthy forests.”\n\nAcross Montana, the impact is already being felt. Hunters are running into overgrown trails, ranchers are watching as drought resilience and wildfire mitigation funds are frozen, and outfitters and guides — who brought in roughly $314 million to Montana in 2024 — are dealing with staffing cuts that have affected their business.\n\nAnd this isn’t just happening in Montana.\n\nVersions of this scenario are playing out across the west, with real consequences for rural jobs, small businesses and the cost of hunting and fishing on public lands.\n\nSince early 2024, the federal workforce that manages America’s public lands has shrunk by about 20%, dropping from 79,070 employees to 63,141 by September 2025, according to the Center for American Progress (2).\n\nThe cuts have hit these specific agencies the hardest (3):\n\nU.S. Forest Service: Approximately 3,400 jobs cut\n\nNational Park Service: Approximately 1,000 jobs cut\n\nBureau of Land Management: Approximately 800 jobs cut\n\nRoughly 97% of Bureau of Land Management employees work outside of D.C., often in small remote towns where federal agencies are among the biggest employers (4). When ranger stations close or seasonal crews disappear, the economic fallout can spread to local gas stations, restaurants and diners, as well as hotels and motels.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion in economic output in 2023, made up 2.3% of U.S. GDP and supported five million jobs (5). States like Montana, Alaska, Vermont and Hawaii rely on outdoor recreation at twice the national average. In Montana alone, the sector pumped $3.4 billion into the state economy in 2023 (6).",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — There are few signs that President Donald Trump’s supporters wanted the United States to become more embroiled in foreign conflicts ahead of its military actions in Venezuela — even as many Republicans show initial support for his military strike there, according to an Associated Press analysis of recent polling.\n\nMost Americans wanted the U.S. government to focus in 2026 on domestic issues, such as health care and high costs, rather than foreign policy issues, an AP-NORC poll conducted last month found. Meanwhile, polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. may take a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere, Republicans in polling last fall remained broadly opposed to the U.S. getting more involved in other countries’ problems.\n\nThere’s still room for public opinion to shift as Trump's administration clarifies its next steps for Venezuela. But it could be a challenging issue for the Republican president, particularly given Americans’ desire for the government to fix economic issues at home.\n\nForeign policy and drug trade weren’t high priorities for many Americans\n\nHeading into the new year, Americans were less likely to want the government to focus on foreign policy than they had been in recent years.\n\nAbout one-quarter of U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics — such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel or general involvement overseas — as something they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026, according to an open-ended AP-NORC question that asked respondents to share up to five issues they wanted the government to work on in the coming year. That was down from the prior two years, when roughly one-third of Americans considered foreign issues an important focus. Almost no one specifically named Venezuela.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges on Monday in New York. His capture followed U.S. strikes on boats that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on the issue of drug trafficking, it doesn’t register at the top of Americans' lists of issues for the government to focus on. Few Americans mentioned drug-related issues as a priority, and it was primarily a Republican issue. About 1 in 10 Republicans mentioned it, compared with hardly any Democrats or independents.\n\nInstead, Americans overall were more focused on domestic issues — including health care, economic worries and cost-of-living concerns — as top priorities for the government.\n\nMore Americans say the US should not run Venezuela\n\nAmericans are split about the U.S. capturing Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure. Republicans broadly approved of the action, while Democrats were largely opposed to it.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said that the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.\n\nIn December, a Quinnipiac poll found that about 6 in 10 registered voters opposed U.S. military action in Venezuela. Republicans were more divided: About half were in support, while about one-third were opposed and 15% didn’t have an opinion.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the US more involved in the world’s problems\n\nOnly about 1 in 10 Republicans wanted the U.S. to take a “more active role” role in solving the world’s problems, according to an AP-NORC poll from September. They were much less likely than Americans overall, or Democrats and independents, to say the U.S. should become more involved. Most Republicans, 55%, said the current U.S. role in global issues was “about right.”\n\nIt could be a tricky position for a president who ran on a promise of putting “America first” and ending the country’s involvement in “forever wars.” About 7 in 10 voters who backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election said that they wanted the U.S. to take a “less active” role in solving the world’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states.\n\nBut at least in that poll, which was conducted before the military operation that removed Maduro, Trump's supporters still were largely behind him: About 1 in 10 Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 felt he had deserted the “America First” promise, while the overwhelming majority felt he had kept it.",

The president has said that a GOP ticket of Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in 2028 could be formidable.\n\nVance has also widely led in polls on the 2028 race.\n\nBut polls issued last year showed Vance’s lead shrinking and a surprise candidate coming on strong: Trump Jr.\n\nA McLaughlin & Associates poll in August had Vance at 36% support, with Trump Jr. far behind at 16%.\n\nBut that gap narrowed in a survey in October, with Vance at 38% and Trump Jr. at 20%.\n\nThen in November, a survey showed Vance slipping to 34% and Trump Jr. surging to 24.\n\nWhen asked in May if he would seek the White House, Trump Jr. said, “I don’t know. Maybe one day, you know, that calling is there.”\n\nTrump Jr.’s surge in the McLaughlin poll has led to speculation that were he to win the presidency, he would resign in favor of his father, who would then take the reins for a third term in the White House.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits anyone from being elected to more than two terms as president. President Trump is currently in his second term in the White House.\n\nAnd the 12th Amendment would prohibit President Trump from running as vice president on a ticket with his son.",

    "title": "FEC Obstructed from Enforcing Campaign Finance Laws for Last 250 Days",
    "description": "The Federal Election Commission needs its ability to function restored, without sacrificing its independence.",
    "fullText": "Since Thursday, the bipartisan Federal Election Commission hasn’t been able do its job. That’s because the independent agency, which oversees money in campaigns for federal office, no longer has the minimum four required members to do most business.\n\nThe loss of quorum is due to the resignation of a Republican appointee, coupled with President Trump’s unprecedented move in February to fire a Democratic appointee. Such a shortfall has only happened three other times in the FEC’s 50-year history, including twice during Trump’s first term.\n\nOrdinarily, the big question would be how fast the president and Congress will move to restore a full complement of commissioners so the agency can function. That is still important. But in light of the firing and the president’s other steps to exert control over the FEC and other independent agencies, there is now a much bigger issue: Will the FEC be able to continue as an independent watchdog at all? Because even worse than a dormant FEC is one that could be weaponized against the president’s opponents.\n\nThe FEC was created as part of the post-Watergate reforms that established our current system of campaign contribution limits and disclosure requirements. It is led by six commissioners, no more than three of whom can be from one party. When fewer than four seats are filled, the commission cannot carry out most of its important functions, including enforcing the law and issuing regulations and other legal guidance.\n\nThanks in part to its evenly divided leadership, the FEC is nobody’s idea of an aggressive watchdog, often deadlocking on partisan lines in important matters. That gridlock has exacerbated the effects of Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United, for instance, by making it easier for candidates to outsource key campaign operations to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money.\n\nBut even a dysfunctional FEC is still important. Among other things, the agency plays a vital role in collecting and disseminating campaign finance data, which is critical at a time when Trump and his Democratic opponents continue raising money at a rapid clip ahead of the 2026 midterms (and when a number of the president’s biggest donors have a hand in shaping policy in his administration).\n\nLoss of the FEC’s quorum won’t keep data from being collected and published, but the commission won’t be able to do anything to enforce reporting requirements against those who ignore them. It also can’t address novel legal issues that arise — for instance, in connection to online campaign activity, where significant reporting gaps remain.\n\nBut the loss of the FEC’s quorum may not even be the agency’s biggest challenge. In February, the president fired a sitting Democratic appointee, Ellen Weintraub (full disclosure: I worked for Weintraub from 2011 to 2014). This firing is the reason the FEC was down to only four commissioners before the latest resignation.\n\nTo be sure, Weintraub’s term at the commission had long expired and she was eligible to be replaced. But no president has ever removed an FEC commissioner from the opposing party without naming a replacement, usually selected by the opposition party’s congressional leaders. Her removal was part of a series of firings of Democratic commissioners at independent agencies who are supposed to be legally insulated from presidential removal — representing a major power grab by the White House.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the White House issued an executive order purporting to formally place all independent executive branch agencies under direct presidential control. The president subsequently issued an order that, among other things, directs the Election Assistance Commission — another federal agency that was modeled in key respects on the FEC — to illegally revise federal voter registration procedures. A federal court has blocked relevant parts of the order in a Brennan Center lawsuit challenging the move while the case proceeds.\n\nThe president’s assault on the independence of agencies like the Elections Assistance Commission and FEC flies in the face of Article I of the Constitution, which vests oversight over federal elections in the states and Congress. Congress in turn delegated oversight over federal campaign finance rules to the independent FEC with the goal — as we recently noted in a publicly filed comment to the agency — of ensuring that election-related complaints and questions would be handled free from partisan manipulation.\n\nThe record-breaking 2024 election showed the dire need for effective and scrupulously even-handed campaign finance regulation. At a bare minimum, the president and Congress should follow the practices of every president since the 1970s for filling opposing party seats on the commission. Nominees from both parties should also be asked whether they will explicitly commit to defending the FEC’s independence.\n\nUltimately, as frustrating as some of the FEC’s current failings are, the solution can never be to allow the agency to be weaponized for partisan ends. There has long been broad, bipartisan agreement on this point — and it’s more important than ever to reaffirm this commitment to fairness.",

    "description": "Trump said the US would run Venezuela until a \"safe, proper\" election could occur, and that US oil companies would be entering Venezuela's industry.",
    "fullText": "The US executed targeted, large-scale attacks in Venezuela's capital city, Caracas, overnight.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday American forces struck the country's military, turned off the lights in the city, and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for prosecution in New York.\n\nThe assault news has raised big questions. Here's what we know right now.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Trump revealed on Truth Social that the US military carried out a \"large-scale attack against Venezuela\" and that the leader had been captured and taken out of the country.\n\nThe US president didn't seek Congressional approval prior to the mission. Congress, however, was notified afterward.\n\nTrump told Fox News he watched the capture of Maduro play out in real time from a room inside his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida alongside military generals.\n\n\"I was told by real military people that there's no other country on Earth that can do such a maneuver,\" he shared during a phone interview with Fox News. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally, like I was watching a television show.\"\n\nTrump said the raid was \"extremely complex,\" more so than the Midnight Hammer operation against Iran's nuclear sites conducted last year. Maduro and his wife were taken to the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima.\n\nTrump said US assets involved included land, air, and sea, including a \"massive number\" of aircraft and troops. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, was based on months of intelligence-gathering, including watching Maduro's patterns of life, and involved all elements of the joint force, from space and cyber assets to traditional combat forces.\n\nThe assault involved 150 aircraft — fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, and helicopters and rotary aircraft — that provided \"layered effects\" to clear the way for the interdiction force to slip in with the \"element of surprise\" into downtown Caracas. Fighters and different drones covered the extraction.\n\nThere were no US personnel or equipment losses, Trump said; however, he did say that troops were hit, along with a helicopter that he said was hit \"pretty hard.\" Caine said the US responded to hostile fire with \"overwhelming\" force.\n\nTensions have been rising for months between Venezuela's Maduro regime and the Trump administration, which has ramped up its rhetoric while increasing military action nearby.\n\nThe US has blamed Venezuela for pushing deadly drugs into the country, as well as using its oil industry, which the Trump administration says the US built and intends to take back, to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nThe administration has labeled cartels and the Maduro regime terrorist organizations. Trump has also called Maduro an illegitimate leader.\n\nThe US has been launching attacks against alleged drug trafficking boats since September 2025, with over 100 people killed and others missing or captured.\n\nA massive US force presence, including warships and combat aircraft, has been in the Caribbean to combat narcotics trafficking and pressure Venezuela for months.\n\nMore recently, US forces began executing a blockade of oil tankers out of Venezuela in an effort to enforce American oil sanctions, hurting a key Venezuelan export and straining its economy.\n\nMaduro's government said that the purpose of the US attack on Venezuela was to \"seize Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals, in an attempt to forcibly break the nation's political independence.\"\n\nThe US has removed the leaders of sovereign states in the past. For instance, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Operation Iraqi Freedom, it captured Saddam Hussein after the Bush administration asserted the Iraqi president had weapons of mass destruction. Hussein was later convicted for crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court and executed in December 2006.\n\nA lack of evidence that Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction led to criticisms against the Bush administration's motives.\n\nMuch earlier, Panamanian military dictator Manual Noriega was also a target of American military forces during the US invasion of Panama from December 1989 to January 1990, partially prompted by his attempt to annul the results of the 1989 Panamanian general election. US courts had charged Noriega with drug smuggling and money laundering, and the Panamanian official was captured in January 1990 and taken to Miami, where he was convicted on most of the charges.\n\nBoth Noriega and Maduro were heads of state indicted by US federal courts, they were accused of using state power to facilitate drug trafficking, and the US could argue in both cases those actions taken against them were law enforcement.\n\nThe US has also conducted military action to kill prominent foreign figures. Exactly six years ago, US military personnel successfully assassinated Qasem Soleimani, a senior Iranian military officer, in a drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nThe US designated Soleimani a terrorist in 2005. In response to Soleimani's assassination in January 2020, Iran launched missiles against US military bases in Iraq, injuring 110 US troops.\n\nMaduro and his wife are on their way to New York. Pamela Bondi, US attorney general, said that Maduro had been charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices, as well as conspiracy against the US.\n\n\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said on X.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump posted a picture of Maduro in custody on Truth Social. The photo showed Maduro aboard USS Iwo Jima.\n\nThe president also added that US oil companies would be returning to Venezuela.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s bold claims that his policies delivered an unprecedented jobs boom for American-born workers are at odds with data showing a weaker market than under his predecessor.\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly boasted that all new job gains have gone to U.S.-born workers since he returned to office. “In the year before my election, all net creation of jobs was going to foreign migrants. Since I took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American-born citizens,” Trump said during an address to the nation last month. “One hundred percent.”\n\nAdministration officials have parroted that rhetoric, saying on X in November that what Trump “is doing for our workforce is nothing short of HISTORIC.”\n\n“While other Presidents allowed foreign workers to flood the job market, President Trump is working to ensure ALL jobs created go to our workers,” the U.S. Department of Labor’s X account posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s right-hand man, Vice President JD Vance, has been aggressively backing his government’s handling of the economy.\n\nJust last month, against the backdrop of pessimistic unemployment data, Vance graded Trump’s economic performance “A plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nHe has also praised the administration for “bringing jobs back to America.”\n\n“We had a policy in this country for 40 years of shipping American jobs overseas... There is going to be a massive exception to that 40-year trajectory of American decline, and that’s the second Trump admin,” he said in discussion with Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle in Washington, D.C.\n\nEconomists, however, are calling Trump’s bluff. Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Washington Post reported Friday that the labor market itself has weakened, leaving U.S.-born workers modestly worse off than they had been under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\n“The unemployment rate has been rising for both native-born and foreign-born adults,” Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Commerce Department economist, told the Post.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among native-born workers was higher in late 2025 than a year earlier. The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers rose from 3.9 percent in November 2024 to 4.3 percent in November 2025.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Trump’s claims that his immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers are “false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey.”\n\n“If anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years,” senior economist Ben Zipperer wrote in September.\n\nIn August, Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and undersecretary for economic affairs at the US Department of Commerce under Biden, accused the president of committing a “multiple-count data felony” in trumpeting a jobs boom for native-born Americans.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Post that “mindless nitpicking doesn’t change the simple fact that President Trump has done more for American workers than any president in history by cracking down on visa program abuses, successfully negotiating new trade deals, securing our border, and carrying out the largest mass deportation of illegal aliens.”\n\nRogers said those policies ensure “American-born workers can finally benefit from our new economic resurgence.”",

    "fullText": "We asked: Would you prefer a $240,000 in-office job or a $120,000 remote one?\n\nThe Business Insider readers who responded were split down the middle, with the lower-paying virtual job narrowly winning out by just one vote.\n\n365 readers answered Business Insider's informal survey following the debate's TikTok virality. 183 answered that they would choose the $120,000 remote gig, while 182 chose to go five days in-person for double the salary.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight respondents — four on each side — explained to Business Insider why they made their choices.\n\nWhile the reader survey isn't scientific, the results, and the reasons people gave us for why they voted the way they did, offer insight into how workers today view the tradeoffs.\n\nIn 2018, Arlton Lowry packed a bag and traveled from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Bali.\n\nThe 44-year-old owner of a digital product design agency spent seven weeks working remotely, waking up at 1 a.m. and scootering through paddy fields to a coworking space where he clocked in on Central Time.\n\nLowry voted for the remote option. That trip wouldn't be possible if his company wasn't remote-first, he said, and the flexibility is a benefit for his employees as well.\n\n\"If it wasn't for remote-based work, we probably wouldn't be able to attract and retain the talent that we have,\" he said.\n\nRespondents who chose the lower-salary remote option prized flexibility and the absence of a rigid corporate culture. It's about more than doing your laundry or squeezing in a workout, they said; it's about freedom.\n\nBetty Chen said she was tired of dealing with other people's egos. After corporate jobs at Autodesk and Cisco, Chen decided to go freelance before the pandemic. Now, the 49-year-old San Francisco resident does contract UX design and boards dogs in her home.\n\n\"I'm so much happier,\" Chen said. \"I did better working with animals, not doomscrolling. Touch grass.\"\n\nChen also enjoys not having to put on makeup. \"As a woman going into the office, there's another half hour of maintenance,\" she said.\n\nThose who chose the in-person option say that flexibility comes at the cost of organizational performance. American Edge Project CEO Doug Kelly said that there was a \"chemistry\" to bringing people together.\n\n\"I would rather pay people more to be on-site working with me,\" the 60-year-old Columbus, Ohio resident said. \"It increases the product that the company is making and the creativity overall.\"\n\nDominic Sharlette agreed: \"You have to be in the office to get great products made.\"\n\nSharlette is a 59-year-old health tech worker based in New York. He works five days in-person, and said he is happy that way. Jobs like customer service could be done remotely, he said, but work that's \"pushing innovation\" must be done face-to-face.\n\nThen there's the salary question. The prompt offered double the pay — $240,000 compared to $120,000 — for in-person attendance. For some, the money was enough.\n\nJennifer Rasmussen, a 44-year-old logistics worker from Fargo, North Dakota, likes her fully remote job. As she called me, her golden retrievers lay next to her. But the perks of $240,000 were too strong not to influence her vote.\n\n\"The quality of life for my entire family would improve with a salary at that level,\" she said.\n\nRasmussen's kids are still young. The money would help her family travel internationally or hire childcare and cleaning help. She could also save more money for retirement, she said.\n\nAmy Leonard, a 42-year-old community college teacher from San Jose, California, said she would choose the virtual job so she could move elsewhere. The Bay Area has a notoriously high cost of living. Leonard said that most of her money now went to basic expenses, such as gas and food.\n\n\"I could definitely take that, move somewhere else, and probably own a house instead of having to rent,\" Leonard said.\n\nIn her debate-sparking TikTok, influencer Tinx said that she could immediately guess the generation of the individual consider the half-salary remote option: Gen Z.\n\nIn the video, Tinx said that time in the office could do Gen Z some good. \"It'll make you all less weird,\" she said.\n\nPriya Chaudhari, a 20-year-old student at the University of Georgia, said that much of her generation actually preferred to be in-person. The in-office push was a \"rebound\" from an adolescence on screens, she said. Chaudhari and some of her friends have chosen to get off social media.\n\nChaudhari said she would opt for the $240,000 salary, citing the pay difference and her own extroversion. \"I really thrive off working with other people,\" she said.\n\nPedro Ochoa posed the question to his four-person team. The 45-year-old manager of business intelligence said the team was split generationally, with the younger colleagues opting for higher pay and the older colleagues choosing the remote work role.\n\nYounger workers see \"very hard outcomes for their careers,\" the Dallas resident said, so they want to claim as much income and experience as they can while they're still employed. Older workers care more about raising their families, he said.\n\nOchoa put himself in the latter camp. He'd take the remote option.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.
