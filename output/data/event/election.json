    "fullText": "President Donald Trump raged in a dead-of-night social media post at Republicans who defied him on a plan that would have given the GOP more seats in Congress.\n\nThe Indiana State Senate voted down a redistricting plan Trump pushed hard to give Republicans two more congressional seats, defeating it by a 31-19 margin — including a majority of Republicans.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about the vote just after it happened, he downplayed his role in supporting the plan:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I wasn’t working on it very hard. Would have been nice, I think we would have picked up two seats, if we did that. You had one gentleman, the head of the Senate, I guess, Bray, whatever his name is, I heard he was against it. He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is. I hope he does, because he’s done a tremendous disservice.\n\nBut the issue kept Trump awake into the early hours Saturday morning. It was almost one o’clock in the morning when Trump posted a threatening rant to his Truth Social account:\n\nRepublicans in the Indiana State Senate, who voted against a Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be ashamed of themselves. Headed by a total loser named Rod Bray, every one of these people should be “primaried,” and I will be there to help! Indiana, which I won big, is the only state in the Union to do this!\n\nThe rant came hours after Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) tried to downplay the significance of the vote and its effect on Trump’s stature.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju asked Johnson, on Friday, “Are you worried about Trump’s grip on power after Indiana? Do you think it shows he’s a lame duck?”\n\n“Not at all! No, he is not a lame duck!” Johnson said. “He’s the most powerful president of this generation and many others. We have a lot more work to do together. The outcome in Indiana is inconsequential to that.”\n\nThe post Trump Rages In Dead Of Night At Republicans Who Defied Him On Election Map — After Claiming He Hadn’t ‘Worked Very Hard’ On It first appeared on Mediaite.",

Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.\n\nxAI’s Grok is more known for referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria’s government resigned on Thursday after mass protests gripped the country and just weeks before the European Union nation is due to join the eurozone.\n\nThe resignation of the minority coalition, led by the center-right GERB party, was announced minutes before parliament was scheduled to vote on a no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition over economic mismanagement and supported by growing public anger with widespread corruption.\n\n“Ahead of today’s vote of no confidence, the government is resigning,” Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov told reporters in parliament.\n\nThe demonstrations on Wednesday came after last week’s protests that were sparked by the government’s budget plans for higher taxes, increased social security contributions and spending increases. The government later withdrew the contentious 2026 budget plan.\n\nThe protesters’ demands had expanded to include calls for the center-right government to step down.\n\n“The decisions of the National Assembly are meaningful when they reflect the will of the people,\" Zhelyazkov said, referring to the anti-government protests. “We want to be where society expects us to be.”\n\nStudents from Sofia’s universities had joined the protests, which organizers said outnumbered last week’s rallies that drew more than 50,000 people. Media estimates based on drone visuals put the number of protesters at over 100,000.\n\nAt the core of the protesters’ frustrations is the role of Bulgarian politician and oligarch Delyan Peevski, who has been sanctioned by both the United States and the United Kingdom, and whose MRF New Beginning party backs the government. Peevski has been accused by opponents of helping shaping government policy in line with oligarchic interests.\n\n“We have no doubt that the government will receive support in the upcoming vote of no confidence. Regardless, the decisions of the National Assembly are important when they reflect the will of the sovereign,” the prime minister said.\n\nZhelyazkov’s government survived six votes of no confidence since it was appointed in January, but this time the large turnout of protesters on the streets was a game changer.\n\nThe resignation will be formally submitted to parliament on Friday, which must adopt a resolution to accept it. After this formal procedure, President Rumen Radev will give the biggest group in parliament the chance to form a new government. If it fails, the second-largest grouping will get a chance before the president choses a candidate.\n\nIf all attempts fail — which is likely — he will appoint a caretaker Cabinet until a new election is held. Political analysts expect that another vote — the eighth since 2021 — will likely produce a similar deeply fragmented parliament facing an uphill task to form a stable government.\n\nAssen Vassilev, the leader of the opposition We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria coalition, called the government’s resignation “the first step in making Bulgaria a normal European state.”\n\n“The next step along this path is to conduct fair and free elections rather than elections compromised by vote manipulation as in the previous campaign,” he added.\n\nThe Balkan country of 6.4 million people is due to make the switch from its national currency, the lev, to the euro on Jan. 1, to become the eurozone's 21st member. Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",
