    "description": "TikTokers have been debating two jobs: $120,000 for virtual work, or $240,000 for five days in-person. It's time to cast your vote.",
    "fullText": "A debate over remote versus in-person work has been shaking up the internet in recent weeks — and we want you to weigh in.\n\nIt started when the influencer Tinx lit up TikTok with a job-related question she'd received: Which is better, a $240,000 in-office job or a $120,000 virtual one?\n\nCommenters chimed in to take their sides. Some said that virtual work protects their mental health, while others said that the doubled salary was an easy choice. In a variety of spin-off TikToks, commentators made their case for one vs. the other.\n\nIt's the latest round of the return-to-office debate that has raged since the COVID-19 pandemic. While companies place return-to-office mandates, some employees have realized that they prefer to skip the commute — even if it means a pay cut. Others need virtual work for at-home responsibilities, such as childcare.\n\nWe're asking readers which they'd prefer. As of Friday at 10 a.m. in New York, the $120K remote job had a narrow lead, but we'll keep the poll open until next week — so stay tuned for the final result!",

    "description": "A state polls showed that 55% of Russians believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine will end next year.",
    "fullText": "The majority of Russians expect the war with Ukraine to end in 2026, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe survey of 1,600 Russians aged 18 and above found that 55% believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" is nearing its end. The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 Oregon high school football season has ended and Salem-Keizer area teams and athletes across all division are collecting accolades.\n\nThere were state champions, conference champions and memorable moments throughout the entire season. Countless athletes stood out on the gridiron as they represented their schools in quests for glory.\n\nHere are the nominees for the Statesman Journal’s football player of the year.\n\nHere’s information on the nominees. Vote for who you think deserves to win at statesmanjournal.com/sports. The poll closes at noon Friday, Jan. 2.\n\nSouth Salem’s junior quarterback led the state in 6A passing yards — his 3,214 yards were more than 400 yards ahead of the second-highest passer. The Saxons went 0-9, but Bowman set single-game state records in passing yards (692) and completions (48), both against Grants Pass.\n\nBowman was named to the all-state honorable mention list.\n\nCampos was West Salem’s workhorse running back this fall as the Titans fought to a 6-4 record and playoff appearance. Campos, a senior, finished the season with some of the best 6A individual tallies in the state. He was fifth in rushing yards (1,397) and seventh in rushing touchdowns (17) on 210 carries.\n\nCampos earned a bid to the all-state second-team offense.\n\nHawkins was a two-way playmaker for the Cougars as they completed an undefeated state championship season. Hawkins, a junior, played an integral role on both sides of the ball from wide receiver and defensive back. In the state championship game, Hawkins had 77 yards receiving and a touchdown.\n\nHawkins was awarded first-team all-state honors on offense (wide receiver) and defense (defensive back), the only Salem-area player across 6A/5A/4A to earn first-team bids on both sides of the ball. He also earned all-state second-team offense as a kick returner.\n\nHockett led the Buckaroos to a 2A state semifinal appearance, Special District 2 conference championship and an 8-3 overall record. Hockett was named the Statesman Journal Athlete of the Week Nov. 13 for a 213-yard, three-touchdown performance in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nAs a lead-blocking, versatile offensive weapon and lockdown, physical defender, Hinkle helped lead Cascade to a perfect season that ended in a 4A state championship. Hinkle, a senior, was integral on both sides of the ball for the Cougars.\n\nHinkle was awarded 4A defensive player of the year along with all-state first-team defense second-team all-state offense.\n\nKuenzi was the lead back for a Cascade team that marched through a perfect 13-0 season all the way to a 4A state title. Kuenzi, a senior, scored a whopping 34 touchdowns for the Cougars this fall and closed his senior season as one of the most dominant high school running backs in recent Oregon memory.\n\nKuenzi claimed 4A offensive player of the year and first-team all-state honors.\n\nKuenzi was a two-way lineman for the state title-winning Foxes this fall. The senior provided leadership and stability to a young, talented line that delivered all the protection, pressure and coverage necessary throughout Silverton’s march to the 5A championship.\n\nKuenzi was named to the all-state first team as a defensive lineman.\n\nMabry led the way as a senior on the offensive line for the Dragons this season. He excelled in all facets of the game from the position as he helped lead Dallas to a 7-4 season that ended in the 5A state quarterfinals.\n\nMabry was named 5A Special District 3’s offensive lineman of the year, and he earned a spot on the all-state first team roster.\n\nDayton’s senior running back led the charge throughout the Pirates' season that resulted in a 3A Special District 2 championship and a 9-1 overall record. Macias racked up 15 touchdowns and 1,149 yards (114.9 yards per game) this season.\n\nMakarenko was a key part of Sprague’s offensive line that acted as a strongpoint for the Olympians throughout the season. A senior center, he helped push Sprague to a 5-5 season that resulted in a 6A state playoff appearance.\n\nMakarenko was awarded a bid on the all-state honorable mention.\n\nMariano was the lead running back for the Cougars this fall. A senior, he led the Cougars to an 8-4 season that ended in the program’s first-ever 3A state semifinals. He scored 12 touchdowns in the Cougars’ first two playoff games and closes his Gervais career as one of the top football players in the school’s history.\n\nMay was a rock of a lineman for Cascade as the Cougars plowed through a 13-0 season and 4A state championship. A senior, May consistently provided leadership, experience and talent and stood out as one of the top offensive linemen in the Salem area across all levels.\n\nMay earned a spot on the all-state first-team offense.\n\nPhillips was the Vikings’ star running back this season who was untouchable in the backfield and uncatchable in the open field. A senior, he finished the season with 1,459 rushing yards and 21 rushing touchdowns, both being the fourth-highest 6A tallies in the state.\n\nPhillips earned all-state second-team offensive honors.\n\nRivers was a force to be reckoned with on the Dallas defense this season. At the 5A level, the Dragons' senior led the state of Oregon in sacks (11), was fifth in total tackles (99) and tied for third in forced fumbles (3). Rivers was an integral part of a dominant defense that gave up less than 14 points in eight different games this fall.\n\nRivers claimed a spot on the all-state defensive first team.\n\nSingleton was a two-way sensation for the Vikings from the wide receiver and defensive back positions this fall. The North Salem senior delivered 986 yards of total offense and nine touchdowns, while also grabbing two interceptions and 58 tackles.\n\nSingleton earned a spot on all-state second-team defense and offensive all-state honorable mention as a wide receiver and kick returner. He's one of two area players from 6A/5A/4A with three different bids to the all-state rosters.\n\nSilverton's junior Swiss army-knife of a player contributed to both sides of the ball in the Foxes' march to a 5A state championship. Teeney, a junior, fielded as a receiver, defensive back and even running back at times — contributing invaluable reps with the Foxes.\n\nTeeney booked a spot on the all-state defensive first-team lineup.\n\nUitto was a key part of Silverton’s 5A state championship march from the wide receiver and defensive back positions. Uitto, a senior, garnered 798 receiving yards and 13 receiving touchdowns this season, tallies good for fourth and second at the 5A level, respectively.\n\nUitto stamped his name on the all-state offensive first-team roster and earned a bid to the all-state honorable mention defense.\n\nWusstig was a two-way receiver/defensive back for West Salem that excelled in both. Wusstig, a senior, helped the Titans to a 6-4 record and playoff appearance and was consistently one of the most impactful players on any football field he stepped on.\n\nWusstig was named to the defensive all-state second team.\n\nLandon Bartlett covers high school sports and Oregon State for the Statesman Journal.

    "fullText": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.\n\nThe meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes the state's top lawmakers, is expected to be attended by Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and other team officials. If the proposal is passed, the Chiefs could move swiftly in announcing plans to depart their 53-year-old home at the Truman Sports Complex for a stadium that could cost upwards of $2 billion.\n\nThe state's proposal would allow for STAR bonds to be issued to cover up to 70% of the overall cost of the project. They would be paid off with state sales and liquor tax revenues generated in a defined area around around the sports complex.\n\nThe same bonding process was used to build Kansas Speedway and the surrounding shopping and entertainment district, known as The Legends, in Kansas City, Kansas — the area where a future stadium for the Chiefs is most likely to be built.\n\nThe area is also home to Children's Mercy Park, where Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer plays its home matches.\n\n“The state of Kansas is in active discussions with the Kansas City Chiefs about the prospects of building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas,” the Kansas Department of Commerce said last week. “No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come. We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”\n\nThe move by the Chiefs would be a massive blow to Missouri lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe, who have been working on a package of their own to prevent a second NFL franchise in a decade from leaving their borders. The Rams departed St. Louis for Los Angeles a decade ago in part because of their inability to secure funding to help replace The Dome at America’s Center.\n\nKehoe backed a special legislative session in June to authorize bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.\n\nThe special session came in response to Kansas lawmakers approving their bond package.\n\nThe Chiefs originally planned an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium in a joint effort with the Kansas City Royals, who are similarly planning to build a new facility to replace Kauffman Stadium — which sits a couple of hundred yards across a parking lot from Arrowhead Stadium — when the two teams' leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire in January 2031.\n\nBut after county voters soundly defeated a local sales tax extension last year, the Royals and Chiefs began work on separate plans.\n\nThe Royals will not be discussed by Kansas lawmakers Monday, but momentum appears to be building behind their own move across the state line. An affiliate of the club already has purchased the mortgage on a tract of land in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nQuinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, has been working to keep both franchises on the Missouri side of the state line. He said in a statement over the weekend that negotiations had continued with the Chiefs throughout last week.\n\n“We’ll reserve further comment until we hear from the Kansas City Chiefs,” Lucas said.\n\nHunt has long said his preference was to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, which was beloved by his father and team founder, the late Lamar Hunt. It is considered one of the jewels of the NFL, alongside Lambeau Field in Green Bay, and is revered for its tailgating scene and home-field advantage; it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium roar.\n\nThis summer, Arrowhead Stadium will host six World Cup matches, including matches in the Round of 32 and quarterfinals.\n\nThe Hunt family has warmed in recent years to the idea of leaving their own mark by building its replacement, though. Not only would a new, state-of-the-art stadium provide new revenue streams, through luxury seating and accompanying development, but a fixed or retractable roof would allow it to be used year-round. That would mean the potential to host concerts and events, college football bowl games, the Final Four and one of Lamar Hunt's long-held dreams: a Super Bowl.\n\nHanna reported from Topeka.

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn't rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.\n\nTrump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump's attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.\n\n“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.\n\nThe lawmakers' lawyers argue Trump can't prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",

    "description": "A Kennedy Center Board member accused the White House of lying about the vote to change the center's name to the Trump Kennedy Center.",
    "fullText": "A Kennedy Center board member accused the White House of lying about the organization’s “unanimous” vote to change the center’s name to the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” claiming that her dissent was censored.\n\nOn Thursday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the Trump-controlled board “voted unanimously” for the name change. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who sits on the center’s board, posted a video to X after the announcement making it clear that she was on the call when the decision was made and was muted so she could not voice her dissenting opinion.\n\n“What you may hear is that there was a unanimous vote to rename the Kennedy Center the Trump Center,” Beatty said. “Be clear, I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak I was muted. Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.”\n\nFor the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this  move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship. https://t.co/D1zGV7xiWV pic.twitter.com/npNvSIy6sV\n\n— Rep. Joyce Beatty (@RepBeatty) December 18, 2025\n\nShe continued: “Clearly, the Congress has a say in this. This center – the Kennedy Center – was created by the Congress. I think it is important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law, and not let the people have a say.”\n\nThe president named himself a chairman of the Kennedy Center earlier this year after taking office. He hinted at the name change in October in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe proposal to change the name of the center to the Trump-Kennedy Center was also lambasted online by members of President John F. Kennedy’s family on Thursdasy.\n\n“Perhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is the memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy,” Tim Shriver, JFK’s nephew, wrote on X. “Would they rename the Lincoln Memorial? The Jefferson? That would be an insult to great presidents. This too is an insult to a great president.”\n\nPerhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is 𝗧𝗛𝗘 memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy.

Kennedy,” Shriver, JFK’s niece, wrote. “It was named in his honor. He was a man who was interested in the arts, interested in culture, interested in education, language, history. He brought the arts into the White House, and he and my Aunt Jackie amplified the arts, celebrated the arts, stood up for the arts and artists.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center was named after my uncle, President John F Kennedy.

It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable. It is not.”\n\nJoe Kennedy III added that altering the Kennedy Center could “no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\nIn July, House Republican’s introduced a bill that aimed to strip former President Kennedy’s name from the center, turning it into the Trump Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe center’s name change was part of legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Onder (R-Missouri) called the Make Entertainment Great Again (MEGA) Act. Onder noted in his bill proposal that Trump was intended “to preserve the integrity of the fine arts by ending woke programming and rebalancing the Kennedy Center’s $234 million budget” since being elected chairman.\n\nThe post Kennedy Center Board Member Says Opposition to Trump Renaming Was Censored as JFK Family Condemns Move: ‘An Insult’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Mike Johnson had a ready-made refrain when asked why Republicans weren't moving to extend federal health care subsidies: their party wanted to help 100% of Americans with their costs, not just the 7% of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nBut not 100% of his conference agreed.\n\nA rare revolt from the moderate wing of the party has upended Johnson's plans. Four Republicans this week signed onto a Democratic discharge petition that guarantees that the House will vote on extending the ACA subsidies sometime in January, with Republican leaders now powerless to stop it.\n\nFor Democrats, it was vindication of a months-long strategy, starting with the government shutdown in the fall, that pushed the expiration of the ACA support to the forefront of politics. Republicans from competitive districts most at risk of losing their seats in next year's midterms felt the political pressure as they heard from constituents about their skyrocketing premiums.\n\n“Nothing has changed with House Republican leadership, but something has changed within their own ranks,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nFlanked by his caucus Thursday on the Capitol steps, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries demanded that Johnson allow a vote on the three-year extension of ACA subsidies before lawmakers leave for the holidays: “Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next year. Today.”\n\nJohnson refused, saying it will “be on the floor that first week of January when we return.”\n\nLawmakers prepare to leave in limbo\n\nThe impasse left lawmakers with a cliffhanger as they headed home for the holiday break. Republican leaders now face growing pressure to appease centrist members who are threatening to side with Democrats to approve an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has to confront the issue as well. Any ACA bill clearing the House would simply push the fight to the Senate, which has already rejected a three-year extension.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has been meeting and discussing possible compromise bills that would extend the subsidies but put new limitations on them. But they would not consider anything until January.\n\nThune told reporters Thursday that a three-year extension of “a failed program that’s rife with fraud, waste and abuse is not happening.”\n\nYet Republican leaders in both chambers have not offered a plan that fully addresses members’ concerns about the sharp insurance cost increases many Americans are expected to face in 2026 and potentially beyond.\n\nThe White House has been engaged in discussions about the healthcare proposals but has largely allowed House Republicans to sort out their internal divisions and coalesce around a plan on their own, according to a senior administration official involved in the talks who was granted anonymity to discuss private discussions.\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday passed a 100-plus-page health care package centered on long-standing GOP priorities, including expanding coverage options for small businesses and the self-employed. The bill would also rein in pharmacy benefit managers — middlemen that manage drug costs and process insurance claims.\n\nJohnson touted the measure as “a bigger and better and more important thing for 100% of Americans, not just 7% of Americans.” But some Republicans who face tough reelection bids remain fixated on the looming spike in ACA costs.\n\nThe holidays provide Johnson with a brief window to try to persuade moderates to abandon the effort. The discharge petition froze once it reached the 218-signature threshold, meaning that while only four Republicans have publicly signed on, more may be willing to support the Democratic bill.\n\nRep. Ryan Mackenzie, one of the four Republicans who signed the Democratic petition, said it has “generated more conversations” and that “hopefully over the next three weeks, we will actually see some changes in some bipartisan efforts that actually can generate a meaningful vote that gets 218 in the House and 60 in the Senate.”\n\n“I think allowing a vote is critically important,” Mackenzie said. “I think everybody should be able to put up their votes on the board, and they should be able to let everybody in the American public see how they voted on these individual issues.”\n\nLeader Jeffries' waiting game pays off\n\nFor months, Jeffries refused to support a one-year extension of ACA subsidies that a bipartisan group of lawmakers had been pursuing, dismissing it as a “non-starter” and “a laughable proposition.”\n\nInstead, he held firm on a three-year extension with no income caps or cost offsets. That strategy paid off, as GOP moderates were forced to move in his direction when Johnson refused to allow any vote on an ACA extension.\n\nJeffries has faced criticism this year from progressive members of his caucus and grassroots groups who have urged him to push back more forcefully against Trump and Republicans. But on Thursday, much of the party rallied behind him on the Capitol steps, with several lawmakers praising his approach.\n\n“As Leader Jeffries has said all along, this is the only real plan on the table,” said Aguilar.\n\nStill, while Democrats have secured a vote, insurance costs for millions are set to rise next year, and passage of a three-year ACA subsidies extension remains a long shot even if it does pass the House. Senate Republicans have already rejected the three-year extension, but some GOP senators who are open to a deal on the subsidies said a House vote could provide momentum.\n\n“We could have a vehicle — if we could get Republicans and Democrats behind it — then we could send it back,” said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, adding that it “means that there’s still a chance.”\n\nFor Democrats, the fight has also allowed them to unify around a message they believe could prove potent on the campaign trail.\n\n“The Republican health care crisis is unacceptable, unconscionable, and un-American,” Jeffries said.\n\nThe decision by four Republicans to break with party leadership and join Democrats is only the latest sign of discontent in the narrowly divided House.\n\nJohnson has argued that the criticism directed at his leadership — and lawmakers repeatedly bypassing leadership to force votes — is inevitable given the slim GOP majority. He said he lacks the advantages of a large majority, where “the speaker had a long stick that he would administer punishment.”\n\n“I don’t have that, because we have a small margin,” he said. Of the ACA extensions, Johnson said leadership had “talked about it at length” with GOP moderates, describing the conversations as “some intense fellowship.”\n\n“Everybody’s in good spirits now and everybody understands what’s happening,” he added.\n\nSome GOP members, however, don’t appear to share that assessment. There was lingering discontent as lawmakers headed home for the holidays.\n\n“I don't know how we did not vote on a good bipartisan extension,” said GOP Rep. Don Bacon, adding that Democrats will use the health care issue “like a sledgehammer” on the campaign trail.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., insisted that Republicans are finishing the year “as united as we've ever been.”\n\n“We set out on a course to do big things, not little things, and that means we’re going to have some differences along the way.”",

    "description": "Trump was applauded by MAGA allies for his economic-focused primetime address, despite polls showing that most voters are feeling the opposite.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump was showered with praise by GOP lawmakers and MAGA allies as he insisted that the economy is stronger than how most Americans feel in a primetime speech from the White House.\n\nDuring an 18-minute address, Trump attacked his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and touted his record on immigration, tariffs and culture issues, arguing that the “Golden Age” he proposed on the campaign trail is building momentum. He also announced his administration will be sending $1,776 bonuses, which he called “warrior dividends,” to nearly 1.5 million U.S. service members before Christmas.\n\n“I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,” Trump said Wednesday night.\n\nThe speech came as Trump has oscillated on his messaging on the economy, boasting it as the “best” to repeatedly labeling affordability as a “hoax” — all while polls show that voters need convincing.\n\nAn NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released hours before he spoke found that the president’s economic approval hit a new low at 36%. A new Fox News poll revealed similar, with most voters believing the economy is in bad shape.\n\nBut while his address was ruthlessly ripped by Democrats, his supporters were singing an entirely different tune.\n\n“He very clearly said to the American people, ‘I see you,’ and look at the things we’ve done,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) said on Fox News. “What he has accomplished in just these first 10, 11 months is remarkable, but I think more is yet to come.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich dubbed Trump’s address as “worthy of Ronald Reagan.”\n\n“That was a good speech. It was an important speech,” Gingrich said on Fox News. “Someday, people will say it was one of the most important speeches of his career because it set the table for the entire debate over the next year.”\n\nIn a post on X, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) supported the president’s attacks against the Affordable Care Act, as subsidies are set to expire by the end of the month.\n\n“Republicans will fix what Democrats broke!” he wrote.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also weighed in on X: “High energy, great delivery, grand slam, home run on making the case that the best is yet to come.”\n\nA popular MAGA account posted that Trump “just shows up and performs under pressure.”\n\n“We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes,” the user wrote. “I couldn’t feel more secure with him steering the ship.”\n\nIn the background, the economy remains one of the top concerns of voters heading into the 2026 midterm elections, which could be seen as a litmus test for Trump and the GOP as they look to maintain control of the House and Senate.\n\nAfter Democrats scored sweeping victories in November, Trump has since increased his focus on the key issue.\n\n“I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,” Trump said during a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania last week. “They caused the high prices and we’re bringing them down.”",

    "fullText": "Equity says vote signals strong opposition to AI use and readiness to disrupt productions unless protections are secured\n\nActors have voted to refuse digital scanning to prevent their likeness being used by artificial intelligence in a pushback against AI in the arts.\n\nMembers of the performing arts union Equity were asked if they would refuse to be scanned while on set, a common practice in which actors’ likeness is captured for future use – with 99% voting in favour of the move.\n\nThe general secretary, Paul Fleming, said: “Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity’s film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action.\n\n“Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and [if] decades of erosion in terms and conditions begins to be reversed.”\n\nThe vote was an indicative ballot designed to demonstrate the strength of feeling on the issue, with more than 7,000 members polled on a 75% turnout. However, actors would not be legally protected if they refused to be scanned.\n\nThe union said it would write to Pact, the trade body representing the majority of producers and production companies in the UK, to negotiate new minimum standards for pay, as well as terms and conditions for actors working in film and TV.\n\nEquity said it may hold a formal ballot depending on the outcome of the negotiations, which, if backed, would give actors legal protection if they were being pressed to accept digital scanning on set.\n\nThe decision comes after months of debate and growing concern about performers’ rights as AI becomes embedded in the creative industries, with high-profile actors urging Equity members to support the push to stop digital scanning.\n\nAdrian Lester, Hugh Bonneville and Harriet Walter have backed the union’s campaign to ensure AI protections for performers are written into union agreements.\n\nBonneville said actors’ likenesses and voices should not be “exploited for the benefit of others without licence or consent”, while Lester said actors at the start of their careers often found it difficult to push back against body scanning.\n\nIn October, Olivia Williams told the Guardian that performers were routinely pressed to have their bodies scanned on set without having a say over how the data was later used.\n\nThe Dune star argued that actors should have as much control over data harvested from body scans as they do over nudity scenes. She said some contracts included clauses that appeared to give studios carte blanche over a performer’s likeness “on all platforms now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe in perpetuity”.\n\nThe arrival of the first AI “actor”, Tilly Norwood, further heightened concerns and demands for formal agreements on what is and is not permissible.\n\nIn 2023, concerns over AI were at the heart of the Hollywood writers’ strike, with writers and actors warning that unchecked use of the technology could radically reshape the industry and undermine their roles.",

The GOP plan does not include an extension.\n\nThe committee advanced the bill to the floor late Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday.\n\nModerate Republicans are perplexed at the decision not to hold a vote on an extension ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, and have warned of the political ramifications of allowing insurance premiums to soar in the new year for more than 20 million Americans who buy their insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to shut the door on any amendment votes earlier Tuesday, only to open it slightly after a heated meeting with moderates.\n\n\"We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure-release valve, and it just was not to be. We worked on it all the way through the weekend,\" Johnson told reporters Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican later said \"there's some ideas on the table that could work.\"\n\nModerate Republicans expressed their frustration throughout the day.\n\n\"I am pissed for the American people. This is absolute bulls--t,\" Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told reporters after leaving a GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning.\n\nLawler called it a \"tremendous mistake\" not to address the expiring tax credits.\n\n\"The Democrats want to use this as an issue in the election, and seemingly the Republican leadership is going to allow them to do it. And it's idiotic,\" he said.\n\nHe urged all Democrats to sign on to two bipartisan discharge petitions to force votes on legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms. But even if the discharge petitions hit the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote in the coming days, there's a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can call it up to the floor. The House's last day in session this year is Friday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has said that Republicans should offer up the votes on a Democratic discharge petition to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms. It needs to secure the support of four Republicans to force a vote.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said he hasn't ruled out supporting Democrats' discharge petition.\n\n\"We waited until the very end of the year to just kind of hastily throw together some narrow package to try to make it look like something's being done about health care when this bill is likely not going to become law and it doesn't address the immediate crisis in front of us, or 22 million people,\" he said of the GOP plan.\n\nDuring Tuesday's Rules Committee meeting, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said the only thing worse than an extension without any reforms is no extension at all.\n\nNick Reiner, son of Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, arrested, jail records show\n\nDetails on Nick Reiner's arrest for murders of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele\n\nWhat we know after Rob and Michele Reiner's son Nick arrested in their deaths",

    "fullText": "Jack Smith, the former DOJ special counsel, claimed in closed-door congressional testimony on Wednesday that investigators had proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” that President Donald Trump “criminally” conspired to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSmith made the remarks in his opening statement to lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\n“I made my decisions in the investigation without regard to President Trump’s political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 election,” Smith said in his opening statement, which was obtained in advance by the Associated Press. “We took actions based on what the facts and the law required — the very lesson I learned early in my career as a prosecutor.\n\nSmith added that his probe had “developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.”\n\nSmith’s investigation, which began in 2022, focused on Trump’s alleged effort to overturn his 2020 election loss, as well as the classified documents that were stored at Mar-a-Lago. Charges were filed in both investigations, but Trump escaped prosecution due to the longstanding DOJ policy against the indictment of a sitting president.\n\nThe remarks will likely rile up Trump, who has relentlessly maintained for years that he is innocent of any election tampering.\n\nIn October, the president turned his ire toward Smith in a Truth Social post, calling him a “CRIMINAL,” “MAJOR LOWLIFE,” and “FAILURE” who “SHOULD BE IN JAIL.”\n\nThis is a developing story and has been updated.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Jack Smith Claims He Had ‘Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt’ That Trump Conspired to Overturn 2020 Election first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $10 billion in damages from the BBC, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation as well as deceptive and unfair trade practices.  The lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

It included parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech, which took place before some of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\nThe BBC spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, accusing it of defamation over editing of his Jan. 6 speech\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $10 billion in damages from the BBC, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation as well as deceptive and unfair trade practices.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt accused the BBC of “splicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021” in order to ”intentionally misrepresent the meaning of what President Trump said.”\n\nAbrego Garcia is still hoping to find justice after his wrongful deportation, his lawyer says\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia wasn’t an activist and he didn’t choose to become locked into what has become one of the most contentious immigration issues of the Trump administration, his lawyer told The Associated Press.\n\nBut as he experiences some of the few days he’s had with his family since being sent erroneously to an El Salvador prison in March, his lawyer said he’s still hoping for a just resolution to his case.\n\n“He’s been through a lot, and he’s still fighting,” said his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg during an interview with AP following Abrego Garcia’s court-ordered release from detention last week. “What it is he can fight for is circumscribed by the law and by the great power of the United States government, but he’s still fighting.”\n\nAbrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation to El Salvador helped galvanize opposition to Trump’s immigration policies. He was held in a notoriously brutal prison there despite having no criminal record.\n\n▶ Read more about Abrego Garcia’s case\n\nSen. Mark Kelly’s attorney warns Trump administration of ‘dangerous overreach’\n\nThe attorney’s letter comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Democratic senator who was among a group of lawmakers in a video calling on military personnel to defy “illegal orders.”\n\n“There is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” wrote Paul J. Fishman in the letter to Navy Secretary John Phelan.\n\nTrump himself had lashed out at the lawmakers, who all have military backgrounds after years of service.\n\nKelly’s attorney warned of legal action if the department sought to pursue the senator in any forum — “criminal, disciplinary, or administrative.”\n\nFishman wrote they would “take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”\n\nSecret Service official says ballroom construction doesn’t yet meet agency’s security standards\n\nIn its Monday court filing, the Trump administration included a declaration from the deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service saying more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.”\n\nThe administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in-person without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among Trump’s political adversaries, but the lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded group, is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) addition.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block construction until the project goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification.\n\nTrump administration says White House ballroom construction is a matter of national security\n\nFor that reason, the construction project must continue, the Trump administration said in a court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing came in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt the project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.\n\nExecutive order directs whole of government mobilization against drug traffickers\n\nThe order instructs the State and Treasury departments to pursue the financial assets of and sanctions on financial institutions and groups involved in fentanyl trafficking. It also calls for greater cooperation between the Pentagon and Justice Department on fentanyl and drug trafficking issues.\n\nThe order directs the homeland security secretary to “identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling” by using intelligence resources that in the past were devoted to the detection of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe federal government by law has a wide range of national security and law enforcement capabilities to combat drug smuggling, including asset forfeiture, targeted arrests and surveillance of criminal organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s earlier this year designated some drug cartels as terror groups, a move that may unlock more coordination between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement but has been questioned by legal analysts over its scope and legality.\n\nWisconsin judge allows case against former Trump aides to proceed to trial\n\nA Wisconsin judge has ruled there is enough evidence to proceed to trial in a felony forgery case against an attorney and an aide to President Donald Trump related to action taken after 2020 election.\n\nThe judge on Monday at a preliminary hearing found there was probable cause to proceed with the charges after taking testimony from a special agent with the state Department of Justice who detailed the allegations.\n\nThe charges relate to attempts by the former aides to present a slate of Republican electors to Congress falsely claiming that Trump had won Wisconsin that year.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman were in court for the hearing but did not testify. The judge postponed the preliminary hearing for a third person charged, Ken Chesebro, amid questions about what comments he made to prosecutors could be admitted in court.\n\nPence’s group urges Trump to fire RFK Jr.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group Advancing American Freedom on Monday called on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what the group argues has been a slow-walked safety review of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nKennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary have pledged to review the drug’s safety but are facing mounting pressure from abortion opponents to move more quickly. Mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago, has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.\n\nIn a statement alongside Monday’s memo, the Republican Pence accused Kennedy of being unable or unwilling to keep promises to abortion opponents and said he should step aside.\n\nThe attacks come as Kennedy has faced criticism from both sides but also waves of support as he seeks to dramatically reshape the nation’s health agencies and target vaccines.\n\nTrump again says he’s ended hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia. But fighting continues\n\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire in July, and formalized the deal in October when Trump was in Malaysia. But lately, fighting has resumed. Trump on Friday said he had called the leaders and got them to agree to another truce -- but officials said heavy combat continues.\n\nNevertheless, Trump on Monday said in the Oval Office that “we were able to straighten that out.”\n\nThe two countries were “having a little problem yesterday,” Trump said. “I called them and I said, ‘look, fellas, relax. You gotta take it easy.’ They started the war again, and I got it ended.”\n\nTrump says he has asked Xi to free Jimmy Lai\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media mogul who on Monday was convicted in a landmark national security case.\n\nLai, 78, now could spend the rest of his life in prison. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he has brought up Lai’s case with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and asked for Lai’s release.\n\n“I spoke to President XI about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump said. “He’s not well, he’s an older man, and he’s not well, so I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nIn London and Washington, Jimmy Lai’s children have expressed gratitude for the support from the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump praises José Antonio Kast’s win in Chilean presidential election\n\nTrump touted the win by Kast, a far right conversative who comfortably defeated his left-of-center opponent in Sunday’s election, as a sign of his broader influence on politics across the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I look forward to pay my respects to him here,” Trump said of Kast. “He’s a very good person.”\n\nKast is the most conservative candidate to win Chile’s presidential election in 35 years. He won 58.2% of the votes on a campaign heavily centered on crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defends Syria’s new leader after attack that killed three Americans\n\nTrump said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa “feels very badly” about an attack over the weekend that claimed the lives of two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian.\n\nTrump said the attack happened in a region of Syria that the new government doesn’t control.\n\n“This had nothing to do with him,” said Trump, speaking of al-Sharaa. He hosted al-Sharaa at the White House in November.\n\n“He feels very badly about it. He’s working on it. He’s a strong man, and this had nothing to do with the Syrian government,” Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. military and Trump have blamed the attack on the Islamic State group. Trump has threatened to retaliate.\n\nTrump defends FBI and calls Brown shooting a ‘school problem’\n\nTrump defended the FBI after a mass shooting at Brown University, arguing that questions about the case should be directed to officials at the Ivy League school in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that authorities do not yet know a motive in the shooting that killed two and injured others.\n\nPressed about why the FBI has not been able to identify a shooter, Trump called it a “school problem.” Brown “had their own guards, they had their own police and their own everything,” he said.\n\nTrump told reporters to “ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI,” which he said “came in after the fact.”\n\nHe said the FBI “will do a good job,” and cited the Charlie Kirk assassination as an example. In that case, the alleged killer’s family helped turn him in to authorities.\n\nTrump says the administration is considering changing how it treats marijuana\n\n“We are considering the idea because a lot of people want to see it,” the president said.\n\nTrump had said in August that he was reviewing whether the federal government should reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Such a step could move the federal government closer to an approach already embraced by many states.\n\n“We are looking at that very strongly,” Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump doubles down on criticizing Reiner and calls him ‘deranged’\n\nThe president was asked if he stood by his social media post in light of the pushback he was getting, including from those in his own party.\n\nUsing the third person, Trump said Reiner “was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”\n\n“I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form,” Trump said. “I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nTrump signs executive order classifying fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’\n\nHe signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine, White House border czar Tom Homan and other top military officials.\n\nTrump says his administration is “formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is. No bomb does what this is doing.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the new designation would affect administration policy or what the legal implications would be for those impacted by fentanyl use or drug traffickers.\n\nThe term weapon of mass destruction has typically referred to nuclear, biological, chemical or kinetic threats capable of causing overwhelming and lasting damage to a population, infrastructure or environment. The term has also been hotly debated in American politics since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump is recognizing 13 military service members with a Mexican Border Defense Medal\n\nThe president is in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump border czar Tom Homan, all of them hailing the border defense portion of his immigration crackdown.\n\nMilitary commanders and the award recipients looked on as Trump, Hegseth and Homan declared the border secure. Trump said his administration has “stopped the invasion in its tracks, and we are dismantling the cartels very rapidly.”\n\nHe added many hits from his 2024 campaign speech, blasting the immigration policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and declaring migrants who crossed the border “some of the worst people on Earth.”\n\nHoman praised “greatest president of my lifetime – yes, I said it.” Hegseth said the medal is a reprisal of a military honor awarded previously in the early 20th century\n\nTrump expresses optimism that Russia-Ukraine war is nearing the end\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump said while recapping war talks in Europe at the start of an unrelated White House event.\n\nTrump said he had a “long talk” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also spoke with the leaders of several European countries, including Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom as well as NATO.\n\n“Things are going along pretty well,” the president said.\n\nTrump said everyone wants to see the war end.\n\nPresident Trump to deliver remarks in North Carolina on Friday\n\nThe president’s upcoming trip to Rocky Mount was confirmed by Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, a close Trump ally who was chair of the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election.\n\n“Let’s give him the North Carolina welcome he deserves,” Whatley wrote on social media. Whatley did not describe a reason for the trip in his social media post.\n\nThe event will take place at the Rocky Mount Events Center. Trump last week traveled to Pennsylvania to discuss the economy and cost of living.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson urges an appeal to ‘our better angels’ after weekend violence\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of tragedies,” the GOP speaker said as he arrived at the Capitol.\n\nHe drew on scripture to provide comfort to the Reiner family and others after “the senseless violence” this past weekend in Australia and at Brown University.\n\n“We have to appeal to our better angels,” Johnson said, and “I think we have to amplify those voices.”He declined to answer questions about Trump’s insensitive remarks after Reiner’s death.\n\nUS, Paraguay sign agreement setting out legal basis for American troops in the country\n\nThe United States and Paraguay have signed an agreement laying out the legal framework for American troops to be stationed the in the South American country and clearing the way for further defense and intelligence cooperation between the two as the Trump administration steps up military operations throughout the western hemisphere.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Ramirez signed the so-called “status of forces” agreement on Monday at the State Department. Both men hailed the deal as a step forward in relations that would enhance already strong counter-terrorism and -narcotics measures.\n\nSuch agreements outline the legal requirements and immunities for U.S. troops to be present in other countries, although there was no immediate announcement of any deployments to Paraguay.\n\nCalifornia hires two former CDC officials who rebuffed Trump, Kennedy\n\nCalifornia is hiring two former top federal health officials, state officials said Monday.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is helping California launch an effort to maintain trust in science-driven decision-making and improve public health infrastructure.\n\nMonarez is being joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer. Both will be advisors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nThe White House fired Monarez in August when she fell out of favor with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after only one month on the job. Houry and some other top CDC officials resigned in protest.\n\nA few Republicans speak out against Trump post on Reiner\n\nA few Republican members of Congress are calling out President Donald Trump’s insensitive social media post regarding the deaths of director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted ox X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, “this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump’s post: “This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James makes first comments on the repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her\n\nJames said Monday she isn’t spending a lot of time thinking about the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her.\n\nJames, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the matter at an unrelated press conference after the news last week that a second federal grand jury had declined to indict her on charges related to her purchase of a home in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\n\n“I don’t really spend a lot of time focused on this campaign of retribution,” said James. “I’ve got a lot of work on my hands — standing up and defending the rights of New Yorkers, protecting them from harms coming from Washington, D.C.”\n\nA judge last month threw out an indictment charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case at Republican President Donald Trump’s urging was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve got a job to do,” said James, who had pleaded not guilty to the earlier indictment and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nPoll shows health costs are a rising concern among Americans\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans cite the cost of health care as the most urgent health problem facing the country, and about one-quarter say the health care system is in “crisis,” according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll also shows that only 16% of Americans are satisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe findings from the survey conducted in November come as Congress has yet to address the spiking health insurance premium costs facing millions of Americans when Affordable Care Act health subsidies expire at the start of the new year.\n\nIt also comes as health expenses have risen across the board in response to a variety of factors, including inflation and the increasing use of expensive medications such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\n\nHunter Biden disbarred in Connecticut after complaints about federal convictions\n\nBiden agreed to the penalty and admitted to violating the state’s attorney conduct rules, but he did not admit to committing any crimes.\n\nHis father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him last year after he was convicted of three felonies relating to a 2018 gun purchase and pleaded guilty to failing to pay federal taxes. He previously was disbarred in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Connecticut judge ordered the disbarment on Monday. Hunter Biden did not speak and he and his lawyer appeared via video at the virtual court hearing in Waterbury.\n\nThe judge found that Hunter Biden violated several lawyer ethics rules, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”\n\nIn a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.\n\nWhite House views Russian openness to Ukraine joining the EU as a big deal\n\nThe U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelenskyy and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it doesn’t object to Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "fullText": "The Kennedys' legacy of style endures through auctions of their historic clothing.\n\nEven unmentionables tied to the Kennedys remain hot-ticket items — a pair of JFK's underwear sold for $9,100 at an auction in March held by Julien's Auctions.\n\nOne of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' most memorable looks, the purple wool maternity coat she wore the night John F. Kennedy was elected in 1960, sold for $50,800 at Sotheby's Handbags and Fashion auction on Monday in New York City.\n\nThe coat's designer is unknown, but it remains recognizable as a pivotal moment in her rise to become one of America's defining fashion icons.\n\nTake a closer look at the former first lady's historic outfit.\n\nKennedy Onassis was pregnant with John F. Kennedy Jr. at the time, so she only occasionally joined Kennedy on the campaign trail leading up to election night. One such stop took place in New York City in October 1960, where she accessorized the purple coat with a matching hat.\n\nKennedy Onassis stood next to the then-president-elect as he delivered his acceptance speech.\n\nA photo of her wearing the coat appeared on the cover of the November 21, 1960, issue of Life Magazine.\n\nKennedy Onassis, who was eight months pregnant on election night, accessorized the coat with strands of pearls and low heels.\n\nAccording to Sotheby's, Kennedy Onassis shared the coat with a few of her close friends to wear during their pregnancies. The daughter of the last of these women to wear the coat donated it to Sotheby's.\n\nSotheby's estimated the coat's value at between $6,000 and $8,000. It sold for $50,800, more than six times the high estimate.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump raged in a dead-of-night social media post at Republicans who defied him on a plan that would have given the GOP more seats in Congress.\n\nThe Indiana State Senate voted down a redistricting plan Trump pushed hard to give Republicans two more congressional seats, defeating it by a 31-19 margin — including a majority of Republicans.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about the vote just after it happened, he downplayed his role in supporting the plan:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I wasn’t working on it very hard. Would have been nice, I think we would have picked up two seats, if we did that. You had one gentleman, the head of the Senate, I guess, Bray, whatever his name is, I heard he was against it. He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is. I hope he does, because he’s done a tremendous disservice.\n\nBut the issue kept Trump awake into the early hours Saturday morning. It was almost one o’clock in the morning when Trump posted a threatening rant to his Truth Social account:\n\nRepublicans in the Indiana State Senate, who voted against a Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be ashamed of themselves. Headed by a total loser named Rod Bray, every one of these people should be “primaried,” and I will be there to help! Indiana, which I won big, is the only state in the Union to do this!\n\nThe rant came hours after Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) tried to downplay the significance of the vote and its effect on Trump’s stature.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju asked Johnson, on Friday, “Are you worried about Trump’s grip on power after Indiana? Do you think it shows he’s a lame duck?”\n\n“Not at all! No, he is not a lame duck!” Johnson said. “He’s the most powerful president of this generation and many others. We have a lot more work to do together. The outcome in Indiana is inconsequential to that.”\n\nThe post Trump Rages In Dead Of Night At Republicans Who Defied Him On Election Map — After Claiming He Hadn’t ‘Worked Very Hard’ On It first appeared on Mediaite.",

Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.\n\nxAI’s Grok is more known for referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria’s government resigned on Thursday after mass protests gripped the country and just weeks before the European Union nation is due to join the eurozone.\n\nThe resignation of the minority coalition, led by the center-right GERB party, was announced minutes before parliament was scheduled to vote on a no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition over economic mismanagement and supported by growing public anger with widespread corruption.\n\n“Ahead of today’s vote of no confidence, the government is resigning,” Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov told reporters in parliament.\n\nThe demonstrations on Wednesday came after last week’s protests that were sparked by the government’s budget plans for higher taxes, increased social security contributions and spending increases. The government later withdrew the contentious 2026 budget plan.\n\nThe protesters’ demands had expanded to include calls for the center-right government to step down.\n\n“The decisions of the National Assembly are meaningful when they reflect the will of the people,\" Zhelyazkov said, referring to the anti-government protests. “We want to be where society expects us to be.”\n\nStudents from Sofia’s universities had joined the protests, which organizers said outnumbered last week’s rallies that drew more than 50,000 people. Media estimates based on drone visuals put the number of protesters at over 100,000.\n\nAt the core of the protesters’ frustrations is the role of Bulgarian politician and oligarch Delyan Peevski, who has been sanctioned by both the United States and the United Kingdom, and whose MRF New Beginning party backs the government. Peevski has been accused by opponents of helping shaping government policy in line with oligarchic interests.\n\n“We have no doubt that the government will receive support in the upcoming vote of no confidence. Regardless, the decisions of the National Assembly are important when they reflect the will of the sovereign,” the prime minister said.\n\nZhelyazkov’s government survived six votes of no confidence since it was appointed in January, but this time the large turnout of protesters on the streets was a game changer.\n\nThe resignation will be formally submitted to parliament on Friday, which must adopt a resolution to accept it. After this formal procedure, President Rumen Radev will give the biggest group in parliament the chance to form a new government. If it fails, the second-largest grouping will get a chance before the president choses a candidate.\n\nIf all attempts fail — which is likely — he will appoint a caretaker Cabinet until a new election is held. Political analysts expect that another vote — the eighth since 2021 — will likely produce a similar deeply fragmented parliament facing an uphill task to form a stable government.\n\nAssen Vassilev, the leader of the opposition We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria coalition, called the government’s resignation “the first step in making Bulgaria a normal European state.”\n\n“The next step along this path is to conduct fair and free elections rather than elections compromised by vote manipulation as in the previous campaign,” he added.\n\nThe Balkan country of 6.4 million people is due to make the switch from its national currency, the lev, to the euro on Jan. 1, to become the eurozone's 21st member. Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",
