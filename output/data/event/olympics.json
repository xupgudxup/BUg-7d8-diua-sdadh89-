    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - will not be able to wear their new helmets because they do not comply with the sport's rules around shape.\n\nThe British team had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) on Thursday to overturn the decision by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nBut Cas say the helmet is a departure from the standard helmet shape and has clearly been designed to specifically enhance aerodynamic performance because the back of the helmet protrudes.\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) stressed that the helmet was designed with safety in mind and to comply with new safety regulations due to be introduced by the IBSF at the start of the 2026-27 season.\n\nThose rules are not in place at the Olympics but British skeleton have essentially tried to get ahead of the curve by designing and using their new helmet in Italy.\n\nInstead they will wear the ones they wore during the last World Cup season.\n\nA picture seen by BBC Sport shows that the helmet is pointed at the back - similar in appearance to a track cycling helmet.\n\nNatalie Dunman, executive performance director at the BBSA, said: \"Based on the strength of the case we put forward, naturally we are disappointed in [the] decision.\n\n\"However, this does not affect our final preparations and nor has the discourse affected the athletes' focus or optimism going into the Games.\n\n\"Our athletes have been winning medals all season, and throughout the Olympic cycle, in their current helmets and we remain in a strong position to continue that trend.\"\n\nWhen asked about the helmet prior to the verdict, Team GB's skeleton racers said they had no preference on which helmet they used at the Olympics.\n\nThey arrive at the Games as heavy favourites to win medals with world champion and overall World Cup winner Matt Weston leading the charge for gold while compatriot Marcus Wyatt is also fancied to go well.\n\nThe British team wore the new helmets at a training session last week in Switzerland with the IBSF ruling them out on 29 January before the BBSA appealed against the ban on Thursday.\n\nOfficial skeleton training in Cortina begins on Monday with the men's event beginning on 12 February, while the women's starts on 13 February and the team event is on 15 February.\n\nThe helmet is the most important bit of kit both for safety and aerodynamics - how quickly the slider can travel down the track.\n\nDoctor Bryce Dyer, a professor of sport technology at the University of Bournemouth, says that because skeleton is head first it is essential that the helmet is aerodynamic to cut through the air.\n\n\"The airflow over that section is really, really important,\" he said. \"Any kind of gain they can make with the shape and the general performance of it, then obviously the higher the speed gap is going to achieve and therefore the better chances of the medal.\n\n\"The funny thing with aerodynamics is that the faster you go, the more resistance actually gets thrown against you. So you need the most aerodynamically efficient shape you can obtain.\"\n\nIt is here that the British team's case appears to have been decided, with Cas agreeing with the IBSF that the overall shape incorporates prohibited spoilers (attachments), protruding edges or aerodynamic elements.\n\n\"Even that [aerodynamic helmet] will only yield a very, very small increase in velocity. But that could be just enough,\" said Dyer.\n\nWith the margin between winning gold and going home empty handed \"hundredths of a second\", two-time world champion Weston knows that innovation in aerodynamics is key to the \"minor gains\" needed.\n\nWhile the BBSA say they are disappointed with the decision, the British team know they are in a strong position without the new helmets.\n\nBetween them, Weston and Wyatt have won all seven World Cup races this season while three women have qualified for the Olympics for the first time in British history.\n\nWhen discussing the matter before the verdict was announced, Wyatt, Weston and women's skeleton rider Tabitha Stoecker all said they did not mind which helmet they wore at the Games.\n\n\"All of our success has been with the other helmet - for me this is the tiniest little thing in the background,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\"I'm not worried, whatever we end up wearing I think we're in with a great shout of bringing some medals home.\"\n\nThree-time overall World Cup winner Weston added: \"I have other things I can focus on and other things I'm working on to maximise my performance coming into the Olympics.\n\n\"If these new helmets get though then great it's an added bonus. But if not then we are in a pretty solid place.\"\n\nStoecker added: \"We've been competing in our regular training helmets all year and having amazing results.\n\n\"With or without that [helmet] I think we all feel really confident in the team and in our abilities and what we're going to be able to lay down at the Games.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold said: \"It's good to get the decision out of the way before official training has begun. The athletes are likely to be unaffected mentally and their preparation is unaffected.\n\n\"I personally like to see developments in elite sport, innovation is important, maybe this process will develop the rules further and create more clarity within the rules, and therefore allow for some innovation.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Winter Olympics feature a variety of sledding sports.\n\nTwo of the most well known are bobsled and luge. And then there's skeleton.\n\nFrom the name to the sport itself, skeleton is a bit more of an unknown.\n\nSo here's some of what you need to know.\n\nMORE: How Laila Edwards is making U.S. women's hockey history\n\nSkeleton is the sledding sport at the Olympics that features the competitor facing head-first down the track.\n\nThe competitor lies on their stomach, face down.\n\nIt was a part of the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, then didn't return until 2002.\n\nThe sport of skeleton is named after the first metal sleds.\n\nWhen they were first introduced in 1892, they looked like a human skeleton.\n\nSkeleton most closely resembles luge, which has sleds that are somewhat similar but instead has the competitor on their back and going down the track feet first.\n\nThe United States won the first gold medal in skeleton, back in 1928, and also won gold in 2002.\n\nWhy Eileen Gu competes for China, not U.S.\n\nHow Lindsey Vonn plans to ski at the Olympics with a torn ACL\n\nWhat to know about Jutta Leerdam at the Olympics\n\nEverything about Snoop Dogg's roles at the Olympics\n\nThis is what Russia's Olympic hockey roster would've looked like",

    "description": "Take a look back at the biggest Olympics controversies, from Jordan Chiles losing her bronze medal to Tonya Harding's infamous scandal.",
    "fullText": "After suffering an injury prior to the Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and realizing three minutes into her free skate that she wouldn't be receiving a medal, Bonaly decided to pull out her signature move, a backflip with a landing on one blade, which was then illegal in competition.\n\n\"I wanted to do something to please the crowd, not the judges,\" she said, according to the Miami Herald and the Washington Post. \"The judges are not pleased no matter what I do, and I knew I couldn't go forward anyway because everybody was skating so good.\"\n\nThe Huffington Post reported Bonaly is one of only a few female skaters to have ever performed the move in competition, and the only skater, male or female, to ever land a one-foot backflip.\n\nIn one of the biggest scandals in sports history, Nancy Kerrigan was physically attacked and struck in the leg on January 6, 1994, which put her at risk of never skating again.\n\nAt the time, she was the top ice skater in the US and a gold medal hopeful for the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\nHarding pleaded guilty to failing to cooperate with prosecutors. She was fined $160,000 and barred from ever participating in skating competitions again.\n\nHarding's ex-husband, her former bodyguard, and two others spent time in prison for their connections to the scheme after pleading guilty to charges.\n\nFor more than two decades, Harding denied knowing anything about their plot, but in a 2018 ABC special, she admitted she had an inkling the men were behind it. However, she's maintained she had no part in planning the attack.\n\nThe error during the women's all-around threw many athletes off their game, and some fell. Eighteen gymnasts used the vault before one flagged the issue to organizers.\n\nFive gymnasts took the opportunity to re-perform their vaults after the botched vault setting was revealed, ABC News reported.\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) said the organizations tasked with overseeing the equipment were reprimanded, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"It was checked. Believe me, it was checked. I'm sure triple-checked,\" Slava Corn, then-president of the media commission for FIG, said following the error, AP reported.\"And, quite frankly, I don't think we'll ever have an error like this again.\"\n\nAt the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Jones became the first woman to win five track-and-field medals at a single Olympics. Three of her medals were gold.\n\nHowever, in 2007, Jones admitted she had used steroids to prepare for the games and gave up her medals.\n\n\"I have let my country down, and I have let myself down,\" Jones said at a press conference outside court in 2007. \"I recognize that by saying that I'm deeply sorry, it might not be enough and sufficient to address the pain and the hurt that I have caused you. Therefore, I want to ask for your forgiveness for my actions, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\"\n\nIn January 2008, she was sentenced to six months in prison for lying to federal investigators about her steroid use ahead of the Olympics and for her involvement in a separate check fraud case.\n\nIn 2025, Jones, who went on to play professional basketball after her prison term, told The Athletic she has moved on from the scandal. \"You not only have done your physical time, but you've done your mental time, as well,\" Jones told herself.\n\n\"You've apologized more times than you ever needed to. Now it's time for you to live your life,\" she added.\n\nThe story began when Ryan Lochte's mother told USA Today that he'd been robbed at gunpoint. He repeated the claim to other outlets, saying he and his teammates had been robbed at gunpoint by men posing as police.\n\nHowever, police in Brazil said they were unable to confirm their account with witnesses. Within days, Conger and Bentz told police that Lochte had made up the story.\n\nInstead, an investigation found that after the four men had asked their taxi driver to pull over at a gas station, they engaged in public urination and vandalism. They were then confronted by armed security guards, police said.\n\nA week after his initial claims, Lochte admitted to exaggerating their original story in an interview with NBC, saying, \"If I hadn't exaggerated the story or told the entire story, none of this would have happened. I was coming from the France house, I was highly intoxicated, and I made immature accusations. If I had not done that, none of this would have happened.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"truly, 110% sorry.\"\n\nLochte was given a 10-month suspension from domestic and international competitions, while Feigen, Bentz, and Conger were given four-month suspensions for failing to come forward about what actually happened that night, The New York Times reported.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson, one of the fastest female runners in the US, was excluded from the US relay team in 2021 after testing positive for THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis, at the US Olympic Team Trials. She later admitted she had taken marijuana after learning from a reporter that her biological mother had died.\n\n\"I'm not making an excuse or looking for empathy in my case,\" the then-21-year-old athlete said in an interview with NBC's \"Today\" show. However, she added that finding out about her mother's death and dealing with the relationship they had \"was a very heavy topic.\"\n\nUSATF said in a statement: \"First and foremost, we are incredibly sympathetic toward Sha'Carri Richardson's extenuating circumstances and strongly applaud her accountability — and will offer her our continued support both on and off the track.\n\n\"While USATF fully agrees that the merit of the World Anti-Doping Agency rules related to THC should be reevaluated, it would be detrimental to the integrity of the US Olympic Team Trials for Track & Field if USATF amended its policies following competition, only weeks before the Olympic Games,\" the statement continued.\n\nRichardson did make the 2024 Paris Olympics, however, and earned silver and gold medals there.\n\nIn 2021, German coach Kim Raisner was ejected from the Olympic competition following an incident involving athlete Annika Schleu and her horse, Saint Boy. When Saint Boy refused to jump during the show-jumping round of the women's event, Raisner was heard encouraging Schleu to \"really hit it, hit\" the horse to get it to jump, and even struck Saint Boy herself.\n\nFollowing the incident, animal safety at the event was called into question. The Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne, which oversees the pentathlon, said the incident caused \"distress both inside and outside the global UIPM Sports community.\"\n\n\"UIPM regrets the trauma suffered by Saint Boy in this high-profile incident and has penalized the coach who violated the UIPM Competition Rules by striking the horse from outside the ring,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\n\"Although no athlete or horse was physically injured on August 6, the best possible safeguards must be in place to minimize risk in future,\" it added.\n\nUltimately, the UIPM's executive board voted to remove horse riding from the modern pentathlon. The change came into effect after the 2024 Paris Olympics, and obstacle course racing will replace the equestrian event at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nKamila Valieva, a skater competing for the Russian Olympic Committee, was embroiled in a doping scandal after it emerged she had tested positive for trimetazidine, a drug the World Anti-Doping Agency categorizes as a \"hormone and metabolic modulator,\" as reported by The Associated Press.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that the drug can \"bolster endurance and improve circulation,\" potentially giving athletes who do not need to use the drug a competitive advantage.\n\nValieva's lawyers said her positive test was the result of a mix-up with her grandfather's medicine.\n\nAfter news of the skater failing the drug test in December 2021 emerged in early February 2022, Valieva was suspended from competition. However, the decision was appealed and overturned, allowing Valieva to continue with the competition. The IOC later challenged that decision, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport lifted her suspension.\n\nUltimately, Valieva was allowed to skate, a move that drew backlash from the skating community, including commentators Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir.\n\nAmerican sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson said she believed she was treated differently from Valieva over their positive tests because she is Black; the IOC denied that was the case.\n\nThe skater earned first place in the women's short program on February 15, 2022, but she placed fourth in the women's free skate two days later after two falls, keeping her out of medal contention.\n\nThe IOC had said it would not hold a medal ceremony if she were in the top three.\n\nIn a July 2024 press release, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) said it received a video of six-time dressage medalist Dujardin \"engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare,\" noting that \"the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during a training session conducted by Ms. Dujardin at a private stable.\"\n\nThe Guardian reported Dujardin whipped a horse more than 20 times during the session.\n\nShe was issued a one-year suspension, a fine, and barred from the Paris Games.\n\nDujardin released a statement on Instagram, writing that the video showed her \"making an error of judgment.\"\n\nShe added, \"What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils; however, there is no excuse. I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.\"\n\nDujardin finished her statement with an apology and said she would \"cooperate fully\" during investigations.\n\nThe women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise final was full of drama. Team USA gymnast Jordan Chiles was initially awarded a score of 13.666, placing fifth.\n\nHer coach, Cecile Landi, appealed the score based on the routine's difficulty, and officials re-evaluated it, awarding Chiles a 13.766, bumping her from fifth to third place and allowing her to receive the bronze medal instead of Romania's Ana Bărbosu.\n\nAfter the competition, Team Romania filed an inquiry about Team USA's request to review Chiles' score, arguing that the challenge wasn't submitted within the 60-second limit.\n\nOn August 10, the Court of Arbitration ruled that Team USA's appeal was four seconds late and reinstated her original score of 13.666, putting Bărbosu back in third place.\n\nThe IOC agreed with the court and released a statement that it is \"in touch with the NOC of Romania to discuss the reallocation ceremony and with USOPC regarding the return of the bronze medal.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics and the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee released a joint statement defending Chiles and Landi's original inquiry, writing, \"The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics released an additional statement on X that Landi requested to file the inquiry 47 seconds after the publishing of Chiles' score, writing, \"The time-stamped video evidence submitted by USA Gymnastics Sunday evening shows Landi stated her request to file an inquiry at the inquiry table 47 seconds after the score is posted, followed by a second statement 55 scores after the score was originally posted.\"\n\nIn January 2026, Switzerland's federal court said the case would be returned to the Court of Arbitration for further review, in light of new video evidence.\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif faced scrutiny throughout the Olympics due to the spread of misinformation about her sex.\n\nThe controversy began after Italy's Angela Carini withdrew from her competition against Khelif, refusing to shake her hand and saying she'd \"never been hit with such a powerful punch.\"\n\nCarini's actions reignited debate over the International Boxing Association's (IBA) 2023 decision to disqualify Khelif from the world championships.\n\nThe IBA — which was banned from the Olympic family in 2023 — said Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting failed \"to meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams repeatedly defended Khalif and Yu-ting against the unspecified tests and the scrutiny they faced. No evidence was presented publicly that Khelif violated Olympic eligibility rules.\n\n\"The whole process is flawed,\" Adams said, per the AP, adding, \"From the conception of the test, to how the test was shared with us, to how the tests have become public, is so flawed that it's impossible to engage with.\"\n\nKhelif and Yu-ting went on to win gold medals in their respective weight classes.\n\nAfter Khelif's win, she said, \"I'm a woman like any other woman. I was born a woman, I lived a woman, I competed as a woman.\"\n\nEleven members of China's swim team for the 2024 Olympics were involved in a 2021 doping scandal, NBC reported.\n\nThese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned drug that's used to treat heart-related conditions, in 2021, but the results didn't come to light until 2024.\n\nChina said the athletes' levels of trimetazidine were the result of contaminated food, which the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted. Thus, none of the swimmers was sanctioned.\n\nAll of the athletes were allowed to compete in Tokyo, including Wang Shun, who won the gold medal in the men's 200-meter individual medley. He also won the bronze medal in the same event this year.\n\nAP reported that Shun, through a translator, said, \"Chinese swimmers only compete cleanly.\"\n\nThe city of Paris invested $1.5 billion to clean the River Seine, which had been closed to swimmers for more than a century because of pollution levels. Mayor Anne Hidalgo even swam in the water to prove its safety.\n\nA representative for Paris 2024 told Business Insider in a statement that \"this project to make the Seine swimmable after 100 years is a major achievement.\"\n\nHowever, even after the 2024 Olympics got underway, there were concerns about levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river, and the men's triathlon was rescheduled, the AP reported.\n\nOlympic athletes ultimately swam in the Seine, but the reviews left something to be desired.\n\n\"While swimming under the bridge, I felt and saw things that we shouldn't think about too much,\" Jolien Vermeylen of Belgium told Dutch television station VTM, Metro reported.",

    "fullText": "Swiss Alpine skier Franjo von Allmen was crowned the first champion of the 2026 Winter Olympics as Italians Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris won their nation's first medals in the downhill.\n\nVon Allmen blazed down the iconic Stelvio in a time of one minute 51.61 seconds, 0.20 seconds quicker than fellow 24-year-old Franzoni.\n\nParis, the veteran on the podium at 36, was half a second slower than Von Allmen as he pipped Swiss great and runaway World Cup leader Marco Odermatt to the bronze medal.\n\n\"It feels kind of like a movie, not really real,\" said Von Allmen.\n\n\"I can't tell you what it means to me.\"\n\nWhen the last Olympics took place, Von Allmen was yet to make his World Cup debut but he has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top.\n\nHe won World Championship gold in 2025 - the youngest man to win the downhill title in 36 years - with that victory coming before he won the first of his four titles on the World Cup circuit.\n\nBut it hasn't been any easy run to glory.\n\nAt 17, after the sudden death of his father, he struggled to finance his promising ski career.\n\n\"My racing career was hanging in the balance,\" he told Swiss outlet Blick., external\n\nHe decided to crowdfund, and eventually raised enough money to continue for another season, after which he made the jump on to the Swiss national squad.\n\nHe credits training as a carpenter with \"shaping him\", and has previously spent his summers working on construction sites.\n\nBut that will not be necessary now, having become the fifth Swiss Olympic downhill champion since 1948.\n\nVonn disputes doctor's knee injury claim\n\nGB on brink of mixed semis after another win\n\nSwiss skiers had held all three podium positions before the Italians entered the start gate, with Franzoni and Paris knocking off Alexis Monney and then Odermatt with impressive performances in sunny Bormio.\n\nParis is seen as a king of this course, having won seven World Cup titles across both downhill and the Super-G, and he won a first Olympic medal at his fifth Games.\n\n\"Getting the first medal in front of the home crowd, that's really special,\" he said.\n\nBut for the Italians, their medal success comes in what has been an emotionally difficult season, five months after the death of their team-mate Matteo Franzoso in a training crash.\n\nFranzoso suffered a head injury in a collision with a fence in La Parva, Chile, in September.\n\nLast month, after winning World Cup gold at prestigious Kitzbuhel, Franzoni said he had raced with Franzoso \"in his mind\" after the two had shared a room at the course a year previously.\n\n\"To share the podium with Franjo, after [doing so at] the junior world championships [in 2022], he's such a great guy,\" said Franzoni.\n\n\"Also with Domi, I really wanted to share a podium with him. I don't know if he'll continue racing next year but this is the biggest stage to share.\"\n\nAs a junior, Franzoni used to race against Jannik Sinner, who was a standout skier before pursuing tennis.\n\nIn fact, Sinner, now a four-time Grand Slam champion, once beat Franzoni in 2009, something he was made aware of after the latter's super-G victory in Wengen earlier this year.\n\nSinner followed Franzoni on social media and the pair have since struck up a friendship.\n\n\"Receiving a message from a champion like him gave me a lot of motivation,\" said Franzoni after his Kitzbuhel win.\n\n\"I thought, 'If he wrote to me, it means I'm doing something right'. It's been something really, really nice for me.\"\n\nSki jumpers sceptical of penis injection reports\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\n“No, I didn’t see that,” Trump replied in video from Forbes Breaking News. “Is that true, is that right? It’s surprising, ’cause people like him.”\n\nThat’s when Trump made his curious statement.\n\nPolitics: Union Starbucks Workers Call On Customers To Delete Starbucks App\n\n“Well, I mean he is in a foreign country, in all fairness. But, uh, he doesn’t get booed in this country.”\n\nVance has been booed in the United States on multiple occasions. He was booed at a firefighters’ union conference in Boston in 2024, during Trump’s presidential campaign. He was booed by protesters in Vermont when he traveled there with his family last March for a ski vacation. He was booed by the audience at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the same month.

    "fullText": "Skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess talked about the \"mixed emotions\" that come with representing the U.S. amid political turmoil at the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nLillis said he's \"heartbroken\" by what's happening in the U.S.\n\nAnti-ICE protestors staged a rally in Milan on Feb. 6\n\nTwo Team USA athletes are speaking out about what it means to them to represent their country before the rest of the world amid a season of political turmoil at home.\n\nWhile several athletes skirted around the question of politics with diplomatic answers about representing personal values at the 2026 Winter Olympics, freestyle skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess acknowledged that wearing red, white and blue at this point in history comes with mixed emotions during a press conference on Friday, Feb. 6.\n\nLillis, 27, said that he loves the United States and “would never want to represent” any other country at the Games. Still, he acknowledged that he’s “heartbroken” over what’s happening in the U.S. amid President Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\n“A lot of times, athletes are hesitant to talk about political views and how we feel about things. I feel heartbroken about what’s happening in the United States,” he said. “I’m pretty sure you’re referencing ICE and some of the protests and things like that. I think that as a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we’re treating our citizens as well as anybody, with love and respect.”\n\nHe continued, “I hope that when people look at athletes competing in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent.”\n\nHess, meanwhile, said it “brings up mixed emotions” to represent the United States at the 2026 Games.\n\n“It’s a little hard. There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t,” the skier, 27, said. “I think for me, it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home… all the things that I believe are good about the United States.”\n\nHess noted that “just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S.”\n\n“I just kind of want to do it for my friends and my family and the people that support me getting here,” he said.\n\nThe immigration conversation in the U.S. has become heated in recent months, especially after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alexi Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota.\n\nICE tactics — including the nearly two-week detainment of a 5-year-old boy — have drawn outrage from some, prompting protests nationwide and abroad. Citizens of Milan, the main home of the 2026 Winter Olympics, staged an anti-ICE protest on Friday, Feb. 6, while Vice President JD Vance’s appearance at the opening ceremony later that day prompted boos from the crowd when he was shown on screen at the stadium.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "fullText": "Team GB's mixed doubles curlers moved to the brink of the Winter Olympics semi-finals with three matches still to play, as a statement victory over heavyweights Canada maintained their 100% record.\n\nUS honorary coach, hype man and rapper Snoop Dogg was not in the house on Saturday, but Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds made their own headlines, roaring into a 5-1 lead after just three ends before closing out a 7-5 triumph.\n\nThe sense is six wins should be enough for a place in the last four and the British pair have already hit that mark to sit top of the round-robin standings.\n\nOnly the US - who GB play at 13:35 GMT live on BBC Two - had beaten Canada's Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman so far. But the husband-and-wife team could not compete with childhood friends Mouat and Dodds.\n\nThree points in the opening end set the tone - and sent a cascade of noise rolling down from the wooden bleachers in the quirky Cortina Curling Stadium - and a series of judicious shots ensured the Scots kept their opponents at arms length.\n\nThe GB pair led 5-2 at the halfway interval, before two more fabulous closing throws by Dodds left it at 7-3 with two ends remaining.\n\nCanada were done at that stage, and looked poised to concede as Dodds lined up a final stone to take a point in the seventh. But a rare overthrow instead gifted them two and extended the contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds did not falter, though, blanking that final end to all but seal a semi-final spot.\n\nElsewhere, Kirsty Muir enjoyed a confident start to her Olympic campaign, placing third in freeski slopestyle qualifying.\n\nMuir, one of Team GB's best medal hopes, scored a best of 64.98 from her two runs in Livigno.\n\nThat put the 21-year-old behind Switzerland's Mathilde Gremaud and China's Eileen Gu - the gold and silver medallists from Beijing 2022 respectively - in the standings.\n\nGu, a triple medallist from four years ago, is one of the biggest global stars at these Games but avoided an early shock after crashing off the first rail of her opening run.\n\nAfter almost a year out with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, Muir has won three World Cup golds in the past year, including two in slopestyle.\n\nThe Olympic final takes place on Monday from 11:30 GMT.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "title": "Italians embrace unity — except with JD Vance — during Olympics opening ceremony",
    "description": "Italy welcomed the world with a snow-capped spectacle during the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Olympics, pushing past pre-Games tension.",
    "fullText": "Spread across more than 265 miles in four different cities from the snowy Dolomites to the sunny — for now — streets of Milan, the Milan-Cortina Olympics delivered one message.\n\nThe most widespread Olympic Games in history showcased Italy’s idyllic snow-capped mountains, cutting-edge city life and celebrated winter legacy in the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Games on Friday. The unique setup that required four ceremonies in Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina d'Ampezzo used movie magic on video screens, a golden ring and Italian icon Andrea Bocelli to bridge the distance between host cities Milan and Cortina and unite the Olympics behind the athletes who will compete across seven sports zones in the next 16 days.\n\n“Let these Games be a celebration of what unites us, of everything that makes us human,” International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry said in her speech, her first at an Olympic Games under her leadership. “This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be — together.”\n\nThe theme for Milan-Cortina’s opening ceremony was armonia, or harmony. The Games needed it.\n\nThese Olympics appear to be the most disconnected ever. The sprawling footprint covers seven different competition zones. The 2026 Games are the first to be officially hosted by two cities.\n\nBut the geographical distance is small compared to the geopolitical canyon the Games hope to bridge.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine is keeping most Russian athletes out of the competition. Only 32 athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports were allowed and will have to compete as individual neutral athletes. They will not hear their national anthems or wear their national flags. Ukrainian athletes marched into San Siro Stadium — where athletes competing in ice sports participated in the opening ceremony — to loud cheers.\n\nWhen talk of protest or political conflict arose this week, Coventry tried to downplay it to keep the focus on the Games. She called controversy about LA28 chairman Casey Wasserman and ICE agents in Milan \"sad\" distractions. The United States was at the center of much of the contention after reports concerning the presence of U.S. immigration agents in Milan prompted anti-ICE protests. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee tried to cool tensions by clarifying that the organization does work with the federal government to help secure the Games, but the USOPC works with the Diplomatic Security Service, which falls under the jurisdiction of the State Department and not Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.\n\nPresident Trump’s recent comments about the United States taking control of Greenland from Denmark also angered European allies.\n\nOn Friday, an American fan walked around the concourse at San Siro Stadium in a sweatshirt that read in multiple languages: “Sorry for our president.”\n\nWhen Vice President JD Vance, sitting in the presidential suite, was shown on the video screen at San Siro, the cheers that showered U.S. athletes when they entered the stadium turned into jeers. Vance attended multiple events this week, including the U.S. women’s hockey’s group stage opener Thursday and the team figure skating competition Friday.\n\nThe 323-athlete U.S. delegation led by flag bearers speedskater Erin Jackson in Milan and bobsled athlete Frank Del Duca in Cortina was the largest in the nation's Winter Olympics history and the largest of any country at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nAthletes marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium, the home of AC Milan and Inter Milan, across a spiral-shaped stage. The four ramps converging into a circle represented the connection between Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina.\n\nEven if athletes of a country were not competing in Milan and were unable to attend the opening ceremony, a sign-holding volunteer dressed in a silver floor-length puffer dress strutted across the stage while screens showed athletes marching in during ceremonies at other Olympic locations around Italy.\n\nIn Cortina, a Brazilian athlete did a backflip after talking through a golden ring portal, a shared symbol at each ceremony. While Olympians in Milan walked into a packed stadium with flashing lights and thumping techno music played by a DJ at a turntable that looked like ice, the mountain ceremonies took place through the streets. Fans assembled on either side of the walkway for the parade of athletes.\n\nThe ceremony hit on the quintessential northern Italian experience. A plate of risotto was among the first images shown on the video board in the countdown video as the ceremony approached, followed by the picturesque snowy peaks of the Dolomites. As a fashion capital of the world, Milan used runway models dressed in green, white and red outfits designed by Giorgia Armani to represent the Italian flag. There was even a two-minute video on Italian hand gestures.\n\nItaly, as the host nation, marched in last to deafening applause and cheers from the crowd in Milan. In about two years, the United States will have the honor of closing the parade of athletes when L.A. hosts the 2028 Summer Games. The opening ceremony is also planned to take place in multiple locations, with the Coliseum and SoFi Stadium co-hosting the event.\n\nTo unite the Italian host cities, the Olympic flame was passed out of the stadium as Bocelli belted and the torch simultaneously reached two cauldrons. In Milan, the pulsating cauldron inspired by the sun will burn at Arco della Pace. In Cortina, it will light up Piazza Angelo Dibona.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "An enthusiastic welcome for American athletes at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics opening ceremony quickly soured when cameras focused on Vice President JD Vance.\n\nTeam USA, led by speedskater and flag bearer Erin Jackson, was among the final delegations to parade into Milan’s San Siro stadium on Friday.\n\nWhile the crowd cheered for the athletes, jeers and whistles erupted as Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, appeared on stadium screens, waving American flags.\n\nCommentators highlighted this distinct shift in the crowd’s reception.\n\n“There’s the vice president and his wife, Usha; those are not, oh, those are a lot of boos for him,” one commentator said on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s coverage.\n\nThe Independent’s Flo Clifford reported from inside San Siro stadium, “A largely positive reception for the U.S. contingent. There are thousands of American fans in the stadium - but very definite boos and jeers for vice president JD Vance and his wife, second lady Usha Vance, who the camera pans to waving American flags for a few brief seconds.”\n\nSupport for the U.S. among its allies has been eroding as the Trump administration has taken an aggressive posture on foreign policy, including imposing tariffs, military action in Venezuela and threats to invade Greenland.\n\nOn social media, viewers at home noted hearing the boos as well. It comes after International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry urged spectators to be “respectful” toward U.S. athletes after worldwide backlash over Trump’s immigration raids and the killing of two Americans by border officers in Minnesota.\n\nJeers also rang out when Israel's delegation entered the stadium.\n\nBesides Milan, athlete parades were held in three other locations: Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livigno and Predazzo. The Games are staged across a vast area of northern Italy, making them the most geographically dispersed Winter Olympics in history.",

    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina Winter Olympic Games are officially under way after a vibrant opening ceremony split across four locations.\n\nMilan's iconic San Siro stadium was the primary venue, with elements of the ceremony also taking place in Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo.\n\nDespite concerns over the logistics of a multi-location ceremony, it was an impressive production that went off without a hitch.\n\nTwo Olympic cauldrons were lit - one in Milan and the other in Cortina - with Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli performing a rousing rendition of Nessun Dorma as the torch entered the San Siro.\n\nThat followed a jubilant ending to the athlete's parade, with the Italy team the last to be brought out to huge cheers in all four locations.\n\nFigure skater Lilah Fear was the Great Britain flagbearer in Milan, with bobsledder Brad Hall given that honour in Cortina.\n\nItaly aside, the warmest welcome was reserved for the Ukrainian athletes, while Team USA were also loudly cheered.\n\nBut there were boos when US vice-president JD Vance was shown on the big screen, with negative crowd reactions for the Israel and Georgia teams as well.\n\nBefore the parade, creative director Marco Balich's show was based around the principle of 'armonia' - meaning union, connection, agreement - with \"a narrative aimed at uniting territories, people and values within a shared vision\".\n\nIt featured sections labelled 'Italian beauty' and 'fantasia', with a tribute to fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who died aged 91 in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, American singer Mariah Carey - one of the world's best-selling female artists - was decked out in a sparkling white outfit as she performed a version of Volare.\n\n\"We stand ready to make Olympic history again, inspired by the values that unite all of us: excellence, friendship and respect,\" said Giovanni Malago, president of the organising committee for Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\n\"The co-ordination of so many different bodies in the pursuit of one dream has been a powerful expression of this country's ability to deliver such a complex project.\n\n\"I have never been as proud to be Italian as I am tonight.\"\n\nIt was left to International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry to declare the Games open.\n\nAs the first female IOC president, it is the first time the Olympics have been officially opened by a woman.\n\n\"This is why we all love the Games. Because through you, we see the very best of ourselves,\" she told the athletes.\n\n\"You remind us that we can be brave. That we can be kind. That we can get back up, no matter how hard we fall.\n\n\"The spirit of the Olympic Games is about so much more than sport. It is about us - and what makes us human.\n\n\"This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be, together.\"\n\nWhile events such as curling, figure skating and ice hockey have already begun, the first five gold medals of the Games will be won on Saturday.\n\nAll you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nHow Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear\n\nSnoop Dogg, selfies and a clean sweep for GB curlers\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "My family and I traveled to Rio de Janeiro to watch my daughter win a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics. It was challenging, but incredibly rewarding.",
    "fullText": "My first assignment at the 2016 Summer Olympics was to deliver a package. My second was to find a food mart that sold bottled water.\n\nI wasn't working the event, though. My \"job\" was being the parent of an Olympic athlete.\n\nMy daughter, Gwen Jorgensen, was set to compete in the women's triathlon, and our family had flown from Wisconsin to Rio de Janeiro to support her.\n\nThough we'd watched her compete in London four years prior, she was favored to win this time, putting added pressure on her and our family.\n\nWhen our family arrived at the airport, my first thought wasn't about wandering the city or soaking up the sun on the beach.\n\nInstead, it was about delivering a package to Gwen's hotel room for her coach. (She chose to avoid the Olympic Village this time, and instead stayed in a hotel on Copacabana Beach, within walking distance of the triathlon's start line.)\n\nThen, I was tasked with buying bottled water. When traveling, Gwen avoids ice cubes, tap water, and local foods as a precaution against illness — no churros or rodízio-style meat for her, which the rest of us enjoyed later.\n\nWhen I arrived at her hotel with several gallons, Gwen was so busy that she grabbed the water and rushed me back out the door. I only saw her for a few seconds.\n\nTo be fair, her schedule was packed. That day, in addition to doing three workouts (swimming, biking, and running), she had booked an interview, scheduled a massage, and planned for a nap, the last two of which were necessary to be ready for the biggest race of her life.\n\nOver the next few days, I only saw Gwen for a few minutes at a time, usually to perform a task for her, like picking up energy drinks, clothes, and sunglasses from sponsors, like Red Bull and Oakley.\n\nThe night before the race, I couldn't sleep. My head played a loop of the catastrophes that could ruin a race: a crash, a flat tire, fatigue, heat, or injury. Gwen had experienced them all.\n\nAnd now, there was added pressure from the media to win the USA's first Olympic gold medal in triathlon.\n\nIn the morning, our growing group of friends and family (more supporters had joined us in Rio) gathered in the hotel lobby to walk to Copacabana Beach, where Gwen would begin the race by swimming 1.5 kilometers in the ocean.\n\nOur daughter had received two comped tickets to share with us, and the rest of our group paid for their seats. We sat together in the bleachers, in an area athletes would circle past several times during the 40-kilometer bike ride and 10-kilometer run that followed the swim.\n\nMy heart was pounding as a gunshot signified the beginning of the race and the competitors dove into the water.\n\nTriathlon is a low-profile sport, so there were no TV cameras to record me closing my eyes every time Gwen descended a dangerous, winding hill or cheering as she battled for the lead. I'm doubtful there's any footage of how I hugged my husband and anyone within arm's reach as our daughter crossed the finish line in first place, crying in amazement at her own success.\n\nI tried to remember those moments: Gwen congratulating the other athletes, Gwen embracing her husband and then her coach, Gwen waving at us from the podium with a gold medal around her neck.\n\nI anticipated spending the rest of the day celebrating with my daughter, but it would be hours before we reunited.\n\nAfter the podium, an escort whisked Gwen off for interviews and photos. Meanwhile, I was led to an open-air NBC studio on the beach, where she'd appear later.\n\nWhen Gwen finally arrived, she hugged me, handed me the medal, and was then ushered to a chair for hair and makeup.\n\nAlthough it was mid-afternoon, she hadn't eaten lunch, so her sister fed her bites from a takeout box while professionals aimed a blow dryer at her hair and dabbed foundation on her skin.\n\nAs Gwen got up from the chair, she gave me one more hug and asked if I had any deodorant. She hadn't gotten a chance to shower and was worried she smelled bad. Even gold medalists still need their parents.\n\nAfter the interview, Gwen disappeared once more, saying we wouldn't see her again until 9 p.m. for a celebration at the Team USA House.\n\nAt the party, my family and I heaped appetizers onto our plates and sipped wine, as photos of Gwen and her teammates flashed on giant screens around the room.\n\nEventually, Gwen spoke, thanking those who had invested in her success, including me, my husband, and her sister, acknowledging that her win was only possible because of so many.\n\nI knew she appreciated everything we did, but it made me proud to hear her say it.\n\nMy day ended at midnight, and I barely slept as I replayed the race in my head and anticipated more celebrations to come.\n\nAlthough I've experienced local triathlons and global championships, nothing compares to the Olympics. I was privileged to be behind the scenes, playing a small part in the process.\n\nGwen may have been the favorite, but racing is unpredictable, and wins are never guaranteed.\n\nWhen my daughter's dream came true, I was the one with misty eyes at the ceremonies. Gwen had spent her tears at the finish line, years of pressure finally released.",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn successfully completed her mandatory downhill training run at the Winter Olympics just one week after rupturing her left anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nThe 41-year-old announced on Tuesday that she had suffered the knee injury in a crash, which saw her airlifted to hospital, at the final World Cup race before the Games in Switzerland.\n\nBut Vonn, the Olympic downhill champion in 2010, completed a smooth run at the Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina in one minute 44.33 seconds, 1.39 seconds off the fastest time of the day.\n\nIn a powerful news conference earlier this week, Vonn had expressed her determination to compete in Sunday's downhill race but was unsure whether she would also make it to the team and Super-G events, which take place on 10 and 12 February respectively.\n\nSkiers must complete at least one training run to be able to compete in Sunday's race and will have the option of a second practice run on Saturday.\n\nIn a session heavily delayed because of foggy weather at the top of the course and already postponed from Thursday because of adverse weather conditions, many of the skiers missed gates on what was a soft course.\n\nThat means overall times might look fast but are somewhat deceptive - while missed gates in Sunday's race will result in disqualification.\n\nVonn appeared largely untroubled by her knee, which is supported by a brace, opting for an aggressive line to ensure she did not miss a gate in tough weather conditions and fist bumping compatriot Breezy Johnson after crossing the line.\n\nAfter finishing the run she was asked: \"All good?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" she replied, and walked away having said she would not speak to any media following the session.\n\nHer Norwegian coach and double Olympic gold medallist Aksel Lund Svindal did speak to reporters and said he thinks Vonn still has a chance of winning a medal.\n\n\"From what I saw today I think she can,\" he said.\n\n\"There were reserves today. She looked symmetrical. You've seen earlier this season that when she skis well, she can win. It's going to be hard but I think she could possibly bring that on Sunday.\"\n\nVonn has said that her knee is not swollen or painful and that is why she felt \"confident\" she could compete, posting a video on her Instagram of her doing a barbell squat in the gym on Thursday.\n\nThe four-time world champion was one of the favourites for the gold medal in Cortina prior to her injury and leads the standings in the downhill World Cup.\n\nVonn is aiming for a remarkable comeback having retired from the sport in 2019 before returning in December 2024 following a partial replacement of her right knee.\n\nWhat's happening and when at the Winter Olympics\n\nAll you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nChemmy Alcott, four-time Olympic Team GB skier\n\nIt's fair to say the girls expected a much more substantial base than what they skied on in this training run - there was a lot of head bobbling entering the finish and a bit of a lack of trust.\n\nThat's because of the warm weather - it's kind of like a sugar coating on the top of the slope so they're not getting that confidence or purchase on the outside ski.\n\nFor Vonn, it's fantastic to get the run in and it all came down to experience for her.\n\nShe knows this hill, this is one of her favourite hills and watching her ski with one ACL on that terrain you could tell that she reads the terrain and knows it.\n\nI think it will be a massive confidence boost for her, especially in these conditions where a lot of the other athletes struggled and she delivered a good performance.\n\nThere's things to work on, a few times you could see a bit of backing off on that knee but she successfully skied at 80mph with a torn ACL.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

The ski resort in the Dolomites was previously the host in 1956.\n\nThe competitions will take place in seven different locations in northern Italy as 2,900 athletes will compete for gold, silver, and bronze medals until February 22.\n\nThe main opening ceremony will begin at 8 pm (1900 GMT) in Milan's San Siro stadium. Italian President Sergio Mattarella will officially open the 25th Winter Games with a speech.\n\nThe musical program will feature many prominent figures, such as pop star Mariah Carey and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\nThe traditional athlete parade will also take place in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Predazzo, and Livigno.\n\nAlso for the first time, there's going to be two Olympic cauldrons: one at the Arco della Pace in Milan and another at Piazza Dibona in Cortina.\n\nIt's still unknown who will light them up, but according to media reports Olympic alpine skiing champions Alberto Tomba and Deborah Caompagnoni will take the prestigious task.\n\nSeveral prominent political figures will be in attendance. More than 50 heads of state and government are expected to be at the San Siro.\n\nUS President Donald Trump won't attend the ceremony, but US Vice President JD Vance landed in Milan on Thursday. Germany will be represented by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nThe opening ceremony, as well as the entire Games, will take place under tight security amid fears of attacks and sabotage. More than 6,000 security personnel will be on duty during the event.",

    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics are upon us and Italy is ready - almost - to host 'the greatest show on Earth'.\n\nSome 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on snow and ice over the next 16 days.\n\nThe Games are spread out across hundreds of miles in northern Italy, from fashionable Milan to chic Cortina d'Ampezzo, to the fellow Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.\n\nHere is everything you need to know.\n\nWhy 2026 could be GB's most successful Winter Olympics\n\nWhat's on when? Winter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\nWhile the action began on Wednesday, the Games officially get under way on Friday when the opening ceremony takes place at Milan's iconic San Siro stadium.\n\nA who's who of stars are set to appear, including multiple Grammy Award winner Mariah Carey and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\nGiven the vast distances between the Olympic venue 'clusters', it's not possible for all athletes to be in Milan. But fear not, those based elsewhere will not miss out on the fun.\n\nA second ceremony, including its own Olympic cauldron, will take place in Cortina, while other satellite ceremonies will occur in Predazzo and Livigno.\n\nFigure skater Lilah Fear and bobsleigh pilot Brad Hall have the honour of carrying the Great Britain flag. Fear will do so in Milan, while Hall will be in Cortina.\n\nBBC coverage of the opening ceremony starts from 18:30 GMT, live on BBC Two and iPlayer.\n\nBBC Sport to show 450 hours of Winter Olympics\n\nCould it be that Great Britain - a land of no ice track, Eddie the Eagle and an average of 13 days of snow per year - is becoming a winter sports nation? Whisper it quietly, but the next few weeks could prove it so.\n\nTeam GB's best medal haul from a Winter Games is five - at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 - but UK Sport says up to eight medals could be won this time around.\n\nSo who could be standing on the podium?\n\nTeam GB have two of the best men's skeleton athletes in two-time world champion Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatt. Between them, they won every World Cup gold medal this season.\n\nTake your pick of snowboarders Mia Brookes and Charlotte Bankes, and freestyle skiers Kirsty Muir and Zoe Atkin, as to who could win the nation's first Olympic gold or silver medal on snow.\n\nOn the ice, Lewis Gibson and Lilah Fear - widely seen as the next Torvill and Dean - are very much in with a shout of winning a first British Olympic figure skating medal since 1994, while Britain's curlers look set to add to their two medals from 2022.\n\nGet to know the Team GB Winter Olympics squad\n\nYour Winter Olympics need-to-know guide in six charts\n\nVonn, Gu and Malinin - global stars to follow at Milan-Cortina 2026\n\nFor the first time since the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, a new sport has been added to the Winter Olympic programme.\n\nSki mountaineering - or skimo - will take place in the resort of Bormio and features three medal events: men's and women's sprint, and the mixed relay.\n\nAthletes start by sprinting uphill with adhesive skins on their skis to provide traction. They then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot.\n\nAfter a further uphill section on skis, they remove the skins and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThere are no British athletes competing in skimo at the Games.\n\nA string of new events have also been added to the programme for Milan-Cortina: men's and women's dual moguls, men's and women's luge doubles, men's and women's team alpine combined, women's large hill individual in ski jumping, and the mixed relay team in skeleton.\n\nMilan and Cortina were selected as host cities in 2019 and while existing facilities have largely been used, new venues have been created for ice hockey and the sliding sports.\n\nA year out from the Games starting, the Cortina Sliding Centre - rebuilt on a century-old track at a cost of more than £72m - was facing a race against time to be ready.\n\nWhile that race was won, with the opening races of the bobsleigh and skeleton season taking place on the new track in November, the same cannot be said for the Milano Santagiulia ice hockey stadium.\n\nAs recently as Sunday, Olympic organisers said the stadium would not be completely finished in time for Thursday's first match of the Games - but they were \"absolutely certain\" all scheduled fixtures will be played there.\n\nThe 11,800-capacity stadium has been beset by delays and controversies - including a boycott warning from the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nThe rink in Milan, approved by the International Ice Hockey Federation, is shorter than the minimum requirement in the NHL, leading to suggestions there could be an increase in high-speed collisions. The quality of the ice has also been questioned.\n\nFrom an Olympics controversies perspective, things didn't get any better for hosts Italy when their biathlete Rebecca Passler was kicked out of the Games because of a failed doping test on Monday.\n\nItalian biathlete fails doping test before Olympics\n\nIce hockey venue will not be ready for start of Olympics\n\nAthletes with Russian or Belarusian passports have been banned from many sports since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn September, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it would allow athletes from the two nations to compete at the Winter Games under a neutral flag and strict conditions, as they did at the 2024 summer Olympics.\n\nThose conditions include showing they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military.\n\nIn total, 20 competitors from Russia and Belarus are set to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) at Milan-Cortina across eight sports.\n\nHowever, four of the 13 Russian athletes approved to compete have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThey are figure skater Petr Gumennik, cross-country skiers Savelii Korostelev and Dariya Nepryaeva, and speed skater Kseniia Korzhova.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but stated that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity",

    "fullText": "Snoop Dogg might have taken most of the attention in the Cortina Curling Stadium early on Friday, but Team GB's duo delivered a big-ticket performance of their own to maintain their 100% record in the Winter Olympics mixed doubles.\n\nThe swaggering rap legend - in the high-end Italian mountain resort as a Team USA hype man and \"honorary coach\" - even felt the urge to claim a selfie with Jen Dodds and Bruce Mouat after their fourth win of the competition.\n\n\"He's just asked for a photo with us, so I'm feeling pretty good about myself,\" Mouat told BBC Sport, before Dodds disclosed that Mr Dogg \"said he'd heard about Bruce\".\n\nIf he and Dodds continue this form, he won't be the only one who has.\n\nIt was another day, another victory for last year's world silver medallists; this time the fancied Sweden - who beat them to bronze in 2022 - who were the victims.\n\nThe Scottish duo delivered a display that showed as much gallus as guts, their 7-4 win takes them top of the standings as the only unbeaten team and within touching distance of the semi-finals.\n\nThe curling cognoscenti reckon six wins in the nine round-robin games could be enough to earn a place in Monday's last four, and the GB duo are well on the way.\n\nThey can edge closer when they return to the ice for the fifth time to face South Korea, who have lost all three of their matches, at 13:35 GMT, live on the BBC.\n\nOlympic skater given Minions music permission\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\nMouat has been calling himself all the bad swears during three patchy opening games amid the Dolomite mountains in the north of Italy, but one of the sport's leading lights lifted it against the Swedes.\n\nAnd in Dodds, he has a partner who has been consistently superb so far. Only Sweden's Isabella Wranaa had been statistically better but she was no match here.\n\nWhen Dodds asked her questions, she struggled to find answers. Indeed, at one stage, she battered her brush off the side of the sheet after an errant throw as the sibling bonds between her and partner Rasmus began to fray.\n\n\"The difference was the two girls. Isabella wasn't making shots, but Jen was,\" said BBC Sport pundit Jackie Lockhart.\n\nAt that stage, the GB pair were four points up - a second consecutive night without much sleep after a quick turnaround from Thursday's win over Czech Republic proving no impediment - but the lead was narrowed to 4-3 at the break.\n\nAnother two in the fifth end cleaved open the advantage again before the teams traded points in the next two to leave Sweden needing four in the final end to win.\n\nThey got none, as the end was blanked. A stunning Mouat throw proved decisive, evincing a first-pump from the restrainted Scot and earning him an audience with Snoop moments later.\n\n\"Can you say you won pretty? It was just a lot better from me and happy we're making opponents play tough shots,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nUp in the Italian Alps, snowboarder Txema Mazet-Brown was the first Team GB athlete in action at the Livigno Snow Park.\n\nMaking his Olympic debut, the 19-year-old placed 21st in big air qualifying with a score of 151.75, with only the top 12 progressing to Saturday's final.\n\n\"I'm happy with the riding, it could have been a bit better with the cleanliness of one [run], but not bad overall,\" Mazet-Brown told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Standing up there, you realise that this is one of the biggest events in the world. I'm proud, for sure. You get a little tingling, some butterflies, but that's a good thing - it's really special.\"\n\nMazet-Brown will return to action on 16 February in slopestyle qualifying, an event he says he came to Italy \"more ready\" for.",

    "fullText": "World Skeleton champion Shelley Rudman was the star of Team GB Winter Olympics back in 2006 when she was the only one to return with a medal, creating a fever in her Wiltshire village which is still felt by some today.\n\nAs this year's Winter Olympics kicks off in northern Italy, Rudman said she would never have guessed the lasting legacy that bringing home the silver medal would have on Pewsey, where she was born and still lives.\n\nTwo streets are now named after her, Olympic Road and Silver Road, which she says makes her children very proud.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal, my children love the fact they are named after me,\" Rudman added.\n\nVillagers were invested in her success from the start. They played a key role in fundraising to send her to Turin to compete on the ice, and still proudly remember their involvement.\n\nOne of them being Emma Dainton, who along with Colin Harris, canoed a 35-mile route from Pewsey to Bath along the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nEmma said: \"It was so quiet on the canal until a swan chased us for a while, and we joked about it and we cheered each other on.\"\n\nDuring the Games, Emma was travelling in Australia and watched the heats on TV with her fellow backpackers.\n\n\"I told them all about Shelley and how I was part of her fundraising team and she was from my village,\" she added.\n\nBack at home, nothing could prepare landlord Jerry Kunkler for the world's media and fans cramming into his Moonrakers pub.\n\n\"My phone kept ringing and ringing, all the local and national media wanted to come to the pub, it was all happening.\n\n\"I had to get up early for breakfast TV and was able to talk to Shelley live from Turin. It was a whirlwind,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Games, Shelley was greeted by a champion's welcome when she arrived home.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Nigel Kerton organised an open-top bus parade to travel through the village.\n\nNigel recalls how he phoned a bus company to see if it was possible.\n\n\"I had a dream for this to happen. You see football teams do it after cup finals, so why not for Shelley.\n\n\"It left the train station and we could see the crowds building. There must have been thousands there,\" he added.\n\nShelley said she was in disbelief when she returned home and saw how many people had turned up to cheer her home.\n\n\"There were so many friends from school I recognised and just people I saw around the village,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she will always feel grateful to those that supported her and the strong community that Pewsey still has today.\n\n\"It is just stunning around here, there's a great community spirit. I always appreciate what they did for me,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "fullText": "MILAN — Adrian Livelten hunched over a sewing machine last March on the eve of the men’s ski jumping competition at the Nordic World Ski Championships.\n\nThe suit technician for Norway’s national ski jumping team brazenly made alterations to suits belonging to the country’s two top contenders after those suits had already passed inspection. Livelten did this in plain view of Norway ski jumping head coach Magnus Brevik, seated in a chair halfway across the room.\n\nWhat neither Livelten nor Brevik realized at the time was that someone was recording them in secrecy from behind a curtain, someone who intended to distribute the video far and wide the following day. The damning footage shared by the anonymous whistleblower shook the sport of ski jumping, bringing out into the open the cheating that happened behind closed doors.\n\nWhen officials from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) seized suits belonging to reigning Olympic champion Marius Lindvik and fellow Norwegian Johann André Forfang, they found rules violations that initially went unnoticed during the competition. Stiffer, non-elastic thread had been sewn into the suits to pull down the crotch area during flight, increasing the surface area and creating more aerodynamic lift in a sport where inches can be the difference between medaling and missing the podium.\n\n\"Probably the most shocking part was that it was Norway because they’ve always been considered one of the more standup teams,” said Johnny Spillane, the first American to medal in the sport of Nordic combined, which consists of ski jumping and cross-country skiing. \"Everyone is going to push the limits. That hasn't changed and that probably will never change, but this was deliberately altering a suit after it had been tested in order to cheat. This was the most blatant cheating I've heard of.\"\n\nThe Norway cheating scandal highlighted two irrefutable facts about the crotch-obsessed sport of ski jumping on the precipice of the 2026 Winter Olympics. There is, as Finnish coach Petter Kukkonen put it last April, “a culture of cheating” in ski jumping. And the battleground between unscrupulous teams and rule-upholding regulators is often below the belt.\n\nMale ski jumpers must wear tight-fitting suits that are no more than 4 centimeters larger than their body measurements at any point. Most national teams seek to find every millimeter they can because a bigger, baggier suit catches more wind and provides more lift during flight than a smaller one does.\n\nFittingly, the most advantageous place to enlarge a ski jumper’s suit is the crotch area. Adding just a centimeter of fabric to the circumference of that part of a suit increases flight distance by approximately 2.8 meters — or more than 9 feet — according to a study published by Frontiers in Sports and Active Living in October 2025.\n\nAthletes chasing that competitive advantage have resorted to trickery when having their body dimensions measured prior to a competition. The more they reduce the distance between their inseam and the floor when FIS equipment controllers record their body measurements, the lower regulators will allow the crotch of their suit to hang while airborne.\n\nIn November 2020, Kukkonen told Finland’s leading tabloid newspaper that athletes were stuffing dish cloths and sponges in their underwear during body measuring. In a recent appearance on the Skirious Problems podcast, Austria’s Mika Vermeulen revealed that when he competed in nordic combined earlier in his career, veterans told him before his first body measuring, “It’s very important to tape your c*** back.”\n\nVermeulen later described ski jumpers putting modeling clay in their underwear to lower their crotch-to-floor measurement by five centimeters.\n\n“People used to cheat a f*** ton,” Vermeulen said.\n\nSalacious stories like those were already pushing ski jumping out of the margins and into the mainstream entering these Olympics. Then the German tabloid Bild sparked further curiosity in January when it reported that ski jumpers have worn condom-like sleeves filled with hyaluronic acid to enlarge themselves before measurement.\n\n“When I read that article, all I could do was shake my head,” USA Ski Jumping and Nordic Combined sport director Anders Johnson said. “If that is really what other people were doing previously, I can't believe that that's how far people have taken it.”\n\nOn Thursday, the alleged scandal went to the top of the performance-enhancing food chain when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was asked about it just 24 hours before the Opening Ceremony of the 2026 Olympics.\n\n\"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that [an enlarged crotch area in their suits] could improve performance,” WADA president Witold Banka said. “If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"\n\nCheating in ski jumping isn’t a new phenomenon. Athletes have been pushing boundaries and exploiting loopholes ever since the sport’s governing body began setting rules restricting how far they can fly.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Austrian national team unveiled suits that were highly permeable in the front but did not allow air to pass through in the back. The resulting parachute effect helped Austrian jumpers take gold and silver in the men’s large-hill event at the 1976 Winter Olympics. Seventeen-year-old Austrian prodigy Toni Innauer set a world record the following month and then bettered it two days later.\n\nThe success of those suits inspired copycat attempts, some well-executed, others not so much. Former American ski jumper Jeff Hastings recalls an early 1980s competitor who “put a garbage bag in the back of his suit to try to get the ‘76 Austrian effect.”\n\n“Everybody could hear him up there rustling like crazy,” Hastings said. “It wasn’t even effective but he was just trying to get a little advantage.”\n\nDetailed rules governing the air permeability of ski jumping suits soon went into effect, but that didn’t deter athletes eager to find even the slightest competitive advantage. Retired ski jumpers have admitted to coating the back of their suits with hairspray or slathering on wood glue in an effort to reduce air flow, improve lift and fly longer.\n\n“You name it, people have tried it,” Spillane said.\n\nAs the sport’s deep-pocketed superpowers stopped buying suits from third-party manufacturers and started hiring sophisticated specialists to produce them in-house, new opportunities to cheat have materialized over the past 10-15 years. Teams sought to gain an advantage by creating custom suits for athletes that exceeded their body measurement by as much as possible without resulting in a disqualification.\n\nThe ideal place to add material is where the legs converge, according to Dr. John Goff, visiting physics professor at the University of Puget Sound and author of the book Gold Medal Physics. The crotch area of the suit is naturally stretched wide with a jumper’s legs in a “V” position during flight. It’s also close to the body’s center of gravity, helping an athlete gain lift without sacrificing control.\n\n“The crotch region, where the legs part, is kind of a sharp transition point,” Goff said. “If you can put some kind of material there to smooth that out, you can reduce the turbulence and increase the lift for the skier. That can have a pretty big influence on the flight.”\n\nFor FIS regulators seeking to prevent teams from gaining an advantage, the process starts with athletes stripping down to their underwear. Athletes must have their body dimensions measured before competitions in the presence of an FIS equipment controller, a team official and a qualified doctor or nurse.\n\nSince 2023, those measurements have sometimes been taken with the help of a 3D body scanner. Before then, it was always a manual process. As American Nordic Combined skier and 2018 Olympian Ben Berend once detailed in a blog post, that made the crotch measurement part of this process particularly awkward.\n\n“The process consists of standing with your feet 40 cm apart wearing nothing but underwear,” Berend wrote in 2016. “Then a metal rod is moved up as high as possible until it hits your junk. The measurement is essentially junk to floor in centimeters.”\n\nThe intrusiveness doesn’t end once the measuring process is over. Athletes also must endure what FIS described in a 2023 memo as a “visual crotch area inspection.” A supervising doctor or nurse checks the athlete “for any irregularities in the genital area” — in other words an artificial prosthesis in the athlete’s underwear that could reduce the crotch-to-floor measurement.\n\nAs a result of stories like the ones shared by Kukkonen and Vermeulen, the process is fraught with suspicion that national teams are finding ways to bypass the rules.\n\nA friend recently sent Hastings a screenshot of one of the world’s top-ranked ski jumpers in mid-flight last year.\n\n“The crotch on his suit practically came down to his knees,” Hastings said. “I’m exaggerating a little bit, but it looked like he had a diaper on.”\n\nBetween suspicious images like that one, unconfirmed gossip about which teams were cheating and the knowledge of how much difference a little extra fabric can make, Johnson admits it creates a toxic culture.\n\n“If one team starts cheating, then two or three start doing it,” Johnson said. “Once you have the best nations in the world doing it, then everyone kind of has to follow suit. It just spreads like wildfire and then once it does, it’s really hard to get back.”\n\nThe chicanery mostly occurred in secret until the anonymous whistleblower shined a spotlight on Norway’s dishonesty and turned the birthplace of ski jumping into a symbol for everything wrong with the sport. Austria, Slovenia and Poland filed formal protests against the Norwegians during the World Championships and called for their results to be annulled.\n\n“This is doping, just with a different needle,” former German Olympic champion Jens Weissflog told the German newspaper Bild at the time.\n\nLindvik and Forgang claimed ignorance, insisting they never would have jumped had they known their suits were rigged. When their coaches backed them, the Norwegian ski jumpers received suspensions of just three months, enabling them to return in time for the 2025-26 World Cup season and the Olympics, where the men’s competition begins on Feb 9.\n\nThe penalty was harsher for Livelten, Brevik and Norway assistant coach Thomas Lobben, each of whom confessed to being part of the conspiracy. On January 15, an independent ethics panel backed the FIS’s request for a punishment strong enough to serve as a deterrent against future cheating, suspending the trio for 18 months apiece.\n\n“In (the panel’s) view, now is indeed the appropriate time to put down a clear marker to what is not acceptable,” the panel’s scathing ruling read.\n\nFor many in American ski jumping circles, the Norway cheating scandal entangled close friends. In 2022, USA Ski Jumping signed a formal partnership with the Norwegian national team for the current Olympic cycle to hold joint training camps and coaching clinics and to collaborate on sports science.\n\nWhile Johnson doesn’t condone what Norway did, he also bristles at how the Norwegians have become “the scapegoat for a much broader issue within our sport.”\n\n“There has been a lot of hypocrisy from other nations,” Johnson said. “I don’t have any personal beef with any of these teams, but it was incredibly disappointing for me to see the response from some of the nations. I think everyone needs to take a look at themselves in the mirror. No one can say they were fully clean. They can only claim they are because they didn’t get caught.”\n\nEmbarrassed by the Norway scandal, FIS has since hired new equipment control coordinators and introduced sweeping reforms for the 2025-26 season. The changes include increased use of 3D scanners for pre-event body measurements, more precisely defined rules for how suits can be cut and shaped and more training for equipment controllers who oversee pre- and post-jump inspections.\n\nHarsher sanctions can now be issued for rules violations during 3D measurement or for the manipulation of a suit after it has passed inspection. Athletes disqualified for an equipment violation during a competition will receive a yellow card. A further transgression will result in a red card and suspension from the following event.\n\nTo Johnson and many others in the ski jumping community, the most notable change is one that has gone unmentioned in any FIS press release.\n\nIn the past, Johnson found that “it was much easier for FIS to discard or disqualify athletes from smaller nations because they didn’t have that political pull in the sport.” This year, highly ranked jumpers from prominent nations have been cited for equipment violations, athletes like Slovenia’s Timi Zajc, who was tied for second place at an event in Germany earlier this winter when he was disqualified for suit violation.\n\n“This year, it doesn’t seem to matter if you’re from Austria or Slovenia or Poland or the United States,” Johnson said. They’re enforcing the rules for everyone.”\n\nAs the world’s top ski jumpers prepare to showcase their talents on the Olympic stage this month, the obvious question is whether the competition will be fair. Will the threat of stricter rules and tougher punishments be enough to deter cheaters? Or will the pursuit of Olympic glory tempt some countries to try to skirt the rules?\n\n“Going into this Olympics, I have a lot more faith and trust in the system,” Johnson said, “but I still have my reservations that teams are really going to be in compliance, that they’re not going to be trying something new.”",

    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "title": "Winter Olympics 2026: How Milan Cortina Games will make history with two cauldron lightings at Opening Ceremony",
    "description": "For the first time in Olympics history, there will be two cauldrons at the Opening Ceremony.",
    "fullText": "History will be made at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics. During the Opening Ceremony Friday, Olympic torches will be used to light two separate cauldrons, the first time that's ever happened in the history of the event.\n\nThe lightings, which will take place simultaneously, will occur in two separate locations. One is located in Milan at the Arco della Pace. The second is located in Cortina d’Ampezzo in Piazza Dibona. Olympic organizers decided on two cauldrons as a way to show harmony and unity between both host cities of the 2026 Olympics.\n\nThe cauldrons are meant to evoke the work of Leonardo da Vinci, particularly his knots, which appeared in his paintings and manuscripts.\n\nWhile Olympic organizers have not announced the exact time the cauldrons will be lit, it will likely occur near the end of the Opening Ceremony, which will start at 2 p.m. ET and run for roughly three hours. That should result in the cauldrons being lit in the final 30-45 minutes of the Opening Ceremony on Friday.\n\nOlympic organizers tend to keep details about the Opening Ceremony a secret, so there's been no official announcement on who was chosen to light the two Olympic cauldrons Friday.\n\nTypically, the host country chooses current or former Olympic athletes for the honor. At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, French track and field star Marie-José Pérec, who won three gold medals during her career, was one of the two people selected to light the cauldron. The other was French judo gold medalist Teddy Riner, who also won three gold medals during his Olympic career.\n\nDuring the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, skier Zhao Jiawen and cross-country skier Dilnigar Ilhamjan were chosen for the honor. Both athletes took part in the 2022 Olympics, though did not medal in their events.\n\nItaly could turn to skiers Deborah Compagnoni and Alberto Tomba for the honor if it wanted to highlight successful Olympians from the past. Compagnoni and Tomba each won three gold medals at the Winter Olympics during their careers. Neither were selected to carry the torch leading up to the cauldron lightings, so it's possible organizers are saving Compagnoni and Tomba for this moment.\n\nThe Milan Cortina Opening Ceremony will take place Friday, Feb. 6, at roughly 2 p.m. ET. It will be 8 p.m. in Italy when the Opening Ceremony kicks off. The entire event is expected to take roughly three hours and will feature a parade of athletes from each country, as well as performances by Mariah Carey, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and Italian actor Sabrina Impacciatore.\n\nThe event will stream live on Peacock at 2 p.m. ET, and will be aired in primetime on NBC at 8 p.m. ET.",

    "fullText": "MILAN — A team full of star power, the United States women got a balanced attack, including two goals from their 13th forward and a hard-working goal from their fourth line, as the Americans opened the 2026 Olympics with a 5-1 win against the Czech Republic, also known as Team Czechia.\n\nIn just 6:45 of ice time, Hayley Scamurra scored two goals and fourth-liner Joy Dunne scored her first career Olympic goal as the United States rolled. Czech goalie Klára Peslarová was tested early and often, making 37 saves on 42 shots, while Aerin Frankel stopped all but one of the 14 shots she faced.\n\nThe game was played with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in attendance with his wife and kids, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Vance stood up and cheered for five American goals scored by Scamurra, Dunne, Alex Carpenter and Hilary Knight.\n\nCarpenter and Tessa Janecke each had two points. Defender Laila Edwards had an assist in her first-ever Olympic hockey game and became the first Black woman to play for the U.S. at an Olympic women’s hockey tournament.\n\nCzechia next plays Friday against Switzerland, while the Americans are at least scheduled to play Finland on Saturday.\n\nFinland’s game against Canada on Thursday was postponed until Feb. 12 due to a norovirus outbreak on the Finnish team. Thirteen players were quarantined at the athletes’ village after being either stricken by or exposed to the virus.\n\nUSA GM Katie Million said the IOC hasn’t given direction yet as to whether Saturday’s game will go on as scheduled, but there is a medical meeting scheduled for Thursday night and they hope more information will be shared.\n\nHeading into Thursday’s game, only Hockey Hall of Fame forwards Jayna Hefford and Hayley Wickenheiser had scored in five Winter Olympics. We can now add Hilary Knight, who is playing in her fifth and final Olympics, to that list.\n\nHer goal was a beauty as she took Carpenter’s pass in the neutral zone, lowered her shoulders and outhustled the defender to the net for her first goal of the tournament and to give Team USA a 4-1 lead.\n\nIt was Knight’s 13th goal at the Olympics, which puts her just one off the United States record held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. It was also her 28th point — four away from Jenny Potter’s all-time record.\n\nThe goal came after coach John Wroblewski tweaked the lines from the United States’ four Rivalry Series wins. He cited chemistry as the big reason he added Hannah Bilka to the top line alongside Carpenter and Knight; all three play together on a line for the PWHL Seattle Torrent. Britta Curl-Salemme was also moved up to the second line with Minnesota Frost teammate Taylor Heise and Abbey Murphy, while Janecke moved from first-line left wing to fourth-line center.\n\nAfter Wednesday’s practice, Wroblewski spoke about Joy Dunne and how it was only a matter of time that Dunne scored for Team USA.\n\nTo fact check the coach: Dunne has scored in a U.S. jersey, at the 2024 women’s world championship in Utica, but the point still stands. That it was only a matter of time before she found the back of the net in Milan.\n\nDunne is a player Wroblewski felt really earned her roster spot on the Olympic team through the little details of her game. She has size (5-foot-11) and incredible compete. She wins puck battles and she’s strong on the back check.\n\nSo even though she hadn’t scored since 2024, Wroblewski saw her as a valuable player to have on this talented roster — and someone to watch.\n\nThe goal came off a sweet setup from Janecke – the first of two goals in 1:23 as the Americans quickly turned a 1-0 lead into 3-0 to seize control.\n\nTwo minutes after taking an interference penalty on Edwards, Czech forward Barbora Jurickova jumped out of the penalty box to score Czechia’s lone goal of the game.\n\nJurickova, who started the game as the Czech’s 13th forward, skated in alone against Frankel with all five American power-play players pushing into the zone. As their time on the advantage expired, Abbey Murphy had a shot blocked and, on a beautiful play, Natálie Mlýnková spotted Jurickova coming out of the box.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nToronto Sceptres, Minnesota Frost, Vancouver Goldeneyes, New York Sirens, Montreal Victoire, Ottawa Charge, Seattle Torrent, Boston Fleet, NHL, Olympics, Women's Hockey, Women's Olympic Ice Hockey, Olympics, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

However, they will be spending the next few weeks without one of their best players, Junior forward Joy Dunne. Dunne is in Italy right now, playing for Team USA at the Winter Olympics. And she is making the most of her time away from Columbus.\n\nIn Team USA's first game, a Group A round robin match against Czechia, Dunne picked up her first ever Olympic goal in her first ever Olympic game. Dunne's opportunity was created by Tessa Janecke (who currently plays for Penn State), who stole the puck in the offensive zone. Her push to the goal was turned away, but she got the puck behind the net before finding a slashing Dunne on a perfect centering pass. Dunne slammed the puck home for an easy goal and a 2-0 Team USA lead.\n\nTWO GOALS IN 83 SECONDS.

    "fullText": "All eyes are on Milan and Cortina as the 2026 Winter Olympics get underway. However, not all the news has been positive in the lead up to these Olympics, as frustrating construction issues have caused massive headaches around the rink set to host the men's and women's hockey tournaments.\n\nBack in December 2025, news broke that the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena was beset by construction issues that delayed tests of the rink. Originally, the rink was supposed to house Olympic-sized ice, but reports then surfaced that the arena will have an ice surface smaller than NHL standard, which is already smaller than the international dimensions. Not only that, there was reportedly no Plan B if the arena wasn't ready in time, which meant work had to be done around the clock to get Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena up and running.\n\nThen in January 2026, just a few short weeks away from the Olympics, reports surfaced that while the playing surface, practice facilities and dressing rooms were finished, other parts of the arena might not be done in time. The arena also is set to house fewer people than expected, as original plans had 16,000 seats in the arena while the latest count sits at 11,800 seats.\n\nThe doom and gloom over Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena's construction certainly cast a pall over the start of the Olympic festivities. However, based on recent reports, it seems as if things have fallen into place for the arena. The NHL was reportedly pleased by the mid-January ice test and members of the French team have since taken to the rink to practice with no glaring issues. French captain Pierre-Édouard Bellemare told The Associated Press that skating \"feel[s] like you're on a lake a little bit\" but overall the verdict was \"not bad\" even if some final touches still needed to be done.\n\nOf course, once fans get into the arena and more players and media begin to arrive, it's possible other issues arise or are brought to light. For now though, it seems as if the arena will be up and running to house the hockey tournaments this February.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: The Milan Cortina Olympic hockey arena issues, explained",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva's former coach is back at the Winter Olympics, this time working with a Georgian athlete, and the World Anti-Doping Agency isn't happy about it.\n\nWADA president Witold Banka said Thursday at the Milan Cortina Games that he's not comfortable with Eteri Tutberidze’s presence at the competition. She is accredited with Georgia as the coach of European champion Nika Egadze.\n\nValieva, then aged 15, was at the center of a legal battle during the 2022 Beijing Games when a sample she gave two months earlier tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine. The revelation came after Valieva won team gold with other Russian skaters. She was later disqualified from that event, which upgraded the United States to gold. Valieva was a contender for the women’s gold medal but placed fourth and was criticized rink-side by Tutberidze.\n\n“It’s not our decision the coach is here,” Banka said Thursday at a news conference in Milan. “The investigation found no evidence that this particular person was engaged in this doping process, so there’s no legal basis to exclude her from the presence during the Olympic Games.”\n\n“But of course, if you ask me personally about my feelings,” he continued, “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here in the Olympic Games, for sure.”\n\nThe Georgian Figure Skating Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nValieva's ban expired in December, despite legal efforts to have it overturned.\n\nRules have been changed to raise the minimum age for skaters to 17 in time for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

It was just not our time this year, but very well could have been.\n\n\"We have qualified for the World Championships in the relay so will be looking to make amends there in March.\"",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds built on their opening Winter Olympics mixed doubles curling win as a stunning four-point haul in the penultimate end secured victory over Estonia in Cortina.\n\nThe Team GB duo - who beat Norway in their opener on Wednesday - were kept honest by the Estonian debutants, but their class ultimately told in the latter stages to force an early end to the contest and a 10-5 triumph.\n\n\"We've played them a lot and knew we'd have to step up our performance from last night and we did that,\" Dodds told BBC Sport.\n\nThe GB duo will have a few hours off before facing the Czech Republic in their third round-robin game at 18:05 GMT on Thursday - live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\n\"We probably only got five or six hours sleep last night, so a nap is needed this afternoon,\" Dodds added.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nGB started with the hammer, took two in accomplished first end, and looked like they might enjoy a comfortable start to the day in Italy.\n\nEstonia responded by doing the same, though, after a slight Dodds error with her last stone. \"Sorry, Bruce,\" said the 34-year-old, who was slightly errant again with her opening rock of the third end.\n\nBut Dodds, peerless against Norway, righted herself to deliver a magnificent final store and restore GB's two-point advantage.\n\nThe Estonians should have pulled level again, but a Marie Kaldvee mistake ensured they still trailed at the break. \"It's been a bit of back and forth,\" was how 2022 Olympic gold medallist Vicky Wright described it.\n\nKaldvee was slack again upon the resumption and Mouat - fuelled by an interval munch of mango - delivered with GB's final stone to extend the advantage to 6-3 with three ends remaining.\n\nEstonia - who overcame a four-point deficit in the final end against Switzerland in their opener - employed their powerplay in the sixth and moved back within one after capitalising on a rare Mouat error.\n\nGB played their own powerplay in response and made full use of it, a furious double sweep by both Mouat and Dodds earning a decisive four points after some deliberation with the measuring stick.\n\nThat opened up a five-point chasm, which persuaded the Estonians to shake hands and concede defeat with an end to spare.\n\n\"That was better from me today. I had a few that slipped up, but I called myself a bad word, and moved on,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We're very happy with how we're performing and excited to get GB off on the right foot.\"\n\nHow Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear\n\nGB skeleton team appeal after new helmet shape ruled out",

This discrepancy exists because the IOC allows certain territories and dependencies to compete as independent entities, even if they lack full United Nations representation. For instance, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico send their own distinct Olympic delegations rather than competing as part of the United States.\n\nMORE: Inside the venues for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics\n\nThe IOC suspended Russia and Belarus from the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, but 12 athletes from those countries will still compete.

    "description": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympics athlete, you pick yourself up and try again.",
    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training; when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "fullText": "Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris crashed on Wednesday night and had to be stretchered off the course during big air training ahead of the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nIt's unclear what happened exactly, but the Canadian snowboard team described the crash as “heavy” in a statement. Specifics of McMorris' condition are not yet known, either.\n\n“Snowboarder Mark McMorris had a heavy crash this evening during big air training,” the team said in a statement on social media. “Canadian Olympic Committee and Canada Snowboard staff are attending to him. We will provide more information as it becomes available.”\n\nThe 32-year-old is making his fourth Olympic appearance for Canada. Qualifying for the big air competition is set for Thursday night, one day before the Opening Ceremony. It’s unknown if McMorris will be able to compete anymore.\n\nMcMorris has won three bronze medals in his Olympics career. He claimed third in slopestyle in each of the past three Olympics, and he finished in 10th in the big air competition in both the PyeongChang Olympics in 2018 and the Beijing Olympics in 2022. He has won four of his 12 X Games gold medals in the big air competition, too, which was only added to the Olympics in 2018. In the big air competition at the Olympics, riders take off from a ramp that is more than 165 feet tall.\n\nMcMorris, per the CBC, suffered life-threatening injuries after he slammed into a tree during a backcountry ride in 2017. That resulted in him having a rod placed in his leg, a plate in his arm and another plate in his jaw. Despite that and other significant injuries, McMorris said last month that he felt he was in good health entering these Games.\n\nThe men’s big air final is set for Saturday night at the Livigno Snow Park. Qualification for the men’s slopestyle will start on Monday, Feb. 16.",

I'm a woman,\" she told CNN. \"I want to live my life. Please do not exploit me in your political agendas.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump last year referred to Khelif as a \"male boxer\" after he had signed an executive order that prevents transgender women from competing in female categories of sports.\n\nA new body, World Boxing, was granted provisional recognition as the sport's international governing federation by the IOC in February 2025.\n\nIt has introduced mandatory genetic tests for athletes to \"determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete\".\n\nWhen announcing the change, it cited Khelif - and later apologised for that.\n\nKhelif lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) over World Boxing's introduction of mandatory tests in August.\n\nA hearing on that case is still pending.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds overcame a power cut and the loss of the first end to get Team GB's Winter Olympics off to a winning start in the mixed doubles curling against Norway.\n\nThe Scottish duo, who are considered serious medal contenders in this event, cut relaxed figures inside the quirky, partially-wooden Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium in Italy, which was built for the 1956 Games.\n\nEven the loss of light in parts of the venue during an ugly opening end didn't discomfit last year's world silver medallists, who took three in the second end and would never trail again in the first of their nine round-robin matches.\n\nMouat and Dodds ultimately won 8-6 to right the wrongs of the 2022 semi-final, in which they spurned a lead to lose to the Norwegian pair before going on to be beaten by Sweden in the bronze-medal match.\n\nAnd it sets them up nicely for Thursday's ties against Estonia (09:05 GMT) and the Czechs (18:05) - both of whom lost their openers - live across the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nThe pounding music and disco lights lent a sense of occasion to the first action of this year's Games in the high-end Italian resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nThe snow which had hammered down all day in the Dolomites had turned to sleet by the time the four matches started in front of a healthy crowd inside the 3,500-capacity arena.\n\nBut many of those spectators were cast into darkness for four or five minutes early on until someone put some change in the meter, the scoring screens flickered back into life and play resumed.\n\n\"I didn't mind the lights going off,\" said Mouat. \"It was a bit of a boogie, a rave... it was like a nightclub.\"\n\nWhen the dancing stopped, Norway's husband and wife team of Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien initially took control before the sides fell into a cagey contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds seized the initiative in a splendid second end - the final accounting reached after some lengthy deliberation with the measuring stick - and led 4-3 at the break after edging a tight fourth against the 2002 silver medallists.\n\nThe interval did check the momentum of the childhood friends a little, as Norway - who also won bronze in 2018 - drew level again.\n\nNedregotten's flawless play was keeping Norway in it - wife Skaslien's struggles threatening a little domestic disharmony - but even his efforts could not prevent Team GB snatching three in the sixth end thanks to a stunning Dodds throw.\n\nThat opened a three-shot lead with two ends to play.\n\nAnd, although the Norwegians invoked the powerplay to cut the deficit to one, Mouat and Dodds did likewise in the last end to close out a statement 8-6 win.\n\n\"It took us a bit of time to work out one end was curling more than the other, but once we did we took a step up in performance and took control from there,\" Dodds said.\n\n\"It's a good confidence builder to start the week.\"",

    "description": "The \"Today\" anchor stepped away from Milano Cortina coverage as her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, remains missing",
    "fullText": "Sports commentator and former tennis player Mary Carillo will replace Savannah Guthrie as co-host of the NBC’s Opening Ceremony for the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games after the “Today” host pulled out, following her mother’s disappearance.\n\nGuthrie had been originally scheduled to host the Opening Ceremony with Terry Gannon, who will remain on. Ahmed Fareed will now host “Olympic Late Night” from Feb. 7 to 9, replacing Craig Melvin.\n\nMelvin will remain stateside rather than traveling to Milan for the Games.\n\n“Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family. They continue to have our full support,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented commentators who will step in and fill these roles.”\n\n“Mary is one of the most experienced Olympic commentators ever and a master storyteller,” she added. “She and Terry will lead the American audience through one of the world’s greatest global moments. With his skill and versatility, Ahmed has proven time and again he can step into any hosting role, and we’re thrilled he’s available to handle our late night coverage before heading to Los Angeles for NBA All-Star Weekend.”\n\nThe Milan Games will be Carillo’s 17th Olympics that she has covered — she was already scheduled to be a correspondent in Milan. Of Italian descent herself, the commentator has a personal connection with the host city. This year will be her 14th Olympic assignment with NBC.\n\nAs previously announced, Shaun White will join the Opening Ceremony commentators in the booth during the Parade of Athletes. Following her Opening Ceremony duties, Carillo will cover the Games as a SportsDesk reporter.\n\nGuthrie’s 84-year-old mother Nancy has been missing since late Saturday night. The case has escalated from a missing-person to a suspected abduction with authorities saying they found signs of forced entry in her Arizona home.\n\nLive coverage of the Opening Ceremony begins Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, with primetime coverage scheduled for 8 p.m. ET/PT on both NBC and Peacock.\n\nThe post NBC Sports Taps Mary Carillo to Fill In for Savannah Guthrie at Winter Olympics appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - have been told their helmets do not meet safety standards only days out from the competition starting.\n\nThe British team have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for sport (Cas) after the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) said the helmets \"did not comply with the IBSF skeleton rules based on its shape\".\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) said the helmet was designed with safety in mind.\n\nThe team would currently not be able to wear the helmets in competition, but the Cas ruling will be heard on Thursday, with the result expected on Friday, before competition begins on 12 February.\n\nThe British skeleton team enjoyed a successful 2024-25 season, with Matt Weston winning overall World Cup gold and Marcus Wyatt silver, winning all seven races between them.\n\nThat success came using a different helmet, and the BBSA told BBC Sport the helmet it had hoped to use for the Games in Italy is a new design for the 2026-27 season, which begins towards the end of the year.\n\nIt said it has tried to be \"innovative\" with the new design, which it believes to \"be in the current rules\".\n\nIt said the new helmet has been designed to comply with new rules imposed by the IBSF for the 2026-27 season, which are aimed at improving safety, and that it is proven to be safer than any other helmets being used.\n\nThe rules set out the safety standards helmets must meet and have stipulations about the shape. For example, the helmet must not have any additionally attached aerodynamic elements.\n\nThe team wore the new helmets last week at a training session in Switzerland but have also brought the old helmets to Cortina.\n\nAt the 2010 Games the USA and Canada lodged a protest moments after British slider Amy Williams won the gold medal, alleging the small ridges on her helmet were illegal, but the protest was thrown out.\n\nAt the 2018 Games British medallists Lizzy Yarnold, Laura Deas and Dom Parsons wore specialised skin suits featuring drag-resistant ridges, the legality of which was also questioned by rival teams.\n\nWeston is the heavy favourite for the gold medal in Cortina, with the men's event beginning on 12 February and the women's on 13 February.\n\nLizzy Yarnold, two-time British skeleton Olympic champion\n\nThere will always be a different kit which is being worked on - whether it's the helmets, the sled, the suits itself - they will all go through a process of making sure that they abide by the rules and it's the best kit possible for the athletes.\n\nI think there's always likely to be noise around equipment. The British team wore this helmet in Switzerland last week, so it's not a hidden thing.\n\nBut the noise around it is almost very anticipated, because whenever you bring in new equipment it has to go through the process of being checked.\n\nWhether there is an element of gamesmanship having a new helmet, I don't think that is at play.\n\nI don't know whether the athletes will have a preference on which helmet they use but they know they are performing well and can still perform well with the old helmet.\n\nThey will be happy with all of the different versions of equipment, so their role is simply just focusing on the matter at hand.",

And it's all thanks to you.\n\n\"I'm so happy to see that the Minions hitting Olympic ice is becoming real again!\"\n\nThe routine in Sabate's short program - the first of two routines in singles figure skating - has proved a hit in competitions, including in Sheffield at this year's European Figure Skating Championships, where he finished 18th but became a fan favourite.\n\nSabate, a six-time Spanish champion set to make his Olympic debut in Milan, said he followed all required procedures and submitted the music through the International Skating Union's (ISU) ClicknClear system in August.\n\nIf he is unable to perform to the Minions mix, he may use music by the Bee Gees for his short program, as this was the routine he performed to in 2024-25.\n\nThe men's event starts in Milan on Tuesday.\n\n\"As soon as we have more details on this specific case, we will share them as appropriate,\" read an ISU statement.\n\n\"Copyright clearances can represent a challenge for all artistic sports.\"\n\nWhat’s happening when at the Winter Olympics?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Olympics stand as the most prestigious sporting event worldwide.\n\nEvery two years, athletes from hundreds of nations gather in a single location, alternating between summer and winter Games. They compete for medals and national pride, pushing the world's top competitors.\n\nItaly is honored to host the 2026 Winter Olympics from February 6 to February 22. This will be Italy's fourth time hosting the Olympics and its first since 2006.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2026 Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nMORE: Who are the biggest USA Olympic hockey snubs?\n\nThe 2026 Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo has previously hosted the Olympics, but only the Summer Games. This is the first time Milan is hosting the Olympics, and it is also Cortina d'Ampezzo's first time hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nHere's a list of each time Italy has hosted the Olympics:\n\nMilan and Cortina d'Ampezzo host 15 Olympic venues. Below is a full list of the sports scheduled at each location.\n\nMilano San Siro Olympic Stadium\n\nMilano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nCortina Curling Olympic Stadium\n\nCurling, wheelchair curling, Paralympic closing ceremony\n\nAlpine skiing, para alpine skiing\n\nTesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium\n\nCross-country skiing, Nordic combined, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing\n\nAlpine skiing, ski mountaineering\n\nOlympic closing ceremony, Paralympic opening ceremony\n\nThe time difference can significantly affect viewers wanting to watch the Olympic Games. Fortunately, the Winter Games pose less of a challenge for those in the Eastern Time Zone. Italy is six hours ahead of EST and nine hours ahead of Pacific Time.\n\nThe 2021 Tokyo Olympics experienced a harsh 14-hour time difference, making viewing difficult. In contrast, the 2026 Games will be more accessible for U.S. fans to watch live without disrupting their sleep routines.\n\nMORE: When will the Olympics be in USA?\n\nHosting the Olympic Games is a great honor, but it comes with high costs. The organizers of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics have announced an operating budget of approximately \"1.7 billion euros\" ($1.9 billion).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will provide approximately $1 billion in extra funding for the February 6-22 Games. At the same time, the Italian government is investing over $1 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance access to the venues.\n\nAlthough this appears substantial, Russia reportedly invested $51 billion to host the 2014 Sochi Games, a cost that is expected to remain an Olympic record for many years to come.\n\nThe Milano Cortina Olympics will welcome thousands of athletes from across the world for the 2026 Winter Games. They'll stay in one of the six Olympic Villages spread across northern Italy.\n\nThe locations include Milan, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo, Anterselva (Antholz), and Cortina.\n\nIt is said that after the games, some villages will be converted into student housing.",

    "fullText": "Sam Bennett may have been the most notable snub from Team Canada's Olympic hockey roster.\n\nTurns out, the Florida Panthers star will be playing in the Olympics anyway.\n\nBennett was added to the roster as an injury replacement on Tuesday. The Lightning's Anthony Cirelli was hurt in the Stadium Series game on Sunday and will have to miss the tournament.\n\nBennett was just injured, too, but TSN's Darren Dreger says it was \"nothing serious.\" The news of Bennett as a replacement for Cirelli, and no announcement about the Panthers' injured Brad Marchand, may be a good sign for Marchand's chances of also suiting up at the Olympics.\n\nMORE: How Connor McDavid is to the Oilers what Josh Allen is to the Bills\n\nCirelli, as a faceoff guy and penalty-killing type, had a very specific role for the Canadian team. Bennett fits that pretty well, and he does bring a type of grit that Cirelli also has.\n\nBennett is a winner. He has been a part of back-to-back Stanley Cup championships with the Panthers. He was also on Canada's victorious 4 Nations Faceoff team.\n\nAt 29 years old, this may have been Bennett's best chance of making an Olympic team.\n\nThis season in 55 games with the Panthers, Bennett has 19 goals, 23 assists and 101 blocks shots.\n\nMORE: How Olympic roster freeze may create a second NHL trade deadline\n\nTeam Canada squeezed Bennett off the initial roster because it decided to keep both Bo Horvat and Nick Suzuki on the initial roster.\n\nHopefully, Bennett didn't make any plans for the Olympic break. Because after it was in doubt, he has some hockey to be played and a gold medal to chase.\n\nBilly Heyen is a freelance writer with The Sporting News.

I have been working really hard to come into these Games in a much different position,\" she said in a media conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"I know what my chances were before the crash and I know that my chances aren't the same as it stands now, but I know there is still a chance.\n\n\"As long as there is a chance, I'll try. That's where I am.\"\n\nThe four-time world champion retired from the sport in 2019 but made a stunning comeback in December 2024 following a partial replacement of her right knee.\n\nShe arrived in Cortina at the top of the World Cup downhill standings, with two race wins and three more podium finishes, and as one of the favourites for the gold medal.",

So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"\n\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein prior to his death in custody in 2019.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said in a statement obtained by news agency AFP.\n\nHe also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Epstein\".\n\n\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" Wasserman said.\n\n\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nWhile the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Wasserman, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with the influential financier.\n\nThe BBC has approached Wasserman for comment.\n\nWasserman founded a sports and entertainment agency in 2002, and is a trustee of the non-profit Clinton Foundation, according to the Olympics website.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell agreed last month to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.\n\nThe committee also summoned both former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify.\n\nThe former president appeared in photographs with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.\n\nEpstein, who was convicted of sexual offences in 2008, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn’s status for the Winter Olympics is uncertain. While competing in her final downhill event before the upcoming world competition, Vonn crashed on the course and had to be airlifted to a nearby facility for treatment.\n\nThe skier lost control while attempting to land a jump during a World Cup downhill event, becoming tangled in the safety nets lining the course. When Vonn was able to get up, she was limping and favoring her left knee, using her poles to steady herself.\n\nHere are the latest injury updates for Vonn following her crash while preparing for the Winter Olympics.\n\nMORE: When do the Winter Olympics start\n\nVonn released a statement on her Instagram. She said, \"I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams. This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics...but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over. I will give more information when I have it. It's not over until it's over.\"\n\nVonn, as expected, did not race in Saturday's Super-G race. Her skiing coach, Chris Knight texted the Associated Presssaying that Vonn \"is preparing for Cortina as usual.\" Vonn herself posted on Instagram, announcing her withdrawal from the Super-G race and said that she is \"doing my best right now...\"\n\nThe U.S. Ski team also released a statement on Friday, backing up Vonn. \"Lindsey Vonn crashed in today's Cras Montana World Cup downhill and injured her left knee, however her Olympic dream isn't over yet.\"\n\nVonn had been running the fastest time at the first checkpoint before her injury. She landed a jump off-balance, then lifted her left arm and pole to try to regain her balance, and tried to brake. This caused her to be spun around, and she ended up in the nets.\n\nReports suggest that Vonn had an \"anxious expression\" and had a long embrace with teammate Jacquelin Wiles before going into the medical tent for treatment.\n\nMORE: Why were \"Heated Rivalry\" stars chosen as Winter Olympic torchbearers?\n\nVonn was competing in her final downhill competition before the Winter Olympics. She had gone over a jump, but didn't land correctly. Vonn was trying to regain her balance, but ended up spinning out and sliding down the course. Unable to control herself, she slid hard into the protective netting in what looked like a bad crash.\n\nWishing Lindsey Vonn a speedy recovery following her crash in Crans-Montana ❤️ pic.twitter.com/hZ6PcPVvW3\n\n— TNT Sports (@tntsports) January 30, 2026\n\nAfter being checked by medical personnel, Vonn was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nHere is video confirmation of Lindsey Vonn being airlifted to the hospital after her crash.\n\nHeartbreaking. #FISAlpine | #WorldCupCransMontanapic.twitter.com/Ck2oNc9lff\n\n— Team USA Olympics Updates and Coverage (@TeamUSAOLYCov) January 30, 2026\n\nVonn was also not the only one to crash. Three different competitors crashed, including Vonn.  Austria's Nine Ortlieb and Norway's Marte Monsen also crashed. Ortlieb crashed in the same area as Vonn, and Monsen nearly made it to the end before crashing into the nets and had to be taken away in a sled.\n\nFrench skier Romaine Miradoli completed her run, but said that the snow falling caused bad visibility issues. She said, \"You can't see, and it's bumpy everywhere.\" When pressed further and asked if the course was dangerous, Miradoli responded, \"We just couldn't see well.\"\n\nThe event was cancelled after Vonn's crash, per the AP.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team USA winter Olympic hockey team\n\nVonn was checked by the onsite medical team, but further evaluation was needed, especially given her knee favoring. Due to winter conditions and snow, she was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nMORE: Meet the USA Olympic figure skating team for the Winter Olympics\n\nThe International Ski and Snowboard Federation CEO Urs Lehmann told reporters, \"I know she hurt her knee, I talked to her. I don’t know if it’s really heavy and (if) she won’t miss the Olympics. Let’s wait for what the doctors are saying.”\n\nVonn's first scheduled event is the women's downhill on February 8.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team Canada's Winter Olympic team\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics are set for Friday, February 6.

    "description": "Olympics fans can expect a unique dual-city setting, new events and even a new sport, and more TV coverage here in the United States than ever.",
    "fullText": "Summon the heroes! The 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are almost here, and athletes from around the world are heading to northern Italy in hopes of skating, skiing, snowboarding, and sledding their way to the medal podium.\n\nAnd this year’s games are different from previous editions of the Winter Olympics, with a unique dual-city setting, new events, and even a new sport, and more TV coverage here in the United States than ever.\n\nHere are those details and more.\n\nFor the first time in Olympic history, two cities are hosting the games: Milan, Italy’s second-largest city, and Cortina d’Ampezzo, an Italian ski resort more than 250 miles away. And the action will play out at more than a dozen venues in those cities and elsewhere in northern Italy.\n\nAs NBC News reports, Milan will host ice skating, speed skating, ice hockey, and the opening ceremony; Cortina will host Alpine skiing, bobsled, curling, and luge; the Anterselva/Antholz region will host biathlon and cross-country skiing; Livigno will host freestyle skiing and snowboarding; Bormio will host men’s Alpine skiing and ski mountaineering; Tesero will host cross-country skiing; Predazzo will host ski jumping; and Verona will host the closing ceremonies.\n\nThe 2026 games are introducing ski mountaineering as a new Olympic sport, according to an Olympics.com FAQ. With medals awarded for men’s and women’s sprints and a mixed-gender relay, “skimo” has athletes alternating between racing on skis and racing on foot as they navigate a mountainous course.\n\nSki mountaineering is the only new sport at this year’s games, but viewers will see new events in returning Olympic sports: Women’s Doubles in luge, Women’s Large Hill in ski jumping, Mixed Team in skeleton, Men’s and Women’s Dual Moguls in freestyle skiing, and Team Combined in alpine skiing.\n\nBoth the 2026 Olympic Winter Games and the ensuing Paralympic Winter Games will award gold, silver, and bronze medals imagined by the Milano Cortina 2026 design team and crafted by the Italian State Mint and Polygraphic Institute (IPZS) using recycled metal recovered from production waste, per Olympics.com.\n\nThe medal design features interlocking halves representing several dual concepts, according to NBC Olympics. Those dual concepts include Milan and Cortina, urban and alpine, Olympic and Paralympic, and the athletes and the teams behind them.\n\nMilano Cortina 2026 medals revealed!\n\nThe medals for the Olympic Winter Games @milanocortina26 have a unique design that combines two halves symbolising the athlete’s journey and all those who have walked beside them along the way.\n\nDiscover: https://t.co/EiFV2cgObf pic.twitter.com/wFAlxAJ4YS\n\n— IOC MEDIA (@iocmedia) July 15, 2025\n\nEighty-six delegations will represent their home countries at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes who meet International Olympic Committee specifications will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, according to Sports Illustrated. Making their Winter Olympics debut at the 2026 games are Benin, Guinea-Bissau, and the United Arab Emirates, the magazine adds.\n\nThis year’s Olympic and Paralympic Games boast an emblem dubbed “Futura,” representing the number “26” drawn in a single motion. “Influenced by the themes of sport, solidarity and sustainability, ‘Futura’ illustrates a dynamic and modern design that reflects some of the fundamental values of the Olympic and the Paralympic Winter Games,” IOC Milano Cortina 2026 Coordination Commission Chair Sari Essayah said in a statement, per Olympics.com.\n\nThe Milano Cortina 2026 organizing committee’s choice of motto for the 2026 Olympics and Paralympics is “IT’s your vibe,” with “IT” capitalized as a play on Italy’s country code, according to the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe mascots of the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are the stoats Milo and Tina, named after the two host cities. Tina is the Olympic mascot, a white stoat who “believes in the power of beauty.” And Milo is the Paralympic mascot, a brown stoat who was born without one paw but “learned to use his tail and turn his difference into a strength,” Olympics.com explains. The two stoats will be joined by six snowdrop flowers symbolizing rebirth and collectively called The Flo.\n\nNearly four years ago, the song “Fino all’alba” (“Until the Dawn”) won a song contest in Italy to become the official anthem for the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, according to Inside the Games. The song, which received 72 percent of the vote, is the work of the La Cittadina of San Pietro Martire, a youth music group in the town of Seveso, Italy.\n\nIn a press release, NBCUniversal touts that it will provide the biggest Winter Olympics ever with the media corporation’s most comprehensive Winter Games coverage, totaling more than 3,200 hours in all. NBC’s Primetime in Milan will offer three hours of coverage each night, and NBC is also extending coverage into daytime to provide more Olympics programming hours on the network than it did for any previous Winter Games. Peacock, meanwhile, will stream live coverage of every event in every sport. And USA Network and CNBC, two cable channels now owned by Versant following that company’s spinoff from NBCUniversal, will also carry coverage of the games.\n\n2026 Winter Olympic Games, February 6 through February 22, NBC, Peacock, USA Network & CNBC\n\n2026 Winter Paralympic Games, March 6 through March 15, NBC, Peacock, USA Network & CNBC\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",
