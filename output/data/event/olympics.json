    "fullText": "Follow our live coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nChloe Kim, the snowboarder who has been setting the bar high over the years, will attempt her third gold medal on Thursday in hopes of continuing her strong legacy. The U.S. and Canadian hockey teams will take the ice indoors as the men begin their tournaments and return to Olympic action for the first time since 2014.\n\nWhile Norway leads the gold medal count with seven of the 13, the United States is up to four gold medals (seven total) so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count on Day 6 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nLet’s take a look at everything to watch today.\n\nTime: 7 a.m. ET, 1 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The women’s 10km interval start freestyle brings another good chance for Diggins, the American star in her final season, to win a medal. She has several World Cup wins over 10 kilometers and was the world champion in 2023.\n\nTime: Canada at 10:40 a.m. ET, 4:40 p.m. in Italy; U.S. at 3:10 p.m. ET, 9:10 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: American and Canadian NHL stars return to the Olympic ice for the first time since the 2014 Sochi Games. Canada opens against the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, while the U.S. takes on Latvia in the nightcap. Two other games Thursday: Switzerland-France at 6:10 a.m. ET and Germany-Denmark at 3:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTime: 1:30 p.m. ET, 7:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Kim will be chasing a third gold medal, and the competition will be chasing her. The key question will be whether she lands her most technically ambitious runs under Olympic pressure and how close the field can push her to perform at her best, as riders attempt to shorten the gap. Even when Kim isn’t perfect, her scoring ceiling often forces competitors to take bigger risks, setting up a final that could hinge on execution and nerve as much as difficulty.\n\nTimes: 3:05 a.m. (women), 8:05 a.m. (men) and 1:05 p.m. (women) ET; 9:05 a.m., 2:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The U.S. and Canada women make their debut in the morning session. The Americans are up again in the evening session. Great Britain vs. Sweden highlights the afternoon men’s session.\n\nTimes: 3:30 a.m. ET; 9:30 a.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The opening two heats will set the tone for a race where hundredths of a second can define medal hopes. With athletes making their first Olympic runs down the track, early consistency and clean starts will be crucial, especially as sliders balance aggression with control on one of the fastest courses in the world. Pressure will likely be on medal favorites to avoid mistakes while leaving little margin for recovery heading into the final runs, as Heats 1 and 2 will separate the good and great.\n\nTimes: Qualification No. 2 at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 6:15 a.m. ET, 12:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Demanding combinations of speed, aerial difficulty and technical precision will be tested as qualifiers kick off. The event rewards skiers who can maintain clean, controlled turns while attacking the course with aggression and executing high-difficulty jumps, so expect the competition to hinge on how athletes balance speed with form, as even small mistakes in the bumps or landings can swing scores dramatically. With judging split among turns, air and time, the event often produces tight finishes and momentum swings as finalists try to deliver high-risk runs under pressure.\n\nTimes: Qualification at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 7:45 a.m. ET, 1:45 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Strategy, positioning and clean starts are often just as important as raw speed, as riders jostle for lanes and try to avoid crashes that can quickly eliminate medal favorites. The knockout format adds another layer of pressure, forcing competitors to balance aggression with control while navigating traffic at high speeds, making snowboard cross one of the Games’ most volatile and dramatic events. Keep an eye on USA’s Nick Baumgartner, Australia’s Adam Lambert, Austria’s Alessandro Hämmerle and Canada’s Éliot Grondin.\n\nTime: 10:30 a.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Norway’s Ragne Wiklund, Canada’s Isabelle Weidemann and Joy Beune of the Netherlands are among the best in the women’s long-distance race. Italy’s Francesca Lollobrigida is the reigning world champion, giving the host nation a medal hopeful. Dutch great Irene Schouten, the defending Olympic champion, has since retired.\n\nTime: 12:30 p.m. ET, 6:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Germany and Austria lead the field after strong individual results, but one misstep or sloppy transition can swing the podium. Keep an eye on Germany and Austria’s consistency, which earned them a lead so far. Star power and making every run and handoff will be critical, but they won’t necessarily carry each team to victory.\n\nTime: 2:15 p.m. ET, 8:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: It could be a big day for North America here, with Americans Corinne Stoddard and Kristen Santos-Griswold and Canadians William Dandjinou, Steven Dubois and Courtney Sarault all among the medal contenders. Pietro Sighel gives Italy a medal shot in the men’s 1,000. Two-time world champion Xandra Velzeboer of the Netherlands is the name to beat in the women’s 500.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nOlympics, Global Sports, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Meanwhile, the men's competitions began six days later.\n\nThe United States and Canada are favored to be the top teams in both fields, with superstars spread across these rosters.\n\nAs the preliminary round shifts to the knockout stage, The Sporting News has you covered with all the details you need to know on how the Olympic hockey tournament format works below.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nAt the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics, the men's and women's ice hockey tournaments use distinct group-stage formats before transitioning to single-elimination knockout phases.\n\nBoth tournaments conform to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) point system: three points are awarded for a regulation victory, two points for an overtime or shootout victory, and one point for an overtime or shootout defeat.\n\nThe men's tournament, featuring NHL players for the first time since 2014, consists of three groups of four teams each.\n\nThe twelve teams are divided into three evenly structured groups. Following the round-robin phase, the four leading teams (comprising three group winners and the best runner-up) receive byes to the quarterfinals. The remaining eight teams must compete in a qualification playoff game to secure the final four spots in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe women's tournament uses a tiered \"power-seeding\" format to create more competitive matchups in the early rounds.\n\nThe ten teams are allocated based on world ranking. Group A comprises the top five seeds, all of whom automatically advance to the quarterfinals regardless of their preliminary records. Conversely, Group B includes the lower five seeds, with only the top three teams from this group progressing further.\n\nKnockout stage: Feb. 16-Feb. 20\n\nKnockout stage: Feb. 13-Feb. 16",

    "description": "Wednesday was a busy day for U.S athletes at the Milan Cortina Olympics as Team USA doubled its gold-medal tally.",
    "fullText": "Wednesday was a busy day for U.S athletes at the Milan Cortina Olympics as Team USA doubled its gold-medal tally.\n\nMeanwhile, injured snowboarder Chloe Kim laid to rest any notion that she's anything but the gold-medal favorite. Madison Chock and Evan Bates likely finished their careers on the podium. And the jilted lover of the unfaithful Norwegian biathlete has responded.\n\nHere are five of the top stories from Day 5 of the Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nIf you didn't know Jordan Stolz's name before, he introduced himself to the wider world on Wednesday.\n\nThe 21-year-old U.S. speedskater who's the best in the sport made his Olympics debut in dramatic fashion. Stolz trailed Jenning de Boo of the Netherlands in the final lap of their 1,000-meter race and appeared at risk of an upset loss.\n\nBut he chased de Boo down on the back stretch, then sprinted past him on the final turn as if propelled out of a slingshot to overtake the Dutch skater with the fastest time of the day at 106.28, a new Olympic record. Stolz made up a deficit of nearly a full second on the final lap to secure the win.\n\nA NEW SPEED SKATING STANDARD. 💪\n\nJordan Stolz wins GOLD with a men's 1000m #WinterOlympics RECORD. pic.twitter.com/qW3DSj2vP0\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nStolz's time survived the final race of the competition, and the world-record holder in the 1,000 meters is now the Olympic record holder and a gold medalist. De Boo took silver, and China's Ning Zhongyan won bronze.\n\nStolz is just getting started at Milan Cortina. He has a realistic shot at leaving the Games with four gold medals. He's also slated to compete at 500 meters (Saturday), 1,500 meters (Feb. 19) and in the mass start event slated to close speedskating competition on Feb. 21.\n\nIt's not the color they were targeting. But Madison Chock and Evan Bates finally have Olympic medals of their own.\n\nThe veteran U.S. ice dancers skated second to last in Wednesday's free dance and executed a performance worthy of gold-medal contention.\n\nSimply BEAUTIFUL. This is what 15 years of skating together looks like. 😍 pic.twitter.com/UQhpVEBB90\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nBut France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron entered Wednesday with a slim lead of 0.46 points after edging the U.S. couple in Monday's rhythm dance.\n\nAnd they delivered a brilliant performance of their own to edge Chock and Bates with a total score of 225.82 to secure the gold medal.\n\nLaurence Fournier Beaudry ganó la medalla de oro en danza sobre hielo en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de Milán-Cortina 2026, junto a su pareja Guillaume Cizeron. 🥇⛸️#PatinajeArtistico pic.twitter.com/XFut3HGhrI\n\n— Bastian C (@basdc68) February 11, 2026\n\nChock and Bates won silver with a combined score of 224.39, 1.43 points behind the gold-medal winners. Canada's Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier won bronze with a score of 217.74.\n\nThe individual Olympic medal was the final item on the résumé for Chock and Bates, who have been partners on the ice for 15 years and married since 2024. They've won two Olympic gold medals in team competition, including from Sunday night. And they entered the Milan Cortina Games with three consecutive world championships.\n\nWednesday's performance was expected to be their last in competition. If so, they'll conclude their decorated careers with two more Olympic medals from Milan Cortina.\n\nChloe Kim declared on Jan. 13 that she was \"good to go\" for the Olympics despite sustaining a torn left labrum in training just days earlier.\n\nIt turns out that she was right. The two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe made her Milan Cortina debut in qualifying on Wednesday. As stated, she's good to go.\n\nKim laid down a monster score of 90.25 on her first of two runs.\n\nTwo-time Gold medalist Chloe Kim WOWS with a huge first run in halfpipe qualifying. 😮‍💨🇺🇸\n\n📺 Peacock | #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/x9sIIICdEg\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nThat score stood at the end of the day as the best by nearly three points. Japan's Sara Shimizu finished second with an 87.5, and Kim's U.S. teammate Maddie Mastro finished third with an 86.\n\nThe scores don't carry over to Thursday's final, where each rider will have three runs to lay down the best score of the day. But Kim erased any doubt that her injury has made her anything but the favorite to secure her third consecutive Olympic gold medal and the sixth in seven Games in the event for the U.S.\n\nIt was a banner day for the U.S. in women's moguls competition. All four American competitors advanced to Wednesday's final. Two of them finished on the podium with gold and silver medals.\n\nLiz Lemley finished with gold thanks to a dominant performance that secured a score of 83.20, well clear of any of the skiers before her.\n\nLiz Lemley is as GOOD AS GOLD in her #WinterOlympics debut. 💪 pic.twitter.com/vTKIwtAsfW\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nHer teammate Jaelin Kauf competed after her and posted an 80.77 as the only other competitor to crack 80 points.\n\nJaelin Kauf secures BACK-TO-BACK SILVER in women's moguls at the #WinterOlympics! 🥈 pic.twitter.com/hCMFfHPbZ6\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nNeither of their positions were secure until reigning Australian Olympic gold medalist Jakara Anthony competed. But Anthony fell on her final run and finished in eighth place, ensuring that Lemley and Kauf would claim gold and silver.\n\nFrance's Perrine Laffont won bronze with a score of 78. Japan's Hinako Tomitaka matched Laffont's 78, but finished excruciatingly off the podium in fourth place due to a tiebreaker.\n\nIt was clear from reports that Lindsey Vonn's broken leg was no simple fracture.\n\nVonn provided some insight on Wednesday hammering that point home. In her second update since her devastating injury crash in Sunday's alpine downhill competition, Vonn posted on Instagram that she'd undergone a third surgery to repair her fractured left tibia. She also shared a picture from her hospital bed demonstrating just how serious her injury is.\n\nVonn's left leg is placed in what appears to be an external fixator, a brace that uses pins, wires and bars to stabilize severely fractured bones. She previously announced that she'd sustained a complex fracture, which Yale medicine defines as \"when the bone breaks into bits and pieces, when the soft tissue surrounding the bone is severely damaged, or when the patient has other illnesses or injuries that complicate treatment and healing.\"\n\nIt's not clear if Vonn will require more procedures to rebuild her broken leg. But she clearly has a difficult road to recovery.\n\nVonn expressed optimism in her recovery while giving a thumbs up alongside a note of gratitude to her medical team and supporters and well wishes for Team USA at the Olympics.\n\n\"I had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful,\" Vonn wrote. \"Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I’m making progress and while it is slow, I know I’ll be ok.\"\n\nNBC's drone pilots are doing outstanding work getting third-person shots of athletes barreling down the halfpipe, racing on the downhill course and sledding through the twists and turns of the luge track. They also appear to be having a good time.\n\nOn Wednesday, they offered up this gem simulating a first-person view of what it might look like to take on the Milan Cortina moguls course.\n\nWait for it...😍 pic.twitter.com/gDPuXK4O2V\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nWe have an update on the saga of the cheating Norwegian biathlete. He cheated in love, not in competition, to be clear.\n\nIn case you missed it, Sturla Holm Lægreid won bronze in the 20km biathlon on Tuesday, then made the questionable decision to admit — in tears — in his post-race interview that he cheated on his girlfriend and that he'd hoped to win her back.\n\nThe girlfriend has now weighed in. Make that the ex-girlfriend. She understandably does not sound interested in Lægreid's post-infidelity overtures.\n\nThe girlfriend — who chose to remain anonymous — provided this response to Norwegian tabloid VG:\n\n“It’s hard to forgive,\" she wrote. \"Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world. ... I did not choose to be put in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it. We have had contact, and he is aware of my opinions on this.”\n\nHere's the initial interview that sparked one of the strangest story of these Games:\n\nSå ikke helt denne komme. Tidenes mest absurde medaljeintervju. 🫣 pic.twitter.com/fFwJ1B0vCO\n\n— Daniel Vassbund (@Smoothedan) February 10, 2026\n\n\"There's someone I wanted to share it with who might not be watching,\" he said, via BBC translation, fighting back tears.\"Six months ago I met the love of my life — the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her.\"\n\nIt sounds like her eyes are looking elsewhere.",

    "title": "Winter Olympics 2026: A superstar in Europe, maybe now America will know Jordan Stolz after winning gold in 1000",
    "description": "Stolz collected his first of multiple expected golds at the Milan Cortina Olympics.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — When American speedskating phenom Jordan Stolz and his family went out to eat while in the Netherlands for a World Cup event a few months ago, they didn’t have the luxury of choosing a restaurant for the type of food it served.\n\nTheir main priority was finding a secluded spot in a quiet part of town where Stolz could enjoy a meal in peace without getting recognized.\n\nAlmost immediately after the Stolzes sat down, a group of men walked by their table and did a double take.\n\n“Are you Jordan?” one of them asked.\n\nStolz tried to say no, but smirks and giggles from his family members gave him away. Before long, more restaurantgoers approached the table to say hello to Stolz or to ask him to pose for a picture. He barely had time to shovel food into his mouth between interruptions.\n\n“It’s crazy over there,” said Dirk Stolz, Jordan’s father. “Anywhere we go, everybody knows him.”\n\nSince rocketing onto the global speedskating scene three years ago, Stolz has become the rare athlete more famous internationally than he is in his home country. The 21-year-old is a superstar in speedskating hotspots like the Netherlands, Norway and Germany, but he remains almost completely unknown across America and even in his home state of Wisconsin.\n\nStolz took a big step toward changing that Wednesday night in Milan when he shined in the first of his four races on the Olympic stage. The kid who learned to skate on his family’s backyard pond in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, overwhelmed a world-class field in the men’s 1,000 meters to win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nStolz destroyed the Olympic record by nearly a second, posting a 1:06.28.\n\nIt’s always reckless to guarantee gold medals in a pressure-packed setting like the Olympics, but it would have been a massive surprise to see any other skater besides Stolz win the men’s 1,000. He’s not just the world record holder in this event. He last lost a World Cup race at this distance in November 2023.\n\nWhile Stolz is also a clear favorite to win gold in the men’s 1,500 on February 19, his other two races pose a stiffer challenge. The high-intensity, fast-paced 500 features several sprinters who have beaten Stolz on the World Cup circuit this season. And the chaotic mass start event brings an element of randomness with the whole field racing shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nIf Stolz can pile up medals over the next 10 days, it could be life-changing for him and huge for the notoriety of his sport in the U.S. Already, Stolz has landed endorsement deals with the likes of Hershey’s and Honda and gained the backing of NBC. He starred alongside Glen Powell in a hilarious commercial promoting NBC airing the Winter Games.\n\nFor Stolz, his first Olympic gold medal is a major milestone on a journey that began with watching the charismatic Apolo Anton Ohno at the 2010 Vancouver Games. He has chased Olympic glory ever since, snapping at the heels of America's fastest speedskaters by age l6 and then coming for the rest of the world a year or two later.\n\nJane Stolz recalls a ticket scanner initially denying her entry the first time her son competed at the World Championships three years ago. No matter how many times she tried, her digital ticket wouldn’t scan properly.\n\nThen Jordan won his first global title in the 500. And the 1,000. And the 1,500.\n\n“By the end of the week, I didn’t have to worry about showing tickets anymore,” Jane said with a laugh. “They all knew who we were.”\n\nThe more races Stolz has won and records he has broken, the more well known he becomes. He seldom finishes a meal in the speedskating-obsessed Netherlands without interruptions. He rarely makes it to his gate at the airport in Amsterdam without fulfilling a request for a picture or autograph.\n\nStolz’s parents receive so much airtime when he races that they’ve become famous-adjacent among speedskating fans. Jane remembers two elderly women approaching her at an overseas coffee shop when she was jet-lagged and exhausted. At first, Jane thought they needed help. Then they asked her, “Are you Jordan’s mom?”\n\nDirk and Jane know a Wisconsin couple that emigrated from the Netherlands and still watches Dutch TV regularly.\n\n“They tell us they see us and Jordan on the evening news all the time,” Jane said.\n\nThe contrast is striking compared to Stolz’s anonymity in his home country, especially among those not old enough to remember Eric Heiden’s five gold medals at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980. The average Wisconsinite that Jane encounters isn’t guaranteed to know what speedskating is, let alone about the exploits of her son.\n\n“I’m like, you know, speedskating, where they go around in the oval?” Jane said. “They’re like, huh? I’m like, you know, Eric Heiden? They still have no clue.”\n\nNow is Stolz’s two weeks in the Olympic limelight back home, his best chance to elevate his own stature and his sport’s.\n\nSomewhere in America, there’s a kid with a backyard pond watching Olympic speedskating. And maybe he dreams of being the next Jordan Stolz.",

    "description": "Despite a lack of COVID-19 precautions implemented by the 2026 Winter Olympics organizers in Italy, some athletes, teams, and their loved ones are protecting themselves from airborne pathogens by masking and isolating.",
    "fullText": "Despite a lack of COVID-19 precautions implemented by the 2026 Winter Olympics organizers in Italy, some athletes, teams, and their loved ones are protecting themselves from airborne pathogens by masking and isolating.\n\nThese precautions were put in the spotlight last week before the games officially began when some members of the U.S. men’s and women’s cross-country ski team attended press conferences in respirators. Then, on the way to Friday’s opening ceremony, some Olympians sported respirators and other high-quality masks, protecting themselves from COVID-19 and other airborne pathogens that could affect their health or performances — or, if they developed Long COVID, their careers.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing as the virus continues to spread around the world unchecked, causing further death and disability. The virus has caused over 25 million excess deaths, while more than 400 million people have been affected by Long COVID.\n\nJust before the games started, two members of the Australian team’s staff tested positive for COVID-19 at a training facility in Italy, according to ABC News. Meanwhile, various outlets have reported that an “outbreak” of norovirus has affected many hockey teams in Italy. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) claimed there is “absolutely no outbreak” of that virus.\n\nIn interviews and press conferences, Olympians and their coaches have elaborated on the extent of precautionary measures some are taking at the games to avoid pathogens. Kristen Bourne, a coach of the U.S. women’s cross-country ski team, told Faster Skier that the team is staying in a separate, private hotel to avoid the Olympic village and members are wearing masks indoors. Some other teams are taking similar measures.\n\n“We have closed our hotel. We don’t want outsiders in, and we don’t want infections to come in,” Swedish cross-country ski team doctor Rickard Noberius told Expressen. “So, it’s just us and the family who run the hotel — and they have been given strict restrictions as well.” (Editor’s note: These quotes were translated from Swedish.)\n\nMany of these athletes are also taking precautions by isolating and masking around family members and friends — something disabled people, including those with Long COVID, have been doing since the beginning of the pandemic. Still, media outlets reporting on the precautions have shown their biases and incorrectly said the pandemic is over in a standard “back to normal” narrative.\n\nNPR wrote in the opening of an article on athletes’ COVID-19 precautions, “For most people, if not everyone, the pandemic days of masking are behind us.”\n\nIn social posts for the story, NPR also called the precautions “extreme,” despite millions of disabled and immunocompromised people around the world who continue to take COVID-19 precautions daily as SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens spread. Similarly, the Associated Press called Olympians taking precautions “worried” in a headline. The AP also framed prior Winter Olympics, like Beijing 2022, which did have mandatory COVID-19 precautions, as “sports prison.”\n\nThese framing choices have been criticized by many on social media as condescending and misleading, minimizing the very serious risks of COVID-19 and other pathogens that can cause long-term illness and disability.\n\nCOVID-19 has caused many Olympians and other athletes to miss important competitions and games in their careers; others have competed while actively infected. During the 2024 summer Olympics, runner Noah Lyles competed two days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 and collapsed at the end of a race. Long COVID experts have advised extreme rest during and after COVID-19 to help avoid the potential of Long COVID.\n\nOlympians, just like anyone, are at risk of Long COVID. Studies have shown that the risk of the disabling disease may increase with each SARS-CoV-2 infection and trigger or worsen diagnoses, including myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Professional basketball player Kristaps Porziņģis was diagnosed with POTS last year and it has  sidelined him for much of the season.\n\nOlympians, just like anyone, are at risk of Long COVID. Studies have shown that the risk of the disabling disease may increase with each SARS-CoV-2 infection and trigger or worsen diagnoses.\n\nThe Sick Times has also reported on elite athletes who have developed Long COVID. Athletes shared their stories about how the disease has put many of them on the bench and greatly affected their careers and finances. Research has found that the disease lowers VO2 max (the body’s ability to absorb oxygen), weakens lung muscles, and causes muscle fibers to die off after long bouts of exercise.\n\nOther research has shown that U.S. Marines, known for their high caliber of fitness, have also been heavily impacted by Long COVID. A 2024 study found that 25% of the Marine cohort developed the disease.\n\nNovie McCabe, from the U.S. women’s cross-country ski team, told Faster Skier last December that she’s experienced “mystery health challenges” for the past two years, alongside managing celiac disease and Hashimoto’s disease.\n\nShe told the outlet that doctors have said she likely has a “post-viral illness” and a “chronic fatigue type-thing,” potentially a reference to ME, a disabling neurological disease (as defined by the World Health Organization) with which many people with Long COVID have also been diagnosed. The disease has been called “chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)” in the past, but myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is preferred by many people with the disease. Sometimes it’s referred to as “ME/CFS.”\n\nA cardinal feature of ME is post-exertional malaise (PEM), in which a constellation of debilitating symptoms can worsen following physical, cognitive, or emotional exertion. These disabling symptoms may last days, weeks, or permanently alter someone’s health baseline. Research has found serious muscle abnormalities in people with ME and Long COVID.\n\n“I have taken a pretty cautious approach to training this year and just been trying to build back into it super slowly and give a lot of extra attention to rest and recovery,” McCabe told Faster Skier last year.\n\nThe 2026 games put a spotlight on how collective public health failures of governments and the IOC have made specific teams and athletes take their own precautions as the world continues to ignore the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many disabled and immunocompromised people, these athletes and teams are forced to put their health first, despite overwhelming stigma against masking and other COVID-19 precautions and despite the overwhelming research that shows the adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, also did not have any COVID-19 precautions for athletes or attendees. This lack of foresight during a surge of COVID that summer forced a group of Olympic volunteers to quit.\n\n“We want basic precautions, measures we’ve implemented…we know these work and are validated by science. Why aren’t they being used?” one volunteer told The Sick Times that summer.\n\nWe want basic precautions, measures we’ve implemented…we know these work and are validated by science.

    "fullText": "His maiden Olympics, at Beijing 2022, hadn't gone the way it was supposed to. Just months earlier, he had won a first skeleton World Cup gold and was a genuine medal contender.\n\nThe latest in a long line, too. British sliders - including two-time champion Lizzy Yarnold - had won a medal at every Winter Olympics since the sport was reinstated to the programme in 2002.\n\nBut 20 years later, that run had come to a disastrous end. Weston's 15th-place finish was the highest of the four British athletes competing on the Yanqing track.\n\nBlame was laid firmly on their equipment - a risk was taken with their sleds and \"it didn't pay off\".\n\n\"In this sport the fine margins are everything and you have to take risks to be the best, but sometimes that will come back to bite you and it came back to bite us at the biggest event of my career,\" Weston, 28, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself. As a child you think 'I want to be an Olympian' and that it's going to be the best experience of my life, but I came back and felt it wasn't how it was meant to be.\"\n\nFour years on, Weston is back at his second Olympics and things are very different - 'helmet-gate' aside.\n\nHe is a two-time world champion, a multiple World Cup gold medallist - and will have one of the sport's greats on his side when competition gets under way on Thursday.\n\nBecause when Weston was pondering his future, conversations were happening behind the scenes.\n\nMartins Dukurs - widely regarded as the greatest slider to ever take to the ice - became Great Britain's new coach.\n\nA six-time world champion with more than 60 World Cup victories to his name, Dukurs retired after the Beijing Games and his capture as a coach - alongside that of his own coach and sled designer Matthias Guggenberger - by the British team was a major coup.\n\n\"This is just a massive bonus to a good package that we already had, this is the icing on the cake,\" said Weston.\n\n\"Martins is the best ever at what he's done. His experience is invaluable.\"\n\nTeam-mate Marcus Wyatt added: \"[Dukurs] is almost bigger than skeleton.\n\n\"He is the GOAT [greatest of all time]. He's won more World Cups than some people have taken part in, he's really special and just to have him happy enough to coach us, it gives you so much more confidence in yourself.\"\n\nSo what was it about the British challenge that attracted Dukurs to the role?\n\n\"I saw that there was potential,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We needed fast results because we saw the athletes had lost a bit of confidence, and in professional sport confidence it is really important.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Beijing, the skeleton programme had a drop in UK Sport funding - from the £6.5m they received for the 2022 cycle, to an initial £4.8m for 2026 - though this later rose to £5.8m.\n\nIt was a blow after such huge success in the sport. No nation has won more Olympic skeleton medals than Great Britain's nine, an astounding feat given the country's lack of ice track - a push track at the University of Bath, shared with the bobsleigh team, their only practice space on home soil.\n\n\"This is what they've achieved without a track, it's actually amazing,\" said Dukurs.\n\n\"Any time I needed I was jumping on a sled, I was testing equipment, and unfortunately they don't have such opportunity.\"\n\nThe British squad have not let that count against them, though.\n\nIn addition to his two world titles, Weston also has three Crystal Globes - overall World Cup titles - to his name.\n\nWyatt has won four individual World Cups, while this season both he and Tabby Stoecker won overall bronze medals.\n\nAnd together Weston and Stoecker have won two World Championship silvers in the mixed team event, which will make its Olympic debut on the Cortina track.\n\nThe team's build-up to the Games has been overshadowed by a debate over new helmets they had been hoping to wear. They eventually lost their appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nBut they have not let it affect them, with Weston and Stoecker both topping multiple training runs.\n\nTeam GB skeleton helmet appeal dismissed by Cas\n\nSo why are Great Britain so good at skeleton?\n\nThe athletes all point to one specific weapon in their armoury - each other.\n\nWith no ice track, the British squad have had to find their advantage elsewhere and that has largely come in their camaraderie.\n\n\"We only get to slide down an ice track about 120-150 times a year. Each run is less than a minute, so you're looking at less than two hours actually doing the sport every year,\" said Wyatt.\n\n\"But if you talk to other athletes, learn from their experiences and share what you're doing, suddenly you've doubled, tripled, quadrupled your knowledge.\n\n\"The day before a race, I might be struggling on a corner, so I ask Matt: 'What are you doing on corner four?' He tells me, I try that, it works for me, and lo and behold when the race comes, I might beat him.\n\n\"That's fine, because he knows that next week when he's struggling somewhere else, I'll help him out and he might beat me.\"\n\nWeston added: \"On the track, [Wyatt's] the first person I want to beat, I'm the first person he wants to beat.\n\n\"But when we're training, when we're working stuff out, we work together so well, and I think that's what separates us apart [from the rest].\"\n\nBetween them, Weston and Wyatt won every men's World Cup this season - the first time one nation has done so.\n\nIt bodes well for the Winter Olympics, with the skeleton action getting under way on Thursday, and there is only one potential outcome in Weston's mind.\n\n\"My sights are set on gold. That's the only colour I want to come home with,\" he said.\n\n\"It sounds funny saying this as a two-time world champion, but I don't really feel like I've been able to put down what I really feel like I can.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

    "title": "Milan Cortina: What to watch today in the Winter Olympics — Chloe Kim hits halfpipe as U.S. chases gold in speed skating, ice dance (2/11)",
    "description": "There are several gold medal opportunities for the United States today in Italy.",
    "fullText": "The Winter Games have begun in Italy. From the rink to the slopes, a new generation of stars has emerged to chase gold. We’ll keep you connected to all of the thrilling moments and top stories as we track the medal race each day of the Games.\n\nThe United States is up to seven total medals so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count in Day 5 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nJordan Stoltz will attempt to continue his dominant run throughout speed skating in the 1,000 meters, and the women's double luge will have its first ever gold medal awarded at the Olympics later Wednesday. Madison Chock and Evan Bates are back in action with their final ice dancing event. Oh, and Chloe Kim will hit the halfpipe for the first time, too.\n\nHere are the top five things to watch on Wednesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics:\n\nIt’s time for Jordan Stoltz to take the ice in Italy. The Team USA speed skating star will open with the 1,000 meters on Wednesday, the event in which he already holds the world record. He made his Olympics debut in Beijing four years ago and finished only 14th in the 1,000 meters, though he’s widely considered a medal favorite every time he takes the ice in these games.\n\nBut the 1,000 meter is his best event. Stoltz has five wins at that distance already this season, and has won 14 races in a row in that distance on the World Cup level. Stoltz will also compete in the 500 meters, 1,500 meters and mass start.\n\nChloe Kim is ready for her first event in Italy. The top name in the sport will open her quest to become the first person to win three straight gold medals in the halfpipe, starting with qualifying Wednesday. Kim was 17 when she won gold in South Korea in 2018, and she backed it up in Beijing four years ago, too. But Kim is now dealing with a torn labrum, which she suffered during training in Switzerland.\n\nIf she can get through qualifying, the final of the women’s halfpipe is set for Thursday.\n\nThe women’s doubles luge was added to the Olympics for the first time this year after more than six decades on the men’s side. It’ll be up to Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby to lead the way for the United States.\n\nThe duo, who are the only American women’s pairing, won bronze at the first ever world championship back in 2022. They’ve looked good so far, too, with a top five time in five of their six training runs. But it’s Austria’s Selina Egle and Lara Kipp who are the favorites, as they both lead the World Cup standings and have won three training runs so far.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates will enter Wednesday’s ice dance free skate in second place, so they’ll have to rally a bit in order to pull off the gold medal. They trailed France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron by less than half a point after the rhythm dance portion of the competition on Monday.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates with a STELLAR first-place ice dance performance to start off strong for Team USA! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/kk0O802JTr\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 6, 2026\n\nThe married couple are the reigning world champions in the event, and are just days removed from helping the U.S. win a second straight team gold medal. But the individual medal is the last piece they’ve been chasing after a fourth-place finish in Beijing.\n\nAll eyes will be on Ryan Cochran-Siegle when he hits the Super-G on Wednesday. He was the only American Alpine skier to win a medal at the Beijing Olympics when he won silver in the event four years ago.\n\nBut competition is stiff for Cochran-Siegle to improve on that finish this time around. Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt is the favorite in the event, with already two wins to his name this season. A trio of Austrians have dominated the World Cup season race, too, and Italy’s Giovanni Franzoni is a big name to watch.\n\nHe has his work cut out for him, but he is the only returning medalist from Beijing.

However, on Tuesday, it was the American supporting cast that came away with Olympic hardware, and in the process made names for themselves that will bring them temporary fame.\n\nJacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan\n\nHeading into the slalom portion of the women’s team alpine combined, Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin were the heavy favourites, as they were the defending world champions and even had the lead as Johnson was the fastest women’s downhill skier of the event. However, it was Shiffrin who had a poor slalom run, and the Johnson/Shiffrin tandem shockingly finished in fourth place. The Americans still got on to the podium in the event as Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon and Paula Moltzan of Lakeville, Minnesota posted a third place time of 2:21.91 to beat Shiffrin and Johnson by six one-hundredths of a second.\n\nWhat we saw on Tuesday was a gigantic upset from American cross country skier Ben Ogden of Lebanon, New Hampshire. The odds of Ogden coming through with a medal was +6500 according to 3wiresports.com. However, it was Ogden that had the second fastest time in the men’s sprint, and was only behind the heavy favourite, Johannes Hesflot Klaebo of Norway. For Klaebo, it was his second Olympic gold in Milan, as he also was first in Saturday’s skiathlon.\n\nThe mixed doubles curling event came to completion on Tuesday, with the United States winning silver behind only Sweden. It ws a notable week for American curler Cory Thiesse of Duluth, Minnesota. Thiesse became the very first American female curler to win an Olympic medal. The only other American medal in Olympic curling came in 2018, when John Shuster of Duluth shocked the curling world with a win over Sweden in the gold medal final in the men’s event.\n\nThe native of Fairbanks, Alaska is now a two-time Olympic medalist in slopestyle. After winning gold four years ago in Beijing, Alex Hall won silver on Tuesday at the Livigno Snow Park. Hall had a score of 85.75 points, and was beaten by the slimmest of margins–0.53 points. The gold medalist was Norway’s Birk Ruud, the Olympic gold medalist from men’a big air skiing in Beijing.\n\nIt has been a tough time for the Sacramento Kings over the last month, as the Kings are losers of 13 straight games. However, Olympic bronze medalist Ashley Farquharson calls Sacramento home and was marvelous on Tuesday as she claimed an unexpected bronze in the women’s luge event. Faquharson had a four run time of 3:31.582.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympic Games: five medal Tuesday for Team USA appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Monica Aksamit won a Bronze medal in the 2016 Olympics with team USA. She says she had to go into debt to fund her dream and destroyed her credit score.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Monica Aksamit. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I ask people how much they thought I earned as a US Olympian, they always guess an amount far above what I actually got paid.\n\nDuring the years I was part of the US fencing team from 2016 to 2021, I made $300 a month. This was the pinnacle of my fencing career, and yet I wasn't making enough to cover my living expenses.\n\nBut this had always been my dream, and I had to pursue it at all costs.\n\nI'd been fencing since I was about 8. My mom, a Polish immigrant, had signed me up after a client of hers suggested she bring me along to a practice. He said there was a scholarship opportunity if I did well, and my mom was hooked.\n\nFencing was a great outlet for me during my parents' divorce. Most kids get yelled at for hitting other kids — I was being applauded for it.\n\nMy mom financially supported my fencing. She put herself into credit card debt to ensure we could pay for equipment, travel, practices, and tournaments.\n\nI remember her once telling one of my coaches that she couldn't afford to bring me to practices anymore. The coach told her to just pay what she could. He wanted me to chase this dream and saw potential. My road to the Olympics wouldn't have been possible without him.\n\nAs I got a bit older, I started winning competitions, and with that came prize money. My mom's sacrifice, the coach's generosity, and the prize money kept me pushing forward.\n\nAfter watching the 2004 Olympics in Greece, I became fixated on the idea of one day competing on the US Olympic fencing team. It was the first Olympic Games that my event, the women's saber, was added. Nowadays, they're a lot more lenient with adding events — but it wasn't like that then — it was a big deal.\n\nThat year, I sat on my grandparents' couch in Poland and watched, telling them one day, I'd become an Olympian. It was a crazy dream, and that time, my mom didn't necessarily think I'd achieve it, but she kept paving the way for me to get there.\n\nWhen I graduated from college in 2012, my main goal was to get to the Olympics. But now, I was an adult and had to fund it myself.\n\nI alone had to pay for a big portion of the competitions, travel, and all of my own living expenses. I stayed at home because there was no way I could afford to pursue my dream while paying rent.\n\nI worked endlessly as a fencing coach and a referee at tournaments. I handed out flyers for companies and took low-end modelling gigs.\n\nMy fencing club and those who contributed to my GoFundMe continued to financially support me along the way, helping fund my dream.\n\nIn 2016, I qualified for the US Olympic team. Team USA started covering all of my tournaments, training camps, and travel. But I was only given a monthly salary of $300.\n\nThere wasn't any way I could take on another job because what employer was going to let me take several weeks off throughout the year to train and compete?\n\nMy only option was to take out credit cards to fund what I needed to achieve my dream — car insurance, train travel into the city to train, food, bills, and any extras I did. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I didn't want money to be the reason I couldn't achieve what I had worked so long for.\n\nPeople are shocked when I tell them how much I made each month as an Olympian and how I went into debt to represent the US on an international stage.\n\nIt did eventually pay off. I took home a bronze medal at Rio in 2016, but I'm still paying off my credit cards from those years of training and competing with Team USA.\n\nAfter Rio, I put on a fundraiser to cover the costs of getting to Tokyo 2020, and people generously donated enough to go over my goal — it was the only way to fund my Olympic dreams as someone who didn't come from money.",

    "description": "Ilia Malinin, known as the \"Quad God,\" is one of Team USA's breakout figure skating stars of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics.",
    "fullText": "You may recognize US figure skater Ilia Malinin from his gravity-defying backflips and quadruple jumps.\n\nOr perhaps you know him simply as the \"Quad God.\"\n\nMalinin, 21, is a two-time world champion and one of Team USA's breakout figure skating stars of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nHere's what to know about Malinin's background and Olympic career.\n\nMalinin's parents, Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, were born in Russia and represented Uzbekistan at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano and the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nNow, they serve as his coaches.\n\nMalinin was born in Fairfax, Virginia, and began figure skating at 7 years old.\n\nMalinin's younger sister, Ellie \"Liza\" Beatrice Malinina, is also a competitive figure skater.\n\nHe trains in Reston, Virginia. When he's not figure skating, he's a student at the nearby George Mason University majoring in exploratory studies.\n\nMalinin is the first and only skater to ever land a quadruple axel in competition, and began using the nickname \"Quad God\" when he was 13 years old.\n\nMalinin helped Team USA secure the gold medal in the team figure skating competition on Sunday. He landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, but has yet to attempt a quadruple axel at the 2026 Olympics. While he had planned to execute a quadruple axel during the Team Event, he substituted a triple axel instead.\n\nMalinin has also included backflips in his Olympic routines — a feat with a complicated history.\n\nDuring the 1976 Olympics, American figure skater Terry Kubicka performed the first-ever backflip, but the International Skating Union banned the move shortly thereafter in 1977, saying it was too dangerous.\n\nIn 1998, French figure skater Surya Bonaly became the first Olympic figure skater to land a backflip on one blade during her free skate, but was penalized by the judges since the move was still illegal in competition.\n\nThe International Skating Union lifted the ban on backflips in 2024. During the Team Event this year, Malinin landed a backflip on one skate just as Bonaly had, but this time, it was permitted.\n\nMalinin is believed to be the highest-paid figure skater at the 2026 Olympics with an estimated income of $700,000 from sponsorships over the last year, Forbes reported.\n\nAccording to Malinin's website, his corporate partners include Coca-Cola, Samsung, Google, Xfinity, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Honda.\n\nHaving already won gold in the team competition, Malinin will skate in the individual Men's Short Program on February 10 and the individual Men's Free Skate on February 13.\n\nSee Business Insider's full guide to watching Olympic figure skating",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Julia Taubitz added a new chapter to Germany's Olympic luge dominance. Elina Bota made some history for Latvia.\n\nAnd Ashley Farquharson was moved to tears — after giving USA Luge just the seventh medal in its Olympic history.\n\nTaubitz rolled to the win in the women's singles race at the Milan Cortina Olympics, finishing her two-day, four-run strut to the gold in 3 minutes, 30.625 seconds — nearly a full second ahead of Bota, who got the silver.\n\nFarquharson got the bronze, the third singles medal ever for USA Luge at the Olympics and matching the best finish by an American women's slider. Chris Mazdzer got silver in men's singles at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, and Erin Hamlin got the women's bronze at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nThis time, it was Farquharson's turn.\n\nTaubitz got the 17th gold medal awarded in women's singles luge, and the 13th that went to a German slider.\n\nThe Olympic singles gold medal was the only thing missing on Taubitz's resume.\n\nShe's a two-time women's singles world champion, a five-time World Cup overall champion, a winner of more than 30 World Cup races and none of that takes into account how she has piled up medals as part of Germany's near-unbeatable team relays.\n\nAnd now, the biggest medal. The shiniest one, too. She's the Olympic champion, taking over that crown from now-retired German great Natalie Geisenberger, who won the last three gold medals.\n\nEmily Fischnaller was 12th for the Americans in 3:33.035, falling from fifth after three runs with some trouble in her final heat. Summer Britcher of the U.S., a two-time World Cup race winner this season and now a four-time Olympian, was 14th in 3:33.553.\n\nTaubitz and Fraebel were so far ahead of the field entering Tuesday that the only way they wouldn't win gold and silver was if someone committed a huge mistake.\n\nIt took about one second for her gold chance — or any medal chance — to be gone. Fraebel badly botched the start of her third run, bouncing off the wall and ping-ponging her way down the rest of the track. She went from second entering the third run to 10th entering the last, way out of medal contention.\n\nAnd that meant, for the fourth run, Taubitz didn't even have to get into fourth gear. With a lead of 0.704 seconds going into the final heat, there was no doubt that Taubitz would get gold.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Norwegian biathlete Sturla Holm Laegreid confessed on live television to cheating on his girlfriend moments after winning bronze in the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who won his first individual Olympic medal in the 20km individual biathlon at Milan-Cortina, admitted he had an affair three months ago and called it \"my biggest mistake\".\n\nLaegreid said it had been \"the worst week of my life\" since he told his girlfriend of six months about the affair.\n\n\"There's someone I wanted to share it with who might not be watching,\" he told NRK, Norway's state broadcaster., external\n\n\"Six months ago I met the love of my life - the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her.\n\n\"Sport has come second these last few days. Yes, I wish I could share this with her.\"\n\nHe later told Norwegian newspaper VG: \"My only way to solve it is to tell everything and put everything on the table, and hope that she can still love me.\n\n\"I've done that for her, and now for the whole world. I have nothing to lose.\n\n\"I want to be a good role model, but I have to admit when I make mistakes.\"\n\nThe seven-time world champion finished third in the biathlon - which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting - behind champion Johan-Olav Botn, a fellow Norwegian, and Eric Perrot of France.\n\nIt is a second Olympic medal for Laegreid, who won gold in the relay at the 2022 Games.\n\nAsked about his admission in the news conference later, he added: \"Of course, now I hope I didn't ruin Johan's day.\n\n\"I don't know if it was the right choice or not, but it was the choice I made.\n\n\"I made the choice to tell the world what I did so maybe there's a chance she will see what she really means to me - maybe not, but I don't want to think I didn't try everything to get her back.\n\n\"I don't want to steal the show. I hope this is just like a day-or-two thing. Then you are an Olympic gold medallist forever.\"\n\nBotn shouted the name of late team-mate Sivert Guttorm Bakken as he crossed the line to win gold.\n\nBakken was found dead on 23 December in a hotel room in northern Italy, about two hours from where the biathlon was held.\n\n\"I was racing with him the entire last loop. And, yeah, it was more like a feeling of crossing the finish line together, and seeing the number one beside my name was really special,\" an emotional Botn said.\n\nLaegreid added: \"We were five guys on the start line, and one of them was watching from above.

    "fullText": "Danny O'Shea and Ellie Kam tell PEOPLE about their hard-earned road to Olympic gold\n\nThe pair talk about how they didn't let O'Shea's broken foot or Kam's concussion get in their way\n\nThe pair won gold in the figure skating team event on Feb. 8\n\nJust several months ago, Team USA figure skaters Danny O’Shea and Ellie Kam’s dreams of winning gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics were in jeopardy.\n\nO’Shea, 34, was fresh off surgery for a broken foot — and as soon as he returned to the ice, Kam, 21, suffered a major concussion when she fell to the ice on her head, leaving her sidelined for a month. Still, the duo persevered, and on Feb. 8, took home a gold medal in the team event, proving that sometimes, believing in yourself is the best medicine.\n\n“This whole season has been a lot of ups and downs for both Danny and I,” Kam, 21, tells PEOPLE at the Starbucks Winter House on Monday, Feb. 9 after their win. “We had a lot of injuries in the offseason and coming into this year, you know what it would mean to perform well and make it to an Olympic team and have the chance to represent the country. You want that so bad… and at times it felt like we were so far away from that end goal, and it felt like we were getting farther instead of closer.”\n\nThe pair’s roller coaster journey first started to go off the rails in March, when O’Shea broke his foot doing off-ice jumps just 48 hours before he and Kam left for the 2025 World Championships. They finished seventh, which helped earn Team USA a third Olympic spot in Milan, but O’Shea had to undergo surgery afterward, and needed two plates and 11 screws, according to U.S. Figure Skating.\n\nThen, on July 18, just weeks after O’Shea returned from his injury, Kam suffered one of the worst concussions of her life when she fell on her head during practice, which kept her off the ice for a month. She and O'Shea were forced to pull out of a major opportunity in August, and withdrew from a competition in New York in September. The two weren't back on the ice competing at a top level until October — just four months before the Olympics.\n\n“[Talk about] resilience. Not just pure hard work, but overcoming another roadblock, another roadblock, another roadblock. We got disheartened for sure,” O’Shea tells PEOPLE. “But [we were] not allowing that to stop us from continuing forward.”\n\nKam adds that she and O’Shea, who have been skating together since 2022, kept their eyes on the prize, and maintained a positive attitude despite all that life threw at them.\n\n“I think that we did such a good job at staying together as a team and trusting the process. We had a competition that was really rough in the beginning, but I think that that was all just part of the plan,” she says. “In order to get to the high point of success, you have to go through the nitty-gritty, the dirty… It just makes me even more proud of wearing this medal around our neck, because I know what type of work it has taken us to get here. We worked so hard.”\n\nThe two were a major part of Team USA’s team event win, earning seven team points for their pair skating routine. They ultimately took home medals alongside teammates Madison Chock, Evan Bates, Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin.\n\nO'Shea and Kam will aim to add to their medal collection on Monday, in the final night of the pairs skating competition.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "title": "All About the New Sport and Medal Events Featured at the 2026 Olympics",
    "description": "Ski mountaineering is making its debut at the 2026 Winter Olympics",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics kicked off on Feb. 6 and will feature several returning sports\n\nIn addition to traditional events, the Games will also introduce the new sport of ski mountaineering\n\nMany women's and team events have also been added to existing sports\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics is introducing the first new sport in nearly three decades!\n\nIn addition to adding various medals and events within existing sports, the Olympics added ski mountaineering to its roster for the 2026 Milan Cortina Games. The sport, which is also called \"skimo,\" is a combination of mountain climbing and skiing.\n\nWhile ski mountaineering is the only official new sport, the 2026 Games also introduced a variety of medal opportunities in the men's, women's and team categories for a number of existing sports. Between the new sport and fresh events, there are a total of 10 additional medals up for grabs.\n\nHere's everything to know about the new sport and medal events at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nSki mountaineering is the only new sport to join the 2026 Winter Olympics. The sport, which is also referred to as \"skimo,\" is a skiing event that combines climbing and skiing on mountains.\n\nAthletes must maneuver through the challenging rugged course while attaching and unassembling their skis over and over again.\n\n\"The concept of ski mountaineering is fairly simple: Competitors climb up a mountain on skis and by foot, then descend on skis. Whoever crosses the finish line first wins,\" Team USA wrote in a description. \"Athletes follow a designed course throughout the race, and they must navigate terrain that is more rugged than that in a traditional cross-country or alpine ski race.\"\n\nThe 2026 Olympics will include three medal events within ski mountaineering: men's sprint, women's sprint and mixed gender relay. The sprints will cover over 250 feet of elevation where athletes will race up and down the designated course in just a few minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, the mixed gender relay occurs on a longer course of around 500 feet and features one male and one female athlete taking turns running the course.\n\nThe ski mountaineering competitions will be held in the Valtellina Valley town of Bormio, which is the same location as alpine skiing. The sprints are scheduled for Feb. 19, while the mixed gender relay will take place on Feb. 21. Team USA has two athletes, Anna Gibson and Cam Smith, who qualified in December 2025 for both the mixed gender relay team and individual sprints.\n\nFreestyle skiing has been an Olympics medaling sport ever since it was introduced in the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, but it has expanded with two medal events — men's and women's dual moguls — for 2026.\n\nUnlike traditional moguls in freestyle skiing, the dual moguls feature a total of 30 athletes broken down into brackets of two athletes competing side-by-side at a time. In every bracket, the two designated skiers directly compete against each other as they perform tricks and run down the set course.\n\nAfter they embark on simultaneous runs, the skiers are judged against each other on the same factors as traditional moguls — including turns, speed and air. The winner is determined by judges — who all have five votes they can divide between the athletes — and whomever has the most votes moves on to the next round.\n\nFor the Milan Cortina Olympics, the same athletes will be competing in both traditional moguls and dual moguls, so all 30 qualified competitors have two chances to win a medal, per NBC Olympics. The Team USA mogul skiers include Olivia Giaccio, Tess Johnson, Jaelin Kauf, Liz Lemley, Charlie Mickel, Nick Page, Dylan Walczyk and Landon Wendler.\n\nThe women's dual moguls finals are scheduled for Feb. 14 and the men's finals are slated for the following day, Feb. 15.\n\nAnother medal event that viewers will witness for the first time is the women's doubles luge. The sport has been a staple at the Winter Olympics ever since the 1964 Games and included men's singles, women's singles and doubles.\n\nAlthough women were not explicitly ineligible from the doubles portion of the event, no women had previously competed, and it had traditionally been a men's event.\n\nThe women's double luge will resemble the men's in that two athletes will team up and lie on their back while riding a single sled and steering it with their bodies at extremely high speeds. Similar to other luge events, the team with the lowest cumulative time after two separate runs wins.\n\nLongtime partners Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby will make history by representing Team USA in the historic event on Feb. 11.\n\nSkelton, the high-speed sledding event where athletes lie on their stomach and race head-first down an icy course, was first introduced in the Winter Olympics in 1928 but wasn't included as an official sport until 2002, with both men's and women's events.\n\nFor the first time since then, skeleton has launched a mixed team relay. The new event features pairs made up of one man and one woman from the same country. In a single heat, the woman will begin the course before the man immediately follows.\n\nBoth individual times are combined into a final team time, and the lowest time among competitors wins. Team members Mystique Ro and Austin Florian will be competing on behalf of the U.S. on Feb. 15.\n\nAnother sport that has added a women's event is the large hill ski jumping program. The men's large hill event has been a signature sport at the Games ever since the inaugural Winter Olympic Games in 1924.\n\nThe men's normal hill event was later added in 1964, and the women's portion of that competition emerged in 2014. However, the women's large hill event was absent until the 2026 Games.\n\nThe women's large hill ski jumping event features female athletes launching themselves from a large ramp (around 400 feet tall). A panel of judges determine the winners based on several factors, including distance, speed and style.\n\nAnnika Belshaw, Paige Jones and Josie Johnson will compete in the inaugural ski jumping event with Team USA on Feb. 15.\n\nAlpine skiing, which has been part of the Olympics since 1936, introduced a team combined medal event in 2026.\n\nThe team event consists of two athletes working together to race two runs: a downhill and a slalom. One member of the team races the downhill, while the other takes on the slalom. The pair with the fastest cumulative time takes home the gold.\n\nThe new event replaced the super combined event, which showcased just one athlete competing in both portions of the race. The 2026 Olympics will include an event for both women and men's teams.\n\nThe men's inaugural event, which took place on Feb. 9 at the Stelvio Ski Centre, resulted in Switzerland's Franjo von Allmen and Tanguy Nef winning gold. Team USA duo Kyle Negomir and River Radamus competed and placed 16th.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's events, held on Feb. 10, will feature Team USA pairs Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin, Jacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan and Keely Cashman and AJ Hurt.",

    "description": "Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni slams anti-Olympics protesters as 'enemies of Italy and Italians'.",
    "fullText": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has condemned anti-Olympics protesters as “enemies of Italy and Italians” after violence on the fringes of rallies in Milan and the alleged sabotage of train infrastructure.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also joined the criticism on Sunday, condemning violence linked to the protests in Milan on Saturday, stating such behaviour has no place at the Games.\n\nThe incidents ⁠happened on the first full day of competition in the Winter Games that Milan is hosting along with the Alpine town of Cortina d’Ampezzo.\n\nMeloni praised thousands of Italians who are working to keep the Games running smoothly, many of whom are volunteers.\n\n“Then there are those who are enemies of Italy and Italians. The protesters demonstrate ‘against the Olympics,’ causing these images to end up on televisions around the world. After others cut the railway cables to prevent the trains from leaving,” the prime minister wrote in a statement on Facebook on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian Transport Ministry said that an investigation into suspected “terrorism” had been launched after the railway sabotage near the city of Bologna on Saturday and that those responsible would face a multimillion-euro damages claim.\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in Milan on Saturday to protest against the Olympics’ environmental and social consequences, including concerns over excessive public spending and ecological damage.\n\nThe march, which began peacefully, turned tense when some protesters set off smoke bombs and firecrackers near Olympic venues. Milan police responded with tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds, leading to clashes in areas close to the Olympic Village and a nearby highway.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams told reporters on Sunday that peaceful protest is legitimate, but “we draw a line at violence”, which “has no place at the Olympic Games”.\n\nSeparately, protesters have also rallied against Israel’s participation in the games and against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which has deployed agents to provide security to the US delegation at the Games.\n\nDuring Friday’s opening ceremony, Israel’s small delegation marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium to a smattering of “boos” from the crowds. The four Israeli athletes, waving their national flag and smiling, saw the jeers quickly drowned out by the loud music and overall festive atmosphere.\n\nUnited States Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Second Lady Usha Vance, received a similar hostile reception when they appeared on the stadium’s big screen.",

    "fullText": "Milan-Cortina 2026 organisers have \"identified\" a reason for the spate of broken medals at the Winter Olympics and said any athletes affected will have theirs fixed.\n\nTwo of the USA's gold medallists, Breezy Johnson and Alysa Liu, revealed the ribbons had come away from their medals soon after they received them.\n\nJohnson, who won gold in the women's downhill alpine skiing, showed her broken medal at the post-event news conference.\n\n\"So there's the medal. And there's the ribbon,\" she said. \"And here's the little piece that is supposed to go into the ribbon to hold the medal, and yeah, it came apart.\"\n\nLiu highlighted a similar issue in a video on social media after she won gold as part of the USA's squad in the figure skating team event.\n\nThe video shows Liu holding up her medal and the ribbon in separate hands, with the text: \"My medal don't need the ribbon.\"\n\nThe issue also affected the German team who won bronze in the biathlon. An Instagram video shows one of the athletes' medals falling from the ribbon as they jumped up and down in celebration at the team hotel.\n\nGames organisers said on Monday they were giving the problem \"maximum attention\" and have now confirmed they have found a fix.\n\nDramatic or distracting?

Athletes whose medals have been affected are encouraged to return them through the appropriate channels so that they can be promptly repaired and returned.\n\n\"Milan-Cortina 2026 remains fully committed to ensuring that medals, which represent the pinnacle of every athlete's journey, meet the highest standards of quality and care.\"\n\nBBC Sport has asked organisers what the exact issue with the medals was, and what the precise nature of the fix is.\n\nThis is not the first time the quality of medals awarded at Olympic Games has been called into question.\n\nAs of February 2025, a total of 220 requests have been made to replace medals won at the 2024 Summer Games because of wear and tear.\n\nDiver Yasmin Harper, who won Team GB's first medal in Paris, was among the athletes to notice her medal was showing signs of \"tarnishing\".\n\nParis 2024 organisers said any damaged medals would be replaced.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "U.S. short-track speed skaters look to get back on the podium at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics after being shut out in Beijing in 2022.",
    "fullText": "The American short-track speed skating team will look to get back on the podium at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics after being shutout at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.\n\nEight short-track speeders will represent Team USA in Milano Cortina, including five returning Olympians (Kristen Santos-Griswold, Corinne Stoddard, Julie Letai, Eunice Lee and Andrew Heo) and three first-timers (Kamryn Lute, Brandon Kim and Clayton DeClemente). The U.S. has won 20 Olympic medals in short-track speed skating, most recently John-Henry Krueger's silver in the 1000m at the 2018 PyeongChang Games.\n\nShort-track speed skating was staged as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Calgary Winter Games and officially made its Olympic debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games. The 2000m mixed team relay was added to the program at the 2022 Beijing Games.\n\nUnlike speed skating, where athletes race against the clock, short-track speed skating pits racers against each other, highlighting the importance of strategy in this event. Short-track speed skating, takes place on a shorter track (111.12 meters long) like the name suggests, compared to a speed skating track (400 meters long).\n\nThere will be nine short-track speed skating medal events in Milano Cortina:\n\n2000m mixed team relay: Each team consists of two women and two men.\n\nKristen Santos-Griswol: Santos-Griswold was in medal contention in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Olympics when she was bumped by an opponent and fell. She finished just off the podium in fourth place and contemplated retirement. Santos-Griswol, 31, came back strong and won five medals at the 2024 World Championships, including a 1000m gold, to become the first U.S. skater to win medals at three individual distances (500m, 1,000m, 1,500m) at one world competition. She won her first Crystal Globe for the 2024-25 season, which is awarded to the best overall skater.\n\nCorinne Stoddard: The 24-year-old is looking to improve upon her seventh-place finish in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Stoddard won three medals at the 2024 World Championships and finished the 2025-26 World Tour second overall after winning eight individual medals (3 silver, 5 bronze).\n\nSantos-Griswol and Stoddard will look to dethrone Italian Arianna Fontana, who's set to compete in her sixth Olympics. Fontana has 11 Olympic medals to her name, including back-to-back golds in the 500m. Don't count out South Korea, which leads all countries with 53 total short-track speed skating Olympic medals and 26 gold.\n\nThe 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics are here! \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Short-track speed skating at 2026 Milano Cortina: US stars to watch",

    "fullText": "The big story over the weekend at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi was Lindsey Vonn’s crash in the women’s downhill on Sunday. For Vonn, her Olympic experience in Milan was not supposed to end this way after an iconic career that saw her be one of the best female alpine skiing speed racers of all-time. The crash was simply spectacular, and the 41-year-old Olympic gold medalist from Saint Paul, Minnesota was heard screaming on the course as she was lifted by helicopter.\n\nWith the injury to Vonn, will many sports fans remember who won the Olympic gold medal in the women’s downhill? It just so happened to be another American in Breezy Johnson of Jackson, Wyoming.\n\nInside look at Johnson’s Olympic gold\n\nJohnson posted a winning time of 1:36.10. Emma Aicher of Germany won the silver medal with a time of 1:36.14. Sofia Goggia of Italy won the bronze medal with a time of 1:36.69. Johnson reached the podium by 0.86 seconds over Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon, and Cornelia Hutter of Austria, as they both had a fourth place time of 1:36.96.\n\nAt age 30, this is the first Olympic gold medal for Johnson in her impressive skiing career. She previously won two gold medals at the Alpine Skiing World Championships in Saalbach, Austria. Johnson won gold in the women’s downhill, and gold in the women’s team combined with another American icon in women’s alpine skiing, Mikaela Shiffrin of Vail, Colorado. Due to the fact that Johnson has been a big performance skier in the past, the Olympic gold medal in Cortina should not have been much of a surprise–even to Snoop Dogg, who was watching the women’s downhill with Lindsey’s father.\n\nUSA has two gold medals to date\n\nJohnson’s gold medal is one of two medals for the United States so far. They also placed first in the team figure skating competition. The Americans beat Italy by a single point. The Americans were led by quad and backflip artist Ilia Malinin in the men’s event, and ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates in ice dance.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympics: Did the Lindsey Vonn crash overshadow Breezy Johnson’s Olympic gold? appeared first on The Big Lead.",

I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it.\n\n\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets.\n\n\"Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget. Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself.\"\n\nVonn crashed in Switzerland in the final race before the Olympics nine days before competing in the downhill event in Italy.\n\nIn a media conference on Wednesday, she confirmed she had torn her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) but expressed determination to compete.\n\nThe two-time world champion says the torn ACL and her previous injuries, including a partial right knee replacement, \"had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever\".\n\nVonn's decision to race has led to widespread praise for her bravery but also criticism about the dangers and potential risk of permanent damage.\n\n\"It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport. And similar to ski racing, we take risks in life,\" she said.\n\n\"We dream. We love. We jump. And sometimes we fall. Sometimes our hearts are broken. Sometimes we don't achieve the dreams we know we could have. But that is also the beauty of life; we can try.\n\n\"I hope if you take away anything from my journey it's that you all have the courage to dare greatly.

    "fullText": "On Sunday, Lindsey Vonn courageously took part in the Tofane downhill run in Cortina d’Ampezzo, despite recently suffering a torn ACL.\n\nVonn [pictured below], who had come out of a five-year retirement to compete in her fifth Games, was looking to win her third Olympic medal.\n\nHowever, her journey at the Milano-Cortina event came to an end sooner than she would have hoped.\n\nThe 41-year-old was looking to become the oldest athlete to win a medal in the downhill event. Unfortunately for the American star, her dreams were ended when she crashed 12 seconds into her run.\n\nThe American has since undergone surgery after suffering a broken leg, and numerous athletes have sent messages of support.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the ATP number one, posted a short message on his Instagram story in support of the 41-year-old downhill skier.\n\nThe Spaniard said: “We’re thinking of you Lindsey Vonn!”\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising to see Carlos Alcaraz commenting on such an issue. Since making his debut on the ATP Tour in 2020, the Spaniard has demonstrated that he is one of the most compassionate and relatable figures on the professional tennis circuit.\n\nAs an example, Alcaraz sent a heartfelt message to Jannik Sinner after the Italian was forced to retire from the 2025 Cincinnati Open final due to illness.\n\nHe said: “I’m so sorry for Jannik!\n\n“Nobody likes to win because their opponent retires, especially in a final like this. Wishing you a speedy recovery!”\n\nNorwegian skier Kajsa Vickhoff Lie, who finished seventh, revealed why Vonn crashed on Sunday.\n\nAs reported by The Guardian, she said: “It is a critical section, because it’s in the beginning, and you really need a lot of speed coming out of it.\n\n“It’s super flat after it, so the goal is to be as close to that gate as possible. She really nailed the turn, but she was too close to it, so she was hooked into it.\n\n“But that’s how it is with the Olympics – you really want to be at the limit, and she was a little bit over the limit.”\n\nBreezy Johnson, Vonn’s compatriot, won the downhill gold medal after posting a time of 1min 36.10sec, fending off Germany’s Emma Aicher\n\nAs for Vonn, her career as an Olympic downhill skier is likely over. Despite the crash, the American can take pride in her efforts and reflect positively on a career in which she won three Olympic medals – including one gold medal.",

I struggled to accept how close it was, but I know I've got \n\nIn a final that demonstrated the strength of women's freestyle skiing, Mathilde Gremaud successfully defended her Olympic title by only 0.38 points.\n\nChina's Eileen Gu - the world's fourth highest-paid female athlete in 2025 but arguably a bigger star off the slopes through her modelling and brand endorsements - took silver, but crashed on her final run to allow Gremaud a victory lap.\n\nGremaud soaked up her moment, a Switzerland flag tied around her neck and billowing in the wind as she floated down the course.\n\nMuir is one of Team GB's best medal hopes at the Milan-Cortina Games, and has another shot at the podium when she competes in the big air starting on Saturday.\n\n\"I just need to have a moment to process. I don't want to dwell on it too much,\" she said.\n\n\"I've got at least a day or so until I hit the big air. I'm going to go through this, accept it and try and find the positives that I can from it, and then completely reset because the big air is just a completely different competition.\"\n\nFour years ago in Beijing, Scotland's Muir was GB's youngest competitor at 17 and finished fifth in the big air and eighth in the slopestyle.\n\nAfter those Games, Muir achieved three World Cup podiums, but in December 2023 an MRI scan showed she had been competing with a fully torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).\n\nAn operation followed in early 2024, as well as surgery on a shoulder problem that had troubled her for some time.\n\nEleven months later she was back on snow, and her maiden World Cup gold arrived in Tignes in March 2025.\n\nTwo more have followed this season, as well as slopestyle gold and big air silver at the invitation-only X Games on the eve of the Olympics.\n\nMuir was likely to be back at the snow park to watch team-mate and close friend Mia Brookes tackle the snowboard big air final, which starts at 18:30 GMT.\n\nBrookes, one of the biggest names in her sport as a world champion and two-time X Games gold medallist, qualified in third.\n\nCurlers Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds could secure a place in the gold medal mixed doubles final when they face Sweden in the semi-final in Milan from 17:05.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team look at why one figure skating coach was seen wearing two different national team jackets.",
    "fullText": "Eagle-eyed viewers of figure skating may have thought they were seeing double when French coach Benoit Richaud was pictured wearing the jackets of both Canada and Georgia within the space of 15 minutes on Sunday evening.\n\nRichaud, 38, is a coach and choreographer who is working with 16 different skaters at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, with those athletes coming from a total of 13 different countries.\n\nCoaching this combination of athletes from different countries in the same event led to Richaud being caught on camera wearing two different team jackets during the team event final in a short space of time.\n\nHe was first pictured in the crowd sporting a jacket of the Georgia national team in support of Nika Egadze.\n\nLess than 15 minutes later, Richaud was again spotted in the crowd - only this time he was wearing a Canada team jacket to support Stephen Gogolev, another one of his athletes.\n\n\"It's an organisation. It's going to be fast,\" Richaud told BBC's More Than the Score podcast.\n\n\"It's actually very demanding emotionally because, you know, depending on [how it goes]. Let's imagine everything is fine and beautiful and everyone skates good, very easy.\n\n\"If one skates bad, then the other one skates good, you have this peak of emotion that is very difficult to express because it's something like when you are with your skater, you are fully with them.\n\n\"Thank God they are not one after the other one... then it's very, very difficult.\n\n\"People laugh because I'm always wearing black. And now everyone is like, how it's possible we see Benoit with different colours?\"\n\nThere are a lot of logistics involved in switching between coaching and supporting athletes from different nations in quick succession - including the ability to change which jacket Richaud is wearing at quick notice.\n\n\"I usually put everything in the dressing room of the skater,\" the French choreographer said. \"Usually, I'm not allowed but they let me put some stuff [in there]. They very friendly.\n\n\"If not, we always have like a team leader or the manager of the national team who keeps the jackets and they give it to me.\"\n\nAmong Richaud's skaters also include Spanish athlete Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate, who has become popular at the Olympics due to his performance in tribute to the Minions films.\n\nRichaud's popularity as a coach is no surprise when you look at his track record to date.\n\nAs a skater, he won the Junior French Championships while skating in partnership with Elodie Brouiller in 2005-06.\n\nThree years later, Richaud also finished third at senior level at this competition in partnership with Canada's Terry Findlay.\n\nBut it is as a coach and choreographer where Richaud has found more success.\n\nAt the 2024 ISU Skating Awards, he was named Best Figure Skater Choreographer, an award he was also shortlisted for in 2025.\n\nOf the five skaters in Sunday's men's final, two being coached by Richaud is a testament to how he is rated in the sport.\n\nWhile all athletes are representing their own countries, in figure skating they tend to be coached individually rather than per nation.\n\nRichaud is a prime example of this, with his 16 athletes coming from 13 different countries.\n\nRules allow coaches to work with athletes from multiple different nations, even if they are competing against each other.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat is the difference between bobsleigh, skeleton and luge?\n\nWhich country is the most successful at the Winter Olympics?\n\nHow are points scored in snowboard big air?\n\nWhen and where will 2030 Winter Olympics be held?",

If I don’t land, then I get to make history as the first person to ever try this trick in such a situation. It’s a decision that I would be super proud of and live with forever.”\n\nShe'll be trying to add more medals to her collection at these Olympics.

Seven players have scored for Team USA, with Alex Carpenter, Hayley Scamurra and Hilary Knight netting two goals apiece.\n\nKnight's goal against Finland was the 14th of her Olympic career, tying the U.S. record shared by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. If the captain scores again in Milan, she'll stake sole claim to the record.\n\nThe Swiss opened the tournament with a shootout win over Czechia but fell 4-0 to Canada on Saturday. The U.S. will try to dismiss them in similar fashion ahead of Tuesday's showdown to end group play.\n\nHere's how to watch all the action from Milan.\n\nUSA vs. Switzerland will air live on USA Network with Kenny Albert on play-by-play and AJ Mleczko providing analysis. Fans can stream the game on Peacock, which will carry every event of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics live.\n\nThe NBC-owned streaming service's sports programming features live coverage of NFL Sunday Night Football, the NBA, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Premier League soccer, Big Ten football and basketball, Notre Dame football, Big East and Big 12 basketball, PGA Tour golf, and more.\n\nThe USA vs. Switzerland game is set to begin at 2:40 p.m. ET, or 8:40 p.m. local time in Milan.

    "description": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's behaviour towards her pupils was branded \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it was hard to see her returning - but she is back for Milan-Cortina 2026.",
    "fullText": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's \"tremendous coldness\" was described as \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it may have been hard to imagine her returning to her sport's biggest stage.\n\nFour years later, the highly successful coach is at Milan-Cortina - and not everyone is happy about it.\n\nTutberidze and her training methods were under the spotlight at Beijing 2022 amid the Kamila Valieva doping scandal that rocked the Games, and it was the then-IOC president Thomas Bach who gave the stinging assessment of the coach.\n\nRather than comforting 15-year-old gold medal favourite Valieva when she left the ice in tears after falling several times, Tutberidze had instead asked the youngster \"why did you stop fighting?\"\n\nBach said he had been \"very, very disturbed\" by what he had seen and that it did not give him \"much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past, nor as far as it concerns the future\".\n\nWell, that future is here and so too is Tutberidze.\n\nNot only is Tutberidze back at the Olympics, but she is apparently coach to another Russian teenage medal hope.\n\nThat skater is 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, who is here as a neutral athlete (AIN) as Russia's team are banned from the Games because of the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Tutberidze is not officially listed as the teenager's coach in the media guide for these Games and it remains to be seen whether she will be at rinkside when Petrosian competes.\n\nWhoever she is with, there will be many eyes on Tutberidze, with the shadow of Valieva and Beijing 2022 set to loom large.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTutberidze's official coaching role is with the Georgia figure skating team and she was at Milano Ice Skating Arena for the team event to watch one of her longest-serving pupils, Nika Egadze.\n\nEgadze stormed to victory at the 2026 European Championships in Sheffield, where Tutberidze shared a warm hug with her skater after a gold medal-winning performance, and other athletes spoke positively about the coach.\n\nIt was a different story at Milano Ice Skating Arena as Egadze endured two error-strewn routines, with Georgia missing out on a medal.\n\nIn the short programme he made two early errors, failing to land the triple toe loop in his first technical element.\n\nAs he continued his performance, the TV cameras caught Tutberidze in passing - standing at rinkside, arms folded.\n\nEgadze did enough to pull the performance around and help earn Georgia fifth place in qualifying, progressing to the final. When he came off the ice, the hug from Tutberidze seemed curt.\n\nShe joined the Georgian squad as they waited for the results. Generally, waiting teams will laugh and joke, even if they know elimination is coming.\n\nInstead, the 11 skaters and team members sat stony-faced as the scores were announced.\n\nIf this was an indicator of the atmosphere in the team, it is certainly not positive, but it may have just been a moment of nervous focus.\n\nPerhaps Tutberidze was minding her body language on Sunday as Egadze struggled even \n\nHis coach gave him a pat on the hand as the numbers came in. Despite Egadze scoring only 154.79 for the free skate - 27 points lower than his season best - there was no berating.\n\nThe attention comes at a Games which began for Georgia with their team being roundly booed in San Siro when they entered the stadium during the opening ceremony.\n\nOfficial views on Tutberidze's presence in Milan vary.\n\nGiven she has not been personally implicated in any doping scandals and has not broken any rules, Tutberidze has every right to be at the Olympics.\n\nShe has rejected any suggestions of wrongdoing in her career as a coach and said in 2022 she was baffled by Bach's remarks.\n\n\"There was an investigation at the time and no issues were found that could be actioned against that individual,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a media conference on Sunday.\n\n\"If you are going to take action against someone, you need evidence, and from what I gather there isn't any.\"\n\nHowever, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) president Witold Banka said on Thursday he does not \"feel comfortable with her presence here\",, external while Britain's 1980 Olympic champion and BBC pundit Robin Cousins was unequivocal in his disdain.\n\n\"This comes down to the International Olympic Committee and International Skating Union - coaches are not part of the team,\" Cousins told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So when they ban a team, the coach of said team is not part of that. That is not correct, as far as I am concerned. I would not have her anywhere near Milan, personally.\n\n\"Is that because of behaviour, or Russia being banned? All of the above.\n\n\"The way we watched everything unfold, someone has to take the blame. Any skater would say the most important person is the coach; you trust them, you give yourself to them. That is not how you treat a student.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, a television documentary - The Tutberidze Method - was released in Russia, celebrating her track record in training medal winners.\n\nTwo of Tutberidze's skaters have won women's gold and silver medals at the past two Olympics, but both were amid drama.\n\nAs the Valieva saga played out, Beijing 2022 champion Anna Shcherbakova was left barely celebrating victory – later saying she felt \"emptiness\" – while silver medallist Alexandra Trusova was so disappointed to miss out on gold that she said before the medal ceremony that she never wanted to skate again.\n\nFour years before that, in 2018, favourite Evgenia Medvedeva was sobbing after being upstaged by 15-year-old training partner Alina Zagitova.\n\nIn the run-up to those two Games, Tutberidze's skaters had been hot favourites, dominating the World Championships and European Championships.\n\nLittle has been seen of Petrosian recently on the international stage because of Russia's ban from competition. The only real sighting of her was at September's qualifying event in Beijing, where she won gold, but not all the top skaters were there.\n\nPetrosian has also won the past three national championships – making it 11 years in a row for Tutberidze skaters – and she is the first woman to land a quadruple loop in competition, but she was injured last year and has struggled with errors this season.\n\nFollowing the Valieva episode, the minimum age for competitors was raised from 15 to 17, an age that has not been far off retirement age for some of Tutberidze's skaters in the past because of a combination of injury and a drop in technical skills.\n\nIt has been reported that her training model centres around female skaters peaking before they hit puberty., external\n\nItalian Daniel Grassl, who went to work with Tutberidze in Moscow in 2023, described her as a \"very good\" coach, adding: \"She can be a little bit cold but she was warm with us, and was supporting us.\"\n\nValieva, a mercurial talent who performances drew worldwide attention, was eventually banned for four years over her failed drugs test, but there were no sanctions for any of her entourage.\n\nHer team have always insisted the failed test - for heart medication trimetazidine - was the result of contaminated cutlery which had been tainted by her grandfather's medication, while Wada called for those behind the failed test to face justice because \"the doping of children is unforgivable\".\n\n\"Wada is not behind the decision to accredit the coach [for Milan-Cortina],\" Banka said. \"The investigation found no evidence this person [Tutberidze] engaged in the topic, so there is no legal basis to exclude her.\"\n\nValieva, now 19, has only just returned to skating, finishing sixth in the semi-finals of the Russian Jump Championships last week. She is no longer coached by Tutberidze.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

It was an exercise in why sanctioned sport is healthy for the world, as both sides were able to express their dissatisfaction by hurling fists at each other.\n\nIt was a moment that set the sports world on fire.\n\nThe Canadiens got the last swing and landed the knockout blow by winning the Four Nations tournament in an American barn.

Or as the official IIHF rules state:\n\nThat doesn’t take it entirely off the table, but I highly doubt anyone is willing to risk suspension from the first games involving NHL players in over 10 years. It feels like there is just too much to lose in this tournament.\n\nAfter 12 years, the NHL's biggest stars are finally back on the Olympic stage. 🏒\n\nHere's what it means to some of the players ready to make history. ✨ pic.twitter.com/IPVYJ7YEmS\n\n— The Olympic Games (@Olympics) February 5, 2026\n\nWe know Matthew Tkachuk has his eyes on the prize after this quote in a Sports Illustrated article by Pat Forde, “I’ve had two dreams in my professional life—win a Stanley Cup and win an Olympic gold medal. I’ve got the first.”\n\nFormer Team Canada focal point Rick Nash told FOX News, “As a player, I can guarantee you, the only thing on your mind is a gold medal. You don’t care if it’s Norway, Latvia, the US, or whoever.”\n\nWe might not see the staged fights, but one thing is for certain.\n\nThis hockey tournament is going to be a grueling physical battle, and they will only play one anthem when it’s time to hand out the hardware.\n\nThat moment will feature copious amounts of glory and pride, but standing on the silver or bronze level could be an unforgettable but painful memory. I don’t think I’m speaking out of turn when I say it’s gold or nothing for these competitors.

She rolled over multiple times before coming to a stop on her back.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic champion could be heard crying out in distress as medical staff attended her on the slope. The BBC reporter and former Olympian, Chemmy Alcott, said background music had to be played to the stunned crowd because it was \"uncomfortable\" for spectators watching on.\n\nCompatriot Breezy Johnson, who had set the fastest time, was in tears as she watched on from the paddock near the finish line. Johnson was later confirmed as Olympic champion.\n\nThe following brief statement was offered by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard team: \"Lindsey Vonn fell in the Olympic downhill and will be evaluated by medical staff.\"\n\nLater on Sunday, the U.S. Ski team released an updated statement that Vonn did in fact sustain an injury during her crash, but that she is in stable condition:\n\nUpdate: Lindsey Vonn sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.\n\n— U.S. Ski & Snowboard Team (@usskiteam) February 8, 2026\n\nVonn was eventually airlifted off the slope by a helicopter, at which point she received a standing ovation.

According to the BBC, the doctor who performed Vonn's knee surgery travelled in the helicopter.\n\nGraham Bell, a five-time Olympic skier, said: \"I had Vonn down for a medal. I would have done the exact same thing in Vonn's position, I would have raced.\n\n\"It can be done, she was doing it, she was fast in training, she took the risk and it didn't pay off.\"\n\nAustrian skier Nina Ortlieb also crashed in her run, although she was able to land safely and proceed to the finish line. Cande Moreno then fell heavily at the top of the course and appeared to have badly hurt her knee.\n\nLindsey Vonn saw promising results in her two practice runs, but she suffered a brutal crash early in her run on Sunday and had to be airlifted via helicopter for medical attention.\n\n🚨🇺🇸 American Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn airlifted by helicopter after crashing in downhill skiing.\n\nVonn came out of retirement to compete again at 41.

    "fullText": "MILAN — The 2026 Winter Games are off to a promising start for host nation Italy with gold, silver and bronze on the first day of medal events.\n\nBut it was Switzerland’s Franjo Von Allmen who captured the first gold medal of the Milan Cortina Olympics on Saturday.\n\nThere were no Americans on the podium, though Lindsey Vonn impressed in her second training run ahead of the women’s downhill on Sunday.\n\nItalian speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida celebrated her 35th birthday by winning the host nation’s first gold medal of these Olympics — in the 3,000 meters. It’s also Italy’s first gold in women’s speedskating at any Winter Games.\n\nCompeting in her fourth Olympics, Lollobrigida outskated Ragne Wiklund of Norway for her first Olympic gold after winning silver and bronze in Beijing four years ago.\n\nHer great aunt was the late Gina Lollobrigida, a star actress of the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nItaly had a strong day on the slopes, as well, with Alpine skiers Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris taking silver and bronze, respectively, in the men’s downhill — the first medal event of the Games.\n\nHowever, neither could beat Von Allmen’s time of 1 minute, 51.61 seconds in Bormio.\n\nThe 24-year-old Swiss skier was the leader after his downhill run, but the wait for his rivals to finish was nerve-racking.\n\n“I tried to enjoy the moment, but I didn’t quite realize what was going on today,” von Allmen said after his first Olympic race.\n\nParis, 36, was delighted with his bronze after coming away empty-handed in his four previous Olympics.\n\n“It’s my fifth Olympics, and getting the first medal in front of the home crowd, that’s really special,” Paris said.\n\nIn Cortina, Lindsey Vonn completed another downhill training run and was set for Sunday’s medal race despite tearing her left ACL a little more than a week ago.\n\nThe 41-year-old American crossed the line in third position and told The Associated Press “all good.”\n\nShe has been wearing a large brace on her injured knee.\n\nYuma Kagiyama landed near-perfect quads and scored 108.67 points in his short program to help Japan put pressure on the defending champion U.S. in the figure skating team event.\n\nMalinin, the two-time reigning world champion, was second with 98.00.\n\nBut a brilliant free skate by Madison Chock and Evan Bates pushed the U.S. score to 44 points — five more than Japan ahead of the men’s, women’s and pairs free skates to decide the medals Sunday.\n\nJessie Diggins, the most decorated American cross-country skier ever, finished eighth in the 20-kilometer women’s skiathlon in Tesero. She finished more than 2 minutes behind winner Frida Karlsson of Sweden.\n\n“I had a crash on the first lap, where my tip just disappeared in the slush, and unfortunately it was a tough spot where you lose all your momentum,” the 34-year-old Minnesota native said.\n\nU.S. Vice President JD Vance sat with influencer and boxer Jake Paul as they watched the U.S. women’s hockey team beat Finland 5-0 on Saturday. Paul’s fiancee, Jutta Leerdam, is a speedskater for the Netherlands.\n\nFinland played two days after the team’s game against Canada had to be postponed because of a stomach virus affecting players. Switzerland played Canada a day after announcing that one of its players tested positive for the norovirus. Canada won 4-0.\n\nNorway — the nation with the most medals in Winter Olympics history — got its first gold of the Games in the women’s ski jumping. It was unexpected.\n\nAnna Odine Stroem of Norway won the normal hill competition ahead of Slovenian favorite Nika Prevc, who has dominated the sport this season. Nozomi Maruyama of Japan won bronze.\n\nKira Kimura won Japan’s first gold medal at these Games — in men’s snowboarding big air in Livigno. His teammate, Ryoma Kimata, picked up the silver medal.\n\nDefending champion Su Yiming of China took bronze, keeping 17-year-old American Oliver Martin off the podium.\n\nBig air consists of one single jump off a huge ramp, where the rider varies spins, flips and h",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Tourists to Milan during the Winter Olympics hoping to see Leonardo da Vinci’s “ The Last Supper” were in for an unwelcome surprise: Access to the masterpiece is closed to the public for 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe painting, created between 1494 and 1498 by the Italian Renaissance artist, is located on a wall inside the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a church and Dominican convent still used by friars. It is a major attraction for appreciators of art and devout Catholics alike.\n\nTourists stuck at the police cordon down the street leading to Santa Maria delle Grazie were disappointed. Antonio Rodríguez, who traveled from Spain with friends, said they would have no other chance to see the painting nor the adjacent church since they only traveled for the weekend.\n\n“We didn’t know we would face this,” said Rodríguez, adding he had no plans to attend events related to the Games. \"We would have gone somewhere else in the city.”\n\nA sign on the wall outside Il Cenacolo Vinciano stated that access to the landmark would be closed all day on Feb. 5, 6 and 7, and the morning of Feb. 8, without giving any reason. Staff there told a reporter from The Associated Press they were not authorized to provide any information.\n\nVIPs still allowed in on Saturday\n\nUnbeknownst to frustrated visitors, multiple groups of VIPs were exempt from the restrictions on Saturday.\n\nAmong them were U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his family, according to a statement from the vice president's office. They visited the morning after he met Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and attended the Games' opening ceremony.\n\nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, which he has said brought him a sense of spiritual fulfillment. He visited Rome and Vatican City during Holy Week last year, and was among the last world leaders to meet Pope Francis before his passing. They sat down together on Easter Sunday after a long-distance tangle over the Trump administration’s migrant deportation plans.\n\nIn addition to Vance, many foreign delegations have visited The Last Supper and the Brera Art Gallery in recent days, including those of China, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, Angelo Crespi, the director of Grande Brera that oversees both institutions, said in a statement.\n\n“We interpret our role responsibly, not only in terms of tourism but also in terms of international relations,” he said.\n\nTraffic in the area surrounding the religious site on Saturday was diverted. People walking along nearby streets said public transportation was disrupted, as well.\n\n“The trams were changed without any notice,” said Fedeli Gioia. “This whole area is blocked because someone is going to see Il Cenacolo? And where does that leave us citizens?”\n\nA painting that — with care and luck — has survived for centuries\n\nThe Last Supper — described by renowned writer Giorgio Vasari as “a beautiful and marvelous thing” in his writings — is preserved under strict conservation conditions.\n\nInstead of creating a fresco that would have allowed the paint to be absorbed by plaster, Leonardo used a dry technique that made it much more vulnerable to deterioration. Environmental damage and repeated restoration attempts altered its appearance and prompted ongoing conservation efforts.\n\nNowadays, visits last about 15 minutes for a maximum number of 40 people at a time and temperature and humidity are strictly controlled.\n\nLeonardo’s painting depicts the moment after Jesus tells his apostles: “One of you will betray me.” The scene’s composition has had other interpretations by previous artists, but Leonardo reinterpreted it, placing Jesus at the center and arranging the apostles in four groups of three figures.\n\nAside from conservation issues derived from the dry technique used by Leonardo, the mural suffered deterioration when the refectory housing it was used as a stable in the late 1700s during the French occupation of Milan by Napoleon’s troops. Later, it was severely damaged when Allied bombing struck the Santa Maria delle Grazie complex in 1943 during World War II.\n\nIt made a controversial appearance, of sorts, in the Paris Olympics in 2024. A scene in the opening ceremony evoked the painting, and included DJ Barbara Butch — an LGBTQ+ icon — wearing a silver headdress resembling a halo while flanked by drag artists and dancers.\n\nFrance’s Catholic bishops said it mocked Christian symbolism, and the Vatican said it “deplored the offense” caused to Christians by the scene.\n\nA group of Japanese tourists was among the would-be visitors behind the police cordon on Saturday. They photographed the church from a distance and listened to a guide’s explanation in the middle of the street.\n\nLuisa Castro, a Filipina who has lived in Milan for 20 years, was hoping to visit Santa Maria delle Grazie with friends.\n\n“We are Catholics from the Philippines and we seldom have time to visit a church like this,” she said. “Unfortunately, the vice president of America came to see the Last Supper and we could not enter.”\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "After eight matches and five days of competition at the Winter Olympics, Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds have finally been beaten in Cortina.\n\nIt was Switzerland who eventually did what Norway, Estonia, Czech Republic, Sweden, Korea, Canada and the United States couldn't in the curling mixed doubles in the Dolomites.\n\nTheir 7-5 victory will mean more to them than it would have to the Great Britain duo, as they pursue the semi-final spot that Mouat and Dodds have already clinched.\n\nHowever, the Scottish pair were eager to preserve their 100% record, both to further stamp their authority on the competition and to ensure they have the hammer - the right to throw last - in Monday's semi (18:05 GMT) and in whichever medal match they find themselves in on Tuesday.\n\nMouat and Dodds will have another chance to do both of those things when they conclude their round-robin matches against Italy at 18:05 - live on the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics: GB in curling action, plus mixed biathlon medals - watch\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\n\"The energy will be electric so we're looking forward to that and hopefully causing some drama in the stands,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nTo do so, they will have to rediscover their best form against the hosts, whose every successful shot sends a cascade of noise rolling down the wooden bleachers of this quirky arena.\n\nThe Italians overwhelmed the Czech Republic at the same time as Switzerland were inflicting defeat on Team GB.\n\nThe married Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwaller-Huerlimann started aggressively, stealing shots in both the second and third ends to establish a 4-0 advantage.\n\nMouat and Dodds righted themselves a little with two to go into the break at 4-2, then stole two to pull themselves level.\n\nThe Swiss nudged ahead again and, although GB took two to lead for the first time going into the final end, they were unable to prevent their opponents snatching a decisive two to close out victory.\n\n\"We put ourselves against the wall a bit,\" Dodds told BBC Sport. \"I had a couple of overthrows which put us in a lot of bother but we're still in a very good position.\"\n\nNorway's Johannes Hosflot Klaebo clinched the first of a potential six gold medals at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in the 10km+10km skiathlon.\n\nIt takes the 29-year-old's career Olympic gold tally to six, just two behind the all-time winter record.\n\nThat is held by the Norwegian trio of biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen and cross country skiers Bjorn Daehlie and Marit Bjorgen, who are all retired.\n\nTeam GB's Andrew Musgrave came 10th in his fifth Games - just short of his best Olympic finish of seventh in 2018 - with fellow Briton Joe Davis 16th.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit disappointed,\" Musgrave told BBC Sport after the race.\n\n\"I felt like it was so fast on the first section and straight away I was struggling - it was hot and I was overheating.\n\n\"My chances of a good finish were over after the first lap.\"\n\nMathis Desloges took silver after being spared punishment for cutting a corner on the course, earning France their first medal, with Norway's Martin Lowstrom Nyenget third.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn's Winter Olympic dream ended in screams of pain on Sunday after she crashed out of the women's downhill, failing in her audacious bid to medal in her favoured discipline at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe American star had been trying to claim the fourth Olympic medal of her career despite suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee just over a week ago, but her race ended after just 13 seconds in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nShe cried in anguish and pain after her awful fall high up the course, medical staff surrounding the distraught 41-year-old on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste where has enjoyed much success in the past.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic downhill champion hit the firm snow face first soon after pushing off from the gate.\n\nShe then rolled down the slope with her skis still attached, which could likely cause further serious damage to her knee.\n\nVonn's Olympic dream now lies in tatters after her brave effort to achieve the seemingly impossible, an attempt which ended with her being taken away in a helicopter as fans in the stands saluted her with loud applause.\n\nHer US teammate Breezy Johnson, sitting in the leader's chair, held her face in shock. At the time Vonn crashed, Johnson, the world downhill champion, was in front of Germany's Emma Aicher by just 0.04sec following her powerful run.\n\nJohan Eliasch, the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) who was watching the race in Cortina, said Vonn's crash was \"tragic, but it's ski racing I'm afraid\".\n\n\"And I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport because this race has been the talk of the Games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"I hope she will have a speedy recovery and back on skis very, very soon.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to say she shouldn't have been racing today (with) that type of injury. It's obviously her decision.\"\n\nOne of world sport's most recognisable faces and an alpine skiing icon, Vonn has insisted that she could not only compete but win against the world's best women skiers, some of whom like Aicher are nearly half her age.\n\nVonn said ahead of the Games that she was planning on also competing in the team combined event on Tuesday and the super-G two days later.\n\nBut that now looks unlikely, a potential long lay-off perhaps heralding the end of her comeback to skiing in her early 40s.\n\nVonn retired in 2019 but returned to compeition in November 2024 following surgery to partially replace her right knee to end persistent pain.\n\nHad she not crashed in the last World Cup downhill ahead of the Olympics, in Crans Montana at the end of January, Vonn would have been a serious contender for gold in Cortina.\n\nVonn had finished on the podium in every previous World Cup downhill race this season, including two victories in St. Moritz and Zauchensee, and claimed two more top-three finishes in the super-G.\n\nBut retirement looms for Vonn following a disastrous end to one of the biggest stories of the Winter Olympics.",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn crashed out of the women's downhill competition at the Winter Olympics nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee.\n\nThe 41-year-old had successfully completed two training runs on the iconic Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina but crashed early in her run.\n\nShe was tended to for a lengthy period on the slope before being airlifted off the piste.\n\nVonn was taking a huge risk by competing on Sunday having suffered the ACL injury in Switzerland in the last World Cup race before the Games.\n\nBut she was determined to take to the course in what she says will be her final Olympics.\n\nStunned spectators in the stands applauded towards the helicopter as it carried her away from the piste which has brought her so much success in the past - with 12 of her 84 World Cup wins coming here.\n\nVonn had been unsure what her knee was capable of withstanding but had targeted the downhill as her favoured event while also being entered in the super-G and team events.\n\nIt is now unlikely she will compete in any of those, meaning her Olympic career has likely come to a devastating end.\n\nVonn was the 13th skier to go in the women's downhill and clipped the first gate which put her off balance as she was turning when she crashed.\n\nThe treatment she needed after the crash led to a significant delay to the competition, which compatriot Breezy Johnson led at the time.\n\nJohnson held her head in her hands as she watched her team-mate carried away by the helicopter.\n\nVonn had appeared relaxed in the training runs and in the morning before the race. Her coach Aksel Lund Svindal said on Friday that he felt confident she could pull off something spectacular.\n\nNo stranger to a comeback, Vonn retired from the sport in 2019 as the most decorated female skier at the time but had suffered several serious leg injuries.\n\nShe made a shock return to the sport in 2024 having had a partial knee replacement in her right knee.\n\nVonn was tipped for the podium in Cortina following a successful 2025-26 season, in which she reached the podium in all five races, winning two.\n\nBut this latest crash leaves a significant doubt over whether Vonn will ski competitively again.\n\nWinter Olympics: Johnson set for downhill gold after US team-mate Vonn's crash - watch\n\nVonn knew the risk she was taking by competing on Sunday and had even hit back at a doctor on social media who claimed the injury was \"not a fresh tear\".\n\nShe responded by saying her ACL is \"100% torn\" and had hoped to defy the odds by replicating the Olympic downhill gold medal she won in Vancouver in 2010.\n\nVideos on social media had shown her training in the gym after she said she had no pain or swelling of the knee, while two smooth runs in the build-up to the race had given her, and her team and fans, confidence.\n\nFour-time British Olympian Chemmy Alcott was emotional on BBC coverage and said she \"never believed\" it would end in this way.\n\n\"What we saw [is] that the top of the piste is really hard for a fit athlete. It is brutal, think about her family, her team and herself.\n\n\"We have to be realistic - the risk was really high, the risk she takes when she falls will double that. Her body will not be able to take that.\"\n\nAlcott added that the long delay would also mean the snow on the piste would begin to melt in the midday sun, and therefore it would be unlikely that anyone would beat Johnson's time of one minute 36.10 seconds.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Italian police fired tear gas and a water cannon at dozens of protesters who threw firecrackers and tried to access a highway near a Winter Olympics venue on Saturday.\n\nThe brief confrontation came at the end of a peaceful march by thousands against the environmental impact of the Games and the presence of U.S. agents in Italy.\n\nPolice held off the violent demonstrators, who appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink, after the skirmish. By then, the larger peaceful protest, including families with small children and students, had dispersed.\n\nEarlier, a group of masked protesters had set off smoke bombs and firecrackers on a bridge overlooking a construction site about 800 meters (a half-mile) from the Olympic Village that's housing around 1,500 athletes.\n\nPolice vans behind a temporary metal fence secured the road to the athletes’ village, but the protest veered away, continuing on a trajectory toward the Santagiulia venue. A heavy police presence guarded the entire route.\n\nThere was no indication that the protest and resulting road closure interfered with athletes’ transfers to their events, all on the outskirts of Milan.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Milan as head of the American delegation that attended the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nHe and his family visited Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” closer to the city center, far from the protest, which also was against the deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to provide security to the U.S. delegation.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S. is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.\n\nAt the larger, peaceful demonstration, which police said numbered 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts to represent trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to beating drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, one a profanity-laced anti-ICE anthem.\n\n“Let’s take back the cities and free the mountains,” read a banner by a group calling itself the Unsustainable Olympic Committee. Another group called the Association of Proletariat Excursionists organized the cutout trees.\n\n“They bypassed the laws that usually are needed for major infrastructure project, citing urgency for the Games,” said protester Guido Maffioli, who expressed concern that the private entity organizing the Games would eventually pass on debt to Italian taxpayers.\n\nHomemade signs read “Get out of the Games: Genocide States, Fascist Police and Polluting Sponsors,” the final one a reference to fossil fuel companies that are sponsors of the Games. One woman carried an artificial tree on her back decorated with the sign: “Infernal Olympics.”\n\nThe demonstration followed another last week when hundreds protested the deployment of ICE agents.\n\nLike last week, demonstrators Saturday said they were opposed to ICE agents’ presence, despite official statements that a small number of agents from an investigative arm would be present in U.S. diplomatic territory, and not operational on the streets.",

    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - will not be able to wear their new helmets because they do not comply with the sport's rules around shape.\n\nThe British team had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) on Thursday to overturn the decision by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nBut Cas say the helmet is a departure from the standard helmet shape and has clearly been designed to specifically enhance aerodynamic performance because the back of the helmet protrudes.\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) stressed that the helmet was designed with safety in mind and to comply with new safety regulations due to be introduced by the IBSF at the start of the 2026-27 season.\n\nThose rules are not in place at the Olympics but British skeleton have essentially tried to get ahead of the curve by designing and using their new helmet in Italy.\n\nInstead they will wear the ones they wore during the last World Cup season.\n\nA picture seen by BBC Sport shows that the helmet is pointed at the back - similar in appearance to a track cycling helmet.\n\nNatalie Dunman, executive performance director at the BBSA, said: \"Based on the strength of the case we put forward, naturally we are disappointed in [the] decision.\n\n\"However, this does not affect our final preparations and nor has the discourse affected the athletes' focus or optimism going into the Games.\n\n\"Our athletes have been winning medals all season, and throughout the Olympic cycle, in their current helmets and we remain in a strong position to continue that trend.\"\n\nWhen asked about the helmet prior to the verdict, Team GB's skeleton racers said they had no preference on which helmet they used at the Olympics.\n\nThey arrive at the Games as heavy favourites to win medals with world champion and overall World Cup winner Matt Weston leading the charge for gold while compatriot Marcus Wyatt is also fancied to go well.\n\nThe British team wore the new helmets at a training session last week in Switzerland with the IBSF ruling them out on 29 January before the BBSA appealed against the ban on Thursday.\n\nOfficial skeleton training in Cortina begins on Monday with the men's event beginning on 12 February, while the women's starts on 13 February and the team event is on 15 February.\n\nThe helmet is the most important bit of kit both for safety and aerodynamics - how quickly the slider can travel down the track.\n\nDoctor Bryce Dyer, a professor of sport technology at the University of Bournemouth, says that because skeleton is head first it is essential that the helmet is aerodynamic to cut through the air.\n\n\"The airflow over that section is really, really important,\" he said. \"Any kind of gain they can make with the shape and the general performance of it, then obviously the higher the speed gap is going to achieve and therefore the better chances of the medal.\n\n\"The funny thing with aerodynamics is that the faster you go, the more resistance actually gets thrown against you. So you need the most aerodynamically efficient shape you can obtain.\"\n\nIt is here that the British team's case appears to have been decided, with Cas agreeing with the IBSF that the overall shape incorporates prohibited spoilers (attachments), protruding edges or aerodynamic elements.\n\n\"Even that [aerodynamic helmet] will only yield a very, very small increase in velocity. But that could be just enough,\" said Dyer.\n\nWith the margin between winning gold and going home empty handed \"hundredths of a second\", two-time world champion Weston knows that innovation in aerodynamics is key to the \"minor gains\" needed.\n\nWhile the BBSA say they are disappointed with the decision, the British team know they are in a strong position without the new helmets.\n\nBetween them, Weston and Wyatt have won all seven World Cup races this season while three women have qualified for the Olympics for the first time in British history.\n\nWhen discussing the matter before the verdict was announced, Wyatt, Weston and women's skeleton rider Tabitha Stoecker all said they did not mind which helmet they wore at the Games.\n\n\"All of our success has been with the other helmet - for me this is the tiniest little thing in the background,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\"I'm not worried, whatever we end up wearing I think we're in with a great shout of bringing some medals home.\"\n\nThree-time overall World Cup winner Weston added: \"I have other things I can focus on and other things I'm working on to maximise my performance coming into the Olympics.\n\n\"If these new helmets get though then great it's an added bonus. But if not then we are in a pretty solid place.\"\n\nStoecker added: \"We've been competing in our regular training helmets all year and having amazing results.\n\n\"With or without that [helmet] I think we all feel really confident in the team and in our abilities and what we're going to be able to lay down at the Games.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold said: \"It's good to get the decision out of the way before official training has begun. The athletes are likely to be unaffected mentally and their preparation is unaffected.\n\n\"I personally like to see developments in elite sport, innovation is important, maybe this process will develop the rules further and create more clarity within the rules, and therefore allow for some innovation.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "After suffering an injury prior to the Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and realizing three minutes into her free skate that she wouldn't be receiving a medal, Bonaly decided to pull out her signature move, a backflip with a landing on one blade, which was then illegal in competition.\n\n\"I wanted to do something to please the crowd, not the judges,\" she said, according to the Miami Herald and the Washington Post. \"The judges are not pleased no matter what I do, and I knew I couldn't go forward anyway because everybody was skating so good.\"\n\nThe Huffington Post reported Bonaly is one of only a few female skaters to have ever performed the move in competition, and the only skater, male or female, to ever land a one-foot backflip.\n\nIn one of the biggest scandals in sports history, Nancy Kerrigan was physically attacked and struck in the leg on January 6, 1994, which put her at risk of never skating again.\n\nAt the time, she was the top ice skater in the US and a gold medal hopeful for the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\nHarding pleaded guilty to failing to cooperate with prosecutors. She was fined $160,000 and barred from ever participating in skating competitions again.\n\nHarding's ex-husband, her former bodyguard, and two others spent time in prison for their connections to the scheme after pleading guilty to charges.\n\nFor more than two decades, Harding denied knowing anything about their plot, but in a 2018 ABC special, she admitted she had an inkling the men were behind it. However, she's maintained she had no part in planning the attack.\n\nThe error during the women's all-around threw many athletes off their game, and some fell. Eighteen gymnasts used the vault before one flagged the issue to organizers.\n\nFive gymnasts took the opportunity to re-perform their vaults after the botched vault setting was revealed, ABC News reported.\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) said the organizations tasked with overseeing the equipment were reprimanded, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"It was checked. Believe me, it was checked. I'm sure triple-checked,\" Slava Corn, then-president of the media commission for FIG, said following the error, AP reported.\"And, quite frankly, I don't think we'll ever have an error like this again.\"\n\nAt the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Jones became the first woman to win five track-and-field medals at a single Olympics. Three of her medals were gold.\n\nHowever, in 2007, Jones admitted she had used steroids to prepare for the games and gave up her medals.\n\n\"I have let my country down, and I have let myself down,\" Jones said at a press conference outside court in 2007. \"I recognize that by saying that I'm deeply sorry, it might not be enough and sufficient to address the pain and the hurt that I have caused you. Therefore, I want to ask for your forgiveness for my actions, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\"\n\nIn January 2008, she was sentenced to six months in prison for lying to federal investigators about her steroid use ahead of the Olympics and for her involvement in a separate check fraud case.\n\nIn 2025, Jones, who went on to play professional basketball after her prison term, told The Athletic she has moved on from the scandal. \"You not only have done your physical time, but you've done your mental time, as well,\" Jones told herself.\n\n\"You've apologized more times than you ever needed to. Now it's time for you to live your life,\" she added.\n\nThe story began when Ryan Lochte's mother told USA Today that he'd been robbed at gunpoint. He repeated the claim to other outlets, saying he and his teammates had been robbed at gunpoint by men posing as police.\n\nHowever, police in Brazil said they were unable to confirm their account with witnesses. Within days, Conger and Bentz told police that Lochte had made up the story.\n\nInstead, an investigation found that after the four men had asked their taxi driver to pull over at a gas station, they engaged in public urination and vandalism. They were then confronted by armed security guards, police said.\n\nA week after his initial claims, Lochte admitted to exaggerating their original story in an interview with NBC, saying, \"If I hadn't exaggerated the story or told the entire story, none of this would have happened. I was coming from the France house, I was highly intoxicated, and I made immature accusations. If I had not done that, none of this would have happened.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"truly, 110% sorry.\"\n\nLochte was given a 10-month suspension from domestic and international competitions, while Feigen, Bentz, and Conger were given four-month suspensions for failing to come forward about what actually happened that night, The New York Times reported.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson, one of the fastest female runners in the US, was excluded from the US relay team in 2021 after testing positive for THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis, at the US Olympic Team Trials. She later admitted she had taken marijuana after learning from a reporter that her biological mother had died.\n\n\"I'm not making an excuse or looking for empathy in my case,\" the then-21-year-old athlete said in an interview with NBC's \"Today\" show. However, she added that finding out about her mother's death and dealing with the relationship they had \"was a very heavy topic.\"\n\nUSATF said in a statement: \"First and foremost, we are incredibly sympathetic toward Sha'Carri Richardson's extenuating circumstances and strongly applaud her accountability — and will offer her our continued support both on and off the track.\n\n\"While USATF fully agrees that the merit of the World Anti-Doping Agency rules related to THC should be reevaluated, it would be detrimental to the integrity of the US Olympic Team Trials for Track & Field if USATF amended its policies following competition, only weeks before the Olympic Games,\" the statement continued.\n\nRichardson did make the 2024 Paris Olympics, however, and earned silver and gold medals there.\n\nIn 2021, German coach Kim Raisner was ejected from the Olympic competition following an incident involving athlete Annika Schleu and her horse, Saint Boy. When Saint Boy refused to jump during the show-jumping round of the women's event, Raisner was heard encouraging Schleu to \"really hit it, hit\" the horse to get it to jump, and even struck Saint Boy herself.\n\nFollowing the incident, animal safety at the event was called into question. The Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne, which oversees the pentathlon, said the incident caused \"distress both inside and outside the global UIPM Sports community.\"\n\n\"UIPM regrets the trauma suffered by Saint Boy in this high-profile incident and has penalized the coach who violated the UIPM Competition Rules by striking the horse from outside the ring,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\n\"Although no athlete or horse was physically injured on August 6, the best possible safeguards must be in place to minimize risk in future,\" it added.\n\nUltimately, the UIPM's executive board voted to remove horse riding from the modern pentathlon. The change came into effect after the 2024 Paris Olympics, and obstacle course racing will replace the equestrian event at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nKamila Valieva, a skater competing for the Russian Olympic Committee, was embroiled in a doping scandal after it emerged she had tested positive for trimetazidine, a drug the World Anti-Doping Agency categorizes as a \"hormone and metabolic modulator,\" as reported by The Associated Press.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that the drug can \"bolster endurance and improve circulation,\" potentially giving athletes who do not need to use the drug a competitive advantage.\n\nValieva's lawyers said her positive test was the result of a mix-up with her grandfather's medicine.\n\nAfter news of the skater failing the drug test in December 2021 emerged in early February 2022, Valieva was suspended from competition. However, the decision was appealed and overturned, allowing Valieva to continue with the competition. The IOC later challenged that decision, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport lifted her suspension.\n\nUltimately, Valieva was allowed to skate, a move that drew backlash from the skating community, including commentators Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir.\n\nAmerican sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson said she believed she was treated differently from Valieva over their positive tests because she is Black; the IOC denied that was the case.\n\nThe skater earned first place in the women's short program on February 15, 2022, but she placed fourth in the women's free skate two days later after two falls, keeping her out of medal contention.\n\nThe IOC had said it would not hold a medal ceremony if she were in the top three.\n\nIn a July 2024 press release, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) said it received a video of six-time dressage medalist Dujardin \"engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare,\" noting that \"the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during a training session conducted by Ms. Dujardin at a private stable.\"\n\nThe Guardian reported Dujardin whipped a horse more than 20 times during the session.\n\nShe was issued a one-year suspension, a fine, and barred from the Paris Games.\n\nDujardin released a statement on Instagram, writing that the video showed her \"making an error of judgment.\"\n\nShe added, \"What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils; however, there is no excuse. I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.\"\n\nDujardin finished her statement with an apology and said she would \"cooperate fully\" during investigations.\n\nThe women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise final was full of drama. Team USA gymnast Jordan Chiles was initially awarded a score of 13.666, placing fifth.\n\nHer coach, Cecile Landi, appealed the score based on the routine's difficulty, and officials re-evaluated it, awarding Chiles a 13.766, bumping her from fifth to third place and allowing her to receive the bronze medal instead of Romania's Ana Bărbosu.\n\nAfter the competition, Team Romania filed an inquiry about Team USA's request to review Chiles' score, arguing that the challenge wasn't submitted within the 60-second limit.\n\nOn August 10, the Court of Arbitration ruled that Team USA's appeal was four seconds late and reinstated her original score of 13.666, putting Bărbosu back in third place.\n\nThe IOC agreed with the court and released a statement that it is \"in touch with the NOC of Romania to discuss the reallocation ceremony and with USOPC regarding the return of the bronze medal.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics and the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee released a joint statement defending Chiles and Landi's original inquiry, writing, \"The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics released an additional statement on X that Landi requested to file the inquiry 47 seconds after the publishing of Chiles' score, writing, \"The time-stamped video evidence submitted by USA Gymnastics Sunday evening shows Landi stated her request to file an inquiry at the inquiry table 47 seconds after the score is posted, followed by a second statement 55 scores after the score was originally posted.\"\n\nIn January 2026, Switzerland's federal court said the case would be returned to the Court of Arbitration for further review, in light of new video evidence.\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif faced scrutiny throughout the Olympics due to the spread of misinformation about her sex.\n\nThe controversy began after Italy's Angela Carini withdrew from her competition against Khelif, refusing to shake her hand and saying she'd \"never been hit with such a powerful punch.\"\n\nCarini's actions reignited debate over the International Boxing Association's (IBA) 2023 decision to disqualify Khelif from the world championships.\n\nThe IBA — which was banned from the Olympic family in 2023 — said Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting failed \"to meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams repeatedly defended Khalif and Yu-ting against the unspecified tests and the scrutiny they faced. No evidence was presented publicly that Khelif violated Olympic eligibility rules.\n\n\"The whole process is flawed,\" Adams said, per the AP, adding, \"From the conception of the test, to how the test was shared with us, to how the tests have become public, is so flawed that it's impossible to engage with.\"\n\nKhelif and Yu-ting went on to win gold medals in their respective weight classes.\n\nAfter Khelif's win, she said, \"I'm a woman like any other woman. I was born a woman, I lived a woman, I competed as a woman.\"\n\nEleven members of China's swim team for the 2024 Olympics were involved in a 2021 doping scandal, NBC reported.\n\nThese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned drug that's used to treat heart-related conditions, in 2021, but the results didn't come to light until 2024.\n\nChina said the athletes' levels of trimetazidine were the result of contaminated food, which the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted. Thus, none of the swimmers was sanctioned.\n\nAll of the athletes were allowed to compete in Tokyo, including Wang Shun, who won the gold medal in the men's 200-meter individual medley. He also won the bronze medal in the same event this year.\n\nAP reported that Shun, through a translator, said, \"Chinese swimmers only compete cleanly.\"\n\nThe city of Paris invested $1.5 billion to clean the River Seine, which had been closed to swimmers for more than a century because of pollution levels. Mayor Anne Hidalgo even swam in the water to prove its safety.\n\nA representative for Paris 2024 told Business Insider in a statement that \"this project to make the Seine swimmable after 100 years is a major achievement.\"\n\nHowever, even after the 2024 Olympics got underway, there were concerns about levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river, and the men's triathlon was rescheduled, the AP reported.\n\nOlympic athletes ultimately swam in the Seine, but the reviews left something to be desired.\n\n\"While swimming under the bridge, I felt and saw things that we shouldn't think about too much,\" Jolien Vermeylen of Belgium told Dutch television station VTM, Metro reported.",

    "fullText": "Swiss Alpine skier Franjo von Allmen was crowned the first champion of the 2026 Winter Olympics as Italians Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris won their nation's first medals in the downhill.\n\nVon Allmen blazed down the iconic Stelvio in a time of one minute 51.61 seconds, 0.20 seconds quicker than fellow 24-year-old Franzoni.\n\nParis, the veteran on the podium at 36, was half a second slower than Von Allmen as he pipped Swiss great and runaway World Cup leader Marco Odermatt to the bronze medal.\n\n\"It feels kind of like a movie, not really real,\" said Von Allmen.\n\n\"I can't tell you what it means to me.\"\n\nWhen the last Olympics took place, Von Allmen was yet to make his World Cup debut but he has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top.\n\nHe won World Championship gold in 2025 - the youngest man to win the downhill title in 36 years - with that victory coming before he won the first of his four titles on the World Cup circuit.\n\nBut it hasn't been any easy run to glory.\n\nAt 17, after the sudden death of his father, he struggled to finance his promising ski career.\n\n\"My racing career was hanging in the balance,\" he told Swiss outlet Blick., external\n\nHe decided to crowdfund, and eventually raised enough money to continue for another season, after which he made the jump on to the Swiss national squad.\n\nHe credits training as a carpenter with \"shaping him\", and has previously spent his summers working on construction sites.\n\nBut that will not be necessary now, having become the fifth Swiss Olympic downhill champion since 1948.\n\nVonn disputes doctor's knee injury claim\n\nGB on brink of mixed semis after another win\n\nSwiss skiers had held all three podium positions before the Italians entered the start gate, with Franzoni and Paris knocking off Alexis Monney and then Odermatt with impressive performances in sunny Bormio.\n\nParis is seen as a king of this course, having won seven World Cup titles across both downhill and the Super-G, and he won a first Olympic medal at his fifth Games.\n\n\"Getting the first medal in front of the home crowd, that's really special,\" he said.\n\nBut for the Italians, their medal success comes in what has been an emotionally difficult season, five months after the death of their team-mate Matteo Franzoso in a training crash.\n\nFranzoso suffered a head injury in a collision with a fence in La Parva, Chile, in September.\n\nLast month, after winning World Cup gold at prestigious Kitzbuhel, Franzoni said he had raced with Franzoso \"in his mind\" after the two had shared a room at the course a year previously.\n\n\"To share the podium with Franjo, after [doing so at] the junior world championships [in 2022], he's such a great guy,\" said Franzoni.\n\n\"Also with Domi, I really wanted to share a podium with him. I don't know if he'll continue racing next year but this is the biggest stage to share.\"\n\nAs a junior, Franzoni used to race against Jannik Sinner, who was a standout skier before pursuing tennis.\n\nIn fact, Sinner, now a four-time Grand Slam champion, once beat Franzoni in 2009, something he was made aware of after the latter's super-G victory in Wengen earlier this year.\n\nSinner followed Franzoni on social media and the pair have since struck up a friendship.\n\n\"Receiving a message from a champion like him gave me a lot of motivation,\" said Franzoni after his Kitzbuhel win.\n\n\"I thought, 'If he wrote to me, it means I'm doing something right'.

    "fullText": "Skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess talked about the \"mixed emotions\" that come with representing the U.S. amid political turmoil at the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nLillis said he's \"heartbroken\" by what's happening in the U.S.\n\nAnti-ICE protestors staged a rally in Milan on Feb. 6\n\nTwo Team USA athletes are speaking out about what it means to them to represent their country before the rest of the world amid a season of political turmoil at home.\n\nWhile several athletes skirted around the question of politics with diplomatic answers about representing personal values at the 2026 Winter Olympics, freestyle skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess acknowledged that wearing red, white and blue at this point in history comes with mixed emotions during a press conference on Friday, Feb. 6.\n\nLillis, 27, said that he loves the United States and “would never want to represent” any other country at the Games. Still, he acknowledged that he’s “heartbroken” over what’s happening in the U.S. amid President Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\n“A lot of times, athletes are hesitant to talk about political views and how we feel about things. I feel heartbroken about what’s happening in the United States,” he said. “I’m pretty sure you’re referencing ICE and some of the protests and things like that. I think that as a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we’re treating our citizens as well as anybody, with love and respect.”\n\nHe continued, “I hope that when people look at athletes competing in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent.”\n\nHess, meanwhile, said it “brings up mixed emotions” to represent the United States at the 2026 Games.\n\n“It’s a little hard. There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t,” the skier, 27, said. “I think for me, it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home… all the things that I believe are good about the United States.”\n\nHess noted that “just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S.”\n\n“I just kind of want to do it for my friends and my family and the people that support me getting here,” he said.\n\nThe immigration conversation in the U.S. has become heated in recent months, especially after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alexi Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota.\n\nICE tactics — including the nearly two-week detainment of a 5-year-old boy — have drawn outrage from some, prompting protests nationwide and abroad. Citizens of Milan, the main home of the 2026 Winter Olympics, staged an anti-ICE protest on Friday, Feb. 6, while Vice President JD Vance’s appearance at the opening ceremony later that day prompted boos from the crowd when he was shown on screen at the stadium.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

Two Italian skiers won medals behind von Allmen’s gold in the men’s downhill Saturday at Stelvio Ski Centre, the first medal event of the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics.Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris of Italy cracked the top three on back-to-back runs in front of roaring Italian fans. But neither could overtake von Allmen’s time of 1:51.61.\n\n\"Super happy. Feels kind of like a movie,\" von Allmen said on the NBC broadcast just before securing the win. He also said he thought a lot about his father today, who died when von Allmen was 17.Ryan Cochran-Siegle, Team USA’s best hope in the event, struggled to post a 1:53.65, well back of the leaders in 18th place. Kyle Negomir (1:53.20) posted the best time of the four Americans in the field for a 10-place finish.\n\nThe other two U.S. skiers, Bryce Bennett (1:53.45) and Sam Morse (1:53.68), placed 13th and 19th, respectively.\n\nA field of 36 skiers each got one crack at the downhill course.

    "fullText": "Team GB's mixed doubles curlers moved to the brink of the Winter Olympics semi-finals with three matches still to play, as a statement victory over heavyweights Canada maintained their 100% record.\n\nUS honorary coach, hype man and rapper Snoop Dogg was not in the house on Saturday, but Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds made their own headlines, roaring into a 5-1 lead after just three ends before closing out a 7-5 triumph.\n\nThe sense is six wins should be enough for a place in the last four and the British pair have already hit that mark to sit top of the round-robin standings.\n\nOnly the US - who GB play at 13:35 GMT live on BBC Two - had beaten Canada's Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman so far. But the husband-and-wife team could not compete with childhood friends Mouat and Dodds.\n\nThree points in the opening end set the tone - and sent a cascade of noise rolling down from the wooden bleachers in the quirky Cortina Curling Stadium - and a series of judicious shots ensured the Scots kept their opponents at arms length.\n\nThe GB pair led 5-2 at the halfway interval, before two more fabulous closing throws by Dodds left it at 7-3 with two ends remaining.\n\nCanada were done at that stage, and looked poised to concede as Dodds lined up a final stone to take a point in the seventh. But a rare overthrow instead gifted them two and extended the contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds did not falter, though, blanking that final end to all but seal a semi-final spot.\n\nElsewhere, Kirsty Muir enjoyed a confident start to her Olympic campaign, placing third in freeski slopestyle qualifying.\n\nMuir, one of Team GB's best medal hopes, scored a best of 64.98 from her two runs in Livigno.\n\nThat put the 21-year-old behind Switzerland's Mathilde Gremaud and China's Eileen Gu - the gold and silver medallists from Beijing 2022 respectively - in the standings.\n\nGu, a triple medallist from four years ago, is one of the biggest global stars at these Games but avoided an early shock after crashing off the first rail of her opening run.\n\nAfter almost a year out with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, Muir has won three World Cup golds in the past year, including two in slopestyle.\n\nThe Olympic final takes place on Monday from 11:30 GMT.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Spread across more than 265 miles in four different cities from the snowy Dolomites to the sunny — for now — streets of Milan, the Milan-Cortina Olympics delivered one message.\n\nThe most widespread Olympic Games in history showcased Italy’s idyllic snow-capped mountains, cutting-edge city life and celebrated winter legacy in the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Games on Friday. The unique setup that required four ceremonies in Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina d'Ampezzo used movie magic on video screens, a golden ring and Italian icon Andrea Bocelli to bridge the distance between host cities Milan and Cortina and unite the Olympics behind the athletes who will compete across seven sports zones in the next 16 days.\n\n“Let these Games be a celebration of what unites us, of everything that makes us human,” International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry said in her speech, her first at an Olympic Games under her leadership. “This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be — together.”\n\nThe theme for Milan-Cortina’s opening ceremony was armonia, or harmony. The Games needed it.\n\nThese Olympics appear to be the most disconnected ever. The sprawling footprint covers seven different competition zones. The 2026 Games are the first to be officially hosted by two cities.\n\nBut the geographical distance is small compared to the geopolitical canyon the Games hope to bridge.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine is keeping most Russian athletes out of the competition. Only 32 athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports were allowed and will have to compete as individual neutral athletes. They will not hear their national anthems or wear their national flags. Ukrainian athletes marched into San Siro Stadium — where athletes competing in ice sports participated in the opening ceremony — to loud cheers.\n\nWhen talk of protest or political conflict arose this week, Coventry tried to downplay it to keep the focus on the Games. She called controversy about LA28 chairman Casey Wasserman and ICE agents in Milan \"sad\" distractions. The United States was at the center of much of the contention after reports concerning the presence of U.S. immigration agents in Milan prompted anti-ICE protests. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee tried to cool tensions by clarifying that the organization does work with the federal government to help secure the Games, but the USOPC works with the Diplomatic Security Service, which falls under the jurisdiction of the State Department and not Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.\n\nPresident Trump’s recent comments about the United States taking control of Greenland from Denmark also angered European allies.\n\nOn Friday, an American fan walked around the concourse at San Siro Stadium in a sweatshirt that read in multiple languages: “Sorry for our president.”\n\nWhen Vice President JD Vance, sitting in the presidential suite, was shown on the video screen at San Siro, the cheers that showered U.S. athletes when they entered the stadium turned into jeers. Vance attended multiple events this week, including the U.S. women’s hockey’s group stage opener Thursday and the team figure skating competition Friday.\n\nThe 323-athlete U.S. delegation led by flag bearers speedskater Erin Jackson in Milan and bobsled athlete Frank Del Duca in Cortina was the largest in the nation's Winter Olympics history and the largest of any country at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nAthletes marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium, the home of AC Milan and Inter Milan, across a spiral-shaped stage. The four ramps converging into a circle represented the connection between Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina.\n\nEven if athletes of a country were not competing in Milan and were unable to attend the opening ceremony, a sign-holding volunteer dressed in a silver floor-length puffer dress strutted across the stage while screens showed athletes marching in during ceremonies at other Olympic locations around Italy.\n\nIn Cortina, a Brazilian athlete did a backflip after talking through a golden ring portal, a shared symbol at each ceremony. While Olympians in Milan walked into a packed stadium with flashing lights and thumping techno music played by a DJ at a turntable that looked like ice, the mountain ceremonies took place through the streets. Fans assembled on either side of the walkway for the parade of athletes.\n\nThe ceremony hit on the quintessential northern Italian experience. A plate of risotto was among the first images shown on the video board in the countdown video as the ceremony approached, followed by the picturesque snowy peaks of the Dolomites. As a fashion capital of the world, Milan used runway models dressed in green, white and red outfits designed by Giorgia Armani to represent the Italian flag. There was even a two-minute video on Italian hand gestures.\n\nItaly, as the host nation, marched in last to deafening applause and cheers from the crowd in Milan. In about two years, the United States will have the honor of closing the parade of athletes when L.A. hosts the 2028 Summer Games. The opening ceremony is also planned to take place in multiple locations, with the Coliseum and SoFi Stadium co-hosting the event.\n\nTo unite the Italian host cities, the Olympic flame was passed out of the stadium as Bocelli belted and the torch simultaneously reached two cauldrons. In Milan, the pulsating cauldron inspired by the sun will burn at Arco della Pace. In Cortina, it will light up Piazza Angelo Dibona.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "An enthusiastic welcome for American athletes at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics opening ceremony quickly soured when cameras focused on Vice President JD Vance.\n\nTeam USA, led by speedskater and flag bearer Erin Jackson, was among the final delegations to parade into Milan’s San Siro stadium on Friday.\n\nWhile the crowd cheered for the athletes, jeers and whistles erupted as Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, appeared on stadium screens, waving American flags.\n\nCommentators highlighted this distinct shift in the crowd’s reception.\n\n“There’s the vice president and his wife, Usha; those are not, oh, those are a lot of boos for him,” one commentator said on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s coverage.\n\nThe Independent’s Flo Clifford reported from inside San Siro stadium, “A largely positive reception for the U.S. contingent. There are thousands of American fans in the stadium - but very definite boos and jeers for vice president JD Vance and his wife, second lady Usha Vance, who the camera pans to waving American flags for a few brief seconds.”\n\nSupport for the U.S. among its allies has been eroding as the Trump administration has taken an aggressive posture on foreign policy, including imposing tariffs, military action in Venezuela and threats to invade Greenland.\n\nOn social media, viewers at home noted hearing the boos as well. It comes after International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry urged spectators to be “respectful” toward U.S. athletes after worldwide backlash over Trump’s immigration raids and the killing of two Americans by border officers in Minnesota.\n\nJeers also rang out when Israel's delegation entered the stadium.\n\nBesides Milan, athlete parades were held in three other locations: Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livigno and Predazzo. The Games are staged across a vast area of northern Italy, making them the most geographically dispersed Winter Olympics in history.",

    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina Winter Olympic Games are officially under way after a vibrant opening ceremony split across four locations.\n\nMilan's iconic San Siro stadium was the primary venue, with elements of the ceremony also taking place in Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo.\n\nDespite concerns over the logistics of a multi-location ceremony, it was an impressive production that went off without a hitch.\n\nTwo Olympic cauldrons were lit - one in Milan and the other in Cortina - with Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli performing a rousing rendition of Nessun Dorma as the torch entered the San Siro.\n\nThat followed a jubilant ending to the athlete's parade, with the Italy team the last to be brought out to huge cheers in all four locations.\n\nFigure skater Lilah Fear was the Great Britain flagbearer in Milan, with bobsledder Brad Hall given that honour in Cortina.\n\nItaly aside, the warmest welcome was reserved for the Ukrainian athletes, while Team USA were also loudly cheered.\n\nBut there were boos when US vice-president JD Vance was shown on the big screen, with negative crowd reactions for the Israel and Georgia teams as well.\n\nBefore the parade, creative director Marco Balich's show was based around the principle of 'armonia' - meaning union, connection, agreement - with \"a narrative aimed at uniting territories, people and values within a shared vision\".\n\nIt featured sections labelled 'Italian beauty' and 'fantasia', with a tribute to fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who died aged 91 in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, American singer Mariah Carey - one of the world's best-selling female artists - was decked out in a sparkling white outfit as she performed a version of Volare.\n\n\"We stand ready to make Olympic history again, inspired by the values that unite all of us: excellence, friendship and respect,\" said Giovanni Malago, president of the organising committee for Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\n\"The co-ordination of so many different bodies in the pursuit of one dream has been a powerful expression of this country's ability to deliver such a complex project.\n\n\"I have never been as proud to be Italian as I am tonight.\"\n\nIt was left to International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry to declare the Games open.\n\nAs the first female IOC president, it is the first time the Olympics have been officially opened by a woman.\n\n\"This is why we all love the Games. Because through you, we see the very best of ourselves,\" she told the athletes.\n\n\"You remind us that we can be brave. That we can be kind. That we can get back up, no matter how hard we fall.\n\n\"The spirit of the Olympic Games is about so much more than sport. It is about us - and what makes us human.\n\n\"This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be, together.\"\n\nWhile events such as curling, figure skating and ice hockey have already begun, the first five gold medals of the Games will be won on Saturday.\n\nAll you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nHow Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear\n\nSnoop Dogg, selfies and a clean sweep for GB curlers\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "My first assignment at the 2016 Summer Olympics was to deliver a package. My second was to find a food mart that sold bottled water.\n\nI wasn't working the event, though. My \"job\" was being the parent of an Olympic athlete.\n\nMy daughter, Gwen Jorgensen, was set to compete in the women's triathlon, and our family had flown from Wisconsin to Rio de Janeiro to support her.\n\nThough we'd watched her compete in London four years prior, she was favored to win this time, putting added pressure on her and our family.\n\nWhen our family arrived at the airport, my first thought wasn't about wandering the city or soaking up the sun on the beach.\n\nInstead, it was about delivering a package to Gwen's hotel room for her coach. (She chose to avoid the Olympic Village this time, and instead stayed in a hotel on Copacabana Beach, within walking distance of the triathlon's start line.)\n\nThen, I was tasked with buying bottled water. When traveling, Gwen avoids ice cubes, tap water, and local foods as a precaution against illness — no churros or rodízio-style meat for her, which the rest of us enjoyed later.\n\nWhen I arrived at her hotel with several gallons, Gwen was so busy that she grabbed the water and rushed me back out the door. I only saw her for a few seconds.\n\nTo be fair, her schedule was packed. That day, in addition to doing three workouts (swimming, biking, and running), she had booked an interview, scheduled a massage, and planned for a nap, the last two of which were necessary to be ready for the biggest race of her life.\n\nOver the next few days, I only saw Gwen for a few minutes at a time, usually to perform a task for her, like picking up energy drinks, clothes, and sunglasses from sponsors, like Red Bull and Oakley.\n\nThe night before the race, I couldn't sleep. My head played a loop of the catastrophes that could ruin a race: a crash, a flat tire, fatigue, heat, or injury. Gwen had experienced them all.\n\nAnd now, there was added pressure from the media to win the USA's first Olympic gold medal in triathlon.\n\nIn the morning, our growing group of friends and family (more supporters had joined us in Rio) gathered in the hotel lobby to walk to Copacabana Beach, where Gwen would begin the race by swimming 1.5 kilometers in the ocean.\n\nOur daughter had received two comped tickets to share with us, and the rest of our group paid for their seats. We sat together in the bleachers, in an area athletes would circle past several times during the 40-kilometer bike ride and 10-kilometer run that followed the swim.\n\nMy heart was pounding as a gunshot signified the beginning of the race and the competitors dove into the water.\n\nTriathlon is a low-profile sport, so there were no TV cameras to record me closing my eyes every time Gwen descended a dangerous, winding hill or cheering as she battled for the lead. I'm doubtful there's any footage of how I hugged my husband and anyone within arm's reach as our daughter crossed the finish line in first place, crying in amazement at her own success.\n\nI tried to remember those moments: Gwen congratulating the other athletes, Gwen embracing her husband and then her coach, Gwen waving at us from the podium with a gold medal around her neck.\n\nI anticipated spending the rest of the day celebrating with my daughter, but it would be hours before we reunited.\n\nAfter the podium, an escort whisked Gwen off for interviews and photos. Meanwhile, I was led to an open-air NBC studio on the beach, where she'd appear later.\n\nWhen Gwen finally arrived, she hugged me, handed me the medal, and was then ushered to a chair for hair and makeup.\n\nAlthough it was mid-afternoon, she hadn't eaten lunch, so her sister fed her bites from a takeout box while professionals aimed a blow dryer at her hair and dabbed foundation on her skin.\n\nAs Gwen got up from the chair, she gave me one more hug and asked if I had any deodorant. She hadn't gotten a chance to shower and was worried she smelled bad. Even gold medalists still need their parents.\n\nAfter the interview, Gwen disappeared once more, saying we wouldn't see her again until 9 p.m. for a celebration at the Team USA House.\n\nAt the party, my family and I heaped appetizers onto our plates and sipped wine, as photos of Gwen and her teammates flashed on giant screens around the room.\n\nEventually, Gwen spoke, thanking those who had invested in her success, including me, my husband, and her sister, acknowledging that her win was only possible because of so many.\n\nI knew she appreciated everything we did, but it made me proud to hear her say it.\n\nMy day ended at midnight, and I barely slept as I replayed the race in my head and anticipated more celebrations to come.\n\nAlthough I've experienced local triathlons and global championships, nothing compares to the Olympics. I was privileged to be behind the scenes, playing a small part in the process.\n\nGwen may have been the favorite, but racing is unpredictable, and wins are never guaranteed.\n\nWhen my daughter's dream came true, I was the one with misty eyes at the ceremonies. Gwen had spent her tears at the finish line, years of pressure finally released.",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn successfully completed her mandatory downhill training run at the Winter Olympics just one week after rupturing her left anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nThe 41-year-old announced on Tuesday that she had suffered the knee injury in a crash, which saw her airlifted to hospital, at the final World Cup race before the Games in Switzerland.\n\nBut Vonn, the Olympic downhill champion in 2010, completed a smooth run at the Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina in one minute 44.33 seconds, 1.39 seconds off the fastest time of the day.\n\nIn a powerful news conference earlier this week, Vonn had expressed her determination to compete in Sunday's downhill race but was unsure whether she would also make it to the team and Super-G events, which take place on 10 and 12 February respectively.\n\nSkiers must complete at least one training run to be able to compete in Sunday's race and will have the option of a second practice run on Saturday.\n\nIn a session heavily delayed because of foggy weather at the top of the course and already postponed from Thursday because of adverse weather conditions, many of the skiers missed gates on what was a soft course.\n\nThat means overall times might look fast but are somewhat deceptive - while missed gates in Sunday's race will result in disqualification.\n\nVonn appeared largely untroubled by her knee, which is supported by a brace, opting for an aggressive line to ensure she did not miss a gate in tough weather conditions and fist bumping compatriot Breezy Johnson after crossing the line.\n\nAfter finishing the run she was asked: \"All good?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" she replied, and walked away having said she would not speak to any media following the session.\n\nHer Norwegian coach and double Olympic gold medallist Aksel Lund Svindal did speak to reporters and said he thinks Vonn still has a chance of winning a medal.\n\n\"From what I saw today I think she can,\" he said.\n\n\"There were reserves today. She looked symmetrical. You've seen earlier this season that when she skis well, she can win. It's going to be hard but I think she could possibly bring that on Sunday.\"\n\nVonn has said that her knee is not swollen or painful and that is why she felt \"confident\" she could compete, posting a video on her Instagram of her doing a barbell squat in the gym on Thursday.\n\nThe four-time world champion was one of the favourites for the gold medal in Cortina prior to her injury and leads the standings in the downhill World Cup.\n\nVonn is aiming for a remarkable comeback having retired from the sport in 2019 before returning in December 2024 following a partial replacement of her right knee.\n\nWhat's happening and when at the Winter Olympics\n\nAll you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nChemmy Alcott, four-time Olympic Team GB skier\n\nIt's fair to say the girls expected a much more substantial base than what they skied on in this training run - there was a lot of head bobbling entering the finish and a bit of a lack of trust.\n\nThat's because of the warm weather - it's kind of like a sugar coating on the top of the slope so they're not getting that confidence or purchase on the outside ski.\n\nFor Vonn, it's fantastic to get the run in and it all came down to experience for her.\n\nShe knows this hill, this is one of her favourite hills and watching her ski with one ACL on that terrain you could tell that she reads the terrain and knows it.\n\nI think it will be a massive confidence boost for her, especially in these conditions where a lot of the other athletes struggled and she delivered a good performance.\n\nThere's things to work on, a few times you could see a bit of backing off on that knee but she successfully skied at 80mph with a torn ACL.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

The ski resort in the Dolomites was previously the host in 1956.\n\nThe competitions will take place in seven different locations in northern Italy as 2,900 athletes will compete for gold, silver, and bronze medals until February 22.\n\nThe main opening ceremony will begin at 8 pm (1900 GMT) in Milan's San Siro stadium. Italian President Sergio Mattarella will officially open the 25th Winter Games with a speech.\n\nThe musical program will feature many prominent figures, such as pop star Mariah Carey and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\nThe traditional athlete parade will also take place in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Predazzo, and Livigno.\n\nAlso for the first time, there's going to be two Olympic cauldrons: one at the Arco della Pace in Milan and another at Piazza Dibona in Cortina.\n\nIt's still unknown who will light them up, but according to media reports Olympic alpine skiing champions Alberto Tomba and Deborah Caompagnoni will take the prestigious task.\n\nSeveral prominent political figures will be in attendance. More than 50 heads of state and government are expected to be at the San Siro.\n\nUS President Donald Trump won't attend the ceremony, but US Vice President JD Vance landed in Milan on Thursday. Germany will be represented by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nThe opening ceremony, as well as the entire Games, will take place under tight security amid fears of attacks and sabotage. More than 6,000 security personnel will be on duty during the event.",
