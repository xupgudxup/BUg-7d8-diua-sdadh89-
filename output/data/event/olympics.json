    "fullText": "The men’s ice hockey is into the knockout rounds at the 2026 Winter Olympics, after Canada and the USA both topped their groups.\n\nThe past three winners of the gold medal have been Finland, Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) and Canada, in 2014. Four years before that, in 2010, Canada took home the gold once more, after beating the US in the final in Vancouver.\n\nThe USA has 11 medals in total for competition in ice hockey but has not taken home the gold medal since 1980, over 45 years ago. Their only other gold medal came in 1960.\n\nUSA vs Canada ice hockey final live: Latest updates as women’s teams face off for Winter Olympics golds\n\nBut 2026 will mark the first time since 2014 where NHL players have participated in Olympic ice hockey. Historically the NHL and International Olympic Committee have failed to reach an agreement on allowing NHL players to participate. In both 2018 and 2022 this was the case, affecting the USA, Canada and many other countries.\n\nWith the inclusion of the NHL once more, Canada are the favourites for the gold medal in Milan. The USA are behind Canada as the second favourites but the USA are touted as the team to beat in the women’s ice hockey.\n\nCanada or Finland vs USA or Slovakia (8.10am ET)\n\nCanada or Finland vs USA or Slovakia (3.40pm ET)\n\nFebruary 12: Czech Republic 0-5 Canada\n\nFebruary 13: Switzerland 1-5 Canada\n\nFebruary 15: Canada 10-2 France\n\nAll games will either be played at the Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena or the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena.",

    "fullText": "What country is AIN? Explaining abbreviation for Russian figure skater at 2026 Winter Olympics originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFigure skating is one of the Winter Olympics' signature offerings. No event within its orbit carries more weight than its last — the women's singles.\n\nWomen's singles has long served a platform for the sport's finest talents to shine. From Katarina Witt's dominance with East Germany in the 1984 and 1988 Games to Tara Lipinski's triumphs in the 1998 tournament, the event is a memorable one, offering a spotlight for the sport's finest talents to flaunt their gifts.\n\nThe 2026 iteration of the competition is no exception. Ami Nakai, Kaori Sakamoto and Alysa Liu are some of the standouts who have captivated the masses thus far. So too has Adeliia Petrosian, an 18-year-old who could compete for a podium place.\n\nWhen she takes to the ice, Petrosian sports an unfamiliar flag — one that includes the \"AIN\" abbreviation on it. Just what is Petrosian's country of origin? And why must she compete under the AIN banner? Here's what you need to know.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\n\"AIN\" is the country code for \"Individual Neutral Athletes\", referred to as Athlètes Individuels Neutres in French. The team consists of Russian and Belarusian athletes who meet several criteria, one of which bars athletes who \"actively support\" Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.\n\nRussian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) banner during the 2022 Winter Olympics, an aftershock of a doping scandal which brought about a two-year ban from all major sporting events.\n\nLike FIFA and UEFA, the IOC swiftly moved to bar Russia and Belarus from international competition following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. They've been inconsistent in their willingness to apply that tactic elsewhere: Israel has fielded teams for the 2024 Summer Olympics and 2026 Winter Olympics despite the country committing a genocide against Palestinians, as laid out by numerous human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, the United Nations and Human Rights Watch.\n\nTwenty athletes are presently playing under the AIN banner, including Petrosian and Nikita Filippov, a Russian ski mountaineer who claimed silver in the men's sprint in 2026.\n\nMORE: What's the story behind Alysa Liu's teeth piercings?\n\nPetrosian hails from Moscow. The 18-year-old is widely considered one of Russia's best skaters, capturing three Russian national championships and three Russian Grand Prix Final titles.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics represents just the second time Petrosian has competed in a senior-level event outside of Russia since 2022. Her performances are artful and athletic, pockmarked by dizzying spins and quadruple jumps, the hardest skill to master in the sport.\n\nHer inclusion on the AIN roster has made her the subject of some controversy. Petrosian has never tested positive for steroids or been implicated in doping. But the ROC had its 2022 team event gold medal stripped when one of Petrosian's training mates, then-15-year-old Kamila Valieva, tested positive for a banned substance thought to improve stamina and endurance.\n\nValieva served a four-year ban as a result of the alleged misdeed. The rest of her team — including coach Eteri Tutberidze and choreographer Daniil Gleikhengauz — were spared punishment. Gleikhengauz is Petrosian's coach at the 2026 Winter Olympics, while Tutberidze — officially serving as one of Georgia's figure skating coaches — reportedly accompanied Petrosian during practices, according to The New York Times.\n\nMORE: Youngest, oldest American Olympians in 2026\n\nPetrosian satisfied the International Skating Union's requirements to return to competition as an unaffiliated athlete. The pathway required athletes to complete several steps. The IOC ruled that AIN athletes had to disavow Russia's war with Ukraine and \"not have any ties to military agencies in their countries,\", according to NBC.\n\nMORE: Explaining the differences between ice dancing and figure skating\n\nRussians have found plenty of success in the women's singles event in the Winter Olympics. They nearly swept the podium places in 2018 and 2022, taking gold and silver in each tournament. However, athletes were unable to perform under Russia's banner following the suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee amid the country's doping scandal.\n\nThe last time a Russian won a medal in the women's singles event while competing for Russia was in 2014, when Adelina Sotnikova outshined Japan's Yuna Kim and Italy's Carolina Kostner for the prize.\n\nMORE:Full guide to figure skating scoring system",

    "fullText": "Any Olympic sport requires rigorous training, preparation and immense talent. Every four years, athletes from across the globe compete in the toughest competitions of their lives for the chance at a medal.\n\nHowever, during Wednesday's women's cross-country skiing team sprint race, it was proven that you don't have to be a superhuman to compete in the Olympics.\n\n🐶\nDuring the competition, which involves a six-mile sprint through the snow, Croatian skier Tena Hadzic was making her final stretch toward the finish line when a Czechoslovakian wolfdog managed to enter the course in Tesero, Italy. The two-year-old dog named Nazgul trailed not far behind Hadzic when he managed to cross the finish line among cheers from fans in the stands.\n\nAfter his triumphant Olympic participation, Nazgul was then captured by race officials and returned to his home at a local bed and breakfast near the track. While some may say Nazgul has an unfair advantage in racing in the snow, his viral moment was the highlight performance for many this Olympic season.\n\nNPR interviewed the owners, who revealed, \"He was crying this morning more than normal because he was seeing us leaving — and I think he just wanted to follow us.\" Describing him as \"stubborn, but very sweet,\" Nazgul was reported safe and unharmed during his Olympic run, not before posing for his unofficial bronze medal performance.\n\nAlthough the incident occurred in the midst of a preliminary qualifying round, the top medal contenders had already concluded their participation by the time Nazgul arrived, ensuring no official medal contention was jeopardized.\n\nHadzic also revealed to NPR that although it did cost \"some seconds,\" the entire ordeal was not a \"big deal, because I'm not fighting for medals or anything big.\"\n\nOther athletes, like Greece's Konstantina Charalampidou, told ESPN, \"He was chasing the camera that goes up and down the finish line. He was cute but not aggressive. I wanted to pet him, but I didn't have the time, and I couldn't find him afterwards.\"\n\nWhile it looks like Nazgul won't be returning to fight for an official podium finish, many pet parents are starting to gear up their own pets for the potential of a Pet Olympics in the future, where Nazgul may defend his title.\n\nIn the meantime, the Olympics organization has released Nazgul's photo finish as a testament to his participation in the Olympics, a feat that not many humans will be able to replicate.",

    "fullText": "Rapid uphill sprinting with skis on, lung-busting runs up steps with boots on and a downhill ski race to the finish line.\n\nThe new Winter Olympic sport of ski mountaineering - or skimo for short - made its highly anticipated debut on Thursday in blizzard conditions in Bormio.\n\nSwitzerland's Marianne Fatton added Olympic gold to her world title in the women's sprint event and France's Emily Harrop, who could have competed for Team GB, took silver.\n\n\"It's a magical day. It's history for our sport, and for us as athletes, and it's wonderful,\" said Fatton.\n\n\"It was so emotional. I was like, 'did I really do it?' It was amazing, and I was totally exhausted after the race.\"\n\nSpain's Oriol Cardona Coll took top spot in the men's sprint, the nation's first gold medal at a Winter Olympics in 54 years with their previous one won by Alpine skier Francisco Fernandez Ochoa at Sapporo in 1972.\n\nSilver in the men's event went to Russian athlete Nikita Filippov, who was competing under the neutral banner.\n\nDespite the relentless snowfall, fans poured in and lined the course to cheer on the athletes at the nearly sold-out event with much intrigue surrounding the sport's inaugural Olympic appearance.\n\nSpectators who had braved the conditions were treated to a thrilling competition as athletes pushed themselves to the limit to hike to the top of the hill then ski back down.\n\nThe first new sport added to the Winter Olympics since snowboarding in 1998, skimo is rooted in the 19th Century, before lifts to take skiers up mountains had been invented.\n\nThe sprint events consist of both an ascent and descent, with athletes sprinting uphill with skins on their skis to provide traction, navigating a diamond-shaped obstacle on their way up to a stairway in the mountain.\n\nThey then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot, before a further uphill section on skis.\n\nOnce they reach the top of the course, they remove the skins, and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThe average duration of a race is about three minutes.\n\nThe speed and format of the competition meant fans were quickly invested in the absorbing contest and generated a lively atmosphere.\n\nBBC commentator Matt Chilton said: \"The ski mountaineering event has been so well-received.\n\n\"Televisually, it is superb. For the [in person] fans, they can see everything from the grand stand. They don't miss a moment watching the action directly and on the big screen.\"\n\nSimilar to the summer Olympic sport of triathlon, the transitions are key to a successful race.\n\nThat is ultimately what let Harrop down as she struggled in the second transition, getting the skins caught instead of ripping them off in one clean motion.\n\nHarrop has English parents and could have represented Team GB but opted to compete for France, where she was born and bred.\n\nShe had topped both her heat and semi-final and looked on course for gold in the final but, after the second transition, was trailing behind Fatton and could not catch up on the downhill segment.\n\n\"It means a lot. When I look back to when I started the sport, it wasn't even on the (Olympic) programme,\" Harrop, who started out as an Alpine skier, said.\n\n\"I had an Olympic dream when I was an Alpine skier, and then when I stopped, it was just game over. So now to be here on this stage is mad.\n\n\"The atmosphere is good. The slope itself isn't super technical, but today they made the downhill a little bit more technical than usual, so that was fun.\"\n\nA mixed relay event will take place on Saturday, where one man and woman from each nation completes two laps of the course each with a race typically lasting 30-40 minutes.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Since leaving Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp has been making the most of his break from football management, taking some time to relax away from the touchline.\n\nThis week, he was seen ringing the bell at the Winter Olympics, continuing to enjoy life without the demands of daily training and matches.\n\nDespite his intention to step away from management following his 2024 departure from Liverpool, Klopp has still found himself linked to several high-profile jobs.\n\nRecent reports have suggested he could be in line for one of the vacant roles at either Chelsea or Manchester United. There were even claims that both clubs had reached out to his representatives over a possible return.\n\nBut according to Fabrizio Romano, both clubs have now denied those rumours.\n\nIn a recent update on his YouTube channel, Romano said he has spoken directly with both clubs regarding the speculation.\n\nAccording to him, while both clubs respect what Klopp has achieved, neither made any formal move to bring him in.\n\nRomano explained: “When contacted, both clubs – Manchester United and Chelsea – are playing down those reports, saying that nothing really happened with Jurgen Klopp apart from the admiration they have for one of the best managers in the world.”\n\n“Both clubs absolutely announce that they never had any advanced or concrete negotiations to appoint Jurgen Klopp.”\n\nChelsea have already filled their managerial vacancy by hiring Liam Rosenior. But with United still searching for their next manager, it wouldn’t be a surprise if talk about Klopp resurfaces later in the summer.\n\nReal Madrid are another club who could be looking for a permanent manager this summer, having brought in former Liverpool defender Alvaro Arbeloa as an interim coach. Despite the speculation, Romano says there’s nothing developing between Klopp and the Spanish club.\n\n“On the future of Jurgen Klopp, don’t forget that he’s still very busy with the Red Bull project, still focused on that,” he said.\n\n“With Real Madrid, I keep telling you guys, let’s see what happens with Arbeloa because he’s doing a very good job now. Second step, Jurgen Klopp has some people in the Real Madrid board appreciating him a lot, but at the moment I’m not aware of concrete talks. That’s the status as of today.”\n\nKlopp remains one of football’s most respected figures and could likely walk into any role he wanted. But so far, he’s kept to his word about taking time away from coaching.\n\nWhy PSG passed on Jeremy Jacquet before £60m Liverpool switch\n\nHow Anthony Gordon’s record pace could transform Arne Slot’s Liverpool frontline\n\nJadon Sancho sidesteps question about Liverpool legend during Paris date with Saweetie",

    "fullText": "MILAN — In the immediate aftermath of Sidney Crosby leaving a game because of injury, Jon Cooper said he didn't know Crosby's status and noted, \"I don't even have my poker face on.\"\n\nIt was back on the next day, as Cooper declined to give a definitive answer on the status of Canada's men's hockey team captain, who did not partake in an optional practice on Feb. 19. However, Cooper did not rule him out for the remainder of the 2026 Winter Olympics, which at most would be two games. Canada plays a semifinal game against Finland on Feb. 20 at Milan Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. Win or lose, there's a medal game next.\n\n\"Sid is by no means ruled out of the tournament,\" Cooper said. \"We’ve got the best of the best looking at him. We’re taking this day by day. And we’re not going to put anyone in harm’s way. But if he can play, he’s definitely going to. We’ll know \n\nCanada needed overtime to advance out of a quarterfinal match against Czechia, and had to make do for more than half of it without Crosby.\n\nCrosby was injured on a hard hit from Czechia's Radko Gudas, with Crosby's right leg buckling as he went down. He was also crunched by Martin Necas. Crosby hobbled to Canada's bench, then down the tunnel, and did not return.\n\nInstead, he addressed his teammates during the second intermission, when it was 2-2, essentially urging them to go get the victory.\n\n\"There was a lot more than that,\" Cooper said. \"You know, he's a true leader.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sidney Crosby injury update: Canada’s hockey captain not ruled out at Olympics",

    "description": "Granlund's Finland surges toward Olympic glory, while Gudas and Dostal's medal hopes end in a thrilling quarterfinal overtime loss.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Olympic Games are coming to an end, as all four men’s hockey quarterfinals were played on Wednesday.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks had three players in action: Lukas Dostal (Czechia), Radko Gudas (Czechia), and Mikael Granlund (Finland). Damian Clara’s Italy squad was eliminated on Tuesday, and Jackson LaCombe was a healthy scratch for the fourth consecutive game for the United States.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas, Dostal Advance with Czechia, Clara Eliminated with Italy\n\nFrank Vatrano Talks Shoulder Injury and Tough Season\n\nWith the way the qualifying games shook out after the preliminary round, Czechia found themselves facing Canada for the second time in five games. They had lost 5-0 to open the tournament and were more prepared to face the gold-medal favorite in the quarterfinals.\n\nAn evenly-played first period saw Czechia take a 2-1 lead into the second period, and Canada handily controlled the majority of possession from there. Behind astute interior defending from Gudas and the blueline, Dostal made a handful of big saves and gave his team a chance to win.\n\nOndrej Palat gave Czechia a 3-2 lead late in the third period, but it was answered by Nick Suzuki four minutes later, and the game was sent to overtime, where Mitch Marner advanced Canada to the semis after a minute and a half of OT.\n\nGudas made his presence felt early and often on the defensive side of the puck, not only by providing his trademark physical play, but with keen anticipation skills that disrupted several Canadian attacks through the neutral zone.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those neutral zone pressures sent Canada captain Sidney Crosby to the locker room for the remainder of the game with a lower-body injury. Gudas stepped up on Crosby, as an outlet in the second period, and Crosby seemingly attempted to dodge the hit, but folded on his right leg in an unfortunate way. No penalty was called on the ice.\n\nGudas had an up-and-down tournament, but saved his best hockey for when it mattered most in today’s game. Gudas finished this game with an assist, a high-skilled play where he picked off a cross-ice neutral zone pass and turned it the other way, starting a 3v2. He also registered two penalty minutes and two shots on goal in 19:57 TOI.\n\nHe finished his second, and what will likely be his last, Olympic Games with a point (an assist) in five games played, but he won’t bring a medal home with him.\n\nMuch like the rest of the tournament and his entire 2025-26 season with the Anaheim Ducks, Dostal played very well. However, “very well” is below the superhuman level he needed to perform at if he was to carry his Czech team to the podium at these Olympics.\n\nAs mentioned, he did enough to earn a win in this game, but he didn’t solely win the game for Czechia. He brought his entire arsenal to this quarterfinal matchup: perfect lateral puck tracking, powerful pushes when pucks moved from the goal line to the slot or dots, and terrific rebound control.\n\nThe element that stood out most this tournament, with Czechia’s suspect blueline as a whole, was his ability to knock down dump-ins and individually start breakouts with pinpoint outlets to his defensemen or wingers up the wall.\n\nDostal finished this game by saving 37 of the 41 shots he faced for a .902 SV%. He finished his first Olympic Games medal-less, sporting a 1-3-0 record, and an .886 SV%.\n\nSwitzerland gave Finland quite the scare, as Switzerland had been one of the more impressive and cohesive teams in this tournament, even without the services of star forward Kevin Fiala. Switzerland got a pair of goals late in the first period of what was a high-intensity back-and-forth affair.\n\nSebastian Aho and MIro Heiskanen dashed the Swiss’s hopes of winning in regulation with a pair of late goals that sent the game to overtime, as the Finnish firepower proved too overwhelming and unrelenting for Switzerland. On the ropes, the Finnish coaching staff threw their forward lines into a blender halfway through the game with hopes of igniting a comeback, and they were eventually rewarded.\n\nFinland captain and Ducks’ forward Mikael Granlund started the game in the spot where he started the tournament: on the left wing of Roope Hintz and opposite Mikko Rantanen. As lines were tinkered with, he played with Sebastian Aho and Tuevo Teravainen for a stretch in the second, and played most of the third with Hintz and Kaapo Kakko. It will be curious to monitor how the lines shake out for Finland’s all-important semi-final game against Canada on Friday.\n\nHe was mostly a non-factor on the top line, but provided linemates with steady defensive habits, typically as an F3. When lines began to mix, he earned more puck touches, made several connecting plays to advance pucks up ice, and displayed elite edges multiple times when breaking down defenders along the offensive wall.\n\nGranlund finished this game scoreless with four shots on goal in 20:12 TOI, third-most among Finnish forwards.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Dostal, Gudas, Czechia Drop Overtime Game to Switzerland, LaCombe Scratched for Third Straight\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Granlund's Finland Dismantles Clara's Italy, LaCombe Scratched for USA\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas Defeats France with Czechia, Granlund Assists in Finland Win Against Rival Sweden",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin not only battled her opponents but Father Time at the 2026 Olympics.\n\nWith her gold medal in slalom, she became the youngest and oldest American ever to win Olympic gold in the event. She first won at 18, and her 2026 victory came at 30.\n\nThe Olympics are the pinnacle of sport, contested on a global stage. Physical fitness is paramount, and Shiffrin will be 34 years old when the next Winter Games arrive. She has competed in the Olympics since she was a teenager, and it is no secret that the end of her Olympic career is drawing near.\n\nHere is more on Shiffrin’s future and whether she plans to compete in the 2030 Olympics.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nShiffrin has not decided if she will participate in the next Olympics. A lot could change over the next four years, and she would still have to qualify for her events if she does choose to compete.\n\nAfter winning her gold medal in slalom, Shiffrin kept her reaction short and to the point.\n\n— Mikaela Shiffrin ⛷️ (@MikaelaShiffrin) February 18, 2026\n\nBefore winning her gold medal, Shiffrin had been struggling, continually coming up short in events since taking fourth in the 2018 Olympics. She said, \"The irony is I've cared so much about wanting everybody to know the reality and to not want to answer those questions and to be so sick and tired of it. And I’ve felt that way since (being) fourth in South Korea in the slalom.\" And then about the win she said, \"In order to do this today, I kind of needed to accept the possibility that those questions would keep coming. It was like, just don't resist it. Just live in my own moment.”\n\nThe gold medal win moved Shiffrin into a tie with Shaun White and Kaillie Humphries for second-most gold medals for American athletes at the Winter Olympics. She now has four total medals in alpine skiing, which moves her into a tie for most in the event by an American woman.\n\nAbout competing, Shiffrin said, \"The reality of our sport is you lose a lot more than you win. When you look back on my career, I know statistics and everything, but still I've definitely lost a lot more than I've won. So that's the one thing that's certain is that you're not going to win everything.”\n\nShe hasn't committed to her future, but has acknowledged that her career can't continue forever. She said, \"The one thing that's certain is that that wave's going to stop. You don't get to ride that wave forever.\"\n\nMORE: Mikaela Shiffrin snaps Olympics drought with historically dominant slalom gold",

    "fullText": "Amber Glenn is sharing her current mood after a disappointing short program at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics\n\nThe Texas native popped out of a triple jump and dropped to 13th place\n\nGlenn, a mental health advocate, shared two positive messages on social media on Wednesday\n\nAmber Glenn says she is “coping well” one day after skating a disappointing short program that landed her in 13th place at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nOn Tuesday, Feb. 17, the Team USA skater, 26, started strong, landing her triple axel. But she flubbed a jump when she popped out of a triple toe loop, which hurt her final score.\n\nAfterwards, Glenn was seemingly inconsolable as she tearfully skated off the ice to the kiss-and-cry area where she received her score, 67.39, more than 11 points off the lead.\n\nThe following day, the Plano, Texas native shared two posts on social media that gave a status update on her current mood on the eve of Thursday’s final.\n\n“Landing my highest scoring 3Axel,” she wrote over a video of herself celebrating, before she then hung her head, “Messing up the last jump and getting it invalidated.”\n\n“I'm coping well thanks for asking 🤪” Glenn captioned the TikTok.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn her Instagram Stories, the U.S. national champ shared an adorable image of a dog wearing a baseball cap with an inspirational message.\n\n“The world has ended for me many times and yet tomorrow still comes. Keep going,” the post read.\n\nComing into the Olympics, Glenn was a favorite, having earned eight individual first-place finishes since 2024. The athlete, an outspoken mental health advocate, has also won the last three U.S. championships, according to NBC Sports.\n\nDuring the Games, she won a gold medal as part of the team skating event.\n\nWhen she skated off the ice in Milan on Tuesday, commentator Tara Lipinski articulated what many fans were thinking.\n\n“This is heartbreaking to watch,” the 1998 Winter Olympics gold medalist said.\n\nTeammate Alysa Liu’s short program was a success, landing her in third place going into Thursday, but it was Glenn’s emotional state that was on her mind.\n\n“She’s gone through so much and she works so friggen’ hard, like genuinely, such a hard worker and she’s overcome a lot,” Liu told reporters, including PEOPLE. “I just want her to be happy. That’s genuinely all I want. And so I’ll be seeing her later, don’t worry guys. We’ll stick together.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

The minimalist silhouette was paired with metallic pointed-toe heels and added a reflective pop that complements the modern architectural backdrop. Her long blonde waves sat over one shoulder, bringing softness to the otherwise structured setting.\n\nThe two images showed Lipinski moving through the space, framed by angled concrete walls and geometric glass panels that double as mirrors.\n\nFollowers filled the comments with praise that included “Wow! 🔥” and “Stunning 🤍🤍.”\n\nOlivia Holt Serves Major Date-Night Energy in Chic Chocolate Leather\n\nPro Climber Sasha DiGiulian Turns Tokyo Streets Into Her Personal Runway in Power Neutral Layers\n\nDemi Moore Makes NYC Her Runway with Stylish Streetwear Looks\n\nThis story Former Olympian Tara Lipinski Steals the Spotlight in Milan With Sleek White Gown first appeared on Globe.",

Sidney Crosby was ruled out of the game early in the third period after suffering a lower-body injury.\n\nThe 38-year-old, two-time Olympic gold medalist left in the second period after being hit along the boards by Nečas and Radko Gudas. It was a third big hit Crosby took in the period after Gudas and Palát connected on checks with the Team Canada captain.\n\nCrosby recovered and took a stride following the Gudas and Nečas hit, but he was seen shaking his right leg before exiting the ice. After being attended to on Canada's bench, Crosby limped down the tunnel to the locker room. He did not return to the bench for the rest of the game.\n\nCzechia was leading 2-1 at the time of Crosby's injury.",

Gymnast Carlos Yulo won two gold medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd now Alpine skier Tallulah Proulx has become the first female athlete from the Philippines to compete in the Winter Olympics — and at 17, the youngest ever from the Southeast Asian country.\n\n“This is a new era for the Philippines and sports on the global stage and I really am grateful that I get to be a part of it,” the U.S.-born Proulx said as she finished 50th in the slalom at the Milan Cortina Games on Wednesday after carrying her country’s flag during the opening ceremony.\n\nShe was 52nd in the giant slalom.\n\nProulx grew up skiing at the Sierra Tahoe resort in California, then moved at age 7 to Iowa and raced at tiny Sundown Mountain before moving on Colorado and then settling in Park City, Utah, where she now resides.\n\nProulx’s father is from the Eastern Samar province in the Philippines’ Eastern Visayas region.\n\n“And I have a lot of relatives, family back there and honestly the response has been so heartwarming,” Proulx said. “Filipinos are just such warm and welcoming people. … I think that’s what makes us really strong and I’m so grateful that I get to be the first Filipina because I show that others can follow in my footsteps and hopefully get more involved into winter sports, which I know is quite hard in the Philippines.”\n\nProulx was slated to visit the Philippines for the first time a few years ago before her trip got canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, she has emersed herself in the country’s culture, thanks to her grandmother.\n\n“Me and my brother grew up with her cooking — all of course the delicious Filipino food and sharing her culture,” Proulx said. “Unfortunately, last year she passed away. … I really wanted to push for this and wanted to represent such an important part of my heritage, both for her and for myself.”\n\nIn Cortina, Proulx traded pins with American slalom standout Paula Moltzan and got a picture with slalom gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n“It’s amazing being around these people that I’ve looked up to my whole life,” she said, “and then realize I’m skiing that course next.”\n\nNext up for Proulx: a trip to the Philippines.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Over four decades after the 1984 Winter Olympics, Sarajevo is contending with what to do with its Olympic venues. Many are abandoned and crumbling.",
    "fullText": "Over 40 years ago, the Yugoslavian city of Sarajevo hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics. Many new structures were built, and the Games were seen as something of a reunion since many countries had boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow.\n\nBut six years later, the country would be thrown into turmoil during the Yugoslav Wars, which led to the fall of Yugoslavia. Sarajevo became the capital of a new country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1992, but the fighting didn't end until 2001.\n\nDuring the fighting, Olympic venues became battlegrounds, with ski slopes heavily mined and hotels turned into prisons.\n\nWhile Sarajevo's story is singular, it's not the only former Olympics host city where venues now resemble ghost towns. Olympics host countries famously pour millions of dollars into building new venues, which sometimes fall into disrepair after the crowds have gone home.\n\nMilan Cortina, the host of this year's Olympics, hopes to avoid this costly mistake.\n\n\"The Games are capitalizing on existing infrastructure and local winter sports expertise, aiming to create lasting socio-economic benefits for the local population,\" said Marie Sallois, the IOC director for sustainability.\n\nOf the 13 venues being used across northern Italy, 11 either already exist or are set to be torn down after the games. The country only needed to construct two new permanent venues, per the IOC.\n\nHere's what the 1984 Sarajevo Olympic venues look like in 2026.\n\nThe 1984 Games were the first Winter Olympics to be held in a socialist state and the second consecutive Games to be held in a socialist country after the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\nA destroyed hotel at Mount Igman, where events including ski jumping were held in 1984, is pictured in 2014.\n\nThis is what the bobsled track looked like in 2014 — it's been almost completely left to nature.\n\nSylvia Hui at the Associated Press wrote that year, \"Today, the abandoned concrete construction looks like a skeleton littered with graffiti.\"\n\nNPR reported the Bosnian war led to 100,000 deaths and the \"worst atrocities in Europe since World War II.\"\n\nAccording to Getty, 10 years after the Winter Olympics, \"the hotel was turned into a prison and place of execution for Bosnian Muslims — all overseen by Serb Forces.\"\n\nEven the medal podium was turned into an execution site, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAccording to Getty, \"The area around the 90-meter hill was heavily mined during the Bosnian war.\"\n\nMoss and debris cover the jumps.\n\nThese Olympic rings have fallen into disrepair.\n\nEast Germany's Jens Weißflog and Finland's Matti Nykänen each took home gold medals in ski jumping that year.\n\n\"The remains of destroyed restaurants, hotels, sports facilities and mountain huts were left to rot and the thousands of mines were cleared at a painstakingly slow pace\" after the war ended, The Guardian wrote in 2018.\n\nA photo from 2015 shows downhill bikers using the bobsled tracks for training.\n\nThe walls are covered in tags and street art.\n\nThe track on Mount Trebević was covered in snow when it was photographed in January 2018.\n\nThe cable car follows the same route today as it did during the Olympics.\n\n\"The mountain has slowly returned to something like its former self,\" The Guardian wrote in 2018. \"Hotels, restaurants and cafes have been rebuilt, mines swept away and hikers from all over Sarajevo visit en masse.\"\n\nA wartime cemetery was built right next to the Zetra Olympic Hall.\n\nFollowing the war, the Zetra Ice Hall was rebuilt in 1997 and reopened in 1999. It's still in use and is now known as the Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic Hall.\n\nIn 2024, some of the slopes remain abandoned. Olympics branding, like these rings, was still visible.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarajevo isn't the only city that has to reckon with abandoned Olympic venues. There are empty stadiums all over the world.",

Things got tense when Norway’s Marcus Kleveland, the second-to-last rider, crushed his own final run. The judges took an extraordinarily long time to post Kleveland’s score, leaving an anxious Canter waiting to see if he’d be knocked off the podium.\n\nWhen Kleveland’s score came in at 78.96, Canter breathed a huge sigh of relief. Moments later, when New Zealand’s Dane Menzies crashed on his run, it was celebration time for Canter. \n\nIt’s the first Olympic medal for the 22 year old Coloradan, who won the Aspen World Cup in January to secure his place on Team USA.\n\nChina’s star snowboarded Su Yiming won his second career Olympic gold (big air, 2022) while Japan’s Taiga Hasegawa took silver.\n\nRed Gerard, the 2018 gold medalist, finished sixth while 17-year old Ollie Martin finished ninth for Team USA.",

    "fullText": "Would it surprise you to know that Team GB's curlers are full-time?\n\nThat they train 12 months a year, with only a couple of weeks holiday during the summer? That they are actually on the ice 44 weeks a year?\n\nThat they lift weights like sprinters, strategise like chess players, and fuel like Tour de France cyclists?\n\nIt's now 24 years since Rhona Martin delivered the 'Stone of Destiny' in Salt Lake City - watched by millions of rapt viewers in the early hours UK-time - to win Winter Olympic gold for Great Britain.\n\nThe nation's first Games gold in 18 years had been won by what was dismissively - and erroneously - described at the time as a group of Scottish housewives in an odd little sport.\n\nIt sparked a curiosity in curling that spikes for a couple of weeks every four years.\n\nBut aside from that window into their world, little is known about what they do for the remaining three years and 11 months of an Olympic cycle.\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nSwearing, illicit filming & rule changes - what next in curling cheating row?\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nThe 10 Scottish curlers who are representing Team GB in Cortina right now are professional athletes.\n\nFrom the start of July until the end of April - when they are not at a competition somewhere in the world - they will report to the National Curling Academy in Stirling every weekday morning to start training at 08:00.\n\nEach day includes two two-hour ice sessions and one in the gym.\n\nAcross a week, three of those gym stints are strength-based and two conditioning. Most athletes will add another at the weekend, just to keep themselves right.\n\nThey are supervised - no sitting on a bench next to the weights while doomscrolling for this lot - and are specifically designed with curling in mind.\n\n\"It's Olympic lifts we're doing - clean and jerk, snatches, squats, the lot,\" says men's lead Hammy McMillan. \"And we're using ski machines, rowers, and assault bikes to really condition our bodies.\"\n\n\"The numbers we put up, I don't think people would expect them,\" adds Bobby Lammie, who is credited alongside McMillan as having changed the physicality expected of sweepers.\n\n\"It's allowed us to separate ourselves slightly from the rest of the world.\"\n\nSimilar can be said of the women's game, where 2022 gold medallist Jen Dodds - one of the world's best with a brush - is lifting just as much as some of the men.\n\n\"More than me, to be fair,\" admits men's vice-skip Grant Hardie.\n\n\"Jen is incredible in the gym,\" adds Team GB women's skip Rebecca Morrison, who takes a slightly different view of the physical work.\n\n\"You need a lot of core strength to even stay upright on the ice,\" she says.\n\n\"Maybe we're not flinging ourselves off massive jumps or sliding down a track at 80 miles per hour, but it's a lot harder than people realise to even keep your balance.\"\n\nAdd in tactical and analysis sessions, meetings with sports psychologist and nutritionists, and physio, and the days quickly become filled.\n\nIn May and June, most of those demands disappear, but the strength and conditioning work continues every weekday morning.\n\nAt some point during that spell, a couple of weeks are permitted for a holiday, but then the curlers are back at it.\n\n\"It's a full-time, all-year round job,\" says BBC Sport pundit Vicky Wright, who won Olympic women's gold in Beijing four years ago and is married to head coach Greg Drummond.\n\n\"May and June are supposed to be your recovery time - and you get a break at some point during those months - but you never have an actual holiday from it. You're curling 44 weeks a year, easily.\"\n\nThe curlers will be given an annual Athlete Performance Award (APA) by UK Sport.\n\nThat will be in one of five tiers so the more pedigree you have, the more money you will be given.\n\nWright recalls that, when she was in the Olympic cycle for the Beijing Games, she still had to work one day a week as a nurse to supplement her APA enough to get a mortgage.\n\nNone of those in Italy this month are in that position, but some pick up some coaching on the side, while others such as Hardie and Sophie Sinclair have an involvement in their family's engineering and farming businesses, respectively.\n\nAdd in prize money from the Grand Slam Tour, World Tour and assorted European events - which tends to be capped at around £40,000 per team - plus the odd little bit of sponsorship, and the income starts to go up.\n\nBut let's be clear - none of these curlers are living in luxury, never mind making life-changing money.\n\n\"It's fine if you're at the top and winning slams week in, week out,\" Wright adds. \"But if you're not... I'm not saying it's not worth it, but it's difficult.\"\n\nBruce Mouat's British men's rink - who won silver at the Olympics four years ago and went into these Games as world champions and gold medal favourites - are in a better position than most.\n\nTheir success on the ice has bolstered their APAs, and they opted to employ a management company last year to enhance their prospects away from curling.\n\nNow, they have some commercial partners, as well as doing appearances at events as diverse as the Royal Highland Show and corporate away days.\n\nMouat has been known to speak to companies about LGBT issues and inclusivity, while Hardie will soon do a talk about the importance of science, technology, engineering and maths in schools.\n\n\"But the boys are definitely not making a fortune,\" said someone close to the team.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nAre players allowed to fight in Olympic ice hockey?\n\nWhy do we rarely see world records at the Winter Olympics?\n\nWhich country is the most successful at the Winter Olympics?",

    "description": "Here's what to keep an eye on during the 12th day of the Olympics in Italy.",
    "fullText": "The Winter Games have begun in Italy. From the rink to the slopes, a new generation of stars has emerged to chase gold. We’ll keep you connected to all of the thrilling moments and top stories as we track the medal race each day of the Games.\n\nTeam USA is up to 21 medals after a pair of second-place finishes on Tuesday in Italy. There are several opportunities for the Americans to add to that count on Wednesday, too. And, while there's no medal up for grabs yet, the men's hockey team is back in action in a must-win quarterfinal game against Sweden.\n\nHere are the top five things to watch on Wednesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics:\n\nThis was rescheduled due to weather, and a trio of Americans will try to reach the podium in what is sure to be an entertaining final. Red Gerard is perhaps the most notable among them after his gold medal win in PyeongChang in 2018 when he was just 17 years old. He missed the podium completely four years ago, however. Jake Cander and Oliver Martin will also be competing for Team USA.\n\nMark McMorris of Canada will attempt to win a fourth straight medal in the event, too. He won bronze four years ago. China’s Su Yiming, the silver medal winner in Beijing, is also in the final.\n\nLike the men’s competition, the women’s snowboard slopestyle final was also rescheduled to Wednesday. All eyes will be on New Zealand’s Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, who is the favorite to defend her gold medal from four years ago. She posted the highest score in the qualifying round, and also won silver in the Big Air competition earlier in the Games.\n\nJessica Perlmutter and Lily Dhawornvej are the two Americans who reached the final, though they will have some work to do to reach the podium in this loaded field.\n\nThe U.S. men’s and women’s curling teams will each take on Great Britain on Wednesday in group play.\n\nThe women’s team holds a 5-2 record so far in group play after a dominant 10-3 win over Denmark on Tuesday, their largest win so far of the Games. They’ll wrap up with a match against Switzerland on Thursday before the knockout stage gets going.\n\nThe men’s team is in worse shape entering the match. They hold a 4-4 record after falling to both China and Italy on Tuesday, which has them in fifth. A win is critical, and still may not get them into the finals.\n\nAfter an undefeated run throughout the group stage, the U.S. men’s hockey team will take the ice again on Wednesday in the quarterfinals. They’ll take on Sweden, who beat Latvia 5-1 in a qualification round game on Tuesday.\n\nMen’s hockey beat Germany 5-1 after a slow start on Sunday to wrap up the group stage action, though they were far less dominant than they could have been. Sweden entered Milan as a medal favorite, too, and only lost their group due to a goal differential. Wednesday’s match looks like it’ll be far from easy for the Americans.\n\nAndrew Heo made it through qualifying on Monday, so he’ll have a shot at a medal in the men’s 500-meter short track speed skating final on Wednesday night. The 24-year-old won the event at the ISU Short Track World Tour last fall, and he won his qualifying heat handily.\n\nHeo will have to get past Canada’s Steven Dubois, who won bronze in the event in Beijing four years ago, and favorite William Dandjinou to reach the podium. The Canadian duo posted two of the fastest three qualifying times on Monday.\n\n4 a.m.: Women’s run 1 (USA Network)\n\n7:20 a.m.: Women’s run 2 (USA Network coverage begins at 7:55 a.m.)🏅\n\n8:45 a.m.: Women’s final (airs on USA Network at 3:45 p.m.)🏅\n\n3:45 a.m.: Men’s and women’s qualifying (airs on USA Network 5 a.m.)\n\n5:35 a.m.: Men’s and women’s finals (airs on USA Network at 8:30 a.m.)🏅\n\n3:05 a.m.: USA vs. Great Britain (airs on USA Network at 9:15 a.m.), China vs. Denmark, Sweden vs. South Korea\n\n1:05 p.m.: Great Britain vs. Japan, Switzerland vs. Denmark, Canada vs. Italy (airs on USA Network at 8 p.m.), China vs. Sweden\n\n8:05 a.m.: USA vs. Great Britain (airs on CNBC at 5 p.m.), Italy vs. Canada, China vs. Czechia, Norway vs. Switzerland\n\n5:30 a.m.: Women's final (5:30 a.m.)🏅\n\n6:10 a.m.: Slovakia vs. Germany (airs on USA Network at 1 p.m.)\n\n10:40 a.m.: Canada va.

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world’s glaciers.\n\nAnd Olympic host city Cortina is a fitting place for them to be talking about climate change: Glaciers once visible from town have dramatically shrunk. Many have been reduced to tiny glaciers or residual ice patches at high elevations among the jagged peaks of the Dolomites. Any Olympian or spectator wishing to lay eyes on a major glacier would have to take a long drive on winding mountain roads to the Marmolada. It's melting rapidly, too.\n\nThe world’s top skiers train on glaciers because of the high-quality snow there, and a warming world jeopardizes the future of their sport. Vonn started skiing on glaciers in Austria when she was just 9 years old.\n\n“Most of the glaciers that I used to ski on are pretty much gone,” 41-year-old Vonn said Feb. 3 in response to a question from The Associated Press at a prerace press conference in Cortina before she crashed on the Olympic downhill course. “So that’s very real and it’s very apparent to us.”\n\nAs athletes in snow sports, Shiffrin said, they “get a real front-row view” to the monumental changes underway atop some of the world’s highest, coldest peaks.\n\n“It is something that’s very close to our heart, because it is the heart and soul of what we do,” Shiffrin told AP after racing Sunday. “I would really, really like to believe and hope that with strong voices and sort of broader policy changes within companies and governments, there is a hope for a future of our sport. But I think right now, it’s a little bit of a ... it’s a question.”\n\nItalian glaciologist Antonella Senese said Italy has lost more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) of glacier area since the late 1950s.\n\n“We are observing a continuous and uninterrupted decrease in glacier area and volume. In the last one to two decades, this reduction has clearly accelerated,” Senese, associate professor of physical geography in the University of Milan's environmental science and policy department, said in an interview.\n\nAmong the peaks surrounding Cortina d’Ampezzo, there are glaciers on the slopes of the Cristallo and Sorapiss mountains. The 2015 New Italian Glacier Inventory found these glaciers shrunk by about one-third since the 1959-1962 inventory.\n\nShortly after winning a second gold Sunday at her home Winter Olympics, Brignone told AP that skiing is “totally different” now than when she was younger. Brignone lives in the Valle d’Aosta, about six hours away.\n\nWhen she sees how glaciers are retreating to higher elevations, Brignone said she’s not thinking about the future of skiing — she’s concerned for the future of the planet.\n\n“There we have a lot of glaciers, but they are going up and up, every year, more and more,” she told AP.\n\nYet many people who don't frequent the mountains remain unaware of what's at stake, so the University of Innsbruck created the Goodbye Glaciers Project. The loss of glaciers has far-reaching consequences, threatening water sources, increasing mountain hazards and contributing to sea level rise.\n\nThe project shows how different warming levels change the amount of ice left on selected glaciers around the world. To be included, glaciers must have an estimated 2020 volume of at least 0.01 cubic kilometers. The Cristallo and Sorapiss glaciers no longer meet that threshold, said Patrick Schmitt, a doctoral student at the University of Innsbruck.\n\nSome 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Cortina is the Marmolada glacier, one of the largest glaciers in Italy and the largest in the Dolomites. An apartment building-sized chunk of the glacier detached in July 2022, sparking an avalanche of debris that killed 11 hikers. The mountain is popular for hiking in summer and skiing in winter.\n\nThe University of Padua said in 2023 the glacier had been halved over 25 years.\n\nIt's expected to be mostly gone by 2034 if the world warms 2.7 Celsius (4.9 Fahrenheit), according to the Goodbye Glaciers Project. But if warming is limited to 1.5 C (2.7 F — the international goal — the glacier’s life could be extended by another six years, and around 100 glaciers in the Alps can be saved, Schmitt said.\n\n“Cutting greenhouse gas emissions now will reduce future ice loss and soften the impacts on people and nature,” Schmitt wrote in an email. “The choices we make in this decade will decide how much ice remains in the Dolomites, across the Alps, and around the world.”\n\nGlobally, more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) has been lost since 2000, according to a study last year. And the prospective impact of climate change on Olympic sport is enormous; the list of places that could host Winter Games is projected to shrink substantially in the coming years.\n\nIn Cortina, Noa Szollos, who is competing for Israel, said in an interview the state of the nearby glaciers speaks to the condition of glaciers around the world.\n\n“I hope we can do something about it,” she said, “but it’s a hard time.”\n\nSilja Koskinen of Finland said in an interview she can’t train on some of the glaciers she used to because of crevices, rocks and flowing water. Team USA skier AJ Hurt talked about starting the season in October on glaciers in Sölden, Austria.\n\n“Every year, I feel like we come and there’s a little less snow. And every time, we’re like, are we really going to start in October? There’s no snow here,'” Hurt told the AP. “It is really sad and it’s hard to ignore in this sport, definitely, when we’re around it so much and it is so clear.”\n\nNorwegian skier Nikolai Schirmer is leading an effort to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports. Burning coal, oil and gas is the largest contributor to global climate change by far.\n\nIn Bormio, Italy, Team USA skier River Radamus said athletes — as stewards of outdoor winter sports— should be on the forefront of trying to defend the environment as best they can.\n\n“It’s always present in our mind that we’re on a dangerous trend unless we do something right,” Radamus said.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed from Bormio, Italy.\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAmber Glenn was expected to show out during the women's singles short program at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The three-time U.S. National champion is arguably the United States' finest talent in the event, leaping to gold at the 2024-25 Grand Prix.\n\nBut on Tuesday afternoon, with the eyes of the world watching, Glenn toiled. Her athleticism was still there as she pranced atop the slippery surface at Milano Ice Center.\n\nBut her precision was not. She missed an attempted triple loop, seeing her score tumble as a result. The drama was enough to leave her in tears.\n\nWith that, here's what you need to know about Glenn's short program routine.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nGlenn posted a 67.39 score on short program, good for 13th in the 29-skater field. She sits 11 points off the lead and nine points off the podium at the conclusion of Tuesday's routines.\n\nGlenn enjoyed early success in her program, showcasing her athleticism with a series of depth-defying jumps, including her patented triple axel. But while attempting to complete a triple loop, Glenn missed out on her triple loop, completing just two rotations.\n\nThe ending of Amber Glenn's short program. pic.twitter.com/CWK6kLWEyx\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 17, 2026\n\nHer jump was deemed incomplete, resulting in her receiving zero points for her effort. Glenn was left in tears when her score was shown on the Jumbotron.\n\nMORE: Where Amber Glenn would rank among oldest figure skating medalists\n\nGlenn's eyes were wild and weary following the conclusion of her short program:\n\nGlenn toiled on the ice, set back by an invalid showing on her triple toe loop element.\n\nIt was an unfortunate display for the 26-year-old, who is hoping to become one of the oldest medalists in Olympic figure skating. She was one of just two skaters to pull off a triple axel during the short program's, alongside Japan's Ami Nakai.\n\nWelcome to the triple Axel at the Olympics club, Nakai Ami and Amber Glenn! 🙌#FigureSkating#MilanoCortina2026pic.twitter.com/Rkn6xGTtl9\n\n— The Olympic Games (@Olympics) February 17, 2026\n\nThat wasn't enough to help Glenn penetrate the top-10. There's a gulf-sized gap between her and the podium places. That's not to say she can't overcome the deficit -- pairs star Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara came back from seven points down following their short program routine to take gold for Japan on Tuesday evening.\n\nShe'll need a nigh-on flawless to make it happen, however.\n\nMORE: USA figure skating star Alysa Liu dazzles in short program\n\nWhile Glenn's routine fell short of expectations, her short program soundtrack drew eyes -- and ears.\n\nThe choreography featured a familiar refrain for music fans of a certain generation: Madonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nGlenn says the suggestion came from her choreographer, Catherine Hill.\n\n\"'Like a Prayer' was a suggestion from my choreographer,\" Glenn told USA Today.\n\nShe was initially unconvinced, associating the tune with a children's choir cover of the track that was featured during two sequences in the 2024 film, \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nHill was persistent in her push for Glenn to use the song, however. After parsing through the lyrics, Glenn was sold.\n\n\"Eventually, we really explored the meaning behind it and the passion that we could really pour into the program,\" Glenn said. \"I'm really happy with how it came out.\"\n\nGlenn wasn't the only one delighted with the decision to use the track. Madonna herself praised Glenn's short program.\n\nUS figure skater Amber Glenn received a special message from one of her biggest fans...

    "fullText": "Team GB's Winter Olympics curling medal hopes are now in serious jeopardy after Bruce Mouat's world champions were beaten 9-5 by Canada in Cortina.\n\nArriving in Italy as gold-medal favourites, the British quartet have lost four of their eight matches in a round-robin stage full of maybes and might have beens.\n\nNow, they must beat the United States in their final game on Wednesday (13:05 GMT) - and hope either Italy or Norway fail to win both their closing games, against the Canadians and the unbeaten Swiss - to reach Thursday's semi-finals and salvage their podium prospects.\n\nThe 2022 silver medallists have spoken all week of playing well, but coming out on the wrong side of the narrow margins. And that was the case again against their great rivals high in the Dolomites.\n\nA shot here and a shot there was the difference, as Canada kept their shape better in the big moments and confirmed their own progress.\n\n\"That wasn't a game where we played well,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"We made too many mistakes and we're running out of time to put it right.\n\n\"I think we can deliver the right result tomorrow and hopefully get into the semis.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nMouat's rink have an excellent record against Brad Jacobs' team, and beat them in the last four of the worlds last spring.\n\nBut the Canadians knew they could improve their own chances - and inflict a little revenge - and they started strongly, opening a 3-1 lead after three ends.\n\nThe British team are considered the world's best, though, and righted themselves. Capitalising on a slight drop off by their opponents, they took two themselves in the fourth and another two in the sixth to lead with four to play.\n\nHowever, the clank of granite went against them in the seventh, an unfortunate bounce leaving Canada the chance of three, which they gladly took.\n\nMouat and his team needed to respond. They couldn't. Instead, they gave up a steal to leave themselves with a three-point deficit with two ends to play.\n\nIt was a deficit that they could not overcome. And now, their aspirations of upgrading their silver medal from Beijing are no longer in their own hands.\n\nGB's women are also in a perilous position, and also must beat the United States on Wednesday (08:05), as well as Japan later in the day (18:05) and Italy on Thursday (13:05) if they are to scrape into the last four.\n\nTeam GB finished 12th in the two-man bobsleigh after brakeman Taylor Lawrence withdrew from the final two runs and was replaced by Leon Greenwood.\n\nA statement from Team GB said that Lawrence, who missed several World Cup races last season because of a calf injury, sat out the race as a \"precautionary measure\" in preparation for the four-man event that begins later this week.\n\nGreenwood, making his Olympic debut, and pilot Brad Hall clocked 55.72 seconds and 56.17secs to give them a combined overall time of 3:43:43.\n\nIt was a disappointing showing from Hall, who is GB's most decorated men's bobsleigh pilot in World Cup history with 30 race medals.\n\n\"It wasn't plan A but with Leon [Greenwood] coming in last minute, we wanted to keep Taylor [Lawrence] safe, ready for the four-man,\" Hall told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We knew we were out of contention for the two-man so we just used it as extra training runs for the four-man.\"\n\nIt was a German clean sweep on the podium as Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer won gold while legendary pilot Francesco Friedrich and Alexander Schuller took silver with Adam Ammour and Alexander Schaller bronze.\n\nThe four-man event begins on Saturday with the medal-deciding runs on Sunday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — First came the expletives. Then the allegations. Then the media glare and hilarious memes.\n\nGlobal interest in curling surged over the past week when a cheating controversy erupted at the Winter Olympics, rocking a staid, 500-year-old sport known for its etiquette, manners and friendliness.\n\nAfter a wild few days for curling featuring plenty of verbal jousting and a brief rule change, things have calmed down and both players and officials appear ready to move on with the medal games approaching.\n\n“It’s the Olympics,” said Canadian curler Ben Hebert, whose team has been a central character in the controversy. “It’ll be over in two weeks and everyone will go back to covering curling in four years.”\n\nYet the headline-grabbing saga has highlighted some issues in a sport eager for exposure – and one slowly becoming more professional — but maybe isn’t ready for all the trappings that come with it.\n\nSweden crying foul over a rule infringement, an illegal double-touch by Canada’s Marc Kennedy in the act of releasing his stone down the ice, called into question whether the so-called “spirit of curling” had been broken.\n\nCurling, after all, has long been a tight-knit sport where players typically call their own fouls, shake hands at the end of a match and share a beer or two afterwards.\n\nThe Swedish and Canadian players have been long-time rivals but they’re also friendly. Couldn’t they just have dealt with this behind closed doors without all the bruising?\n\n“That’s where I think the spirit of curling is in a little bit of trouble,” Kennedy said, “and honestly that’s probably come from the quest for medals. But it’s OK. It’s all about the evolution of the sport. There’s opportunity here as well, right? For the sport to really figure it out as we all go forward.”\n\nIt seems the top of the sport isn’t quite ready for that.\n\nThere are no video replays in curling, unlike with sports like soccer, cricket and in the NFL, so officials aren’t allowed to re-umpire decisions like the hog line violation apparently committed by Kennedy when he poked one of the granite stones with his outstretched finger after releasing it.\n\nIn response, curling’s higher-ups first stationed umpires at the hog line to check for future fouls, but then reverted to the traditional practice of players policing themselves.\n\n“We’re trying to spread the word about our culture, and our culture is one based on integrity, and honor, and friendship,” World Curling President Beau Welling told The Associated Press in a phone interview. “We live by this code — the spirit of curling — where you’re expected to have honorable conduct on ice, but also off ice.\n\n“Obviously, this has been tested a little bit this week. But, fundamentally, that’s who we are,” he said. “And I really don’t see that changing.”\n\nSome might see this as sweeping the issue under curling's rug.\n\nYet this is the Olympic Games — it’s serious business, being played out in front of curling’s biggest audience.\n\n“Curling needs to professionalize a little bit,” Canada Curling CEO Nolan Thiessen told the AP at the Cortina Curling Center. “If we want to be where we want to be as a sport, there’s some steps we have to take, and some give and take probably. You know, having officials making subjective calls ... there’s a lot of sports that have that. And we probably need to get there as opposed to, ‘I think you did this’ and ‘Well, I don’t think I did.’\n\n“We’re trying,” he added, “to find the right balance as a sport.”\n\nThe Olympics soon will be without Sweden’s defending champion men’s team, which was officially eliminated from semifinal contention on Tuesday after a sixth loss in seven matches in round-robin play.\n\n“We maybe should have done something different and could have dealt with it differently,” Sweden skip Niklas Edin said of what he described as a “horrible week.”\n\nPlenty of curling traditionalists will no doubt agree with that.\n\nAP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen and Associated Press writer Julia Frankel contributed to this story.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Speedskater Andrea Giovannini knew he was going to celebrate with Steph Curry's “Night night” celebration if he could help Italy beat the favored U.S. in the men’s team pursuit final at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Tuesday.\n\nGiovannini just didn't want to tell teammates Davide Ghiotto and Michele Malfatti ahead of time, in case things didn't go well. Not a problem. The Italians claimed the gold medal by finishing 4 1/2 seconds faster than the American world record-holders, and that margin was so large that Giovannini pulled his two white-gloved hands together and pressed them to the side of his head at the close, just the way NBA star Curry does.\n\n“The last lap, we were in control,” Giovannini said, “and I was just waiting for that finish line to emulate Steph.”\n\nGiovannini said he remembered watching on TV during the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics when Curry did his signature move after one of his late 3-pointers sealed a 98-87 victory for the U.S. against France to win gold in men's basketball.\n\n“Emblematic of having cold blood,” Giovannini said.\n\nSo a couple of days ago, Giovannini was chatting with his Olympic roommate, speedskating teammate Francesco Betti, and told him he planned to go with the “Night night.”\n\n“It happened,” Giovannini said. “I was worried I would forget.”\n\nOne of the other team pursuit gold medalists, Ghiotto, said later he hadn't seen what Giovannini did — and actually wasn't even sure what the whole thing was about, because he wasn't aware of who Curry is.\n\nHearing that, Giovannini joked: “Tonight we’ll watch a basketball game.”\n\nThe American trio of Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepurian — who got the bronze in the event at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and set the world record in November — weren't aware of Giovannini's gesture.\n\n“It’s better,” Lehman said with a big laugh, “than getting two middle fingers from the Russians four years ago.”\n\nAP Sports Writer Daniella Matar contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "American bobsleigh veteran Elana Meyers Taylor had won everything there is to win in the sport - except for Olympic gold.\n\nThat was until Monday when, on her fifth attempt, she finally added that missing piece to her extraordinary collection.\n\nThe 41-year-old triumphed in the women's monobob to become the oldest individual Olympic champion at a Winter Games, overtaking Austrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl, 40.\n\nGold at Milan-Cortina adds to the three silver and two bronze medals she has already won across two events - the monobob and the two-woman bobsleigh - since competing at her first Games in Vancouver 16 years ago.\n\nHer combined time of 3:57:93 over four heats was enough to edge out Germany's Laura Nolte by just 0.04 seconds and compatriot Kaillie Armbruster Humphries by 0.12secs.\n\n\"Finally the gold! It took long enough, right?\" Meyers Taylor told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It just goes to show you... just to keep persevering, my team and everybody behind me, it means so much to come away as Olympic champion.\"\n\nVictory makes her the most decorated female bobsleigh pilot of all time as well as the first mother to win Olympic bobsleigh gold.\n\nThe four-time world champion is also the most decorated black athlete at a Winter Olympics and this, her sixth medal, ties her with speed skater Bonnie Blair for the most by an American woman.\n\nBut although she continues to write her name in the history books, for Meyers Taylor it is also about empowering female athletes and inspiring women.\n\nAs her gold was confirmed, Meyers Taylor sunk to her knees draped in the American flag and embraced her two young children.\n\nShe has made it no secret that her drive to continue to compete at the elite level is not only for her own family but for hard-working mothers everywhere.\n\n\"This medal is also for all those moms who weren't necessarily able to live their dreams, but their kids are now their dreams,\" she said.\n\n\"Because those people keep me grounded. Those people kept me going and those people are the ones who reach out to me when things are hard and encourage me.\"\n\nMeyers Taylor's children, Nico and Noah, are both deaf while the oldest, Nico, also has down syndrome.\n\nShe is married to former bobsledder Nic Taylor and the family travel around together on the sport's circuit for several months at a time.\n\n\"My kids have sacrificed so much. There's so many people who have helped me win this gold medal,\" she said.\n\n\"I've had different nannies throughout the years and every single one of them has done the work to help my kids get here and my husband, I can't even put into words what this means and how many people it took to win this.\"\n\nA disability advocate, Meyers Taylor said she feels encouraged by the communities she is helping to inspire.\n\n\"I've had so many people from around the world reaching out and telling me their stories and how they have a kid with down syndrome or a kid who is deaf and they believe in me - it has just been incredible,\" she said.\n\nFormer British bobsledder John Jackson, bronze medallist at Sochi 2014, knows her well from their early years on the bobsleigh circuit and said \"if there was one person on the whole circuit who I think any athlete and coach wanted to see win gold it was Elana\".\n\n\"She is not only a ferocious athlete but also a beautiful human being and a genuine person,\" he added.\n\n\"It has been a real show of dedication to keep going through the struggles of now being a mum in a high-performance sport, the dedication that takes to maintain that level of physical fitness and the hard work of being a parent. It shows her true nature.\"\n\nMeyers Taylor, who has placed on the podium six times in her five Olympic appearances, has shared it with compatriot Armbruster Humphries, 40, on five of those occasions.\n\nArmbruster Humphries, who has five Olympic medals of her own including three golds, became a mother 20 months ago and it is the first time two women over the age of 40 have finished on the podium at a Winter Games.\n\nBoth women celebrated with their children.\n\n\"You get a lot of people that like to write you off as soon as you reach 40, it's all downhill from there, is what you hear,\" she said. \"I think Elana and I are both proof that that's not true.\"\n\nThe two women are also credited with encouraging the International Olympic Committee to add the monobob to the women's schedule for the 2022 Games with the two-woman event the only one for women prior to that.\n\n\"It should be celebrated that they're both mums, using mum power, both in their early 40s and it's great to see them competing at the top of the world not only physically but the drive and experience too,\" said Jackson.\n\n\"There's a lot of younger athletes there who need to up their game to compete against these two world class athletes.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Mark Callan has gone viral for his on-ice antics. But who is he and how did he end up at the Winter Olympics?",
    "fullText": "Did you hear about the 61-year-old from Glasgow who's been captured moonwalking down the curling rink at the Winter Olympics?\n\nMark Callan shakes his head and laughs. It's been quite a week or so for the Scot, who has been plastered all over various social media platforms in the course of doing his job.\n\nYou might well have seen Callan. He is the guy with the back pack and hose, shuffling backwards down the sheet inside the near-empty Cortina Curling Stadium, spraying plumes of water into the air. Pebbling the ice, it's called.\n\nSome clips have been set to music, exaggerating his dainty movements. Parodies have appeared. One broadcaster from Norway, amid peals of laughter, described the chief ice technician as \"scooting\" down the sheet.\n\nSafe to say the Bishopbriggs-native - who now lives with his partner and two-year-old child in Copenhagen - has not been spared by his friends and family either.\n\n\"They've been like 'dearie me, what are you up to?'\" the World Curling employee tells BBC Sport. \"They're quite enjoying seeing some of the things out there and some of the comments as well.\n\n\"It seems to have just taken off but all I'm doing is my job. If, with all the doom and gloom in the world, it puts a smile on people's face, then I'm fine with that.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nBeing centre of attention at the Winter Olympics in northern Italy is a long way from an ice rink in Aberfoyle, where Callan had his first experience of curling at Forest Hills, having been intrigued by seeing the sport on television.\n\nThat rink no longer exists, but Callan's memories remain vivid. Mainly of him falling over a lot.\n\nHe kept going back, though, and one day curiosity got the better of him when he noticed someone pebbling the ice. \"They explained what was going on and I wanted to learn more… and now I'm here.\"\n\nSo what actually is going on? And why the moonwalk?\n\nCallan explains that he wears a gravity-fed backpack containing 15 litres of water, and his job is to sprinkle the ice with water droplets of different sizes. Those freeze almost immediately and are only removed by the furious sweeping of the players' brushes.\n\nThe \"sharp steps\" - as he calls them - are to keep him balanced on the slippy surface and ensure the spread of water is as even as possible.\n\nCallan has been at the rink in Italy since mid-January, having arrived at his fourth Olympics to find \"a concrete floor and contractors everywhere\" in what is usually an ice hockey venue.\n\nThe quirky Cortina Curling Stadium used to be an open-air arena - hosting the 1956 Games - and, although a roof has since been added as part of the renovations, many of the original features remain, such as the wooden bleachers.\n\nAll that makes controlling the ice a particular challenge for Callan and his small team but the reception from players and fans alike has been warm.\n\n\"I think the word iconic is used a lot, and with the real mix of old and new, it's just a phenomenal venue,\" he says. \"And it looks really good on TV as well.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Both men's and women's Canadian curling teams have been accused of cheating at the 2026 Winter Olympics.",
    "fullText": "A scandal at the Winter Olympics has left the Canadian curling teams on the defensive and Canadians reeling over the crack in their country's polite persona.\n\nOver the weekend, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy had an expletive-filled outburst after Sweden accused him of cheating during a match, and later said his team might be the target of a \"premeditated\" attack by their rivals.\n\nKennedy was accused of \"double-touching\" - touching the stone a second time after initially releasing it down the ice. The next day, Canadian women's captain Rachel Holman was accused of using the same move.\n\nBoth have denied the accusations, but Canada's curling teams, who historically have dominated the sport, now face questions over their tactics.\n\nWhile the curlers have shown their anger over the situation during matches, fans of the sport and Canadians have questioned whether the team acted in the spirit of curling.\n\nIn a country well known for its \"niceness\", the cheating row has stung for some. The BBC asked tourists and locals in Montreal what they made of it.\n\n\"It's a sad day for Canadian sport,\" said Tim Gray, from Alberta. \"Integrity in the sport is important, even if you have to call it on yourself.\"\n\n\"As Canadians, we aren't supposed to do these things,\" said Samar, from Ontario.\n\nWithout sportsmanship, said Dwayne from British Columbia, it's not sport any more.\n\nThere was a more nuanced take at the Royal Montreal Curling Club.\n\nOne of the curling instructors, Ankara Leonard, said the publicity could be good for the sport by generating interest.\n\nShe added: \"Do I think [Kennedy's] finger affects the rock? No I do not. Do I think we have to play within the rules? Yes.\"\n\nThe controversy began on Friday when Swedish player Oskar Eriksson accused Kennedy of double-touching.\n\nAs the game continued, Kennedy and Eriksson got into a verbal back-and-forth that included expletives.\n\nTheir exchange quickly went viral as a video emerged that appeared to show Kennedy pushing the stone with his finger after releasing it.\n\nKennedy got a verbal warning from World Curling for using foul language, but he was not formally charged with cheating by the governing body.\n\nThe next day, Kennedy said: \"I probably could have handled it better. But we're human out there and there's a lot of emotions. I'm not going to apologise for defending my teammates and standing up for myself.\"\n\n\"I've curled my whole life, never once with the intention of getting an advantage through cheating,\" he added.\n\nAn opinion piece in the Canadian news outlet, the Globe and Mail, pointed to some of the frustration felt back home\n\n\"These Canadian curling teams are not fun bad guys. They come off like the sort of competitors who need so desperately to win that they will do anything - even things that are pointless - in order to get there.\"\n\nCathal Kelly, the writer of the opinion piece, continued: \"There's an easy way out of this - stop struggling. Stop acting like our curling reputation matters more than our national one. Be the bigger man and woman, even if you don't think you did anything wrong.\"\n\nThere was a second cheating row on Saturday when match officials accused the Canadian women's team of the same double-touch violation.\n\nRachel Homan said there was a \"zero percent chance\" there had truly been a violation, as she and her teammates looked on in frustration. The Canadians lost to the Swiss, 8-7.\n\nOn Sunday, Great Britain's men's team was accused of the same violation.\n\nBoth Homan and British men's curler Bobby Lammie had stones removed from play due to alleged violations.\n\nHoman later slammed the officials' decision to remove her stone during a defeat to Switzerland, saying it was \"insane\".\n\nAll of the incidents led World Curling to clarify that double-tapping is not allowed.\n\n\"During forward motion, touching the granite of the stone is not allowed. This will result in the stone being removed from play,\" they said.\n\nWorld Curling does not use video to review play, but they did send two officials to monitor how players released their stones in subsequent games.\n\nCurling columnist and Olympian Tomi Rantamaki, in an article for The Curling News, warned that Canada's dominance in the world of curling means its players should be mindful of the influence they have.\n\n\"Young players in Finland, Korea, Italy, Sweden - everywhere - often copy what Canadian teams do. They copy the athlete's delivery, the sweeping, the tactics, the communication,\" Rantamaki wrote. \"And they copy the behaviour.\"",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Anastasia Kucherova, a Russian living in Milan, voiced her opposition to Russia’s war against Ukraine with a highly symbolic, if anonymous, act: Carrying the Ukraine team placard during the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Winter Games.\n\nKucherova was swathed in a long, hooded silver puffer coat, her eyes covered with dark glasses — like all the other placard bearers for the 92 nations competing in the Olympics. The Ukraine sign was illuminated for the crowd to read.\n\nAt first the country assignments were going to be random, but later the choreographer asked if the volunteers had preferences, and Kucherova chose Ukraine.\n\nKucherova, an architect who has been living in Milan for 14 years, was unrecognizable, and her nationality was not announced to the public when she led the five Ukrainian athletes competing in Milan into San Siro stadium to resounding cheers.\n\nShe first revealed her role to her 879 Instagram followers and then in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n“When you walk by the side of these people you realize they have every human right to feel hatred towards any Russian,’’ she told the AP on Monday. “Still, I think it’s important to do even a small action to show them that maybe not all the people are thinking the same way.\"\n\nFor Kucherova, speaking about her small act of resistance on the second anniversary of the poisoning death of dissident Alexei Navalny is a way of reminding the world that the war continues, even as life elsewhere goes on.\n\n“Ukrainians don’t have any possibility to avoid these thoughts or to ignore the existence of war. So it is their reality. They keep loving each other, getting married or doing sports, coming to the Olympics. But all of this is happening (against) a devastating background.”\n\nWithout being told that Kucherova was Russian, the athletes immediately recognized her origins and addressed her in Russian. That was a sign for Kucherova of “some profound connection” between Russians and Ukrainians “that obviously could live on if not for the war.”\n\nThe Milan delegation was led by flag bearer Yelyzaveta Sydorko, a short track speedskater, and included figure skater Kyrylo Marsak. Both athletes have fathers who are fighting on the front lines in a war that is nearing its fourth anniversary.\n\n“There is literally no word you can say that can undo the harm that these people have already suffered, and there is no word that can come in close to forgiveness,’’ said Kucherova.\n\nRight before walking into the stadium, “I turned around — I didn’t know what to say to them — but I just said that the entire stadium is going to give them the standing ovation.’’ The Ukrainians appeared skeptical, she said.\n\nWhen the cheers came, Kucherova said it felt like the entire stadium was “recognizing their independence, recognizing their will for freedom, their courage in making it all the way to the Olympics.”\n\nShe cried, silently, behind her glasses.\n\nKucherova hasn't visited Russia since 2018, but understands that she is taking a risk by defying the regime.\n\n“I have to be worried about this, and I’m supposed to be scared about this. And I cannot guarantee that me speaking out will not harm any people I know,’’ she said. “But what I think is that if I, living in a democratic country and enjoying all the freedoms, if I am scared, this means that the regime has won.”\n\nKucherova held the sign for another delegation, Denmark, which also received a rousing ovation for that nation's resistance of U.S. threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\n“Yes, this is a coincidence, but I pondered over it,” Kucherova said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

I am really proud of myself for the three solid runs and to be sat 11th going into the last run shows the potential.\n\n\"I know everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong and it is just one of those nightmare performances that I'll hopefully move on from.\"\n\nNicoll - a three-time British shot put champion - was a travelling reserve for the two-woman bobsleigh at the 2022 Games in Beijing where the monobob made its debut as a Winter Olympics event.\n\n\"Hopefully that shows people that this is raw and it is not all sunshine and rainbows,\" she added.\n\n\"I've had to overcome a lot of hurdles to even be here. I started off this season not even walking and had to overcome a serious injury to even be on the starting block today.\n\n\"I am just taking some accountability for that fourth run not being good enough and I need to pull it together for the two-woman.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nJamaica's Mica Moore, from Newport in south Wales, finished four places ahead of Nicoll in 14th and was delighted with the outcome having switched in 2022 from representing GB after claiming she had witnessed \"damaging and offensive behaviour\".\n\nMoore told BBC Sport: \"I'm so happy. It has been a real tough journey to get here, it hasn't been easy at all. I guess to me it is just a story of not giving up.\n\n\"I had a really difficult time with Great Britain and that is not secret at all and I'm just so proud I didn't give up on myself and I'm so grateful for my family and friends for digging myself out of the trenches when it was really tough and just keep going. Moments like this make it really worth it.\"\n\nMoore began her sporting career as an athlete - representing Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games - before switching to bobsleigh.\n\nHer grandfather, Venson Byfield, came to the UK in the Windrush generation and settled in Wales.\n\n\"It is a really proud moment,\" she added.\n\n\"I've spoken a lot about my grandfather and how we came over with the Windrush generation and I never got the pleasure of meeting him, but my mum has told me so many stories about him and I just had that in my heart the whole time. I just wanted to make my family proud.\n\n\"They've supported me for so long.

So, what's next for Connor McDavid and co.?\n\nHere's what you need to know about Canada's next game and a complete look at the Olympic men's hockey schedule.\n\nCanada does not play on Tuesday, so they will have a bit of an extended rest before the quarterfinals get started.\n\nTuesday's slate features four games involving teams that finished between seeds 5-12. The top four seeds advanced directly to the quarterfinals, and Canada easily earned a bye by securing the No. 1 overall seed with a 3-0 record and +17 goal differential in group play.\n\nHere are the details on Canada's next game.\n\nMatchup: Canada vs. Czechia or Denmark\n\nCanada will play its next game on Wednesday, Feb. 18, with puck drop set for 10:40 a.m. ET. The Canadians will face the winner of Tuesday's playoff matchup between No. 8 Czechia and No. 9 Denmark, as the quarterfinals are not reseeded.\n\nCanada has already faced one of its potential opponents, defeating Czechia 5-0 in the preliminary round. Regardless of who advances, Canada will be a heavy favorite to win in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe game will air on CBC and can be streamed via CBC Gem.\n\nPeacock will carry every event of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics live.

Sweden also won gold in mixed doubles at these Olympics, beating the United States.\n\n“We just didn’t get up to our best level this tournament, and to be in the playoff in this tournament you have to be on your best level,” said Rasmus Wranå, the mixed doubles champion with his sister, Isabella Wranå.\n\nSweden ignited a controversy during its loss to Canada when Oskar Eriksson accused Canadian Marc Kennedy of breaking the rules by double-touching. The Swedes also lost to Italy, Britain and the U.S. while beating China.\n\nKennedy reacted angrily to Eriksson's accusation, and World Curling temporarily ramped up official monitoring of matches. On Sunday, the federation scaled that back.\n\nWranå and Eriksson said the kerfuffle was not to blame for the team's struggles. Against Germany, the Swedes were “just making too many half shots and a few mistakes here and there,” Eriksson said.\n\nEriksson had no regrets about raising the issue of double-touching and was happy with the way World Curling handled the situation.\n\n“For us, it’s been a problem the last couple of years,” he said. “So we think it’s good that everyone can play with the same rules.\n\n“Hopefully it’s just getting better from this,” he said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Slalom skier Dave Ryding bids farewell to the Winter Olympics with a 17th-place finish in mixed conditions in Bormio.",
    "fullText": "Dave Ryding can pinpoint the exact moment he first dreamed of competing at a Winter Olympics.\n\n\"It was actually in a religious education lesson. I'm not sure I was paying enough attention to the teacher.\"\n\nOn Monday, that daydreaming lad from Lancashire raced at his fifth and final Olympics, his retirement imminent at the age of 39 after a career that has cemented his place as Britain's greatest Alpine skier.\n\nRyding - known as 'the Rocket' - finished 17th in the slalom in Bormio, lower than he and anyone would have hoped for but getting to the finish line was a challenge in itself.\n\nThe first run was held in torrid conditions and he was one of only 46 skiers - out of 96 starters - to complete it amid heavy snowfall.\n\nWhile conditions had vastly improved for the second run, with the loose snow cleared and blue skies overhead, he could not make up enough time to challenge for a higher finish, his ninth spot from 2018 remaining his best Olympic result.\n\nBut Ryding still took his moment, bowing after crossing the line.\n\n\"I really tried everything right until my last turn,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I was quoted on the BBC as saying I would ski until my legs fell off and I kind of feel like they have this year.\n\n\"One season maybe too many, but I had to give it a go. I really went in as always and I'm proud.\"\n\nSwitzerland's Loic Meillard won gold for his third medal of the Milan-Cortina Games while Fabio Gstrein of Austria and Norway's Henrik Kristoffersen took silver and bronze respectively.\n\nRyding was one of three Team GB skiers in the race, with Billy Major finishing one place higher in 16th but Laurie Taylor straddled on the first run.\n\n\"As much as I've helped them, they've helped me,\" Ryding said of his team-mates. \"It's over to them, I might have to sign on in a few weeks!\n\n\"It feels right, I feel ready and I'm looking forward to the future.\n\n\"I honestly think the next 15 years of British skiing are taken care of. It will only get more and more exciting.\"\n\nAsked about Ryding as a child, his mum, dad and grandparents all say the same thing: he never stopped.\n\nBut there had to be competition.\n\n\"If there were two snails going up a wall, he'd be betting on his one going up first,\" his grandmother Muriel told Ski Sunday.\n\nHe dabbled in every sport going but it wasn't until he was eight that he first clipped into skis, not in the mountains, but on the dry slope of Pendle Ski Club.\n\nIt became his playground. He did little training on snow until he was 13 though he continued to race on plastic into his early 20s.\n\nRyding had a late breakthrough to the top circuit of the sport, earning his first World Cup points just a few weeks shy of his 26th birthday and not adding any more until two years later.\n\nHe continued to plug away, picking up three podium finishes before he reaped the rewards of his perseverence and resilience in 2022 when, at the age of 35, he became the first Briton, and oldest skier, to win World Cup slalom gold with his victory in Kitzbuhel.\n\n\"It's been incredible to watch his journey and every time he did something, it was like 'wow',\" said his wife Mandy, herself a former skier for the Netherlands.\n\n\"Skiing for Great Britain, not having any mountains, it was just bizarre. First it was a Europa Cup win, then he started making top 30s in the World Cup, World Cup podiums and then he actually won one.\n\n\"Even the guys on the World Cup tour were like, 'How is this possible? He started on dry slopes'. It's out of this world.\"\n\nWhat Ryding credits the longevity of his career with perhaps comes as a surprise - once running a cafe in Tarleton with Mandy.\n\nDevoting his life to slalom had turned his brain \"to cauliflower\" but the \"real world\" had proved to him that the grass wasn't necessarily greener.\n\n\"I realised what I do is really good,\" he said. \"It reignited that love and the passion.\"\n\nFor much of his career, Ryding was a lone wolf. The key thing missing, for him, was a pack.\n\nIt is no coincidence then that Ryding saw an uptick in his results when Taylor and Major joined him on the World Cup circuit.\n\nSince 2022, the year the trio formed a British 'team' in an otherwise individual sport, Ryding achieved four more World Cup podiums, including that Kitzbuhel win.\n\n\"The next generation really believes and talks about podiums like it's a normal thing,\" Ryding told Ski Sunday before the Games.\n\n\"To be ranked in the top 30 for 11 years and the top 15 for nine years, it was a constant visual thing for kids to watch.\n\n\"I think the belief that I will leave with the next generation is the biggest thing that will come from my career.\n\n\"I'm sure they will go on to bigger and better things than I have.\"\n\nTaylor told BBC Sport: \"Everyone coming after Dave is going to be a product of him, inspired by what he's done.\n\n\"Watching the way he works, his commitment, how professional he is, there are so many aspects I've taken from him through my career, he's had such an impact.\"\n\nSo what is next for Ryding? He is adamant he will stay in the sport in some capacity, keen to mentor young skiers.\n\nThat would afford him more time at home, something he \"owes\" to Mandy and their three-year-old daughter Nina.\n\n\"I have to learn that not everything is about my quads and how I'm feeling in the morning.\n\n\"It's going to be a transition. I'm going to have to learn about normal life. I'm ready for the change.\"\n\nReflecting on his career, he added: \"Everyone always says, 'What if you grew up in the mountains? What if you had all this training before you were 10?'.\n\n\"I don't look back and think 'what if?' I look back and think that was my story. That was my legacy and my path.\n\n\"I'm immensely proud of where I came from, a little village in Lancashire. Mum and dad sacrificed their lives for me.\n\n\"They gave me a chance and I just tried to maximise that chance.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "It's been quite the few days in the Cortina Curling Stadium during a Winter Olympics that has delivered intrigue and excitement both on and off the field of play.",
    "fullText": "Accusations of cheating. Swear words being hurled across the ice. Counter-claims of a sting operation with illicit filming.\n\nThen changes to how games are officiated. Protests from teams. Another alteration to the protocols.\n\nIt's been quite the few days in the Cortina Curling Stadium during a Winter Olympics that has delivered intrigue and excitement both on and off the field of play.\n\nThe drama in the curling started on Friday.\n\nCanada's Marc Kennedy became involved in a heated verbal exchange with Swedish opponent Oskar Eriksson towards the end of his side's 8-6 win.\n\nThe Swedes believed Kennedy was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones - releasing the handle at the appropriate time but then giving the stone another little prod with his finger to correct its course. Not allowed.\n\nBut the cards were signed by both teams at the end, meaning the result would stand in a sport that is proudly self-governed by the players.\n\nWorld Curling later confirmed that \"decisions made during a game are final\" and that they do not use video replays \"to re-umpire\" decisions.\n\nThe only sanction given was to Kennedy for swearing.\n\nIntriguingly, Eriksson had told his opponent during the row that \"I'll show you the video after\" and, sure enough, footage found its way into circulation post-match.\n\nKennedy was bang to rights. But where had the video come from?\n\nThe word from Canada was that it was pre-meditated. A set-up. That the Swedes had deployed someone to try to catch them out in a game that is founded in trust and respect.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time\n\n'Extremely stupid' - ski jumper disqualified for oversized boots\n\nThen the story took another turn when the Canadians returned to the ice on Saturday. Controversy flared around Kennedy again, with Switzerland reporting him to the umpire for the same offence in their 9-5 win.\n\nAgain, no action was taken against the 44-year-old veteran of four Olympics.\n\nAt that stage, World Curling needed to act. They announced they would deploy extra officials for the remainder of the Games to check for double-touching.\n\nCanadian women's skip Rachel Holman was pinged for a double touch. Team GB's Bobby Lammie fell victim too.\n\nBoth incidents were a case of a lingering finger falling on to the granite after the handle was released, rather than a deliberate touch, so no suggestion of devious intent. Furthermore, the monitoring of it seemed sporadic.\n\nThe teams were up in arms and complained. World Curling relented. The protocol was changed on Sunday. Teams could now request to have the stone delivery monitored if they had suspicions, and for a minimum of three ends.\n\nIn reality, that was also haphazardly executed.\n\nSo what does curling do about this? After all, this is a sport in which they determine which stone is nearest the target by using what is effectively a big compass.\n\nOne nod to progress is electric sensors to gauge if stones have been released before the hog line but could they drag themselves further into the modern era and use video technology?\n\nTeam GB lead Hammy McMillan thinks so.\n\n\"You bring in VAR or Hawk-Eye and each team gets a challenge or two, so you've got to be dead certain that somebody did that [violation],\" the Scot said.\n\n\"I think that would be quite cool, it would maybe make curling a bit more modernised. I think video review could be the next thing, with teams getting challenges.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's Niall Treacy suffered his third crash in as many short track speed skating events as his Winter Olympics ended when he failed to progress from the 500m heats.\n\nThe only British representative in short track, Treacy surprisingly reached the 1500m final on Saturday but crashed out and then also fell in the 1,000m heats.\n\nThe 25-year-old says the shortest distance is his least favourite, declaring himself to be \"not a natural sprinter\".\n\nTreacy had a wobbly start as he was clipped on the opening corner by South Korea's Rim Jong-un - an 18-year-old high school student who won bronze in the 1,000m - to require a restart.\n\nBut there was no reprieve for Treacy, as he skidded out midway through the full race under no pressure.\n\nIt ends British interest in short track, and the sport has struggled since losing £4.8m in UK Sport funding after failing to win a medal at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nGB sent a team of five to short track events eight years ago - but that is down to one in Milan.\n\nDutchman Jens van'T Wout, who has already won both the 1,000m and 1500m, remains in the hunt for a golden treble after avoiding a mass pile-up to win his heat.\n\nThe remainder of the 500m competition - with two further knock-out rounds before the final - takes place on Tuesday.\n\nTeam GB's women curlers delivered their best stuff in the biggest moment as they beat Denmark 7-2 to keep alive their semi-final hopes at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nHaving lost three of their opening four matches, Rebecca Morrison's rink woke up on Monday not just in northern Italy but also in must-win territory.\n\nRealistically, they need victories in at least four of their final five matches to have any chance of salvaging a place in Friday's last four - and they began that quest well.\n\nAn aggressive start was rewarded with an early 2-0 advantage and the British rink maintained that to lead 3-2 at the break.\n\nAnother fine two-point haul in the sixth, followed by a steal in the seventh, opened up a four-point gap with three ends to play.\n\nThe Scottish quartet managed the rest of the contest admirably to close out the game with two ends to spare and add to their previous win over world champions Canada.\n\nThe women are back on the ice against the Swiss at 18:05 GMT, but before then the men resume their round-robin campaign against Norway at 13:05.\n\nBruce Mouat's world champions have won four of their opening six games - having lost to unbeaten Switzerland in an epic on Sunday - but know a couple more victories in their final three matches should see them through to the last four.\n\nBritish two-man bobsleigh team Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence suffered a disappointing start to their Olympic campaign - now sitting eighth at the halfway point of the competition.\n\nTheir combined time of 1:51:54 after two heats leaves them 1.64 seconds off the pace of German team Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer in top spot with two more German teams occupying the other podium places before Tuesday's medal-deciding runs.\n\nHall and Lawrence, who is a serving Royal Marine, were unable to improve on their run-one position after a heavy bump near the top of the track on their second heat led to more errors and a struggle to make up time.\n\nPilot Hall will also lead the charge for a medal in the four-man event later this week. while Germany's Francesco Friedrich, who is currently third, is aiming to do the treble double - win two and four-man gold for the third Games in a row.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

They had to settle for the former, meaning an extra end. But Switzerland had the hammer and they held their nerve to close out a statement victory.\n\n\"On another day we come away with the win,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's going to be tough to beat them but we know we are playing pretty well and it would be exciting to play them again.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Britain's women were unable to repeat their statement win over Canada against the Swedish rink who denied them European gold in November.\n\nThe unbeaten Swedes raced out to a 7-3 lead at the break - after twice scoring three with the hammer - and stole one in the sixth to take a stranglehold on the game.\n\nRebecca Morrison's rink kept fighting but ultimately fell to a 10-7 defeat to leave their semi-final hopes in the balance.\n\nAt least four wins will be required from their final five round-robin matches to have any hope of reaching the knockouts.\n\n\"It's really hard at this level - it's near-misses and we're a couple of centimetres away from making great shots,\" Morrison told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's frustrating but that's what happens at the Olympics.

A clean skate, we couldn't ask for any more at the Olympics.\"\n\nGermany's Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin, who last year won world silver, lead at the half-way point with a score of 80.01.\n\nEuropean champions Anastasia Metelkina and Luka Berulava are second as they aim to win a first-ever Winter Olympic medal for Georgia, while Canada's Lia Pereira and Trennt Michaud are currently in bronze position.\n\nAdele Nicoll made history by becoming the first British woman to compete in the monobob at the Olympics and sits 13th at the halfway point at the Cortina sliding track.\n\nThe 29-year-old clocked a time of 2:00:83 over the two heats, 1.71 seconds off Germany's Laura Nolte in top spot.\n\nIt is unlikely Nicoll will trouble the medals but a top-10 finish would likely represent a successful Games for the Welsh slider, who was a travelling reserve for the Beijing 2022 Games but will also contest the two-woman event at Milan-Cortina.\n\n\"I was more nervous than maybe I'd realised for the first run and I felt a little bit like jelly on the block,\" she said.\n\n\"Seeing the Milan-Cortina Olympic rings was really surreal and emotional. These were all first experiences, I just wanted to do myself proud.\"\n\nNicoll is also a three-time British shot put champion and is targeting an appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Mica Moore, who represented Team GB four years ago but has since opted to compete for Jamaica, sits 15th on 2:00:98 before Monday's medal-deciding heats.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Team GB made history by winning two Winter Olympic titles on one day for the first time as Matt Weston and Tabitha Stoecker clinched mixed team skeleton gold.\n\nIt came after Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale won the snowboard cross mixed team event earlier on Sunday.\n\nWeston produced a stunning race to make more of his own history in Cortina - he is the first Briton to win two gold medals at a Winter Olympics having claimed individual gold just two days ago.\n\nStoecker, 25, had given Weston a tough task with her run of 1:00.77, 0.18 seconds off the pace of the Germans, with the British pair - ranked top seeds - the last to run.\n\nBut 28-year-old Weston, who won Team GB's first medal at the Games, showed why he is the best skeleton racer in the world with a sublime 58.59secs run to clinch a second medal with a final time of 1:59:36.\n\nIt is also the first time Great Britain have won three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.\n\n\"The individual event is amazing but doing it as a team when we're normally an individual sport is amazing,\" said Weston.\n\n\"To have my team-mate by my side as Olympic champions, two-time for me which is crazy. I'm looking forward to the celebrations!\"\n\nA second British team, Marcus Wyatt and Freya Tarbit, missed out on a medal by an agonising 0.01secs as the two German teams of Christopher Grotheer and Jacqueline Pfeifer and Axel Jungk and Susanne Kreher took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nGB's Bankes & Nightingale win historic snowboard gold\n\nHow Weston handled pressure to win Olympic gold and GB's first medal\n\nWhy are Team GB so good at skeleton?\n\nThe mixed event, making its debut at Milan-Cortina, sees the sliders hurtle down the track one after the other with a quick reaction time crucial as five red lights going out prompts them to set off.\n\nPushing off before the lights go out results in heavy penalties or even disqualification and that led to many of the sliders erring on the side of caution with some hesitant starts.\n\nJanine Flock, who won gold on Saturday in the women's event, blew the Austrian team's chances when she incurred a one-second penalty for reacting too soon at the start, opening the door for both British teams to get on the podium.\n\nBut the two German teams were too good and the only way Wyatt and Tarbit could have got on the podium would have been if Weston and Stoecker had not.\n\nTwo-time world champion Weston came into this Games stating that only gold would be good enough and he will now walk away as the most decorated man in British Winter Olympics history.\n\nAfter finishing 15th in Beijing four years ago, Weston's rise in the sport has been meteoric and his two Olympic golds add to the three Crystal Globes - overall World Cup titles - he won consecutively from 2024.\n\nFormer bobsledder John Jackson, Olympic bronze medallist in 2014, said: \"Weston has been the cream of the crop of anybody on this track. We are witnessing history right here.\n\n\"He just keeps raising the bar to new standards, and that was absolutely nail-biting stuff when Tabby didn't quite have the run she wanted to give him a chance. Weston absolutely destroyed the field.\"\n\nAs Sunday's competition got increasingly exciting, building to a gripping finale, it was Weston who once again stepped up, having broken the track record in all four runs of the individual event, he produced another immaculate run to turn it into a Super Sunday for GB.\n\n\"Luckily I felt like I knew what I needed to do,\" Weston told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It's all a bit of a whirlwind, I took confidence from the individual event and in my head I had to be quite boring and just get the job done.\"\n\nIt took Team GB a week of action in Italy to get their first medal on the board after a series of fourth-place finishes and near misses from the nation's other medal contenders.\n\nBut securing two gold medals in one day - with Bankes and Nightingale's a first ever on snow - certainly goes a long way to improving the landscape.\n\nWhile the one in Livigno came as a surprise, Weston and Stoecker's in Cortina marks a return to the norm for Team GB on the skeleton track.\n\nThe British team have a long history of Olympic skeleton success but a disastrous Games in 2022, where they failed to win a medal for the first time since the sport was reinstated at the Olympics in 2002, is now proving to be an anomaly.\n\nWeston was the heavy favourite coming into the men's event on Friday and he clinched gold with a winning margin of 0.88secs - the second-biggest in skeleton history.\n\nThen, although the British trio of women - Stoecker, Tarbit and Amelia Coltman - did not finish on the podium, they all ended inside the top 10 at their debut Games.\n\nWyatt, who finished ninth in the men's event, said: \"Me and Matt were there in Beijing [2022] and it was good to come and prove that that was a blip and not a trend.\n\n\"What these medals will do for the future of this programme for the next four, eight, 12 years - we are going to be expecting more medals and keeping that rich history of British skeleton alive.\"\n\nWhy first gold on snow has been just a matter of time",

    "fullText": "MILAN — Madison Chock and Evan Bates will remain silver medalist ice dancers at the Milan Olympics. U.S. Figure Skating did not appeal the controversial judging that awarded their French competitors the gold medal in last week’s ice dance event.\n\nLast Wednesday, Chock and Bates, who are the reigning world and national champions in ice dance, performed an outstanding free skate routine that put them at the top of the medal leaderboard … right up until France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron topped them and skated away with the gold medal.\n\nThe American duo were visibly devastated after the medal ceremony, with Chock calling it “bittersweet” to come so far and fall short of gold. The next day, Chock called for “transparent judging” on CBS News. “I think it's also important for the skaters, that the judges be vetted and reviewed to make sure that they are also putting out their best performance,” she added, “because there's a lot on the line for the skaters when they're out there giving it their all, and we deserve to have the judges also giving us their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field.”\n\nA deeper examination of the skating scores indicated that while bias existed all up and down the judges’ panel, the French judge favored Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron by a greater degree than any other judge’s bias in other directions.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics figure skating ⛸️ free dance was scored by 9 judges\n\nThe French judge gave Beaudry & Cizeron 🇫🇷 a 137.45 but only gave Chock & Bates 🇺🇸 a 129.74\n\nAll other judges were relatively close in their two scores 🤔\n\nJudge No. 4 was just in a bad mood overall pic.twitter.com/1HkDHY5vuo\n\n— Lev Akabas (@LevAkabas) February 12, 2026\n\nHowever, the International Skating Union contended there was no malfeasance at work. “It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,” the governing body said in a statement. “The ISU has full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.”\n\nU.S. Figure Skating had 24 hours to appeal the result, but opted not to do so. “There has been a lot of thoughtful, and at times emotional, discussion about the ice dance competition in Milan,” USFS CEO Matt Farrell told USA Today Sports in a statement. “Working together with Madi and Evan after the Games, we will have thoughtful and intentional discussions about the best way to support them and the future of the sport. For now, we plan to join them in supporting the success of U.S. Figure Skating in Milan.”\n\nThe pairs and women’s events remain to be skated in Milan. Team USA already has a team gold medal, won in part by Chock and Bates.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCanada flexed its muscles in its first two preliminary round games of the Winter Olympics, dominating Czechia and Switzerland by a combined score of 10-1.\n\nAs a result, Canada has already clinched first place in Group A, giving the team a bye and sending it automatically to the quarterfinal round. So far, Canada is one of just two undefeated teams in the tournament, with the United States unsurprisingly also perfect so far.\n\nCanada will close out its preliminary round against France, who has struggled mightily in its two games. The French lost both of their games to Switzerland and Czechia by a combined score of 10-3, putting the team in position to finish last in Group A play.\n\nTherefore, the final preliminary round game is largely just to fill out the standings and play-out the group stage ahead of the knockout rounds.

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Team USA's dominant start to the Olympics in Game 1 turned into a closer-than-expected victory over Denmark in Game 2. Their chances of clinching the top overall seed took a hit, but they dealt with some adversity effectively.",
    "fullText": "The USA's men's Olympic hockey team couldn't have asked for a better first game, but they certainly could have for their second.\n\nWhen they took out Team Latvia on Thursday, they were firing on all pistons, with five players recording two points. And star goalie Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets was nearly perfect for the Americans, which looked like the dominant force many believed they'd be at the Games.\n\nThe Americans got a reality check on Saturday courtesy of Team Denmark, which put up a fight for much of the game before the States pulled away and won 6-3.\n\nSubpar goaltending from Jeremy Swayman and an offense against a team the United States were expected to blow out could have made their next two games more difficult than they needed to be. That said, the wakeup call could help them adjust and come out stronger.\n\nThe result turned out to be in Team USA's favor, with the Americans outshooting Denmark 47-21. But it was not nearly as one-sided as the score or shot count might suggest.\n\nThe Danes took the first two leads of the game, less than two minutes into the first period and again midway through the first. Nobody had that on their bingo card. And although the Americans wound up flexing their muscles by scoring three times in a 7:57 span during the second period, the game on the whole was far closer than the U.S. would've preferred.\n\nMen's #Olympics standings after day 4.🏒 #IIHF pic.twitter.com/xq3tB3ZSzb\n\n— IIHF (@IIHFHockey) February 14, 2026\n\nTeam USA now has a goal differential of plus-7 in Group C play. That's not as good as Canada's goal differential of plus-9 in Group A after two games, but if the Americans can maul Team Germany in their final round-robin game on Sunday, and if Canada has a low-scoring game against France that same day, it's still possible the U.S. locks up the No. 1 seed.\n\nAnd conversely, it's still possible that the States wobble and wind up behind the powerhouse Canadians and end up with a less favorable quarterfinal matchup.\n\nBut one thing is clear: Swayman has probably played his final game in these Olympics.\n\nFirst of all, the Boston Bruins veteran goalie gave up a goal to Danish defenseman Nicholas B. Jensen that was shot from center ice. He told reporters post-game he didn't see the puck and that it was a flash screen.\n\n\"It was just the perfect height, right between the stands and board level,\" he said. \"I truly lost it… No matter how they go in, you have to step up and stop the next one.\"\n\nAs the crowd in Italy gasped at Swayman's miscue, Jensen's goal gave Team Denmark a 2-1 lead.\n\nThen, with three seconds left in the second period, after the U.S. scored three unanswered goals, Denmark defenseman Phillip Bruggisser took a slapshot from the top of the zone that beat Swayman as well. It's possible J.T. Miller screened him when he went for the block, but shots from low-danger areas like that should be fairly routine stops.\n\nMaple Leafs' Matthews, Jets' Hellebuyck Must Lead Team USA To No. 1 Seed Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews and Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck starred in Team USA's first win. They'll need to keep it up when they play to build a large enough goal differential to clinch the No. 1 overall seed over Canada.\n\nTeam Denmark's scoring showed the Americans how much tightening up they need to do before the stakes of the Games get significantly higher.\n\nThat almost certainly means Hellebuyck will be the go-to netminder for the U.S. until further notice, although that was probably the plan anyway. After tomorrow, there aren't any back-to-back games for Team USA, which clinched Group C with the win.\n\nThat doesn't mean the road ahead for Team America will be easier. It could turn out to be considerably tougher, with a possible showdown against Team Sweden in the cards if the U.S. are the No. 2 seed and if the Swedes win their qualifying match.\n\nThe good vibes of the Americans' first game quickly evaporated in Game 2 against the Danes. In the end, the result went their way, but if their first game unfolded like a pleasant dream, their second game was a cold wakeup call that they have to show urgency against any team, no matter how their opponents look on paper.\n\nDon't get it twisted – the Americans still have a lot to like about their Olympics thus far. And the brief stretch of adversity they faced on Saturday may be exactly what they need to thrive when the games matter most. No team has a flawless road to a gold medal performance, and Team USA learned against Denmark that you need to put in the work and earn every 'W' that puts you any closer to the Olympic podium.\n\nFighting your way through rough spots – and emerging stronger on the other side of it – is the hallmark of every champion. We'll see how the U.S. reacts to this close call, but for now, at least, their destiny is very much in their hands.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "A medallist with Team GB in 2014, bobsleigher Joel Fearon is preparing for his third Winter Olympics after coming out of retirement to compete for Jamaica.",
    "fullText": "\"The fastest man in the UK this year and he's not even going to the Olympics.\"\n\nThat was the line belted out by the commentator as Joel Fearon stunned onlookers by running the 100m in under 10 seconds - breaking one of the most revered barriers in sport.\n\nFrustratingly, the performance came just after the cut-off date to qualify him to represent Team GB at Rio 2016.\n\nA decade on, the 37-year-old is at his third Winter Olympics, but his first for Jamaica's bobsleigh team, who he came out of retirement for last year.\n\nHe remembers that day in 2016 as one that changed his life.\n\n\"I don't know if I ever believed that I could do something like that,\" he told BBC Local Radio.\n\n\"It was surreal for a long time because I wasn't one of the British superstar sprinters.\n\n\"But there I was, running sub-10, number one in the country and I remember thinking anything can happen.\"\n\nOnly four British men have ever run faster on UK soil than his time of 9.96 seconds to win the England Athletics Championships in Bedford that day.\n\nRunning fast was just one piece of the jigsaw for Coventry-born Fearon, as he was trying to make ends meet, juggling between work and bobsleigh training.\n\n\"I've done all sorts of jobs, at one point, I was a pizza delivery man,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I would run Diamond Leagues in the daytime. In the evening, I'm off delivering my local pizzas, just whatever needed to be done.\"\n\nAthletics was Fearon's first sporting passion, but his bobsleigh career has been unique.\n\nHe has competed for Great Britain, Switzerland and Jamaica over a period of 15 years.\n\nHis bronze medal from the Sochi 2014 Olympics was only awarded five years later because of retrospective doping bans.\n\nThe sport was initially suggested to him by his coach, partly to help support his family.\n\n\"I was pretty broke and some trials came up,\" Fearon explained.\n\n\"It was a tough transition, there is a lot of lifting, you are a mechanic and there are a lot of long hours and time spent out in freezing cold conditions.\n\n\"If I didn't hold out [on] those rough days, I would have never known what was coming in the future.\"\n\nWelsh bobsleigher Moore makes Olympics for Jamaica\n\nHow British skeleton came back fighting after 2022\n\nWinter Olympics athletes to have broken medals fixed\n\nFearon initially came fifth in the four-man bobsleigh in Sochi, and with hindsight, he would not change the way it happened.\n\n\"We knew we were good enough. Knowing that we didn't [medal] actually just kept me striving,\" he said.\n\n\"I went straight to a relay camp. I didn't soak it in, didn't even enjoy it.\n\n\"If I would have got that medal, I probably wouldn't have run sub-10. I wouldn't have had the same drive.\"\n\nAt the time Fearon received it, he was on a season-long loan to Switzerland's bobsleigh team, with whom he won another bronze at the Europe Cup.\n\n\"They bought me, actually. They needed experienced athletes for one of their junior drivers, Timo Rohner,\" he remembered.\n\n\"We were the Swiss number one team that year. [Rohner] is at the Olympics with me [at Milan-Cortina], that's nice because this is his first Olympics and I had a little part in his journey.\"\n\nLike many athletes, Fearon's career has been affected by agonising injuries at key moments.\n\nHe has wires in his lower leg bones holding them together, following a serious one picked up while running for the British relay team.\n\n\"After that, I semi-retired from athletics, I still went and did a few things, but it wasn't the same,\" he said.\n\n\"It took a good two-year chunk out of my athletic career.\"\n\nBut while that pain eased over time as he recovered, what hit his family next was hard to put into words.\n\nIn 2023, his sister Natasha Morais was murdered.\n\nFeeling scared and suffering with insomnia, Fearon retired from all sport.\n\n\"It was tough for all of us. We are all still dealing with it in our own ways,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't think I was ever going to be able to do sport again. I really struggled with anxiety.\n\n\"I was becoming afraid to leave my family alone.\"\n\nComing out of retirement to represent Jamaica has given Fearon fresh focus and brought joy to a grieving family.\n\nBut he did not necessarily expect to be pushing a sled at another Winter Olympics.\n\n\"It was an athlete and coach role, I can do all the jobs across bobsleigh, even just organisational jobs,\" said Fearon, who met rapper Snoop Dogg while training in Italy.\n\n\"But we ended up getting in the sled. I've done six races and won six races, so I'm a pretty good lucky charm.\n\n\"I think they're going to have me pushing a few more times before I'm done,\" he joked.\n\nFearon's father is Jamaican, while his maternal grandparents are also from the Caribbean island.\n\n\"My dad was so proud. I've never seen him excited about sport before,\" he added.\n\n\"I didn't even know these guys a year ago and they're all like my brothers, I get more excited about them racing than I do myself racing.\n\n\"I'm probably taking on a dad role. Seeing how much they're excelling, it's just really exciting for me to watch and wonder where it could go.\"\n\nThe crossover between Fearon's two sports is a well-travelled path.\n\nFellow sprinter and bobsleigher Mica Moore is also part of Jamaica's squad in Milan-Cortina, having previously switched allegiance from Great Britain.\n\nFour years ago, Montell Douglas became GB's first female summer and Winter Olympian, while this year, track and field internationals Adele Nicoll and Ashleigh Nelson are in their squad.\n\nThey all have explosive power and speed over the initial acceleration phase where pushing the sled effectively is so vital.\n\nBut perhaps the crossover that Fearon is most excited about is the association with the 1993 hit film Cool Runnings about the Jamaican bobsleigh team.\n\n\"I love it, because I watched it when I was 10,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I had no idea I was ever going to have anything to do with bobsleigh at that point, never mind Jamaican bobsleigh.\n\n\"I've gone from being an Olympic medallist and part of this team, which is great, but now I'm a Disney character. Now I'm in a movie, it's different.\n\n\"We are the most famous team in the world, so it's for us to go out and do our flag proud.\"",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — On Valentine’s Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week.\n\n“We can confirm that condom supplies in the Olympic Villages were temporarily depleted due to higher-than-anticipated demand,” the Italian organizing committee said in a statement Saturday. “Additional supplies are being delivered and will be distributed across all villages between today and Monday.”\n\nProviding condoms for athletes has been a gift from organizers — and a constant fascination to the world — for decades.\n\nWhile 300,000 condoms were provided for more than 10,500 athletes at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, the original stock was much lower for these Winter Games.\n\n“I think 10,000 have been used, 2,800 athletes — you can go figure, as they say,” International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said Saturday. “It clearly shows that Valentine’s Day is in full swing in the village.”\n\nReports of no condoms in week one of the games followed an absence of plush toys of the official mascots, Milo and Tina, in the opening days. They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.\n\nCondoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home from as “a kind of gift” to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.\n\n“I’m not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already,” said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. “There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village.\"\n\n\"Every day, everything was (gone),” she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.\n\n“I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it’s a kind of gift for them,” Clerc said.\n\nThere should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony Feb. 22.\n\n“They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability,” the local organizing committee said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Jordan Stolz is 2 for 2. There's a chance 4 for 4 might not be far behind.\n\nThe American speedskating star added his second gold medal in two attempts at the Milan Cortina Olympics by sprinting to victory in the men's 500 meters on Saturday.\n\nStolz joined Eric Heiden as the only skaters to win both the 500 and 1,000 meters at the same Olympics. Heiden did it at Lake Placid in 1980, a full 24 years before the 21-year-old Stolz was born.\n\nWhile Stolz has been wary about comparing himself to Heiden, who won a record five races nearly five decades ago, he hardly seems intimidated by the challenge. Racing in the penultimate pairing, the Wisconsin native's time of 33.77 seconds gave him his second Olympic record in four days. He did the same while capturing the 1,000 meters on Wednesday.\n\nJenning de Boo of the Netherlands took silver, just as he did in the 1,000. Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil got the bronze in 34.26.\n\nNext up for Stolz is the 1,500 meters on Thursday, and the mass start on Feb. 21.\n\nThe party in Brazil this week isn't limited to the annual Carnivale in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAlpine skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen delivered the first gold medal by a South American athlete at the Winter Olympics by surging to victory in the giant slalom.\n\nThe 25-year-old, whose father is Norwegian and mother is from Brazil, posted a two-run time of 2 minutes, 25 seconds, beating defending champion Marco Odermatt of Switzerland by 0.58 seconds. Odermatt’s teammate, Loic Meillard, earned bronze on the snowy and slippery Stelvia course.\n\n“I was skiing with my heart, and when you ski the way you are, anything is possible,” Pinheiro Braathen said. \"The only thing that matters to me is that I remain who I am. I am a Brazilian skier who became an Olympic champion.”\n\nMaren Kirkeeide's first Olympic biathlon race ended with a dismal 49th-place finish early in the Games.\n\nHer second went far, far better.\n\nThe Norwegian earned gold in the women’s 7.5-kilometer sprint, clearing all 10 of her shots before crossing the finish line in 20 minutes and 40.8 seconds, just ahead of Oceane Michelon of France 3.8 seconds back. Lou Jeanmonnot missed one but held on for the bronze, 23.7 seconds back.\n\n“I wanted to try my best, and I got some positive feedback from the coaches, and then I got some extra motivation, and it helped me all the way to the finish line,” Kirkeeide said.\n\nJeanmonnot now has a full set of medals in Italy. She took silver in the 15-kilometer individual race and was part of France's gold medal-winning mixed relay.\n\nA snapped ski binding by Sweden created an opening in the women's cross-country relay. Norway was more than happy to zip through it.\n\nThe Norwegians pulled off a stunner to claim gold in a discipline dominated by the Swedes. Sweden entered the race having won seven out of nine possible medals so far up at the course in Tesero.\n\nThe Swedes were leading during the second leg when Ebba Andersson broke her binding and fell. Forced to ski with just one ski at one point, she lost valuable time.\n\nNorway finished the 4 x 7.5-kilometer race in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 44.8 seconds, 50 seconds ahead of Sweden. Finland earned the bronze, more than a minute back.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Gu and Zhu Yi, a fellow American-born athlete who now competes for China, were paid for \"striving for excellent results\" in the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics.",
    "fullText": "Ever since Eileen Gu decided to compete under the flag of China, and not the United States where she was born, her citizenship has been the subject of scrutiny and controversy.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, she said her decision to switch allegiance back in 2019 had everything to do with “inspiring” children from the country of her mother at the Olympics in her home country. That would be the 2022 Beijing Games, where Gu won two golds and a silver for China in freestyle skiing.\n\nShe’s since become a millionaire many times over, mainly due to her online presence and endorsements, not her skiing. She was the fourth-highest earning female athlete in 2025, earning upwards of $23 million. According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of that $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nNow, she’s back in the Olympics, still competing for China and, reportedly, being paid handsomely to do so.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Gu and Zhu Yi, a fellow American-born figure skater who now competes for China, were paid a combined $6.6 million by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau in 2025 for “striving for excellent results in qualifying for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics.” In all, the two were reportedly paid nearly $14 million over the past three years.\n\nThe payments were revealed when the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau budget was posted online with the names of Gu and Zhu. Their names have since been scrubbed from the public report.\n\nGu already has a silver in slopestyle in Italy, while Zhu — born Beverly Zhu in Los Angeles — is not competing in the 2026 Games.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,” Gu said after winning silver in slopestyle. “Just being able to ski through all of that, you know. To still show my best and still be so deeply in love with the sport.\n\n\"That's really what I care about and I'm so happy to represent that today.\"\n\nThe subject of Gu’s citizenship remains shrouded in mystery. China does not allow dual citizenship, meaning Gu ostensibly had to give up her U.S. passport.\n\nGu will compete in two more events — women’s halfpipe and big air.",

    "fullText": "Elite sport is tense, fraught and competitive. But still, you don't expect a curling match to descend into finger-pointing, swearing and accusations of cheating.\n\nWhen the men's rinks of Canada and Sweden met at the Winter Olympics in Cortina on Friday, tempers became frayed.\n\nThe Swedes believed one of the Canadians was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones - releasing the handle at the appropriate time but then giving the stone another little prod with his finger to correct its course.\n\nSweden skip Niklas Edin raised it with the officials between the second and third ends and the row quietly simmered away as the contest unfolded.\n\nThen, going into the last end, irritation turned to anger. Gestures were made before Canada's Marc Kennedy and Sweden's Oskar Eriksson began swearing at each other across the sheet.\n\n\"I don't like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games,\" said Kennedy. \"So I told him [Eriksson] where to stick it.\n\n\"He might have been upset that he was losing...\"\n\nCanada went on to win 8-6, leaving the 2022 gold medal-winning Swedish rink without a win in their first three games.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nEach stone has a sensor on it to ensure players release their grip on the handle before the thick green line that runs across the ice, known as the hog line.\n\nIf they do, the sensor flashes green. If not, a red light shows.\n\nKennedy's stone showed green, but Eriksson and his Swedish team-mates thought they saw the Canadian give the stone an extra push with his finger after letting the handle go. The video evidence appears to back that up.\n\nBut, as BBC Sport curling commentator Steve Cram asked former world champion Jackie Lockhart, is it actually cheating and does it make a difference?\n\n\"You should not be touching the stone after you've released it,\" Lockhart said. \"If you touch it with a broom, it's burned and removed.\n\n\"He's released that stone, then poked it with his finger – I'm not sure why. Is it to push it a little bit harder because he felt he didn't give it enough?\"\n\nWhen the teams came off the ice, they would have signed a declaration saying they are happy with the result. So, unless a protest was submitted at that stage - and as far as we know there wasn't - the result will stand.\n\nBut what will this mean for the Canadians - who are considered medal contenders and have won their first three matches - in the rest of the Games?\n\n\"The question we should be asking is if Oskar is challenging him, has he [Kennedy] done it before?\" Lockhart added.\n\n\"Have they been doing it at other Championships and now they're being called out on it?\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed with the Canadians if that's what they're doing. We'll all be looking now.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's women curlers kickstarted their campaign with a superb first victory of these Winter Olympics, beating medal contenders Canada 7-6.\n\nAfter surrendering meekly in their opening two matches against China and South Korea, few fancied Rebecca Morrison's rink to right the wrongs against the world champions.\n\nHowever, the British team raised their game significantly, with Morrison in particular making the shots that she was missing earlier in the competition, to overcome a Canadian side who looked fragile after their loss to the United States on Friday.\n\n\"It just feels absolutely amazing to go out there and get our first win,\" skip Sophie Jackson told BBC Sport. \"We put the game together that we wanted to today - we had a good first half and carried that on in the second half.\"\n\nIt took until the third end for the Scottish quartet to get on the board, but after Canada skip Rachel Homan erred, Morrison kept her composure to slide in for three.\n\nAnother fabulous Morrison shot in the fourth forced another mistake from Homan and allowed GB to steal, before they were into the break 4-2 up.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nBoth their previous matches got away from the British rink after the interval, but they maintained their momentum here.\n\nPoints were traded in the sixth and seventh ends before Morrison - growing in stature by the minute - delivered another two to move her side four clear going into the penultimate end.\n\nCanada looked devoid of ideas. Homan, for whom Olympic gold has proved elusive throughout a stellar career, was floundering. One in the ninth left them needing a miracle but GB were not of a mind to let this one go.\n\n\"Becca played absolutely fantastically - we all did - but it's great to see Becca when she's like that and I'm sure she'll be on a roll now,\" Jackson added.\n\nThe women will look to continue their unlikely revival on Sunday against another fancied rink, Sweden (13:05 GMT).\n\nThey have six more round-robin matches to play, with a total of five or six wins potentially enough to clinch a semi-final place.\n\nAnd GB's men are next on the ice, playing their fourth match of nine against Czech Republic at 13:05 GMT on Saturday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",
