    "description": "The U.S. figure skater tells PEOPLE how her time away from the sport revitalized her love for it",
    "fullText": "Alysa Liu is ready for her second Winter Olympics\n\nThe 20-year-old tells PEOPLE she is \"more excited\" than ever to compete, after taking a break following the 2022 Beijing Olympics\n\n“I was checked out. I was just there for the Olympic experience,\" she says about being a member of Team USA four years ago\n\nAlysa Liu has been here before — but not like this.\n\nThe U.S. figure skater, 20, will make her return to the Olympic stage next month with a newfound drive and sense of purpose after the shocking announcement following the 2022 Beijing Games that she would retire from the sport entirely.\n\nLiu's unexpected announcement caught many around the skating world off guard, since she was seen a rising star in the sport at just 16 years old. The California native had already medaled at the World Figure Skating Championships and was only expected to get better.\n\nBut after more than a year away from ice skating, Liu now tells PEOPLE exclusively that she’s “more excited” about figure skating than ever before — especially the last time the Olympics came around.\n\n“I was not there for the skating at all in my head,” Liu tells PEOPLE exclusively, looking back four years ago. “I was checked out. I was just there for the Olympic experience.”\n\nBut as Liu has explained in a number of media appearances in recent weeks, she had grown exhausted of the all-consuming lifestyle Olympic-level figure skating asks of its competitors and wanted a chance to step back and live what she described to NBC News as a “normal, teenage-girl, older-sister life.”\n\n“I really had nothing going on with my life, you know? Just training,” Liu said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. “I would live at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado, in a dorm by myself. I would eat their food. I went to the rink, skated, ate lunch there, skated some more. Went back to the dorm. I didn’t go anywhere. I didn’t see anything. I was just there,” she said. “And so all that, I was like, ‘Skating is not worth it.’ Like, this is not worth it.' ”\n\nSo after finishing short of the podium in 2022, Liu moved out of the Olympic Training Center in Colorado and moved on from figure skating. Or so she thought.\n\nFor nearly more than a year, Liu returned to a semi-normal teenage life: She went on vacation, spent time with family, graduated high school and began attending UCLA, where she now studies psychology. But during a 2024 ski trip with her family to Lake Tahoe, Liu found herself falling back in love with the adrenaline rush of winter sports, as she told NBC Sports, and felt a pull back to get back on the ice.\n\nIt wasn’t until early 2025 when Liu felt like she was fully invested in the sport for the first time.\n\n“That's when I was like, ‘I'm doing this for real,’ “ she tells PEOPLE with a reawakened excitement for the upcoming Winter Games in Italy.\n\nLiu says living her life and “doing a ton of other things,” including “trying out every hobby in existence” made her realize that her true calling was figure skating all along. “It made me realize what I like to do,” Liu says. “A lot of aspects in figure skating actually follow in line with my interests.”\n\nOne of which includes fashion design, something she’s taken the reins of herself after years of letting others consult and pick her outfits for her. The UCLA student says she’ll find herself up until 2 a.m. some nights after practice working out ideas for new costumes to wear on the ice. “In figure skating, we have these gorgeous dresses and I love to design them,” Liu says. “I work really closely with my dress designer on them, so that part of figure skating I like.”\n\nLiu’s redetermined grasp on figure skating has already proved fruitful with a stunning gold medal finish at the 2025 World Championships.\n\n“She hates this term, but we almost call it Alysa 2.0,” Phillip DiGuglielmo, Liu’s coach, told NBC. “It’s like a reboot, in a way.” Liu’s “reboot” already has critics listing her as a top contender to medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, alongside a strong Team USA that also includes Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito.\n\nLiu says her confidence level feels “more or less the same” as it did when she first stepped into the Olympic spotlight at 16 years old.\n\n“But I’m more excited for the figure skating part of it all now,” she says, thinking ahead to the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nGold or not, for Liu, simply getting back to the point of excitement has been an achievement far beyond what she might have imagined just four years ago.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "description": "The U.S. speed skater tells PEOPLE about her and Team USA hockey star Hilary Knight's first dates during the 2022 Winter Olympics",
    "fullText": "Nearly a decade into her competitive speed skating career, Brittany Bowe finally achieved her dream of standing on an Olympic podium at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut when you ask her about her memories of that time, she’s quick to point out that it was actually falling for girlfriend Hilary Knight that stands out the most.\n\n“That was the biggest win coming out of Beijing for sure,” Bowe, 37, tells PEOPLE about meeting her partner, the U.S. women’s ice hockey captain, that February.\n\n“Hilary and I have known each other for a number of years through different Team USA events, a number of different Olympics, but that's the first time we really did have time to connect and get to know one another,” Bowe says. “And it was everything other than glamorous, that's for sure! Hilary would ask, like, ‘Oh, do you want to go for a walk after dinner?’ And that was our first date, going to walk around the Olympic Village masked because everyone was so fearful of getting COVID.”\n\nSoon, the couple’s walking dates became dinner dates.\n\n“[It was] a very unique way to meet someone, but it was also kind of cool because we felt like we were in this bubble,” Bowe recalls. “We didn't have the family, the friends, no outside distractions. And we really had a lot of time just to get to know each other.”\n\nFour years later, the two share a home in Salt Lake City, and will soon be packing their bags for what may be each of their final Winter Olympics. (They'll be leaving behind the fancy handmade Italian coffee machine they recently purchased to prepare for the trip: “We've been watching hours of videos,” Knight laughed to PEOPLE.)\n\nNow, however, their focus will both be on bringing home medals as part of Team USA – Bowe as a veteran member of the U.S. speed skating squad, and Knight as the captain of the U.S. women’s hockey team.\n\nBowe is excited for the 2026 Winter Games — particularly the return to fans in the stands, as they were still barred from attending in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“I know both of our families are really excited to watch both of us compete,” Bowe says. “My family's already got their hockey tickets, and her family's getting the speed skating tickets. So, just to have more people in the stands that love you, support you, are part of your journey — that will make it really special.”\n\nA Florida native who first took up inline skating after a local coach noticed her gliding down the rink at a friend’s birthday party, Bowe didn’t seriously consider ice skating until she found herself watching old friends from her inline days compete for Team USA at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n“My path to the Olympics is definitely not linear,” says the former Florida Atlantic University point guard, who set aside her plans to make it to the WNBA after becoming infatuated with ice skating during those 2010 Winter Games.\n\nDespite not being “an adrenaline junkie at all” when she’s off the ice, \"I love pushing myself to the limit\" in competition, Bowe says. She adds that winning is “an addiction” that gives her “no better feeling in the world.”\n\nAnd when the 2026 Winter Olympics come to a close, regardless of the outcome, her lifelong dream of having an Olympic career will have been accomplished.\n\n“More than anything, [I’m excited about] just being able to compete and represent my country,” Bowe says. “I can't think of a better way to end my career than with the flag on me and my family in the stands.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "fullText": "Snowboarder Scotty James parlayed a never-before-landed trick combination into his fifth straight X Games title on the halfpipe Saturday and tied Shaun White with eight overall gold medals at the biggest event this side of the Olympics.\n\nIn the final major contest before next month's Milan Cortina Games, the 31-year-old Aussie capped off his winning run with two straight backside 1440-degree jumps. That's two tricks spinning with his back facing down the hill to start, one while riding forward, the other riding backward — or “switch.” They are among the toughest on the halfpipe.\n\nJames briefly put his hand onto the snow to stay upright after the second jump, but the judges rewarded him anyway. His score of 95 easily beat second-place finisher Haku Shimasaki of Japan.\n\n“I felt I wanted to do something for myself and for halfpipe and to push backside riding as much as I can,” said Scott, who wore his trademark red boxing gloves and celebrated by crowd surfing into the hundreds of fans who watched the action in Aspen, Colorado. “Tonight, I think it always was the plan. I wanted to come out and do the first back-to-back backside 14s, and I'm pumped.”\n\nJames is looking like the favorite heading into the Milan Cortina Olympics. Last week, he won the Laax Open in Switzerland — a contest in which defending Olympic champion Ayumu Hirano suffered a nasty fall and broke bones in his face, throwing his status for next month's Olympic halfpipe contest into limbo.\n\nJames has Olympic silver and bronze medals. In a documentary on his life that dropped earlier this Winter, he made no secret that he needs the Olympic gold to round out an otherwise impeccable career.\n\nJames has also shown a triple cork — three head-over-heels flips — as part of his repertoire this season, though the back-to-back 1440s was something nobody had seen.\n\nHe said he has always admired groundbreakers, such as slopestyler Mark McMorris, 2014 Olympic halfpipe champion Iouri Podladtchikov (the iPod) and White, and wanted to use this latest X Games performance to add something new.\n\n“I get a chip on my shoulder every year, thinking maybe I wouldn't be expected to show up and try again and win again,” he said. “I managed to do that today, and I'm speechless, honestly.”\n\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia 76ers star Tyrese Maxey is on his way to becoming one of the more popular players in the league. He was voted an All-Star starter and will be receiving a signature shoe from New Balance. All of it is rewarding for a player who is on the up and up.\n\nOn top of being voted in as an All-Star starter, Maxey was the top vote getter among American-born players. That fact has to make one wonder whether the star guard would play for Team USA in the 2028 Olympics should the opportunity arise.\n\n\"I would love to play for Team USA,\" Maxey said on Monday. \"If I got that honor, it would be a blessing. I think it’s in LA, right? So, it’s in the United States. That would be really cool. Just to represent the country in the country and if that’s something that I have the opportunity to do, then I’ll definitely be there for it.\"\n\nMaxey will certainly be in the mix. One has to believe due to what he has done with the Sixers, he will be on Team USA's radar. The Olympic competition is heating up and one has to believe everything will come down to Maxey, Detroit Pistons star Cade Cunningham, and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in terms of the guards Team USA will look at.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers star Tyrese Maxey discusses 2028 Team USA Olympic possibility",
