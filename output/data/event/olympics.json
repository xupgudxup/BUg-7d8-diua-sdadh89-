These were all first experiences, I just wanted to do myself proud.\"\n\nNicoll is also a three-time British shot put champion and is targeting an appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Mica Moore, who represented Team GB four years ago but has since opted to compete for Jamaica, sits 15th on 2:00:98 before Monday's medal-deciding heats.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Team USA's dominant start to the Olympics in Game 1 turned into a closer-than-expected victory over Denmark in Game 2. Their chances of clinching the top overall seed took a hit, but they dealt with some adversity effectively.",
    "fullText": "The USA's men's Olympic hockey team couldn't have asked for a better first game, but they certainly could have for their second.\n\nWhen they took out Team Latvia on Thursday, they were firing on all pistons, with five players recording two points. And star goalie Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets was nearly perfect for the Americans, which looked like the dominant force many believed they'd be at the Games.\n\nThe Americans got a reality check on Saturday courtesy of Team Denmark, which put up a fight for much of the game before the States pulled away and won 6-3.\n\nSubpar goaltending from Jeremy Swayman and an offense against a team the United States were expected to blow out could have made their next two games more difficult than they needed to be. That said, the wakeup call could help them adjust and come out stronger.\n\nThe result turned out to be in Team USA's favor, with the Americans outshooting Denmark 47-21. But it was not nearly as one-sided as the score or shot count might suggest.\n\nThe Danes took the first two leads of the game, less than two minutes into the first period and again midway through the first. Nobody had that on their bingo card. And although the Americans wound up flexing their muscles by scoring three times in a 7:57 span during the second period, the game on the whole was far closer than the U.S. would've preferred.\n\nMen's #Olympics standings after day 4.🏒 #IIHF pic.twitter.com/xq3tB3ZSzb\n\n— IIHF (@IIHFHockey) February 14, 2026\n\nTeam USA now has a goal differential of plus-7 in Group C play. That's not as good as Canada's goal differential of plus-9 in Group A after two games, but if the Americans can maul Team Germany in their final round-robin game on Sunday, and if Canada has a low-scoring game against France that same day, it's still possible the U.S. locks up the No. 1 seed.\n\nAnd conversely, it's still possible that the States wobble and wind up behind the powerhouse Canadians and end up with a less favorable quarterfinal matchup.\n\nBut one thing is clear: Swayman has probably played his final game in these Olympics.\n\nFirst of all, the Boston Bruins veteran goalie gave up a goal to Danish defenseman Nicholas B. Jensen that was shot from center ice. He told reporters post-game he didn't see the puck and that it was a flash screen.\n\n\"It was just the perfect height, right between the stands and board level,\" he said. \"I truly lost it… No matter how they go in, you have to step up and stop the next one.\"\n\nAs the crowd in Italy gasped at Swayman's miscue, Jensen's goal gave Team Denmark a 2-1 lead.\n\nThen, with three seconds left in the second period, after the U.S. scored three unanswered goals, Denmark defenseman Phillip Bruggisser took a slapshot from the top of the zone that beat Swayman as well. It's possible J.T. Miller screened him when he went for the block, but shots from low-danger areas like that should be fairly routine stops.\n\nMaple Leafs' Matthews, Jets' Hellebuyck Must Lead Team USA To No. 1 Seed Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews and Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck starred in Team USA's first win. They'll need to keep it up when they play to build a large enough goal differential to clinch the No. 1 overall seed over Canada.\n\nTeam Denmark's scoring showed the Americans how much tightening up they need to do before the stakes of the Games get significantly higher.\n\nThat almost certainly means Hellebuyck will be the go-to netminder for the U.S. until further notice, although that was probably the plan anyway. After tomorrow, there aren't any back-to-back games for Team USA, which clinched Group C with the win.\n\nThat doesn't mean the road ahead for Team America will be easier. It could turn out to be considerably tougher, with a possible showdown against Team Sweden in the cards if the U.S. are the No. 2 seed and if the Swedes win their qualifying match.\n\nThe good vibes of the Americans' first game quickly evaporated in Game 2 against the Danes. In the end, the result went their way, but if their first game unfolded like a pleasant dream, their second game was a cold wakeup call that they have to show urgency against any team, no matter how their opponents look on paper.\n\nDon't get it twisted – the Americans still have a lot to like about their Olympics thus far. And the brief stretch of adversity they faced on Saturday may be exactly what they need to thrive when the games matter most. No team has a flawless road to a gold medal performance, and Team USA learned against Denmark that you need to put in the work and earn every 'W' that puts you any closer to the Olympic podium.\n\nFighting your way through rough spots – and emerging stronger on the other side of it – is the hallmark of every champion. We'll see how the U.S. reacts to this close call, but for now, at least, their destiny is very much in their hands.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "A medallist with Team GB in 2014, bobsleigher Joel Fearon is preparing for his third Winter Olympics after coming out of retirement to compete for Jamaica.",
    "fullText": "\"The fastest man in the UK this year and he's not even going to the Olympics.\"\n\nThat was the line belted out by the commentator as Joel Fearon stunned onlookers by running the 100m in under 10 seconds - breaking one of the most revered barriers in sport.\n\nFrustratingly, the performance came just after the cut-off date to qualify him to represent Team GB at Rio 2016.\n\nA decade on, the 37-year-old is at his third Winter Olympics, but his first for Jamaica's bobsleigh team, who he came out of retirement for last year.\n\nHe remembers that day in 2016 as one that changed his life.\n\n\"I don't know if I ever believed that I could do something like that,\" he told BBC Local Radio.\n\n\"It was surreal for a long time because I wasn't one of the British superstar sprinters.\n\n\"But there I was, running sub-10, number one in the country and I remember thinking anything can happen.\"\n\nOnly four British men have ever run faster on UK soil than his time of 9.96 seconds to win the England Athletics Championships in Bedford that day.\n\nRunning fast was just one piece of the jigsaw for Coventry-born Fearon, as he was trying to make ends meet, juggling between work and bobsleigh training.\n\n\"I've done all sorts of jobs, at one point, I was a pizza delivery man,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I would run Diamond Leagues in the daytime. In the evening, I'm off delivering my local pizzas, just whatever needed to be done.\"\n\nAthletics was Fearon's first sporting passion, but his bobsleigh career has been unique.\n\nHe has competed for Great Britain, Switzerland and Jamaica over a period of 15 years.\n\nHis bronze medal from the Sochi 2014 Olympics was only awarded five years later because of retrospective doping bans.\n\nThe sport was initially suggested to him by his coach, partly to help support his family.\n\n\"I was pretty broke and some trials came up,\" Fearon explained.\n\n\"It was a tough transition, there is a lot of lifting, you are a mechanic and there are a lot of long hours and time spent out in freezing cold conditions.\n\n\"If I didn't hold out [on] those rough days, I would have never known what was coming in the future.\"\n\nWelsh bobsleigher Moore makes Olympics for Jamaica\n\nHow British skeleton came back fighting after 2022\n\nWinter Olympics athletes to have broken medals fixed\n\nFearon initially came fifth in the four-man bobsleigh in Sochi, and with hindsight, he would not change the way it happened.\n\n\"We knew we were good enough. Knowing that we didn't [medal] actually just kept me striving,\" he said.\n\n\"I went straight to a relay camp. I didn't soak it in, didn't even enjoy it.\n\n\"If I would have got that medal, I probably wouldn't have run sub-10. I wouldn't have had the same drive.\"\n\nAt the time Fearon received it, he was on a season-long loan to Switzerland's bobsleigh team, with whom he won another bronze at the Europe Cup.\n\n\"They bought me, actually. They needed experienced athletes for one of their junior drivers, Timo Rohner,\" he remembered.\n\n\"We were the Swiss number one team that year. [Rohner] is at the Olympics with me [at Milan-Cortina], that's nice because this is his first Olympics and I had a little part in his journey.\"\n\nLike many athletes, Fearon's career has been affected by agonising injuries at key moments.\n\nHe has wires in his lower leg bones holding them together, following a serious one picked up while running for the British relay team.\n\n\"After that, I semi-retired from athletics, I still went and did a few things, but it wasn't the same,\" he said.\n\n\"It took a good two-year chunk out of my athletic career.\"\n\nBut while that pain eased over time as he recovered, what hit his family next was hard to put into words.\n\nIn 2023, his sister Natasha Morais was murdered.\n\nFeeling scared and suffering with insomnia, Fearon retired from all sport.\n\n\"It was tough for all of us. We are all still dealing with it in our own ways,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't think I was ever going to be able to do sport again. I really struggled with anxiety.\n\n\"I was becoming afraid to leave my family alone.\"\n\nComing out of retirement to represent Jamaica has given Fearon fresh focus and brought joy to a grieving family.\n\nBut he did not necessarily expect to be pushing a sled at another Winter Olympics.\n\n\"It was an athlete and coach role, I can do all the jobs across bobsleigh, even just organisational jobs,\" said Fearon, who met rapper Snoop Dogg while training in Italy.\n\n\"But we ended up getting in the sled. I've done six races and won six races, so I'm a pretty good lucky charm.\n\n\"I think they're going to have me pushing a few more times before I'm done,\" he joked.\n\nFearon's father is Jamaican, while his maternal grandparents are also from the Caribbean island.\n\n\"My dad was so proud. I've never seen him excited about sport before,\" he added.\n\n\"I didn't even know these guys a year ago and they're all like my brothers, I get more excited about them racing than I do myself racing.\n\n\"I'm probably taking on a dad role. Seeing how much they're excelling, it's just really exciting for me to watch and wonder where it could go.\"\n\nThe crossover between Fearon's two sports is a well-travelled path.\n\nFellow sprinter and bobsleigher Mica Moore is also part of Jamaica's squad in Milan-Cortina, having previously switched allegiance from Great Britain.\n\nFour years ago, Montell Douglas became GB's first female summer and Winter Olympian, while this year, track and field internationals Adele Nicoll and Ashleigh Nelson are in their squad.\n\nThey all have explosive power and speed over the initial acceleration phase where pushing the sled effectively is so vital.\n\nBut perhaps the crossover that Fearon is most excited about is the association with the 1993 hit film Cool Runnings about the Jamaican bobsleigh team.\n\n\"I love it, because I watched it when I was 10,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I had no idea I was ever going to have anything to do with bobsleigh at that point, never mind Jamaican bobsleigh.\n\n\"I've gone from being an Olympic medallist and part of this team, which is great, but now I'm a Disney character. Now I'm in a movie, it's different.\n\n\"We are the most famous team in the world, so it's for us to go out and do our flag proud.\"",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — On Valentine’s Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week.\n\n“We can confirm that condom supplies in the Olympic Villages were temporarily depleted due to higher-than-anticipated demand,” the Italian organizing committee said in a statement Saturday. “Additional supplies are being delivered and will be distributed across all villages between today and Monday.”\n\nProviding condoms for athletes has been a gift from organizers — and a constant fascination to the world — for decades.\n\nWhile 300,000 condoms were provided for more than 10,500 athletes at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, the original stock was much lower for these Winter Games.\n\n“I think 10,000 have been used, 2,800 athletes — you can go figure, as they say,” International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said Saturday. “It clearly shows that Valentine’s Day is in full swing in the village.”\n\nReports of no condoms in week one of the games followed an absence of plush toys of the official mascots, Milo and Tina, in the opening days. They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.\n\nCondoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home from as “a kind of gift” to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.\n\n“I’m not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already,” said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. “There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village.\"\n\n\"Every day, everything was (gone),” she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.\n\n“I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it’s a kind of gift for them,” Clerc said.\n\nThere should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony Feb. 22.\n\n“They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability,” the local organizing committee said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Jordan Stolz is 2 for 2. There's a chance 4 for 4 might not be far behind.\n\nThe American speedskating star added his second gold medal in two attempts at the Milan Cortina Olympics by sprinting to victory in the men's 500 meters on Saturday.\n\nStolz joined Eric Heiden as the only skaters to win both the 500 and 1,000 meters at the same Olympics. Heiden did it at Lake Placid in 1980, a full 24 years before the 21-year-old Stolz was born.\n\nWhile Stolz has been wary about comparing himself to Heiden, who won a record five races nearly five decades ago, he hardly seems intimidated by the challenge. Racing in the penultimate pairing, the Wisconsin native's time of 33.77 seconds gave him his second Olympic record in four days. He did the same while capturing the 1,000 meters on Wednesday.\n\nJenning de Boo of the Netherlands took silver, just as he did in the 1,000. Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil got the bronze in 34.26.\n\nNext up for Stolz is the 1,500 meters on Thursday, and the mass start on Feb. 21.\n\nThe party in Brazil this week isn't limited to the annual Carnivale in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAlpine skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen delivered the first gold medal by a South American athlete at the Winter Olympics by surging to victory in the giant slalom.\n\nThe 25-year-old, whose father is Norwegian and mother is from Brazil, posted a two-run time of 2 minutes, 25 seconds, beating defending champion Marco Odermatt of Switzerland by 0.58 seconds. Odermatt’s teammate, Loic Meillard, earned bronze on the snowy and slippery Stelvia course.\n\n“I was skiing with my heart, and when you ski the way you are, anything is possible,” Pinheiro Braathen said. \"The only thing that matters to me is that I remain who I am. I am a Brazilian skier who became an Olympic champion.”\n\nMaren Kirkeeide's first Olympic biathlon race ended with a dismal 49th-place finish early in the Games.\n\nHer second went far, far better.\n\nThe Norwegian earned gold in the women’s 7.5-kilometer sprint, clearing all 10 of her shots before crossing the finish line in 20 minutes and 40.8 seconds, just ahead of Oceane Michelon of France 3.8 seconds back. Lou Jeanmonnot missed one but held on for the bronze, 23.7 seconds back.\n\n“I wanted to try my best, and I got some positive feedback from the coaches, and then I got some extra motivation, and it helped me all the way to the finish line,” Kirkeeide said.\n\nJeanmonnot now has a full set of medals in Italy. She took silver in the 15-kilometer individual race and was part of France's gold medal-winning mixed relay.\n\nA snapped ski binding by Sweden created an opening in the women's cross-country relay. Norway was more than happy to zip through it.\n\nThe Norwegians pulled off a stunner to claim gold in a discipline dominated by the Swedes. Sweden entered the race having won seven out of nine possible medals so far up at the course in Tesero.\n\nThe Swedes were leading during the second leg when Ebba Andersson broke her binding and fell. Forced to ski with just one ski at one point, she lost valuable time.\n\nNorway finished the 4 x 7.5-kilometer race in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 44.8 seconds, 50 seconds ahead of Sweden. Finland earned the bronze, more than a minute back.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Ever since Eileen Gu decided to compete under the flag of China, and not the United States where she was born, her citizenship has been the subject of scrutiny and controversy.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, she said her decision to switch allegiance back in 2019 had everything to do with “inspiring” children from the country of her mother at the Olympics in her home country. That would be the 2022 Beijing Games, where Gu won two golds and a silver for China in freestyle skiing.\n\nShe’s since become a millionaire many times over, mainly due to her online presence and endorsements, not her skiing. She was the fourth-highest earning female athlete in 2025, earning upwards of $23 million. According to Sportico, all but $20,000 of that $23 million came from endorsements.\n\nNow, she’s back in the Olympics, still competing for China and, reportedly, being paid handsomely to do so.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Gu and Zhu Yi, a fellow American-born figure skater who now competes for China, were paid a combined $6.6 million by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau in 2025 for “striving for excellent results in qualifying for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics.” In all, the two were reportedly paid nearly $14 million over the past three years.\n\nThe payments were revealed when the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau budget was posted online with the names of Gu and Zhu. Their names have since been scrubbed from the public report.\n\nGu already has a silver in slopestyle in Italy, while Zhu — born Beverly Zhu in Los Angeles — is not competing in the 2026 Games.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,” Gu said after winning silver in slopestyle. “Just being able to ski through all of that, you know. To still show my best and still be so deeply in love with the sport.\n\n\"That's really what I care about and I'm so happy to represent that today.\"\n\nThe subject of Gu’s citizenship remains shrouded in mystery. China does not allow dual citizenship, meaning Gu ostensibly had to give up her U.S. passport.\n\nGu will compete in two more events — women’s halfpipe and big air.",

But still, you don't expect a curling match to descend into finger-pointing, swearing and accusations of cheating.\n\nWhen the men's rinks of Canada and Sweden met at the Winter Olympics in Cortina on Friday, tempers became frayed.\n\nThe Swedes believed one of the Canadians was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones - releasing the handle at the appropriate time but then giving the stone another little prod with his finger to correct its course.\n\nSweden skip Niklas Edin raised it with the officials between the second and third ends and the row quietly simmered away as the contest unfolded.\n\nThen, going into the last end, irritation turned to anger. Gestures were made before Canada's Marc Kennedy and Sweden's Oskar Eriksson began swearing at each other across the sheet.\n\n\"I don't like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games,\" said Kennedy. \"So I told him [Eriksson] where to stick it.\n\n\"He might have been upset that he was losing...\"\n\nCanada went on to win 8-6, leaving the 2022 gold medal-winning Swedish rink without a win in their first three games.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nEach stone has a sensor on it to ensure players release their grip on the handle before the thick green line that runs across the ice, known as the hog line.\n\nIf they do, the sensor flashes green. If not, a red light shows.\n\nKennedy's stone showed green, but Eriksson and his Swedish team-mates thought they saw the Canadian give the stone an extra push with his finger after letting the handle go. The video evidence appears to back that up.\n\nBut, as BBC Sport curling commentator Steve Cram asked former world champion Jackie Lockhart, is it actually cheating and does it make a difference?\n\n\"You should not be touching the stone after you've released it,\" Lockhart said. \"If you touch it with a broom, it's burned and removed.\n\n\"He's released that stone, then poked it with his finger – I'm not sure why. Is it to push it a little bit harder because he felt he didn't give it enough?\"\n\nWhen the teams came off the ice, they would have signed a declaration saying they are happy with the result. So, unless a protest was submitted at that stage - and as far as we know there wasn't - the result will stand.\n\nBut what will this mean for the Canadians - who are considered medal contenders and have won their first three matches - in the rest of the Games?\n\n\"The question we should be asking is if Oskar is challenging him, has he [Kennedy] done it before?\" Lockhart added.\n\n\"Have they been doing it at other Championships and now they're being called out on it?\n\n\"I'm a bit disappointed with the Canadians if that's what they're doing. We'll all be looking now.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's women curlers kickstarted their campaign with a superb first victory of these Winter Olympics, beating medal contenders Canada 7-6.\n\nAfter surrendering meekly in their opening two matches against China and South Korea, few fancied Rebecca Morrison's rink to right the wrongs against the world champions.\n\nHowever, the British team raised their game significantly, with Morrison in particular making the shots that she was missing earlier in the competition, to overcome a Canadian side who looked fragile after their loss to the United States on Friday.\n\n\"It just feels absolutely amazing to go out there and get our first win,\" skip Sophie Jackson told BBC Sport. \"We put the game together that we wanted to today - we had a good first half and carried that on in the second half.\"\n\nIt took until the third end for the Scottish quartet to get on the board, but after Canada skip Rachel Homan erred, Morrison kept her composure to slide in for three.\n\nAnother fabulous Morrison shot in the fourth forced another mistake from Homan and allowed GB to steal, before they were into the break 4-2 up.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nBoth their previous matches got away from the British rink after the interval, but they maintained their momentum here.\n\nPoints were traded in the sixth and seventh ends before Morrison - growing in stature by the minute - delivered another two to move her side four clear going into the penultimate end.\n\nCanada looked devoid of ideas. Homan, for whom Olympic gold has proved elusive throughout a stellar career, was floundering. One in the ninth left them needing a miracle but GB were not of a mind to let this one go.\n\n\"Becca played absolutely fantastically - we all did - but it's great to see Becca when she's like that and I'm sure she'll be on a roll now,\" Jackson added.\n\nThe women will look to continue their unlikely revival on Sunday against another fancied rink, Sweden (13:05 GMT).\n\nThey have six more round-robin matches to play, with a total of five or six wins potentially enough to clinch a semi-final place.\n\nAnd GB's men are next on the ice, playing their fourth match of nine against Czech Republic at 13:05 GMT on Saturday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Ilia Malinin finishes stunning 8th in Olympics singles figure skating: 'I blew it' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf the team event at the 2026 Winter Olympics was Ilia Malinin's introduction to the broader United States sporting fanbase, the men's singles served as something of a coronation.\n\nMalinin, a Vienna, Virginia native, is widely considered to be figure skating's greatest talent. He's the only person to successfully complete a quadruple axel, having pulled off the feat a number of times throughout his still budding career.\n\nMalinin flaunted his talent in the team event, overcoming a shaky short program to lead the Americans to gold. Men's singles, it seemed, would be a cakewalk -- a platform for the 21-year-old to enchant audiences before another gold medal danced along his neckline.\n\nThat didn't happen, though. Malinin suffered one of the biggest upsets in recent Olympic history, missing out on the podium entirely after falling victim to a number of uncharacteristic errors.\n\nSo, just what went wrong for Malinin on Friday afternoon? In short, everything. Here's what you need to know.\n\nMORE: Every mistake that cost Ilia Malinin an Olympic medal in men's singles\n\nMalinin entered the contest with hopes of draping a second golden ornament around his neck. His dreams came crashing during his free skate program, a four-and-a-half minute routine that turned hellish following an early miscue. Malinin attempted to pull off a quadruple axel -- his signature skill. But he was turned away, unable to finish all of his rotations. He settled for a single axel, instead, setting the stage for an unusually nervy display.\n\nThe 21-year-old cratered into the ice shortly thereafter, losing his footing while attempting to land a quadruple toe loop. He tumbled into the slippery white plain once more during his routine. All told, Malinin lost out on 72 points during his jumps. That cost him dearly, seeing him fall into eighth-place, some 37 points shy of gold medalist Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan.\n\nIlia Malinin falls out of the podium in the men's singles final for figure skating.\n\nMalinin finishes in 8th place. pic.twitter.com/c4ZvSrkmIB\n\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) February 13, 2026\n\nMORE: Updated Winter Olympics medal count for every country\n\nMalinin was gracious in defeat, congratulating Shaidorov when his score was read.\n\nDespite the heartbreaking finish, Ilia Malinin went over to congratulate the men's singles final gold medal winner Mikhail Shaidorov 👏 pic.twitter.com/Kcti5qFX0I\n\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) February 13, 2026\n\nHe then spoke with NBC's Andrea Joyce, where he offered an honest assessment of his display.\n\n\"I blew it,\" Malinin said. \"That's honestly the first thing that came to my mind was 'There's no way that just happened.' I mean, I was preparing the whole season, I felt so confident in my program. ... To just go out and that happens, I have no words, honestly.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he could chalk up his errors to some physical limitation, Malinin was clear.\n\nMORE: Updated medal count for Team USA at 2026 Winter Olympics\n\n\"I just felt ready getting on that ice. But I think that maybe I was too confident that it was going to go well,\" Malinin said. \"Honestly, it happened, I can't process what just happened. It happens.\"\n\n\"I think it was definitely mental. Now, finally experiencing that Olympic atmosphere, it's crazy, it's not like any other competition.\"\n\nMalinin is 21 years old. He'll turned 21 on Dec. 2 of last year.\n\nMalinin could have made his Olympic debut four years earlier. He placed second in the men's singles at the 2022 U.S. Championships, putting him in position to be selected for the U.S. roster as a 17-year old.\n\nDespite his impressive exploits, Malinin missed out on the final roster, with U.S. Figure Skating selectors opting to select veterans Vincent Zhou and Jason Brown over him. Malinin's omission was a controversial one; U.S. Figure Skating argued that Zhou and Brown's body of work superseded Malinin, who had yet to make an appearance at junior worlds, junior Grand Prix or the 2021 U.S. Championships.\n\nMalinin had to settle for a spot on the U.S.'s World Championships roster, instead. He finished fourth in the short program, but fell to ninth after struggling in free skate.",

    "fullText": "The Canadian men's curling team closed out a successful 2-0 day at the 2026 Winter Olympics with a narrow win over Sweden.\n\nBut before a winner could be crowned in Cortina d'Ampezzo, there were tensions between the two teams.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Winter Olympics updates: Quad God misses gold, US women's hockey in action\n\nFollowing the ninth end, Canada and Sweden broke out into a heated verbal confrontation on the ice at the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium. The incident was sparked by Sweden’s Oskar Eriksson claiming Canada's Marc Kennedy double-touched his rock after releasing it before the hog line.\n\n\"Apparently it’s OK touching the rock after the hog line,\" Eriksson said while clearing the house, according to the Toronto Star. Per the Star, Eriksson's comments were immediately answered by responses of \"who?\" \"I haven’t done it once\" and \"Don’t chirp\" by Kennedy.\n\nCanada closed out its 8-6 win over Sweden with a point in the 10th end, moving them to 3-0 in the round-robin standings.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Ilia Malinin hot mic says Beijing Olympics experience could have prevented 2026 disaster\n\nThe issue the Swedes had, according to Reuters, was that they thought Kennedy and Canada were making contact with the stone beyond the hog line, which is the line on the sheet of ice where curlers must let go of the curling stone during delivery.\n\nWorld Curling has introduced electronic handles on the stones at the 2026 Winter Olympics, a technology piece that will tell officials if double-touching with the stone happened. Eriksson mentioned Sweden thought Kennedy was touching the stone and not the handle containing the sensor, which would not set off the red lights.\n\n\"He asked who we thought was over the hog line and I pointed out who we thought was touching the rock,\" Eriksson said. \"It was obviously not a red light, but some players are touching the rock, according to us. And that's not allowed. ... We told the officials. They came out and they misread the rules, sadly.\n\n\"Because they thought double-touching any part of the rock is OK. And then they found out that was wrong. You can only touch the electronic part of the handle.\"\n\nAsked about the incident following the match, Kennedy said he didn't like being accused of cheating.\n\n\"It's good. It's (a) sport. It's the Olympics. Both teams are trying to win,\" Kennedy said after the matchup, according to Reuters. \"Oskar was accusing us of cheating. I didn't like it. I've been curling professionally for 25 years.\"\n\nHe later added: \"There's hog line devices on there. I don't know. And he's still accusing us of cheating. I didn't like it. So I told him where to stick it.\"\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, World Curling said that umpires had been set at the hog line to monitor deliveries for three ends after the issue was first raised during the game, but that there were \"no hog line violations or retouches of the stone during the observation.\"\n\nBoth teams return to action on Saturday, Feb. 14 for one game each. Canada takes on Switzerland at 8:05 a.m. ET, while Sweden takes on China at the same time.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Canada, Sweden have heated moment in men's curling at Olympics",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian Vladyslav Heraskevych remain banned from 2026 Winter Olympics skeleton competition after his appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday.\n\nThe slider was banned by ruling body IBSF based on International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour athletes killed in the war with Russia.\n\nThe court said in a statement following an emergency ruling that the sole arbitrator appointed for this matter \"whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevyc's commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines.\"\n\nThe arbitrator considers that these guidelines \"provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.\"\n\nHeraskevych had argued that \"the exclusion is disproportionate, unsupported by any technical or safety violation and causes irreparable sporting harm to him.\"\n\nThe CAS arbitrator said that she was sympathetic with Heraskevych's attempt to \"raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nBut she added that the limitations imposed by the IOC to express views during competitions on the field of play are \"reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness (in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs).\"\n\nHeraskevych had already ruled out racing\n\nEarlier, Heraskevych appeared to have ruled out racing at the Olympics even if he won his appeal against the exclusion.\n\n\"It looks like this train has left,\" the 27-year-old, draped in the Ukrainan flag, told reporters after emerging from a two-and-a-half-hour hearing. \"I cannot do another race so it is done.\"\n\nHis CAS hearing began at a hotel in Milan on Friday and he said he was \"positive\" that his appeal would be upheld.\n\nThe court has set up an ad hoc division to deal with Olympic appeals quickly.\n\nThe first two runs of the Olympic skeleton competition in Cortina took place without Heraskevych, despite him finishing among the top six in all five training runs. The medal runs are scheduled for later on Friday.\n\nA reinstatement would be complicated and the athlete said racing in a symbolic one run was unlikely given the sport is dangerous.\n\n\"From a competitive perspective this makes no sense,\" he said, as he slammed the IOC's \"mockery\" for removing his Games accreditation and then giving it him back despite his racing ban.\n\nHeraskevych had refused repeated warnings from the IOC to give up wearing his helmet.\n\nThe IOC does not allow any kind of political statements in competition. He says this is different as it is a commemoration and not political, something he believes other athletes have been allowed to do.\n\nBut IOC president Kirsty Coventry told a news conference: \"The rules are the rules and I believe in the rules.\n\n\"We have to allow for athletes to express themselves but also to keep athletes safe.\"\n\nShe said political messaging is permitted away from actual competition, in press conferences for example, but that athletes themselves had agreed that the actual events should be neutral.\n\n\"I think he in some ways understood (the rules), but was very committed to his beliefs, but sadly it doesn't change the rules,\" Coventry said.\n\nHeraskevych was excluded shortly before the start of the first run in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Thursday.\n\nIn his appeal, he requested the annulment of the decision and \"that CAS reinstates him in the 2026 [Olympic Winter Games] with immediate effect, or in the alternative, that the athlete performs a CAS supervised official run pending the final decision.\"\n\nAround 40 members of the European Parliament have backed the slider and have written to the IOC, calling the ban wrong.\n\nPress reaction in Europe has also been largely against the IOC, while some Russian media in contrast have said the body has been too soft in giving his accreditation back.\n\nRussia as a nation is not allowed at the Games because of the war, but some individual Russian athletes are competing as neutrals after proving they have not actively supported the conflict.",

    "fullText": "After Team USA ice dancing duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates finished in second place in ice dance at the 2026 Winter Olympics, people are questioning this year’s judging.\n\nChock and Bates, who were favorites for gold, took home the silver medal. French ice dancers Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron won gold, finishing just more than one point ahead of Team USA.\n\nA recent Change.org petition calling for “transparency and accountability in Olympic judging” has nearly 15,000 signatures while Chock, 33, herself also expressed that she’d like to see the playing field remain fair going forward.\n\nWhen Chock and Bates, 36, were asked by CBS News if they’d like to see any changes in the way that ice dance is judged in the future, Chock said, “I think it would definitely be helpful if it’s more understandable for the viewers to just see more transparent judging and understanding [in] what’s really going on.”\n\n“I think it’s also important for the skaters that the judges be vetted and reviewed to make sure that they are also putting out their best performance because there’s a lot on the line for the skaters when they’re out there giving it their all,” she continued. “We deserve to have the judges also giving us their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field.”\n\nIn recent days, French judge Jezabel Dabouis came under fire for favoring Beaudry, 33, and Cizeron, 31, by nearly eight points. According to the Associated Press, if her score was removed, Chock and Bates would have won gold.\n\nThe International Skating Union stands by the judge, saying in a statement, “It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations. The ISU has full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.”\n\nStill, Chock and Bates admit to feeling disappointment coming in second place — but remain proud of their performance on the ice.\n\n“I think there were a lot of emotions flooding through us yesterday. I think there was some disappointment for sure,” Chock said in an interview with People, published on Friday, February 13, as she appeared to get choked up.\n\n“It’s been a long journey, but I certainly have a lot of pride for what we have accomplished, and who we’ve become on the way to those accomplishments,” she added. “So in general, [we’re feeling] gratitude.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump Has Not Disciplined Staffer Allegedly Responsible for Racist Obamas Video\n\nVictoria Justice Shows Off Her Travel Style While Spending Time in Thailand\n\n‘Dance Moms’ Alum Abby Lee Miller Sashays Into Vacation Mode During Sunny Island Escape\n\nThis story Olympic Silver Medalist Madison Chock Calls for ‘Transparent Judging’ as Skating Scores Are Questioned first appeared on Globe.",

    "description": "I attended skiing and snowboarding events in Livigno for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. I had fun and encountered lots of surprises.",
    "fullText": "My first Olympic Games in Paris were defined by swimming arenas, metro transfers, and navigating summer crowds. So, I expected my second round, the Winter Games in Milan Cortina, to feel similar, just colder. I was wrong.\n\nInstead of stadiums in the heart of a capital city, we found ourselves crossing a national border and trudging uphill in snow boots, hearts racing at altitude to attend skiing and snowboarding events in Livigno.\n\nStarting in the Alpine town hosting all of the freestyle skiing and snowboarding competitions, however, turned out to be the perfect way to ease into two weeks of winter sports in the mountains.\n\nHere are six things that surprised me most about the experience.\n\nThere are hotels in Livigno, but by the time we were booking, options were limited, and prices had surged into the thousands of dollars for a few nights.\n\nStaying there simply wasn't realistic for us, so the most practical and budget-friendly option was just across the border in Switzerland.\n\nThat meant each morning began with a 40-minute bus ride up the mountain from Zernez. The decentralization seemed like it'd be logistically challenging, but it felt more like a part of the intrigue of these Games.\n\nWhen I attended the Summer Olympics in Paris, I found it easy to grab tickets for events happening in the city that same afternoon. However, attending the Winter Games required much more planning.\n\nEvents for the Milan Cortina Games are spread across multiple host cities, including Milan, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livigno, and others, which makes bouncing between competitions more complicated.\n\nMilan and Cortina sit nearly 250 miles apart by road, making for a roughly five-hour drive. Livigno is several hours from both cities, so we were largely limited to the events near where we were staying, and traveling between venues adds significant time and cost.\n\nThis made it harder to chase last-minute ticket deals, which were rare anyway.\n\nLivigno sits at almost 6,000 feet above sea level, and we could feel it. Climbing even a modest hill left us fairly breathless.\n\nAdd snow boots, layers, and the excitement of hustling to catch the start of a run, and we started to wonder whether the Games were testing us.\n\nIt only made the feats of athleticism feel that much more impressive, though. Watching snowboarders and freestyle skiers soar through the air at altitude — while you're very aware of your own lungs — makes what they're able to do even more surreal.\n\nAt the Snow Park, not every vantage point comes with a seat and a perfect sightline. Some higher ticket categories included designated seating, but much of the venue was standing-room only.\n\nAlthough we did have seats for the snowboarding events, getting to them meant climbing a steep, snowy hill to reach the best side views of the course. It was slippery and a few of us fell on our way up (and down) the hill.\n\nAfter the first athlete dropped in, though, we almost forgot about our struggles to get up to our spots.\n\nFrom that angle, we could see the speed build and hear the scrape of boards against snow. It was unlike anything I've experienced before.\n\nOne of the strangest things about Livigno is how intertwined the Olympics and the town's everyday ski culture are.\n\nOn both sides of the mountain, visitors with regular lift passes were casually skiing while we watched the snowboarders and freestyle skiers compete.\n\nGondolas carried tourists up alongside the halfpipe, giving them a front-row view without ever leaving their ski gear behind. It was surreal.\n\nWhat's cool about Livigno is that spectators and holiday-goers share the same slopes, blurring the line between focused athleticism and relaxed mountain vibes. This is something we wouldn't have been able to see in a city-based Olympic venue.\n\nWe arrived early for better sight lines of the action on the mountain, which meant standing outside in brisk temperatures for hours.\n\nOnce the music started, though, the energy in Livigno was contagious. Luckily, since we were all outside, the crowds never felt claustrophobic or chaotic like they might inside an arena.\n\nWe head to Milan next for hockey and short-track speed skating, trading snow boots for city streets. But beginning this journey in the mountains has felt like the most fitting way to ease into two weeks of winter sport at its highest level.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych will not compete at the Winter Olympics after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) dismissed his appeal to wear a helmet depicting images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country.\n\nHeraskevych asked Cas to reinstate his place at the Olympics after he was banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) before the first heat of the men's skeleton on Thursday.\n\nHaving worn the helmet, which the IOC say breaks rules in the Olympic charter, during training sessions this week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry visited him at Cortina's sliding track in a final attempt to convince him not to wear it in competition.\n\nBut the 26-year-old refused to back down, believing the helmet to be within the rules and an emergency ad-hoc Cas meeting took place on Friday.\n\nCas said while they are \"fully sympathetic\" to Heraskevych's case and his right to \"freedom of expression\", it is not permitted \"on the field of play\".\n\nThe IOC said Heraskevych could show his helmet in mixed zones, news conferences and on social media, but that \"the field of play is sacrosanct\".\n\nInitially, the IOC had withdrawn his accreditation but eventually returned it and Cas agreed it was \"unfair\" to rescind it \"under these circumstances\".\n\n'Shocking' or correct? Why Ukrainian skeleton slider was banned\n\nHeraskevych's appeal to Cas asked for his ban to be overturned, to be able to wear the helmet and to complete the two skeleton runs he missed out on on Thursday under the supervision of Cas.\n\nHe said his disqualification was \"disproportionate\" and claimed other athletes had been able to express their grief during competition at the Games.\n\nFor example, American figure skater Maxim Naumov held up a photograph of his parents, who were killed last year in a plane crash in Washington DC, as he waited for his score to come in earlier this week.\n\nBut the IOC say Heraskevych has contravened the 'athlete expression' guidelines, external, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law, which state \"focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances\".\n\nThe law states: \"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference.\"\n\nOn Thursday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that if the committee allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games up to exploitation.\n\nBut Heraskevych has accused the Milan-Cortina Games of acting as \"Russian propaganda\" while Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, said, external the IOC are \"playing into the hands of the Russian aggressor\".\n\nHeraskevych, who was his nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony, has received support from his compatriots at the Games with Alpine skier Dmytro Shepiuk displayed a note reading \"Ukrainian heroes with us\" after competing while the Ukrainian mixed relay luge team took the knee and held their helmets aloft in a display of solidarity.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's men were left to rue a shocking first end as a stubborn fightback against hosts Italy in a throbbing Cortina Curling Stadium was not enough to prevent their first defeat of these Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter winning their opening two matches, including against the Swedish rink who beat them in the gold-medal match four years ago, the British team went into their second high-grade encounter in two days in a strong position.\n\nHowever, a horrendous first end - during which the Italians stole four points - left them chasing in front of a raucous home crowd armed with horns, bells and whistles.\n\nThese British players are the world's top-ranked rink for a reason though, and they slowly reeled in Italy, levelling in the ninth end.\n\nHowever, the local favourites held firm in the last to win 9-7 and add the scalp of GB to that of the Swedes, who they beat in their opener.\n\n\"We had to dig deep and we played nine really good ends and controlled it from there, but we just couldn't do enough to get the win,\" lead Hammy McMillan told BBC Sport.\n\nSeven wins from the nine round-robin matches will guarantee a place in the semi-finals - fewer may well still be sufficient - so Bruce Mouat's rink are still in a strong spot.\n\nGB's women are next on the ice, playing their second match against South Korea at 13:05 GMT. The men will return to the rink on Saturday, when they face the Czech Republic, also at 13:05.\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nThe horrified looks on the faces of the GB curlers said more than words could about that appalling opening end.\n\nLying one as Mouat threw his final stone, they took a risk in an attempt to claim two, but could not have anticipated just how badly it would go. An unfortunate kiss left none of their red stones in the house but four yellow Italian ones in position.\n\nThat might have caused some rinks to unravel but this Scottish quartet are the world's best, and soon righted themselves.\n\nThe sides traded singles before a fabulous final Mouat throw - aided by the intervention of the big compass to measure who was nearest the button - ensured GB claimed two to get back to 5-3.\n\nAnother splendid team shot - Mouat's throw, Grant Hardie's judgement, and the ferocious sweeping of Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie - forced a steal in the fourth and suddenly it was back to a one-point game at the break.\n\nThe Italians blanked the sixth, and claimed two in the seventh to open up a healthy advantage again. But Team GB roared back again with another two and remarkably levelled with one end to go after a steal.\n\nIt all came down to the final end but the Italians kept their nerve to edge to victory and cause a thunderous barrage of noise to roll down the wooden bleachers.\n\n\"It's pretty surreal, pretty cool,\" McMillan added. \"It's not a typical curling crowd - it's more like a football one. But it's an amazing atmosphere to play in and we're going to have to get used to it and enjoy it.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "title": "Winter Olympics 2026: Madison Chock and Evan Bates say scoring confusion does 'disservice' to figure skating",
    "description": "The judging of the free dance has come under heavy scrutiny in the U.S.",
    "fullText": "One of the biggest controversies of the 2026 Winter Olympics has been the scoring of the figure skating ice dance event, where French pair Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron defeated the heavy favorite, Team USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates.\n\nThat hasn't been a popular result in the U.S., and Chock and Bates acknowledged the controversy on Thursday while speaking with USA Today. While they didn't go as far as some of their fans, they did acknowledge this episode hasn't been the best look for figure skating:\n\n“Any time the public is confused by results, it does a disservice to our sport,” Chock said on Thursday.\n\n“It's hard to retain fans when it's difficult to understand what is happening on the ice. I think there needs to be a lot more clarity for the skaters, for the coaches and for the audience, in order to just have a solid fan base moving forward. People need to understand what they're cheering for and be able to feel confident in the sport that they're supporting.”\n\nAt issue is a scoring system in which the majority of the judges favored the Americans, but gave the French the win.\n\nWhen reviewing the individual judges' scores in the free dance, the French judge sticks out with their compatriots' second highest score and the lowest score Chock and Bates received, with a delta of nearly eight points. By comparison, the American judge favored Chock and Bates by about four points.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics figure skating ⛸️ free dance was scored by 9 judges\n\nThe French judge gave Beaudry & Cizeron 🇫🇷 a 137.45 but only gave Chock & Bates 🇺🇸 a 129.74\n\nAll other judges were relatively close in their two scores 🤔\n\nJudge No. 4 was just in a bad mood overall pic.twitter.com/1HkDHY5vuo\n\n— Lev Akabas (@LevAkabas) February 12, 2026\n\nBeaudry and Cizeron won by approximately a point and a half, despite some stumbles on the free dance some believed should have cost them enough points to land in silver territory. We're talking about the kind of a result that creates slow-motion supercuts on Reddit.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire is the fact Beaudry and Cizeron were already a controversial pair.\n\nAn online petition calling for an investigation has been circling among Chock/Bates fans, which Bates acknowledged but didn't explicitly endorse:\n\n“We haven’t actually seen it, we’ve just heard about it, but it means a lot that people are voicing their opinions on our behalf,” Bates said. “I think the way that we skated and the way we’ve approached chasing these goals hopefully has resonated with people at home, and even in our response I think hopefully that too can reflect the Olympic spirit.”\n\nThe International Skating Union has responded to the discourse as well, with a spokesperson issuing a statement to NBC News:\n\n\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations. The ISU has full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.\"\n\nTogether, Chock and Bates have won the last three ice dance world titles and hold a pair of Olympic gold medals as part of the U.S.' wins in the team event in 2022 and 2026. They have been skating together since 2011 and married in 2024.\n\nThey declined to tell USA Today if they would go for a fourth straight world title in March, but said they “have plans to remain on the ice” for now.",

    "description": "Several miles off the coast of Turnberry, Scotland, sits a barren island whose precious granite plays a key role in the Winter Olympics.",
    "fullText": "The original golf course at Trump Turnberry, on Scotland’s southwest coast, has some years on it: 125 to be exact. But that’s nothing compared to the age of one of the course’s famous neighbors: the uninhabited volcanic plug that stands sentinel in the Firth of Clyde about 10 miles off Turnberry’s shoreline.\n\nThe origins of that wind-battered granite dome, which rises more than 11 stories out of the sea and is visible from nearly every hole on Turnberry’s Aisla course, have been traced back 600 million years, to those lonely days when the continents were barren and the only signs of life came in the form of bacteria and eukaryotes.\n\nAnyone who’s played at Turnberry — or, for that matter, Royal Troon or Prestwick, about 25 miles up the coast — will be familiar with the island for the magnificent backdrop it provides. Same goes for golf-watchers who’ve tuned into any of the four Open Championships that have been conducted on the Aisla course since 1977, most recently in 2009 when Tom Watson nearly claimed the Claret Jug at 59 years young.\n\nThe Aisla Craig featured prominently in all of those broadcasts, just as Torrey Pines’ hang-gliders or Pebble Beach’s harbor seals do when the PGA Tour visits those storied venues. The rock is a staple of the Turnberry experience: an eroded magmatic pluton that not only inspires awe but also just so happens to play an essential role every four years in the Winter Olympic Games.\n\n***\n\nRicky English isn’t much of a golfer. “I’ve tried it before, it’s quite hard,” he told me earlier this week in a Scottish accent thicker than a pint of Belhaven Black. “It’s one of those games where one hole you can play like Seve Ballesteros, and then the next hole it’s in the woods and you’ve lost your ball.”\n\nBesides, English spends most of his days thinking about another sport: curling. If you’re even just a casual Olympics viewer — perhaps you’ve been following the action in Milan over the past week — you’re surely familiar with the pursuit, which has been awarding Olympic medals since the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Curling, in the most basic terms, involves a “thrower” pushing a roughly 40-pound stone down a 150-foot-long sheet of ice, with the aim of stopping the stone as close as possible to the center of a target (aka “the house”) on the far end of the ice. Aiding in the process are two of the thrower’s teammates who flank the stone as it slides down the ice, using “brooms”, as needed, to reduce the ice’s friction.\n\nEnglish knows a thing or two about those stones because he oversees the process of making them, as the operations manager of Kays Scotland, which since 2006 has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for the Olympics. “We’re kind of servicing the whole sport,” English said of his small but mighty factory about a 45-minute drive north of Turnberry. “There’s only about 50 workers in here. We’re really busy.”\n\nIt likely will come as no surprise from where Kays harvests its materials for the stones: yes, Aisla Craig her good self.\n\nThe island’s Blue Hone granite is used on the stone’s running edge while its Common Green granite, which is resistant to heat transfer and splintering, composes the body of the stone. It’s a formula Kays has spent the last 175 or so years perfecting, with granite that can be found nowhere else on earth. The factory, which is open four days a week, manufacturers about 12 stones a day or 48 per week with a sticker price of approximately $1,000/per (shipping not included). That might sound steep, but when you consider most stones last about 30 years, the cost also might sound like a bargain.\n\n“We have to keep our own quality standards up for every stone,” English said. “Whether we make a stone for the Olympics or we make a stone for a [curling] club in Alabama, it’s the same quality control, the exact same way of making it goes into it. There’s no difference.”\n\nKays ships stones all over the world, from the U.S. to China, Japan and South Korea to Mongolia and New Zealand, even to . . . Antarctica. “They’re using it as a kind of luxury experience type thing,” English said. “It’s like minus-36 degrees, so I wasn’t sure with the temperature and the conditions how the stones would be, but they seemed to be fine.”\n\nWhile the Aisla Craig’s granite is uniquely suited for curling stones, it also has found its way into Turnberry’s golf shop in the form of ball markers and other granite-based memorabilia. Kays also commissioned a St. Andrews clubmaker to build four hickory golf clubs into which Kays incorporated Common Green granite into the bases. They sold quickly. “So, yes,” English said of his team’s handiwork, “there’s wee ties to golf.”\n\nEnglish said he also sees some crossover between the skills required in both curling and golf, and, indeed, it’s not hard to see the parallels between sliding a stone down a slab of ice and rolling a ball across a slick green. “There are a few curlers that we know of that are actually really good golfers,” he said. “They’ve got the type of skills from curling, with the touch and feel, and they kind of took that into golf.”\n\nBut English has little time to work on his own swing or stroke. He has emails to answer and orders to fill, especially in this busy window during which his stones are enjoying their every-four-years moment in the international spotlight. To capitalize on the publicity, Kays’ online shop has been selling Olympics-themed giftware (coasters, drink cubes) made from Aisla Craig granite. The majority of orders thus far have come from the U.S., and English suspects that’s at least partly due to a certain rap legend on NBC’s coverage team in Milan.\n\n“Snoop Dog was at the curling,” English said. “That might have helped.”\n\nSix-hundred million years of history doesn’t hurt, either.\n\nThe post This iconic golf backdrop plays essential Winter Olympics role appeared first on Golf.",

    "title": "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred optimistic major leaguers will play in 2028 Los Angeles Olympics",
    "description": "Manfred said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality.",
    "fullText": "PALM BEACH, Fla. — Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred is optimistic that major leaguers will play in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nManfred, speaking following an owners meeting Thursday, said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality, but “I think we’re a lot closer to there than we were the last time we talked about it,” he said.\n\nThe six-nation baseball tournament will be played from July 13-19 at Dodger Stadium. MLB is planning for an extended All-Star break between July 9 and July 21, with the All-Star Game likely at San Francisco on July 11.\n\nAn agreement with the union is needed.\n\n“I sense a lot of momentum towards playing in LA in 2028,” Manfred said. “I think we are going to get over those issues. I think people have come to appreciate that the Olympics on U.S. soil is a unique marketing opportunity for the game. I think we had a lot of players interested in doing it and, you know, I feel pretty good about the idea (that) we’ll get there.”\n\nIn addition, an agreement is needed on insurance to cover player contracts for time with Olympic teams.\n\nThe United States will have an automatic berth in the both the baseball and softball tournaments and the top two other nations from the Americas in next month’s World Baseball Classic will earn berths.\n\nMLB did not allow players on 40-man rosters to participate in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, when Nippon Professional Baseball interrupted its season and Japan beat the U.S. 2-0 in the gold medal game.\n\nManfred was also asked if the involvement of Casey Wasserman, the prominent businessman and talent agent who has recently lost clients because of his appearance in recently released government files on Jeffrey Epstein, would deter the league from participating in the Olympics. He declined to comment on Wasserman, who is the chairman of the Los Angeles games, saying, “Look, our dealings are not with Casey. Our dealings are with the institution of the Olympics.”\n\nThe addition of star outfielder Kyle Tucker by the Los Angeles Dodgers to what already was among the highest payrolls again sparked debate over whether management will propose a salary cap in collective bargaining this year.\n\nManfred said there hasn’t been much movement in salary cap talks.\n\nTucker, the right fielder who is considered one of the best players in baseball, is the latest accomplished veteran brought in by the Dodgers, who have three of the top eight current contracts by average annual value. Los Angeles also signed top closer Edwin Díaz to bolster its bullpen.\n\n“Look, I think great teams are always good for baseball,” he said. “I think with respect to this particular great team, it added to what we have been hearing from fans in a lot of markets for a long time about the competitiveness of the game. But great teams are always good baseball.”\n\nBargaining is likely to start this spring on a labor contract to succeed the deal that expires Dec. 1.\n\n“We’re in the preparation process,” Manfred said. “We haven’t agreed on a calendar with the MLBPA and it does take two to tango, as they say, but historically after opening day we kind of get started.”\n\nManfred said there likely isn’t a way around insurance issues that have come up for MLB-contracted players planning to play in next month’s World Baseball Classic. Several stars, including Puerto Rico’s Francisco Lindor and Carlos Correa, were left off their countries’ rosters because the WBC insurer wouldn’t cover them.\n\n“We like that, when they say they want to play, obviously,” Manfred said. “But then to have a problem with the insurance and the guy being unable to play, we recognize that. I’m just not sure that there is a way around it.”\n\nThe tournament is co-owned by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Insurance is provided by National Financial Partners.\n\n“In order to get clubs comfortable with the idea that guys should play earlier in games they otherwise would not play, we had to protect them financially,” Manfred said.\n\nOwners approved a rules change requiring first- and third-base coaches to remain in the marked coaching boxes. Coaches have frequently moved toward home plate, in a better position to better relay signs from the defensive team that may pick up.\n\nMLB will produce and distribute local television broadcasts of at least 14 teams this season following financial problems of Main Street Sports Group’s FanDuel Sports Network.\n\n“The RSN situation has an impact on our revenue growth because the decline there is a drag on what is otherwise a growing industry,” Manfred said. “It is true that the smaller markets have been hit harder than the larger markets, which impacts revenue sharing. Having said both of those, I think longer term, our content is inherently valuable. We deliver tons of eyeballs, and I think when we have an opportunity to get to market in 2028, we’re going to be just fine.”\n\nManfred said the 14 teams are “probably making a little less than they made under their old contracts.”\n\n“The key word there is old,” he added. “The reason those contracts aren’t there anymore was they were not economic given the cord-cutting that’s going on.”\n\nTeams approved two changes in controlling owners: Cincinnati Reds CEO Phil Castellini succeeds his father Minnesota Twins board member Tom Pohlad takes over from takes over from his younger brother Bob.\n\nManfred said of the San Diego Padres’ sale process: “There is robust interest in what is viewed as a really appealing asset.”\n\nMilwaukee chairman Mark Attanasio and Baltimore control owner David Rubenstein were voted to the eight-man executive council, replacing Arizona managing general partner Ken Kendrick and Seattle chairman John Stanton. The council also includes San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson and Cleveland chairman Paul Dolan (whose terms expire in 2027) and Miami chairman Bruce Sherman and Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno (2028) and New York Mets chairman Steve Cohen and Athletics managing partner John Fisher (2029).\n\nMLB approved extensions of its contract with Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and of the deals for Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. to carry the Extra Innings package of out-of-market TV broadcasts.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian skeleton pilot Vladyslav Heraskevych says being banned from competing at the Winter Olympics is the \"price of our dignity\".\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned Heraskevych for continuing to wear a helmet featuring images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country, which the IOC says breaks its rules.\n\nHeraskevych, who wore the helmet in all of his training runs before the competition began on Thursday, was told by the IOC on Tuesday it \"does not comply\" with the Olympic charter and that he was not allowed to wear it.\n\nIOC president Kirsty Coventry visited the 26-year-old at Cortina's sliding track at 07:30 local time on Thursday before the first skeleton heat in a final attempt to convince him not to wear the helmet in competition.\n\nBut the IOC said Heraskevych \"did not consider any form of compromise\".\n\nIt said: \"The IOC was very keen for Mr Heraskevych to compete. This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe IOC added that Heraskevych, who was considered to have an outside chance of a medal based on his training times, had been banned for contravening athlete guidelines, rather than because of displaying political propaganda.\n\nResponding on social media after being banned, Heraskevych wrote:, external \"This is [the] price of our dignity.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, he added: \"I could be among the medallists in this event, but suddenly because of some interpretation of the rules which I do not agree with, I am not able to compete while other athletes in the same situation were able to compete, and they didn't face any sanctions.\"\n\n'Shocking' or correct - why Ukraine skeleton slider was banned\n\nThe IOC said he was banned for contravening the 'athlete expression' guidelines, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law.\n\nThey state that: \"The focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances, sport and the harmony that the Games seek to advance.\n\n\"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference.\n\n\"Specifically, the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes' performances.\"\n\nHeraskevych, who said he felt \"emptiness\" at not being allowed to compete, said the ban was not consistent with other decisions taken at the Games.\n\n\"'Expression guidelines', I believe it's a very big term. What do you consider as 'expression'? Many athletes here have helmets with different paints [colours] and I believe it's also a kind of expression,\" he said.\n\n\"Some athletes have national symbols, it's also an expression but for some reason their helmets were not checked. They are allowed to compete, but I am not.\"\n\nHeraskevych insists his tribute is no different to those that other athletes have displayed, such as figure skater Maxim Naumov.\n\nThe American held up a photo of his parents, who were among 67 people killed in a plane crash in Washington DC just over a year ago, while waiting for his score to be announced on Tuesday.\n\nHeraskevych's accreditation for the Games was initially withdrawn by the IOC but, following a \"very respectful\" conversation with the committee's president Coventry, that decision was overturned and he will be allowed to remain at the event but not compete.\n\nAsked how strongly he felt about commemorating those who have been killed during the Russian invasion, Heraskevych said: \"I believe they deserve to be here because of their sacrifice. I want to honour them and I want to honour their families.\"\n\nHe explained that many of those pictured on his helmet were athletes, including teenage weightlifter Alina Peregudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko and ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, and some of them were his friends.\n\nThe IOC said earlier this week that Heraskevych could pay tribute to the fallen athletes by wearing a black armband during competition and could show his helmet in mixed zones, news conferences and on social media, but that \"the field of play is sacrosanct\".\n\nIt added that IOC officials would \"beg\" him not to wear it as they wanted him to compete.\n\nOn Thursday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that if the committee allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games up to exploitation.\n\n\"There are according to the Red Cross, 130 conflicts going on at any one time. We can't have them all in competition [with each other at the Games],\" he said.\n\n\"The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.\n\n\"We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nAdams said IOC president Coventry had left the meeting with Heraskevych in tears as she felt \"very emotional\" about the matter, adding that \"the meeting was good, personal and respectful\".\n\nHe also denied that the IOC had been pressured by either the Russian Olympic Committee or the Russian government to ban Heraskevych, and said the Ukrainian would have access to a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) commission should he wish to appeal.\n\nThe IOC said athletes are able to \"express grief with dignity and respect\" at multi-faith centres in the Olympic villages.\n\nIt added that Heraskevych has been \"supported by the IOC for the last three editions of the Games\" and that he is an Olympic scholarship athlete.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IOC also set up a solidarity fund for Ukrainian sport to support the athletes' preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" it said.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Specifically, the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes' performances.\"\n\nThey say athletes can express their views during Olympic Games when speaking to the media, on social media, and on the field of play at the start of competition or during their introduction.\n\nHowever, they forbid these expressions during medal ceremonies, during competition and in the Olympic village.\n\nIf these rules are broken, participants \"may be subject to the IOC's disciplinary proceedings.\"\n\nThe IOC said these changes have been agreed after consultation with 4,500 athletes – stating that the focus on the field of play must be on the sport.\n\nIt was initially erroneously claimed by the IOC that it was rule 50 - which states that \"no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites\" - that resulted in the disqualification.\n\nIOC president Kirsty Coventry visited Heraskevych and his father in Cortina at 7.30am on the morning of competition, to make a last-gasp plea for him to not wear the helmet.\n\nShe said they had a lengthy, respectful meeting – but ultimately no compromise could be reached.\n\n\"No-one is disagreeing with the messaging. The messaging is a powerful message of remembrance, it's a message of memory, and no-one is disagreeing with that,\" Coventry told the media.\n\n\"What I proposed to him this morning and to his dad - because he also said when he goes down it's blurry, you can't really see it - so I said: 'Could we find a solution where we pay homage to his message, to his helmet before he races, then as soon as he's finished racing going into the mixed zone where you can see the pictures?'\n\n\"Sadly, we've not been able to come to that solution. I really wanted to see him race today. It's been an emotional morning.\"\n\nCoventry was seen to be in tears after leaving the meeting. A former Olympian herself, she won two gold medals in swimming for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe IOC have also reinstated Heraskevych's accreditation, allowing him to stay around the Games and in the Olympic village for the remainder of the competition.\n\nIn a tense media conference on Thursday morning, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams defended their decision to ban Heraskevych.\n\nAdams said that if they allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games to exploitation.\n\n\"There are according to the Red Cross, 130 conflicts going on at any one time,\" he said. \"We can't have them all in competition with each other at the Games.\n\n\"The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes have pressure put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.\n\n\"We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nAdams also denied that the IOC had been pressured by the Russian Olympic Committee or government to ban Heraskevych.\n\nHeraskevych meanwhile has made an urgent appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\nCAS can hold ad-hoc committees during the Games, meaning his appeal will be heard immediately - although BBC Sport understands there is currently no timeframe for a decision.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nThe decision to ban Heraskevych has drawn shock and condemnation from many former and current Olympic athletes.\n\nLizzy Yarnold, Team GB's two-time Olympic skeleton gold medallist, told BBC Sport: \"I think it is actually quite shocking. Within the sliding community there is shock and confusion.\n\n\"This [wearing the helmet] was a reaction to something which was an act of memorial and incredibly emotionally important to him.\n\n\"I think the IOC owe him an apology and this was the wrong decision.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic bobsledder John Jackson was equally unimpressed with the IOC.\n\nJackson, who also served as a Royal Marines commando, told the BBC: \"His approach to that is about remembering those who have fallen.\n\n\"For me, being military and now a veteran, remembrance is really important to all veterans. We have all lost friends and colleagues in conflict, and we all know someone who isn't here and paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n\"I support him in what he was trying to achieve. It is really important to remember those who have given their life for something that ultimately doesn't need to happen.\"\n\nHeraskevych meanwhile told the BBC that being banned only left him feeling \"emptiness.\"\n\n\"Yesterday and before yesterday I was training good. I could be among the medallists for this event, but suddenly because of some interpretation of the rules that I do not agree with, I am not able to compete,\" he said.\n\n\"Expression guidelines - what do you consider as expression? Many others here in this arena have helmets with different colours and I believe that is also a kind of expression.\n\n\"Some others had national symbols, that is also expression. For some reason, their helmets weren't checked and they were allowed to compete but I am not.\n\n\"I believe they [those who have fallen] deserve to be here because of their sacrifice. I want to honour them and their families.\"\n\nHeraskevych's international team mates showed their support throughout Thursday's competition in Italy.\n\nAlpine skier Dmytro Shepiuk displayed a note reading \"Ukrainian heroes with us\" after competing, while luger Olena Smaha also voiced support for Heraskevych wearing a glove reading: \"Remembrance is not a violation.\"\n\nUkraine president Volodymyr Zelensky accused the IOC of \"playing into the hands of the Russian aggressor\" after Heraskevych's disqualification\n\n\"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors,\" he wrote on X, external.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Nike's ACG brand resurges at 2026 Winter Olympics, driving social media buzz as Team USA athletes don the gear, boosting its market presence.",
    "fullText": "Sportswear giant Nike is seeking a golden moment at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Nike ACG logo, short for All Conditions Gear, is on the chests of Team USA athletes at the Winter Games. Nike is using the stage to relaunch its 37-year-old outdoor performance gear brand.\n\nThe effort is gaining traction online as Team USA racks up medals.\n\nNike unveiled the Team USA collection on January 28, and it's been having a moment on social media as athletes don the gear at the games. Between January 30 and the February 6 opening ceremony in Milan, conversations on X mentioning ACG and the Olympics increased by 273%, data analytics firm PeakMetrics told Business Insider.\n\nGoogle searches for \"Nike ACG\" also spiked during the first week of February, then hit a new peak this week with the Olympic Games underway, according to Google Trends.\n\nACG debuted in 1989 as a brand designed for trail running and hiking. Unlike brands like Air Jordan, it remained a niche collection that generated little revenue for Nike. As streetwear styles like gorpcore have taken off in the 2020s, the timing of a revival lines up with mainstream fashion. On the performance side, Nike defines itself as a brand for all outdoor athletes.\n\nThe Olympics sponsorship goes beyond Team USA, with Nike tapping Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner to star in an ACG campaign. The Instagram post featuring Skinner in a custom look garnered nearly 200,000 likes, and ACG's following on the app has grown to more than 48,000 since launching on February 2.\n\nThe collection includes outerwear, base layers, and shoes designed for trail racing and hiking — all of which can be spotted on Team USA throughout the Olympics.\n\nNike's push to outfit Olympic athletes should look familiar to anyone paying attention to CEO Elliott Hill's vision for the company. The Nike boss has put sports performance gear at the center of the brand's mission — a pivot from the lifestyle path Nike was on before Hill took the helm in October 2024.\n\nIn a testament to that strategy, women athletes were the stars of Nike's big return to the Super Bowl last year with its first ad in the game in 27 years. The company has also restructured internally and reformatted its stores to focus on sports.\n\nThe plan is coming into shape in the outdoor space. Nike has plans to open the first stand-alone ACG store in Beijing in February.\n\n\"ACG has the foundation to shape the future of outdoor performance while pushing into spaces that feel fresh and unexpected,\" Scott LeClair, vice president and general manager of ACG, said in a January press release.\"It is going to be a fun ride.\"",

    "description": "Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid overshared at the Winter Olympics with his infidelity confession. It's an example of how Gen Z has taken over the games.",
    "fullText": "Can you remember the last time a bronze medalist became the big story out of an Olympic event? Here's one for you: During his post-race interview, Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid didn't talk about the run he'd completed, which earned him the bronze medal in men's biathlon. Instead, he chose to tell the world about how he cheated on his ex-girlfriend.\n\n\"I told her a week ago. And it's been the worst week of my life,\" Lægreid told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. \"Sports has taken a bit of a back seat these past couple of days. Yeah, I wish I could share this with her.\"\n\nLægreid later apologized to the gold medalist and his ex-girlfriend, saying he deeply regretted sharing about his breakup, in a statement through the Norwegian Olympic team. He didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHis impulse, however, is a particularly Gen Z one. Was it a public display of accountability? Maybe. Was it classic oversharing at work? Definitely.\n\nGen Z has been in the Olympics since 2016, but this winter feels like the first Olympics where they are truly dominating the competition. The median age of Team USA at this year's games is about 28. In banner sports like figure skating and snowboarding, the median age is closer to 23. The Gen Z energy is undeniable in how these athletes conduct themselves on the world stage. Whether it's oversharing about their relationships, speaking out on politics, or using AI in performance, it's the Gen Z Olympics, and we're just watching it.\n\nSome of Team USA's most high-profile athletes are Gen Zers. Skating's \"Quad God\" Ilia Malinin, 21, shares the same name as one of the main characters on the gay hockey romance show \"Heated Rivalry,\" a favorite of Gen Z lookalike competitions. On the women's side, does anyone look more Gen Z than alt-girl figure skater Alysa Liu? With skunk stripe hair, tooth gems, and a frenulum piercing, she reps the alt scene that's making a comeback with the youth.\n\nThen there's Liu's teammate Amber Glenn, whose career follows Gen Z's tendency toward late blooming. She's making her Olympic debut at 26, which is slightly older than the typical age for female figure skaters. Liu and Isabeau Levito — the third US women's figure skating teammate — are 20 and 18 years old, respectively.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be Gen Z without a dash of political engagement and a public statement. Glenn, who is openly pansexual, directly addressed discrimination against the queer community under President Trump at a press conference on Feb. 4.\n\n\"I hope that I can use my platform and my voice throughout these Games to try to encourage people to stay strong,\" Glenn told reporters.\n\nWhen asked about the turmoil around ICE at a different press conference, members of the US ski team didn't shy away from voicing their opinions, either. Hunter Hess, 27, talked about the \"mixed emotions\" of repping the US while ICE raids were happening at home.\n\n\"There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.,\" Hess said.\n\nThe Olympics aren't untouched by AI either — a Czech ice dancing pair used a music mix that was half AI-generated for their rhythm dance. It's also not the first time that these skaters, who are 19 and 22 years old, have used AI music for a routine, which at least shows they're pretty LLM-native and the Olympic Committee is okay with it.\n\nIf that grinds your gears a little, just be thankful Gen Alpha hasn't hit the scene yet. Can you imagine how many celebratory 6-7s we'll be subject to?",

    "fullText": "For some years, it has been said, Great Britain has been punching above its weight in winter sports.\n\nNo ice track, few snowy mountains, and yet world champions, X Games medallists and World Cup podium finishes aplenty.\n\nBut right now, those punches are coming in the opposite direction - and they feel heavy.\n\nMany expected Team GB to be on the medal table by now, with at least three, perhaps four medals on the board. Instead, the total remains at zero.\n\nThere have been three agonising fourth-place finishes for freestyle skier Kirsty Muir, snowboarder Mia Brookes, and curlers Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, while a solitary error cost figure skaters Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson dearly when they had been battling for a bronze in the ice dance.\n\nBut it has demonstrated just how tight the margins are.\n\nTake Muir, for example. Just 0.41 of a point was the difference between bronze and fourth place in the slopestyle.\n\nHad she not squatted on a landing on her final run, she would have made the podium.\n\nBrookes, meanwhile, knew she needed to go huge on her final big air run for a chance of a medal - and so she did.\n\nShe landed a competition-first backside 1620 trick - featuring four-and-a-half rotations - but over-rotated at the very last moment.\n\nHad she landed it cleanly, she would have won a medal.\n\nSometimes, those fine margins work in Great Britain's favour. Twelve years ago at the Sochi Games, snowboarder Jenny Jones won bronze - Team GB's first Olympic medal on snow - in the slopestyle by just 0.25 of a point.\n\n\"I could have very much been in fourth,\" Jones told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The girl who came fourth, she did a bigger trick than me, but she dragged her hand. On the day, I had done it cleaner. On any other day, she might have beaten me.\n\n\"There's lots more going on with the Olympics, mentally. It is that psychological element, it's a mindset.\n\n\"They are all so capable, and they can do these things, but it is about who has got that mental advantage on the day.\n\n\"We should not be disappointed at all in our athletes, we should be celebrating how well they are doing on a world stage. We have so much more to look forward to.\"\n\nHow British skeleton came back fighting after 2022\n\n'Several versions of success' - but women's curlers dream of medal\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nBritain's best medal haul from a Winter Games is five - at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 - but before the Games, UK Sport said up to eight medals could be won.\n\nWhile eight now looks like it could be a stretch, a record-breaking Games is still on the cards, and Dame Katherine Grainger, chair of the British Olympic Association, says \"questions will be asked\" if that is not achieved - particularly given the £25.5m UK Sport has ploughed into Olympic winter sports over the last four years.\n\n\"Because it's public money, there's a responsibility for all of us to make sure the money that goes in is paid back,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We want to see great performances, inspirational performances, and that there's good value for money. I think the results will be brilliant and it will justify the investment.\n\n\"We know the potential is to attain a record number of medals, and if that potential is not achieved then we have a responsibility across all of us to understand where that went wrong.\n\n\"That potential is very real. There rightly will be questions if we do not achieve that.\"\n\nIt is too early to have those conversations, because all is not lost.\n\nTeam GB has plenty of medal chances still to come - and this is where we might see them.\n\nCompetition dates: 12 February (men's heats one and two), 13 February (men's heats three and four), 15 February (mixed team).\n\nMatt Weston is in sublime form and leads the men's skeleton after two of four races.\n\nHe's a two-time world champion and won three successive overall World Cup titles between 2023 and 2026.\n\nHe won five of seven World Cup golds this season, picking up silver behind team-mate Marcus Wyatt in the other two.\n\nGB's Weston in prime position to win skeleton gold\n\nCompetition dates: 13 February (women's heats one and two), 14 February (women's heats three and four), 15 February (mixed team).\n\nTabby Stoecker finished in a top-three position in all six official women's training runs, including twice in top spot.\n\nShe has one World Cup victory to her name and, with Weston, has two World Championship silver medals to her name in the mixed team event.\n\nStoecker and Weston will likely team up again when the event makes its Olympic debut on Sunday.\n\nCompetition dates: 13 February (women's), 15 February (mixed team).\n\nCharlotte Bankes was crowned world champion in 2021 and won the mixed team title two years later with British team-mate Huw Nightingale.\n\nShe has twice won the Crystal Globe - the overall World Cup title - and finished second in the standings in 2024 and 2025, the latter season curtailed by a broken collarbone.\n\nShe won her first race since returning from injury in January.\n\nSport: Freestyle skiing (halfpipe)\n\nCompetition dates: 19 February (qualifying), 21 February (finals).\n\nZoe Atkin is the reigning halfpipe world champion.\n\nShe has achieved three podium finishes from three starts on the World Cup circuit this season, including a gold.\n\nShe also won gold at the recent X Games.\n\nSport: Snowboarding (slopestyle)\n\nCompetition dates: 16 February (qualifying), 17 February (finals)\n\nMia Brookes came so close to a medal in the big air but has an arguably better chance in her preferred slopestyle.\n\nIn 2023, she became the youngest world champion in snowboarding history at the age of 16 with slopestyle gold.\n\nShe has won back-to-back big air Crystal Globes and won World Cup gold in December, as well as slopestyle gold and big air bronze at the recent X Games.\n\nSport: Freestyle skiing (big air)\n\nCompetition dates: 14 February (qualifying), 16 February (finals)\n\nKirsty Muir was devastated after missing out on a slopestyle medal but another shot is coming her way in the big air.\n\nShe is a two-time World Cup gold medallist, her second coming in the big air in Secret Garden, China, in November.\n\nAt the recent X Games in Aspen she won slopestyle gold and big air silver.\n\nCompetition dates: 11-22 February\n\nBruce Mouat's men's rink are the curling world champions, having also won the title in 2023.\n\nThey won three successive European crowns between 2021 and 2023, and silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nOn Wednesday, they beat China 9-4 in their opening match against China.\n\nKeep an eye out for Brad Hall's two-man and four-man sleds in the men's bobsleigh.\n\nThey have been no stranger to World Cup podiums in recent years and get their campaigns under way on 16 February (two-man) and 21 February (four-man).\n\nAt the curling, Jen Dodds will hope to brush off the disappointment of the mixed doubles with Team Morrison in the women's event, as they look to defend the gold medal won by Eve Muirhead's women's team in Beijing.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Matt Weston underlined his status as the world's best skeleton pilot by setting the track record on his way to taking a significant halfway lead at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe two-time world champion - Team GB's biggest medal hope in Milan-Cortina -put down a statement second run to open an advantage of 0.30 seconds over the field, with two medal-deciding runs to come on Friday.\n\nWeston was the only slider under 56 seconds as he clocked 55.88secs in heat two, to add to his 56.21secs in run one on the new Cortina sliding track.\n\nAfter a frustrating opening run, which began with a costly bump against the wall near the top of the track, Weston was clearly annoyed with his performance.\n\nBut, under pressure from two German sliders, he tidied up those errors with a slick and highly impressive second run, shaving 0.33secs off his opening effort, to give him an overall time of one minute 52.09secs.\n\n\"I was quite annoyed after the first run. I tried to be a bit too relaxed because I tried to over-compensate for race-day nerves,\" Weston said.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy [to be the overnight leader] but I take every run as run one. I will completely reset myself, switch off for a bit and then re-focus on Friday.\"\n\nGiven skeleton medals are often decided by hundredths of a second, Weston's fist pumps at the end of his second run were not only a sign of his elation at a cleaner run, but also marking the significance of his advantage.\n\nCompatriot Marcus Wyatt sits seventh with a combined time of 1:53.21 - 0.66secs outside of the medal places.\n\nWyatt, 34, was also a strong medal contender coming into the Games but has struggled on the technical Cortina track and a podium-finish already seems like a tough ask.\n\nAxel Jungk, silver medallist in Beijing four years ago, is in second place with a time of 1:52.39 while fellow German and defending Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer is third with 1:52.55.\n\nThe final two heats will take be shown live on the BBC from 18:30 GMT on Friday with all four run times added together to give an overall result.\n\nWeston arrived in Cortina as Team GB's best hope of a gold medal but now has the added pressure that he is likely to be chasing a first medal of these Games for the British team following a series of misses for the nation's other hopefuls.\n\nHe has been the dominant slider of recent seasons on the global stage, claiming five race wins and two further podium finishes this season as he won a third successive World Cup title.\n\n\"I have taught myself to love the pressure and love the expectation I have on my shoulders,\" Weston said.\n\n\"I didn't like it when I first had success, but now I have turned it into fire that I can go out and give my best.\"\n\nThe build-up to the Olympic event was dominated by 'helmet-gate' - with the British team hoping to a wear a new design in Italy.\n\nThe helmet was banned by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Foundation (IBSF) - who said it did not comply with rules around shape as the back of the helmet protrudes, giving an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nThe British team lost an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to overturn the decision, meaning they could not wear them at the Games.\n\nThe athletes said they were unphased by the issue and pointed out that all of their success this season has come with the old helmets.\n\nGB have long been a dominant force in skeleton, winning medals at every Games since the sport was reinstated to the programme in 2002.\n\nThat was until 2022, when Team GB failed to win a medal in what was a disappointing Olympic campaign in Beijing.\n\nWeston's 15th-place finish was the highest of the four British athletes competing on the Yanqing track with Wyatt coming 16th.\n\nWeston thought about quitting the sport after that but four years later looks primed to fulfil his promise on the Olympic stage.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Follow our live coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nChloe Kim, the snowboarder who has been setting the bar high over the years, will attempt her third gold medal on Thursday in hopes of continuing her strong legacy. The U.S. and Canadian hockey teams will take the ice indoors as the men begin their tournaments and return to Olympic action for the first time since 2014.\n\nWhile Norway leads the gold medal count with seven of the 13, the United States is up to four gold medals (seven total) so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count on Day 6 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nLet’s take a look at everything to watch today.\n\nTime: 7 a.m. ET, 1 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The women’s 10km interval start freestyle brings another good chance for Diggins, the American star in her final season, to win a medal. She has several World Cup wins over 10 kilometers and was the world champion in 2023.\n\nTime: Canada at 10:40 a.m. ET, 4:40 p.m. in Italy; U.S. at 3:10 p.m. ET, 9:10 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: American and Canadian NHL stars return to the Olympic ice for the first time since the 2014 Sochi Games. Canada opens against the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, while the U.S. takes on Latvia in the nightcap. Two other games Thursday: Switzerland-France at 6:10 a.m. ET and Germany-Denmark at 3:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTime: 1:30 p.m. ET, 7:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Kim will be chasing a third gold medal, and the competition will be chasing her. The key question will be whether she lands her most technically ambitious runs under Olympic pressure and how close the field can push her to perform at her best, as riders attempt to shorten the gap. Even when Kim isn’t perfect, her scoring ceiling often forces competitors to take bigger risks, setting up a final that could hinge on execution and nerve as much as difficulty.\n\nTimes: 3:05 a.m. (women), 8:05 a.m. (men) and 1:05 p.m. (women) ET; 9:05 a.m., 2:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The U.S. and Canada women make their debut in the morning session. The Americans are up again in the evening session. Great Britain vs. Sweden highlights the afternoon men’s session.\n\nTimes: 3:30 a.m. ET; 9:30 a.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: The opening two heats will set the tone for a race where hundredths of a second can define medal hopes. With athletes making their first Olympic runs down the track, early consistency and clean starts will be crucial, especially as sliders balance aggression with control on one of the fastest courses in the world. Pressure will likely be on medal favorites to avoid mistakes while leaving little margin for recovery heading into the final runs, as Heats 1 and 2 will separate the good and great.\n\nTimes: Qualification No. 2 at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 6:15 a.m. ET, 12:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Demanding combinations of speed, aerial difficulty and technical precision will be tested as qualifiers kick off. The event rewards skiers who can maintain clean, controlled turns while attacking the course with aggression and executing high-difficulty jumps, so expect the competition to hinge on how athletes balance speed with form, as even small mistakes in the bumps or landings can swing scores dramatically. With judging split among turns, air and time, the event often produces tight finishes and momentum swings as finalists try to deliver high-risk runs under pressure.\n\nTimes: Qualification at 4 a.m. ET, 10 a.m. in Italy; final at 7:45 a.m. ET, 1:45 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Strategy, positioning and clean starts are often just as important as raw speed, as riders jostle for lanes and try to avoid crashes that can quickly eliminate medal favorites. The knockout format adds another layer of pressure, forcing competitors to balance aggression with control while navigating traffic at high speeds, making snowboard cross one of the Games’ most volatile and dramatic events. Keep an eye on USA’s Nick Baumgartner, Australia’s Adam Lambert, Austria’s Alessandro Hämmerle and Canada’s Éliot Grondin.\n\nTime: 10:30 a.m. ET, 4:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Norway’s Ragne Wiklund, Canada’s Isabelle Weidemann and Joy Beune of the Netherlands are among the best in the women’s long-distance race. Italy’s Francesca Lollobrigida is the reigning world champion, giving the host nation a medal hopeful. Dutch great Irene Schouten, the defending Olympic champion, has since retired.\n\nTime: 12:30 p.m. ET, 6:30 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: Germany and Austria lead the field after strong individual results, but one misstep or sloppy transition can swing the podium. Keep an eye on Germany and Austria’s consistency, which earned them a lead so far. Star power and making every run and handoff will be critical, but they won’t necessarily carry each team to victory.\n\nTime: 2:15 p.m. ET, 8:15 p.m. in Italy\n\nTV: Peacock\n\nWhat to watch for: It could be a big day for North America here, with Americans Corinne Stoddard and Kristen Santos-Griswold and Canadians William Dandjinou, Steven Dubois and Courtney Sarault all among the medal contenders. Pietro Sighel gives Italy a medal shot in the men’s 1,000. Two-time world champion Xandra Velzeboer of the Netherlands is the name to beat in the women’s 500.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nOlympics, Global Sports, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHockey at the 2026 Milan Olympics has started.\n\nThe women's matches commenced on Thursday, February 5th, with a triple-header. Meanwhile, the men's competitions began six days later.\n\nThe United States and Canada are favored to be the top teams in both fields, with superstars spread across these rosters.\n\nAs the preliminary round shifts to the knockout stage, The Sporting News has you covered with all the details you need to know on how the Olympic hockey tournament format works below.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nAt the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics, the men's and women's ice hockey tournaments use distinct group-stage formats before transitioning to single-elimination knockout phases.\n\nBoth tournaments conform to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) point system: three points are awarded for a regulation victory, two points for an overtime or shootout victory, and one point for an overtime or shootout defeat.\n\nThe men's tournament, featuring NHL players for the first time since 2014, consists of three groups of four teams each.\n\nThe twelve teams are divided into three evenly structured groups. Following the round-robin phase, the four leading teams (comprising three group winners and the best runner-up) receive byes to the quarterfinals. The remaining eight teams must compete in a qualification playoff game to secure the final four spots in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe women's tournament uses a tiered \"power-seeding\" format to create more competitive matchups in the early rounds.\n\nThe ten teams are allocated based on world ranking. Group A comprises the top five seeds, all of whom automatically advance to the quarterfinals regardless of their preliminary records. Conversely, Group B includes the lower five seeds, with only the top three teams from this group progressing further.\n\nKnockout stage: Feb. 16-Feb. 20\n\nKnockout stage: Feb. 13-Feb. 16",

    "fullText": "Wednesday was a busy day for U.S athletes at the Milan Cortina Olympics as Team USA doubled its gold-medal tally.\n\nMeanwhile, injured snowboarder Chloe Kim laid to rest any notion that she's anything but the gold-medal favorite. Madison Chock and Evan Bates likely finished their careers on the podium. And the jilted lover of the unfaithful Norwegian biathlete has responded.\n\nHere are five of the top stories from Day 5 of the Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nIf you didn't know Jordan Stolz's name before, he introduced himself to the wider world on Wednesday.\n\nThe 21-year-old U.S. speedskater who's the best in the sport made his Olympics debut in dramatic fashion. Stolz trailed Jenning de Boo of the Netherlands in the final lap of their 1,000-meter race and appeared at risk of an upset loss.\n\nBut he chased de Boo down on the back stretch, then sprinted past him on the final turn as if propelled out of a slingshot to overtake the Dutch skater with the fastest time of the day at 106.28, a new Olympic record. Stolz made up a deficit of nearly a full second on the final lap to secure the win.\n\nA NEW SPEED SKATING STANDARD. 💪\n\nJordan Stolz wins GOLD with a men's 1000m #WinterOlympics RECORD. pic.twitter.com/qW3DSj2vP0\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nStolz's time survived the final race of the competition, and the world-record holder in the 1,000 meters is now the Olympic record holder and a gold medalist. De Boo took silver, and China's Ning Zhongyan won bronze.\n\nStolz is just getting started at Milan Cortina. He has a realistic shot at leaving the Games with four gold medals. He's also slated to compete at 500 meters (Saturday), 1,500 meters (Feb. 19) and in the mass start event slated to close speedskating competition on Feb. 21.\n\nIt's not the color they were targeting. But Madison Chock and Evan Bates finally have Olympic medals of their own.\n\nThe veteran U.S. ice dancers skated second to last in Wednesday's free dance and executed a performance worthy of gold-medal contention.\n\nSimply BEAUTIFUL. This is what 15 years of skating together looks like. 😍 pic.twitter.com/UQhpVEBB90\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nBut France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron entered Wednesday with a slim lead of 0.46 points after edging the U.S. couple in Monday's rhythm dance.\n\nAnd they delivered a brilliant performance of their own to edge Chock and Bates with a total score of 225.82 to secure the gold medal.\n\nLaurence Fournier Beaudry ganó la medalla de oro en danza sobre hielo en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno de Milán-Cortina 2026, junto a su pareja Guillaume Cizeron. 🥇⛸️#PatinajeArtistico pic.twitter.com/XFut3HGhrI\n\n— Bastian C (@basdc68) February 11, 2026\n\nChock and Bates won silver with a combined score of 224.39, 1.43 points behind the gold-medal winners. Canada's Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier won bronze with a score of 217.74.\n\nThe individual Olympic medal was the final item on the résumé for Chock and Bates, who have been partners on the ice for 15 years and married since 2024. They've won two Olympic gold medals in team competition, including from Sunday night. And they entered the Milan Cortina Games with three consecutive world championships.\n\nWednesday's performance was expected to be their last in competition. If so, they'll conclude their decorated careers with two more Olympic medals from Milan Cortina.\n\nChloe Kim declared on Jan. 13 that she was \"good to go\" for the Olympics despite sustaining a torn left labrum in training just days earlier.\n\nIt turns out that she was right. The two-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe made her Milan Cortina debut in qualifying on Wednesday. As stated, she's good to go.\n\nKim laid down a monster score of 90.25 on her first of two runs.\n\nTwo-time Gold medalist Chloe Kim WOWS with a huge first run in halfpipe qualifying. 😮‍💨🇺🇸\n\n📺 Peacock | #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/x9sIIICdEg\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nThat score stood at the end of the day as the best by nearly three points. Japan's Sara Shimizu finished second with an 87.5, and Kim's U.S. teammate Maddie Mastro finished third with an 86.\n\nThe scores don't carry over to Thursday's final, where each rider will have three runs to lay down the best score of the day. But Kim erased any doubt that her injury has made her anything but the favorite to secure her third consecutive Olympic gold medal and the sixth in seven Games in the event for the U.S.\n\nIt was a banner day for the U.S. in women's moguls competition. All four American competitors advanced to Wednesday's final. Two of them finished on the podium with gold and silver medals.\n\nLiz Lemley finished with gold thanks to a dominant performance that secured a score of 83.20, well clear of any of the skiers before her.\n\nLiz Lemley is as GOOD AS GOLD in her #WinterOlympics debut. 💪 pic.twitter.com/vTKIwtAsfW\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nHer teammate Jaelin Kauf competed after her and posted an 80.77 as the only other competitor to crack 80 points.\n\nJaelin Kauf secures BACK-TO-BACK SILVER in women's moguls at the #WinterOlympics! 🥈 pic.twitter.com/hCMFfHPbZ6\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nNeither of their positions were secure until reigning Australian Olympic gold medalist Jakara Anthony competed. But Anthony fell on her final run and finished in eighth place, ensuring that Lemley and Kauf would claim gold and silver.\n\nFrance's Perrine Laffont won bronze with a score of 78. Japan's Hinako Tomitaka matched Laffont's 78, but finished excruciatingly off the podium in fourth place due to a tiebreaker.\n\nIt was clear from reports that Lindsey Vonn's broken leg was no simple fracture.\n\nVonn provided some insight on Wednesday hammering that point home. In her second update since her devastating injury crash in Sunday's alpine downhill competition, Vonn posted on Instagram that she'd undergone a third surgery to repair her fractured left tibia. She also shared a picture from her hospital bed demonstrating just how serious her injury is.\n\nVonn's left leg is placed in what appears to be an external fixator, a brace that uses pins, wires and bars to stabilize severely fractured bones. She previously announced that she'd sustained a complex fracture, which Yale medicine defines as \"when the bone breaks into bits and pieces, when the soft tissue surrounding the bone is severely damaged, or when the patient has other illnesses or injuries that complicate treatment and healing.\"\n\nIt's not clear if Vonn will require more procedures to rebuild her broken leg. But she clearly has a difficult road to recovery.\n\nVonn expressed optimism in her recovery while giving a thumbs up alongside a note of gratitude to her medical team and supporters and well wishes for Team USA at the Olympics.\n\n\"I had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful,\" Vonn wrote. \"Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I’m making progress and while it is slow, I know I’ll be ok.\"\n\nNBC's drone pilots are doing outstanding work getting third-person shots of athletes barreling down the halfpipe, racing on the downhill course and sledding through the twists and turns of the luge track. They also appear to be having a good time.\n\nOn Wednesday, they offered up this gem simulating a first-person view of what it might look like to take on the Milan Cortina moguls course.\n\nWait for it...😍 pic.twitter.com/gDPuXK4O2V\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 11, 2026\n\nWe have an update on the saga of the cheating Norwegian biathlete. He cheated in love, not in competition, to be clear.\n\nIn case you missed it, Sturla Holm Lægreid won bronze in the 20km biathlon on Tuesday, then made the questionable decision to admit — in tears — in his post-race interview that he cheated on his girlfriend and that he'd hoped to win her back.\n\nThe girlfriend has now weighed in. Make that the ex-girlfriend. She understandably does not sound interested in Lægreid's post-infidelity overtures.\n\nThe girlfriend — who chose to remain anonymous — provided this response to Norwegian tabloid VG:\n\n“It’s hard to forgive,\" she wrote. \"Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world. ... I did not choose to be put in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it. We have had contact, and he is aware of my opinions on this.”\n\nHere's the initial interview that sparked one of the strangest story of these Games:\n\nSå ikke helt denne komme. Tidenes mest absurde medaljeintervju. 🫣 pic.twitter.com/fFwJ1B0vCO\n\n— Daniel Vassbund (@Smoothedan) February 10, 2026\n\n\"There's someone I wanted to share it with who might not be watching,\" he said, via BBC translation, fighting back tears.\"Six months ago I met the love of my life — the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her.\"\n\nIt sounds like her eyes are looking elsewhere.",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat recovered from his Winter Olympics mixed doubles disappointment in some style, delivering an accomplished display to lead his Team GB men's rink to a 9-4 victory in their opening match against China.\n\nLittle more than 24 hours earlier, Mouat and Jen Dodds had faltered in the bronze-medal match in the Cortina Curling Stadium for the second successive Games.\n\nBut the 31-year-old showed why he is considered one of the world's best, as the gold-medal favourites started strongly in their attempt to upgrade the silver they won in Beijing four years ago.\n\nThe Scots, world champions in three of the past five years, traded points with China in the opening two ends, before a classily compiled three in the third cleaved open an advantage that they would never cede.\n\nThey led 5-2 at the break, then a magnificent double take-out and composed closing throw by Mouat extended the advantage to 8-3 after seven.\n\nA judicious set of throws limited the Chinese to one in the eighth but GB closed down the ninth end, taking one to force a round of handshakes with an end to spare.\n\nIt always looked like being a mismatch and so it proved.

    "title": "Winter Olympics 2026: A superstar in Europe, maybe now America will know Jordan Stolz after winning gold in 1000",
    "description": "Stolz collected his first of multiple expected golds at the Milan Cortina Olympics.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — When American speedskating phenom Jordan Stolz and his family went out to eat while in the Netherlands for a World Cup event a few months ago, they didn’t have the luxury of choosing a restaurant for the type of food it served.\n\nTheir main priority was finding a secluded spot in a quiet part of town where Stolz could enjoy a meal in peace without getting recognized.\n\nAlmost immediately after the Stolzes sat down, a group of men walked by their table and did a double take.\n\n“Are you Jordan?” one of them asked.\n\nStolz tried to say no, but smirks and giggles from his family members gave him away. Before long, more restaurantgoers approached the table to say hello to Stolz or to ask him to pose for a picture. He barely had time to shovel food into his mouth between interruptions.\n\n“It’s crazy over there,” said Dirk Stolz, Jordan’s father. “Anywhere we go, everybody knows him.”\n\nSince rocketing onto the global speedskating scene three years ago, Stolz has become the rare athlete more famous internationally than he is in his home country. The 21-year-old is a superstar in speedskating hotspots like the Netherlands, Norway and Germany, but he remains almost completely unknown across America and even in his home state of Wisconsin.\n\nStolz took a big step toward changing that Wednesday night in Milan when he shined in the first of his four races on the Olympic stage. The kid who learned to skate on his family’s backyard pond in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, overwhelmed a world-class field in the men’s 1,000 meters to win his first Olympic gold medal.\n\nStolz destroyed the Olympic record by nearly a second, posting a 1:06.28.\n\nIt’s always reckless to guarantee gold medals in a pressure-packed setting like the Olympics, but it would have been a massive surprise to see any other skater besides Stolz win the men’s 1,000. He’s not just the world record holder in this event. He last lost a World Cup race at this distance in November 2023.\n\nWhile Stolz is also a clear favorite to win gold in the men’s 1,500 on February 19, his other two races pose a stiffer challenge. The high-intensity, fast-paced 500 features several sprinters who have beaten Stolz on the World Cup circuit this season. And the chaotic mass start event brings an element of randomness with the whole field racing shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nIf Stolz can pile up medals over the next 10 days, it could be life-changing for him and huge for the notoriety of his sport in the U.S. Already, Stolz has landed endorsement deals with the likes of Hershey’s and Honda and gained the backing of NBC. He starred alongside Glen Powell in a hilarious commercial promoting NBC airing the Winter Games.\n\nFor Stolz, his first Olympic gold medal is a major milestone on a journey that began with watching the charismatic Apolo Anton Ohno at the 2010 Vancouver Games. He has chased Olympic glory ever since, snapping at the heels of America's fastest speedskaters by age l6 and then coming for the rest of the world a year or two later.\n\nJane Stolz recalls a ticket scanner initially denying her entry the first time her son competed at the World Championships three years ago. No matter how many times she tried, her digital ticket wouldn’t scan properly.\n\nThen Jordan won his first global title in the 500. And the 1,000. And the 1,500.\n\n“By the end of the week, I didn’t have to worry about showing tickets anymore,” Jane said with a laugh. “They all knew who we were.”\n\nThe more races Stolz has won and records he has broken, the more well known he becomes. He seldom finishes a meal in the speedskating-obsessed Netherlands without interruptions. He rarely makes it to his gate at the airport in Amsterdam without fulfilling a request for a picture or autograph.\n\nStolz’s parents receive so much airtime when he races that they’ve become famous-adjacent among speedskating fans. Jane remembers two elderly women approaching her at an overseas coffee shop when she was jet-lagged and exhausted. At first, Jane thought they needed help. Then they asked her, “Are you Jordan’s mom?”\n\nDirk and Jane know a Wisconsin couple that emigrated from the Netherlands and still watches Dutch TV regularly.\n\n“They tell us they see us and Jordan on the evening news all the time,” Jane said.\n\nThe contrast is striking compared to Stolz’s anonymity in his home country, especially among those not old enough to remember Eric Heiden’s five gold medals at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980. The average Wisconsinite that Jane encounters isn’t guaranteed to know what speedskating is, let alone about the exploits of her son.\n\n“I’m like, you know, speedskating, where they go around in the oval?” Jane said. “They’re like, huh? I’m like, you know, Eric Heiden? They still have no clue.”\n\nNow is Stolz’s two weeks in the Olympic limelight back home, his best chance to elevate his own stature and his sport’s.\n\nSomewhere in America, there’s a kid with a backyard pond watching Olympic speedskating. And maybe he dreams of being the next Jordan Stolz.",

    "description": "Despite a lack of COVID-19 precautions implemented by the 2026 Winter Olympics organizers in Italy, some athletes, teams, and their loved ones are protecting themselves from airborne pathogens by masking and isolating.",
    "fullText": "Despite a lack of COVID-19 precautions implemented by the 2026 Winter Olympics organizers in Italy, some athletes, teams, and their loved ones are protecting themselves from airborne pathogens by masking and isolating.\n\nThese precautions were put in the spotlight last week before the games officially began when some members of the U.S. men’s and women’s cross-country ski team attended press conferences in respirators. Then, on the way to Friday’s opening ceremony, some Olympians sported respirators and other high-quality masks, protecting themselves from COVID-19 and other airborne pathogens that could affect their health or performances — or, if they developed Long COVID, their careers.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing as the virus continues to spread around the world unchecked, causing further death and disability. The virus has caused over 25 million excess deaths, while more than 400 million people have been affected by Long COVID.\n\nJust before the games started, two members of the Australian team’s staff tested positive for COVID-19 at a training facility in Italy, according to ABC News. Meanwhile, various outlets have reported that an “outbreak” of norovirus has affected many hockey teams in Italy. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) claimed there is “absolutely no outbreak” of that virus.\n\nIn interviews and press conferences, Olympians and their coaches have elaborated on the extent of precautionary measures some are taking at the games to avoid pathogens. Kristen Bourne, a coach of the U.S. women’s cross-country ski team, told Faster Skier that the team is staying in a separate, private hotel to avoid the Olympic village and members are wearing masks indoors. Some other teams are taking similar measures.\n\n“We have closed our hotel. We don’t want outsiders in, and we don’t want infections to come in,” Swedish cross-country ski team doctor Rickard Noberius told Expressen. “So, it’s just us and the family who run the hotel — and they have been given strict restrictions as well.” (Editor’s note: These quotes were translated from Swedish.)\n\nMany of these athletes are also taking precautions by isolating and masking around family members and friends — something disabled people, including those with Long COVID, have been doing since the beginning of the pandemic. Still, media outlets reporting on the precautions have shown their biases and incorrectly said the pandemic is over in a standard “back to normal” narrative.\n\nNPR wrote in the opening of an article on athletes’ COVID-19 precautions, “For most people, if not everyone, the pandemic days of masking are behind us.”\n\nIn social posts for the story, NPR also called the precautions “extreme,” despite millions of disabled and immunocompromised people around the world who continue to take COVID-19 precautions daily as SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens spread. Similarly, the Associated Press called Olympians taking precautions “worried” in a headline. The AP also framed prior Winter Olympics, like Beijing 2022, which did have mandatory COVID-19 precautions, as “sports prison.”\n\nThese framing choices have been criticized by many on social media as condescending and misleading, minimizing the very serious risks of COVID-19 and other pathogens that can cause long-term illness and disability.\n\nCOVID-19 has caused many Olympians and other athletes to miss important competitions and games in their careers; others have competed while actively infected. During the 2024 summer Olympics, runner Noah Lyles competed two days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 and collapsed at the end of a race. Long COVID experts have advised extreme rest during and after COVID-19 to help avoid the potential of Long COVID.\n\nOlympians, just like anyone, are at risk of Long COVID. Studies have shown that the risk of the disabling disease may increase with each SARS-CoV-2 infection and trigger or worsen diagnoses, including myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Professional basketball player Kristaps Porziņģis was diagnosed with POTS last year and it has  sidelined him for much of the season.\n\nOlympians, just like anyone, are at risk of Long COVID. Studies have shown that the risk of the disabling disease may increase with each SARS-CoV-2 infection and trigger or worsen diagnoses.\n\nThe Sick Times has also reported on elite athletes who have developed Long COVID. Athletes shared their stories about how the disease has put many of them on the bench and greatly affected their careers and finances. Research has found that the disease lowers VO2 max (the body’s ability to absorb oxygen), weakens lung muscles, and causes muscle fibers to die off after long bouts of exercise.\n\nOther research has shown that U.S. Marines, known for their high caliber of fitness, have also been heavily impacted by Long COVID. A 2024 study found that 25% of the Marine cohort developed the disease.\n\nNovie McCabe, from the U.S. women’s cross-country ski team, told Faster Skier last December that she’s experienced “mystery health challenges” for the past two years, alongside managing celiac disease and Hashimoto’s disease.\n\nShe told the outlet that doctors have said she likely has a “post-viral illness” and a “chronic fatigue type-thing,” potentially a reference to ME, a disabling neurological disease (as defined by the World Health Organization) with which many people with Long COVID have also been diagnosed. The disease has been called “chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)” in the past, but myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is preferred by many people with the disease. Sometimes it’s referred to as “ME/CFS.”\n\nA cardinal feature of ME is post-exertional malaise (PEM), in which a constellation of debilitating symptoms can worsen following physical, cognitive, or emotional exertion. These disabling symptoms may last days, weeks, or permanently alter someone’s health baseline. Research has found serious muscle abnormalities in people with ME and Long COVID.\n\n“I have taken a pretty cautious approach to training this year and just been trying to build back into it super slowly and give a lot of extra attention to rest and recovery,” McCabe told Faster Skier last year.\n\nThe 2026 games put a spotlight on how collective public health failures of governments and the IOC have made specific teams and athletes take their own precautions as the world continues to ignore the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many disabled and immunocompromised people, these athletes and teams are forced to put their health first, despite overwhelming stigma against masking and other COVID-19 precautions and despite the overwhelming research that shows the adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, also did not have any COVID-19 precautions for athletes or attendees. This lack of foresight during a surge of COVID that summer forced a group of Olympic volunteers to quit.\n\n“We want basic precautions, measures we’ve implemented…we know these work and are validated by science. Why aren’t they being used?” one volunteer told The Sick Times that summer.\n\nWe want basic precautions, measures we’ve implemented…we know these work and are validated by science.

    "description": "The 2022 Winter Olympics were a disaster for British skeleton - but they have bounced back with a vengeance since.",
    "fullText": "His maiden Olympics, at Beijing 2022, hadn't gone the way it was supposed to. Just months earlier, he had won a first skeleton World Cup gold and was a genuine medal contender.\n\nThe latest in a long line, too. British sliders - including two-time champion Lizzy Yarnold - had won a medal at every Winter Olympics since the sport was reinstated to the programme in 2002.\n\nBut 20 years later, that run had come to a disastrous end. Weston's 15th-place finish was the highest of the four British athletes competing on the Yanqing track.\n\nBlame was laid firmly on their equipment - a risk was taken with their sleds and \"it didn't pay off\".\n\n\"In this sport the fine margins are everything and you have to take risks to be the best, but sometimes that will come back to bite you and it came back to bite us at the biggest event of my career,\" Weston, 28, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself. As a child you think 'I want to be an Olympian' and that it's going to be the best experience of my life, but I came back and felt it wasn't how it was meant to be.\"\n\nFour years on, Weston is back at his second Olympics and things are very different - 'helmet-gate' aside.\n\nHe is a two-time world champion, a multiple World Cup gold medallist - and will have one of the sport's greats on his side when competition gets under way on Thursday.\n\nBecause when Weston was pondering his future, conversations were happening behind the scenes.\n\nMartins Dukurs - widely regarded as the greatest slider to ever take to the ice - became Great Britain's new coach.\n\nA six-time world champion with more than 60 World Cup victories to his name, Dukurs retired after the Beijing Games and his capture as a coach - alongside that of his own coach and sled designer Matthias Guggenberger - by the British team was a major coup.\n\n\"This is just a massive bonus to a good package that we already had, this is the icing on the cake,\" said Weston.\n\n\"Martins is the best ever at what he's done. His experience is invaluable.\"\n\nTeam-mate Marcus Wyatt added: \"[Dukurs] is almost bigger than skeleton.\n\n\"He is the GOAT [greatest of all time]. He's won more World Cups than some people have taken part in, he's really special and just to have him happy enough to coach us, it gives you so much more confidence in yourself.\"\n\nSo what was it about the British challenge that attracted Dukurs to the role?\n\n\"I saw that there was potential,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We needed fast results because we saw the athletes had lost a bit of confidence, and in professional sport confidence it is really important.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Beijing, the skeleton programme had a drop in UK Sport funding - from the £6.5m they received for the 2022 cycle, to an initial £4.8m for 2026 - though this later rose to £5.8m.\n\nIt was a blow after such huge success in the sport. No nation has won more Olympic skeleton medals than Great Britain's nine, an astounding feat given the country's lack of ice track - a push track at the University of Bath, shared with the bobsleigh team, their only practice space on home soil.\n\n\"This is what they've achieved without a track, it's actually amazing,\" said Dukurs.\n\n\"Any time I needed I was jumping on a sled, I was testing equipment, and unfortunately they don't have such opportunity.\"\n\nThe British squad have not let that count against them, though.\n\nIn addition to his two world titles, Weston also has three Crystal Globes - overall World Cup titles - to his name.\n\nWyatt has won four individual World Cups, while this season both he and Tabby Stoecker won overall bronze medals.\n\nAnd together Weston and Stoecker have won two World Championship silvers in the mixed team event, which will make its Olympic debut on the Cortina track.\n\nThe team's build-up to the Games has been overshadowed by a debate over new helmets they had been hoping to wear. They eventually lost their appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nBut they have not let it affect them, with Weston and Stoecker both topping multiple training runs.\n\nTeam GB skeleton helmet appeal dismissed by Cas\n\nSo why are Great Britain so good at skeleton?\n\nThe athletes all point to one specific weapon in their armoury - each other.\n\nWith no ice track, the British squad have had to find their advantage elsewhere and that has largely come in their camaraderie.\n\n\"We only get to slide down an ice track about 120-150 times a year. Each run is less than a minute, so you're looking at less than two hours actually doing the sport every year,\" said Wyatt.\n\n\"But if you talk to other athletes, learn from their experiences and share what you're doing, suddenly you've doubled, tripled, quadrupled your knowledge.\n\n\"The day before a race, I might be struggling on a corner, so I ask Matt: 'What are you doing on corner four?' He tells me, I try that, it works for me, and lo and behold when the race comes, I might beat him.\n\n\"That's fine, because he knows that next week when he's struggling somewhere else, I'll help him out and he might beat me.\"\n\nWeston added: \"On the track, [Wyatt's] the first person I want to beat, I'm the first person he wants to beat.\n\n\"But when we're training, when we're working stuff out, we work together so well, and I think that's what separates us apart [from the rest].\"\n\nBetween them, Weston and Wyatt won every men's World Cup this season - the first time one nation has done so.\n\nIt bodes well for the Winter Olympics, with the skeleton action getting under way on Thursday, and there is only one potential outcome in Weston's mind.\n\n\"My sights are set on gold. That's the only colour I want to come home with,\" he said.\n\n\"It sounds funny saying this as a two-time world champion, but I don't really feel like I've been able to put down what I really feel like I can.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

    "description": "There are several gold medal opportunities for the United States today in Italy.",
    "fullText": "The Winter Games have begun in Italy. From the rink to the slopes, a new generation of stars has emerged to chase gold. We’ll keep you connected to all of the thrilling moments and top stories as we track the medal race each day of the Games.\n\nThe United States is up to seven total medals so far in Italy, and will have several opportunities to add to that count in Day 5 of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nJordan Stoltz will attempt to continue his dominant run throughout speed skating in the 1,000 meters, and the women's double luge will have its first ever gold medal awarded at the Olympics later Wednesday. Madison Chock and Evan Bates are back in action with their final ice dancing event. Oh, and Chloe Kim will hit the halfpipe for the first time, too.\n\nHere are the top five things to watch on Wednesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics:\n\nIt’s time for Jordan Stoltz to take the ice in Italy. The Team USA speed skating star will open with the 1,000 meters on Wednesday, the event in which he already holds the world record. He made his Olympics debut in Beijing four years ago and finished only 14th in the 1,000 meters, though he’s widely considered a medal favorite every time he takes the ice in these games.\n\nBut the 1,000 meter is his best event. Stoltz has five wins at that distance already this season, and has won 14 races in a row in that distance on the World Cup level. Stoltz will also compete in the 500 meters, 1,500 meters and mass start.\n\nChloe Kim is ready for her first event in Italy. The top name in the sport will open her quest to become the first person to win three straight gold medals in the halfpipe, starting with qualifying Wednesday. Kim was 17 when she won gold in South Korea in 2018, and she backed it up in Beijing four years ago, too. But Kim is now dealing with a torn labrum, which she suffered during training in Switzerland.\n\nIf she can get through qualifying, the final of the women’s halfpipe is set for Thursday.\n\nThe women’s doubles luge was added to the Olympics for the first time this year after more than six decades on the men’s side. It’ll be up to Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby to lead the way for the United States.\n\nThe duo, who are the only American women’s pairing, won bronze at the first ever world championship back in 2022. They’ve looked good so far, too, with a top five time in five of their six training runs. But it’s Austria’s Selina Egle and Lara Kipp who are the favorites, as they both lead the World Cup standings and have won three training runs so far.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates will enter Wednesday’s ice dance free skate in second place, so they’ll have to rally a bit in order to pull off the gold medal. They trailed France’s Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron by less than half a point after the rhythm dance portion of the competition on Monday.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates with a STELLAR first-place ice dance performance to start off strong for Team USA! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/kk0O802JTr\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 6, 2026\n\nThe married couple are the reigning world champions in the event, and are just days removed from helping the U.S. win a second straight team gold medal. But the individual medal is the last piece they’ve been chasing after a fourth-place finish in Beijing.\n\nAll eyes will be on Ryan Cochran-Siegle when he hits the Super-G on Wednesday. He was the only American Alpine skier to win a medal at the Beijing Olympics when he won silver in the event four years ago.\n\nBut competition is stiff for Cochran-Siegle to improve on that finish this time around. Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt is the favorite in the event, with already two wins to his name this season. A trio of Austrians have dominated the World Cup season race, too, and Italy’s Giovanni Franzoni is a big name to watch.\n\nHe has his work cut out for him, but he is the only returning medalist from Beijing. That has to count for something.\n\n5:30 a.m.: Men’s final (USA Network)🏅\n\n8:15 a.m.: Women’s final (airs at 9:15 a.m. on USA Network)🏅\n\n1:05 p.m. Sweden vs. Italy, Canada vs. Germany, Czechia vs. USA (airs at 5 p.m. on CNBC), China vs. Great Britain\n\n1:30 p.m.: Finals (USA Network; NBC coverage begins at 2:15 p.m.)🏅\n\n8:15 a.m.*: Women’s final (USA Network)🏅\n*Light situation needs to be checked\n\n10:40 a.m.: Slovaki vs. Finland (USA Network)\n\n3:10 p.m.: Sweden vs. Italy (USA Network coverage begins at 3:25 p.m.)\n\n11 a.m.: Women’s run 1 (USA Network)\n\n11:50 a.m.: Men’s run 1 (USA Network)\n\n12:45 p.m.: Women’s run 2 (USA Network; NBC coverage begins at 12:55 p.m.)🏅\n\n6 p.m.: Men’s run 2 (USA Network)🏅\n\n3 a.m.: Men's ski jump (USA Network coverage begins at 4 a.m.)🏅\n\n7:45 a.m.: Men’s 10km cross-country ski (airs at 10 a.m. on USA Network)🏅 | Ogden wins first U.S. medal in 50 years\n\n4:30 a.m.: Women's qualifying (USA Network coverage begins at 4:45 a.m.)\n\n1:30 p.m.: Men's qualifying (NBC coverage begins at 1:40 p.m.)\n\n12:30 p.m.: Men’s final (airs at 1:15 p.m. on NBC)🏅",

    "fullText": "The United States have a lot of star power at the Olympic Winter Games in Milan. They include Mikaela Shiffrin, Jordan Stolz, Lindsey Vonn, Chloe Kim, and Ilya Malinin. However, on Tuesday, it was the American supporting cast that came away with Olympic hardware, and in the process made names for themselves that will bring them temporary fame.\n\nJacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan\n\nHeading into the slalom portion of the women’s team alpine combined, Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin were the heavy favourites, as they were the defending world champions and even had the lead as Johnson was the fastest women’s downhill skier of the event. However, it was Shiffrin who had a poor slalom run, and the Johnson/Shiffrin tandem shockingly finished in fourth place. The Americans still got on to the podium in the event as Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon and Paula Moltzan of Lakeville, Minnesota posted a third place time of 2:21.91 to beat Shiffrin and Johnson by six one-hundredths of a second.\n\nWhat we saw on Tuesday was a gigantic upset from American cross country skier Ben Ogden of Lebanon, New Hampshire. The odds of Ogden coming through with a medal was +6500 according to 3wiresports.com. However, it was Ogden that had the second fastest time in the men’s sprint, and was only behind the heavy favourite, Johannes Hesflot Klaebo of Norway. For Klaebo, it was his second Olympic gold in Milan, as he also was first in Saturday’s skiathlon.\n\nThe mixed doubles curling event came to completion on Tuesday, with the United States winning silver behind only Sweden. It ws a notable week for American curler Cory Thiesse of Duluth, Minnesota. Thiesse became the very first American female curler to win an Olympic medal. The only other American medal in Olympic curling came in 2018, when John Shuster of Duluth shocked the curling world with a win over Sweden in the gold medal final in the men’s event.\n\nThe native of Fairbanks, Alaska is now a two-time Olympic medalist in slopestyle. After winning gold four years ago in Beijing, Alex Hall won silver on Tuesday at the Livigno Snow Park. Hall had a score of 85.75 points, and was beaten by the slimmest of margins–0.53 points. The gold medalist was Norway’s Birk Ruud, the Olympic gold medalist from men’a big air skiing in Beijing.\n\nIt has been a tough time for the Sacramento Kings over the last month, as the Kings are losers of 13 straight games. However, Olympic bronze medalist Ashley Farquharson calls Sacramento home and was marvelous on Tuesday as she claimed an unexpected bronze in the women’s luge event. Faquharson had a four run time of 3:31.582.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympic Games: five medal Tuesday for Team USA appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Monica Aksamit won a Bronze medal in the 2016 Olympics with team USA. She says she had to go into debt to fund her dream and destroyed her credit score.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Monica Aksamit. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I ask people how much they thought I earned as a US Olympian, they always guess an amount far above what I actually got paid.\n\nDuring the years I was part of the US fencing team from 2016 to 2021, I made $300 a month. This was the pinnacle of my fencing career, and yet I wasn't making enough to cover my living expenses.\n\nBut this had always been my dream, and I had to pursue it at all costs.\n\nI'd been fencing since I was about 8. My mom, a Polish immigrant, had signed me up after a client of hers suggested she bring me along to a practice. He said there was a scholarship opportunity if I did well, and my mom was hooked.\n\nFencing was a great outlet for me during my parents' divorce. Most kids get yelled at for hitting other kids — I was being applauded for it.\n\nMy mom financially supported my fencing. She put herself into credit card debt to ensure we could pay for equipment, travel, practices, and tournaments.\n\nI remember her once telling one of my coaches that she couldn't afford to bring me to practices anymore. The coach told her to just pay what she could. He wanted me to chase this dream and saw potential. My road to the Olympics wouldn't have been possible without him.\n\nAs I got a bit older, I started winning competitions, and with that came prize money. My mom's sacrifice, the coach's generosity, and the prize money kept me pushing forward.\n\nAfter watching the 2004 Olympics in Greece, I became fixated on the idea of one day competing on the US Olympic fencing team. It was the first Olympic Games that my event, the women's saber, was added. Nowadays, they're a lot more lenient with adding events — but it wasn't like that then — it was a big deal.\n\nThat year, I sat on my grandparents' couch in Poland and watched, telling them one day, I'd become an Olympian. It was a crazy dream, and that time, my mom didn't necessarily think I'd achieve it, but she kept paving the way for me to get there.\n\nWhen I graduated from college in 2012, my main goal was to get to the Olympics. But now, I was an adult and had to fund it myself.\n\nI alone had to pay for a big portion of the competitions, travel, and all of my own living expenses. I stayed at home because there was no way I could afford to pursue my dream while paying rent.\n\nI worked endlessly as a fencing coach and a referee at tournaments. I handed out flyers for companies and took low-end modelling gigs.\n\nMy fencing club and those who contributed to my GoFundMe continued to financially support me along the way, helping fund my dream.\n\nIn 2016, I qualified for the US Olympic team. Team USA started covering all of my tournaments, training camps, and travel. But I was only given a monthly salary of $300.\n\nThere wasn't any way I could take on another job because what employer was going to let me take several weeks off throughout the year to train and compete?\n\nMy only option was to take out credit cards to fund what I needed to achieve my dream — car insurance, train travel into the city to train, food, bills, and any extras I did. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I didn't want money to be the reason I couldn't achieve what I had worked so long for.\n\nPeople are shocked when I tell them how much I made each month as an Olympian and how I went into debt to represent the US on an international stage.\n\nIt did eventually pay off. I took home a bronze medal at Rio in 2016, but I'm still paying off my credit cards from those years of training and competing with Team USA.\n\nAfter Rio, I put on a fundraiser to cover the costs of getting to Tokyo 2020, and people generously donated enough to go over my goal — it was the only way to fund my Olympic dreams as someone who didn't come from money.",

    "description": "Ilia Malinin, known as the \"Quad God,\" is one of Team USA's breakout figure skating stars of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics.",
    "fullText": "You may recognize US figure skater Ilia Malinin from his gravity-defying backflips and quadruple jumps.\n\nOr perhaps you know him simply as the \"Quad God.\"\n\nMalinin, 21, is a two-time world champion and one of Team USA's breakout figure skating stars of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nHere's what to know about Malinin's background and Olympic career.\n\nMalinin's parents, Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, were born in Russia and represented Uzbekistan at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano and the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nNow, they serve as his coaches.\n\nMalinin was born in Fairfax, Virginia, and began figure skating at 7 years old.\n\nMalinin's younger sister, Ellie \"Liza\" Beatrice Malinina, is also a competitive figure skater.\n\nHe trains in Reston, Virginia. When he's not figure skating, he's a student at the nearby George Mason University majoring in exploratory studies.\n\nMalinin is the first and only skater to ever land a quadruple axel in competition, and began using the nickname \"Quad God\" when he was 13 years old.\n\nMalinin helped Team USA secure the gold medal in the team figure skating competition on Sunday. He landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, but has yet to attempt a quadruple axel at the 2026 Olympics. While he had planned to execute a quadruple axel during the Team Event, he substituted a triple axel instead.\n\nMalinin has also included backflips in his Olympic routines — a feat with a complicated history.\n\nDuring the 1976 Olympics, American figure skater Terry Kubicka performed the first-ever backflip, but the International Skating Union banned the move shortly thereafter in 1977, saying it was too dangerous.\n\nIn 1998, French figure skater Surya Bonaly became the first Olympic figure skater to land a backflip on one blade during her free skate, but was penalized by the judges since the move was still illegal in competition.\n\nThe International Skating Union lifted the ban on backflips in 2024. During the Team Event this year, Malinin landed a backflip on one skate just as Bonaly had, but this time, it was permitted.\n\nMalinin is believed to be the highest-paid figure skater at the 2026 Olympics with an estimated income of $700,000 from sponsorships over the last year, Forbes reported.\n\nAccording to Malinin's website, his corporate partners include Coca-Cola, Samsung, Google, Xfinity, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Honda.\n\nHaving already won gold in the team competition, Malinin will skate in the individual Men's Short Program on February 10 and the individual Men's Free Skate on February 13.\n\nSee Business Insider's full guide to watching Olympic figure skating",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Julia Taubitz added a new chapter to Germany's Olympic luge dominance. Elina Bota made some history for Latvia.\n\nAnd Ashley Farquharson was moved to tears — after giving USA Luge just the seventh medal in its Olympic history.\n\nTaubitz rolled to the win in the women's singles race at the Milan Cortina Olympics, finishing her two-day, four-run strut to the gold in 3 minutes, 30.625 seconds — nearly a full second ahead of Bota, who got the silver.\n\nFarquharson got the bronze, the third singles medal ever for USA Luge at the Olympics and matching the best finish by an American women's slider. Chris Mazdzer got silver in men's singles at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, and Erin Hamlin got the women's bronze at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nThis time, it was Farquharson's turn.\n\nTaubitz got the 17th gold medal awarded in women's singles luge, and the 13th that went to a German slider.\n\nThe Olympic singles gold medal was the only thing missing on Taubitz's resume.\n\nShe's a two-time women's singles world champion, a five-time World Cup overall champion, a winner of more than 30 World Cup races and none of that takes into account how she has piled up medals as part of Germany's near-unbeatable team relays.\n\nAnd now, the biggest medal. The shiniest one, too. She's the Olympic champion, taking over that crown from now-retired German great Natalie Geisenberger, who won the last three gold medals.\n\nEmily Fischnaller was 12th for the Americans in 3:33.035, falling from fifth after three runs with some trouble in her final heat. Summer Britcher of the U.S., a two-time World Cup race winner this season and now a four-time Olympian, was 14th in 3:33.553.\n\nTaubitz and Fraebel were so far ahead of the field entering Tuesday that the only way they wouldn't win gold and silver was if someone committed a huge mistake.\n\nIt took about one second for her gold chance — or any medal chance — to be gone. Fraebel badly botched the start of her third run, bouncing off the wall and ping-ponging her way down the rest of the track. She went from second entering the third run to 10th entering the last, way out of medal contention.\n\nAnd that meant, for the fourth run, Taubitz didn't even have to get into fourth gear. With a lead of 0.704 seconds going into the final heat, there was no doubt that Taubitz would get gold.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Norwegian biathlete Sturla Holm Laegreid confessed on live television to cheating on his girlfriend moments after winning bronze in the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who won his first individual Olympic medal in the 20km individual biathlon at Milan-Cortina, admitted he had an affair three months ago and called it \"my biggest mistake\".\n\nLaegreid said it had been \"the worst week of my life\" since he told his girlfriend of six months about the affair.\n\n\"There's someone I wanted to share it with who might not be watching,\" he told NRK, Norway's state broadcaster., external\n\n\"Six months ago I met the love of my life - the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago I made my biggest mistake and cheated on her.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her.\n\n\"Sport has come second these last few days. Yes, I wish I could share this with her.\"\n\nHe later told Norwegian newspaper VG: \"My only way to solve it is to tell everything and put everything on the table, and hope that she can still love me.\n\n\"I've done that for her, and now for the whole world. I have nothing to lose.\n\n\"I want to be a good role model, but I have to admit when I make mistakes.\"\n\nThe seven-time world champion finished third in the biathlon - which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting - behind champion Johan-Olav Botn, a fellow Norwegian, and Eric Perrot of France.\n\nIt is a second Olympic medal for Laegreid, who won gold in the relay at the 2022 Games.\n\nAsked about his admission in the news conference later, he added: \"Of course, now I hope I didn't ruin Johan's day.\n\n\"I don't know if it was the right choice or not, but it was the choice I made.\n\n\"I made the choice to tell the world what I did so maybe there's a chance she will see what she really means to me - maybe not, but I don't want to think I didn't try everything to get her back.\n\n\"I don't want to steal the show. I hope this is just like a day-or-two thing. Then you are an Olympic gold medallist forever.\"\n\nBotn shouted the name of late team-mate Sivert Guttorm Bakken as he crossed the line to win gold.\n\nBakken was found dead on 23 December in a hotel room in northern Italy, about two hours from where the biathlon was held.\n\n\"I was racing with him the entire last loop. And, yeah, it was more like a feeling of crossing the finish line together, and seeing the number one beside my name was really special,\" an emotional Botn said.\n\nLaegreid added: \"We were five guys on the start line, and one of them was watching from above. This was for Sivert, really.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhich country will find the most success at the 2026 Winter Olympics?\n\nIn the past two Winter Games, there was a simple answer to that question: Norway. In 2018, Norway led the way with 39 total medals, also tying Germany for the most gold medals (14). In 2022, not much changed — Norway again paced all countries with 37 medals, including a Games-leading 16 golds.\n\nNow, as the Winter Olympics head to Italy, there will be plenty of storylines to monitor. How will the debut of ski mountaineering look? How will Lindsey Vonn’s official Olympic comeback attempt go after another knee injury?

    "description": "O'Shea broke his foot in March, Kam suffered a concussion in July, and they weren't back competing in top form until October. They just won a gold medal for Team USA anyway",
    "fullText": "Danny O'Shea and Ellie Kam tell PEOPLE about their hard-earned road to Olympic gold\n\nThe pair talk about how they didn't let O'Shea's broken foot or Kam's concussion get in their way\n\nThe pair won gold in the figure skating team event on Feb. 8\n\nJust several months ago, Team USA figure skaters Danny O’Shea and Ellie Kam’s dreams of winning gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics were in jeopardy.\n\nO’Shea, 34, was fresh off surgery for a broken foot — and as soon as he returned to the ice, Kam, 21, suffered a major concussion when she fell to the ice on her head, leaving her sidelined for a month. Still, the duo persevered, and on Feb. 8, took home a gold medal in the team event, proving that sometimes, believing in yourself is the best medicine.\n\n“This whole season has been a lot of ups and downs for both Danny and I,” Kam, 21, tells PEOPLE at the Starbucks Winter House on Monday, Feb. 9 after their win. “We had a lot of injuries in the offseason and coming into this year, you know what it would mean to perform well and make it to an Olympic team and have the chance to represent the country. You want that so bad… and at times it felt like we were so far away from that end goal, and it felt like we were getting farther instead of closer.”\n\nThe pair’s roller coaster journey first started to go off the rails in March, when O’Shea broke his foot doing off-ice jumps just 48 hours before he and Kam left for the 2025 World Championships. They finished seventh, which helped earn Team USA a third Olympic spot in Milan, but O’Shea had to undergo surgery afterward, and needed two plates and 11 screws, according to U.S. Figure Skating.\n\nThen, on July 18, just weeks after O’Shea returned from his injury, Kam suffered one of the worst concussions of her life when she fell on her head during practice, which kept her off the ice for a month. She and O'Shea were forced to pull out of a major opportunity in August, and withdrew from a competition in New York in September. The two weren't back on the ice competing at a top level until October — just four months before the Olympics.\n\n“[Talk about] resilience. Not just pure hard work, but overcoming another roadblock, another roadblock, another roadblock. We got disheartened for sure,” O’Shea tells PEOPLE. “But [we were] not allowing that to stop us from continuing forward.”\n\nKam adds that she and O’Shea, who have been skating together since 2022, kept their eyes on the prize, and maintained a positive attitude despite all that life threw at them.\n\n“I think that we did such a good job at staying together as a team and trusting the process. We had a competition that was really rough in the beginning, but I think that that was all just part of the plan,” she says. “In order to get to the high point of success, you have to go through the nitty-gritty, the dirty… It just makes me even more proud of wearing this medal around our neck, because I know what type of work it has taken us to get here. We worked so hard.”\n\nThe two were a major part of Team USA’s team event win, earning seven team points for their pair skating routine. They ultimately took home medals alongside teammates Madison Chock, Evan Bates, Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin.\n\nO'Shea and Kam will aim to add to their medal collection on Monday, in the final night of the pairs skating competition.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "fullText": "The 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics kicked off on Feb. 6 and will feature several returning sports\n\nIn addition to traditional events, the Games will also introduce the new sport of ski mountaineering\n\nMany women's and team events have also been added to existing sports\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics is introducing the first new sport in nearly three decades!\n\nIn addition to adding various medals and events within existing sports, the Olympics added ski mountaineering to its roster for the 2026 Milan Cortina Games. The sport, which is also called \"skimo,\" is a combination of mountain climbing and skiing.\n\nWhile ski mountaineering is the only official new sport, the 2026 Games also introduced a variety of medal opportunities in the men's, women's and team categories for a number of existing sports. Between the new sport and fresh events, there are a total of 10 additional medals up for grabs.\n\nHere's everything to know about the new sport and medal events at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nSki mountaineering is the only new sport to join the 2026 Winter Olympics. The sport, which is also referred to as \"skimo,\" is a skiing event that combines climbing and skiing on mountains.\n\nAthletes must maneuver through the challenging rugged course while attaching and unassembling their skis over and over again.\n\n\"The concept of ski mountaineering is fairly simple: Competitors climb up a mountain on skis and by foot, then descend on skis. Whoever crosses the finish line first wins,\" Team USA wrote in a description. \"Athletes follow a designed course throughout the race, and they must navigate terrain that is more rugged than that in a traditional cross-country or alpine ski race.\"\n\nThe 2026 Olympics will include three medal events within ski mountaineering: men's sprint, women's sprint and mixed gender relay. The sprints will cover over 250 feet of elevation where athletes will race up and down the designated course in just a few minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, the mixed gender relay occurs on a longer course of around 500 feet and features one male and one female athlete taking turns running the course.\n\nThe ski mountaineering competitions will be held in the Valtellina Valley town of Bormio, which is the same location as alpine skiing. The sprints are scheduled for Feb. 19, while the mixed gender relay will take place on Feb. 21. Team USA has two athletes, Anna Gibson and Cam Smith, who qualified in December 2025 for both the mixed gender relay team and individual sprints.\n\nFreestyle skiing has been an Olympics medaling sport ever since it was introduced in the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, but it has expanded with two medal events — men's and women's dual moguls — for 2026.\n\nUnlike traditional moguls in freestyle skiing, the dual moguls feature a total of 30 athletes broken down into brackets of two athletes competing side-by-side at a time. In every bracket, the two designated skiers directly compete against each other as they perform tricks and run down the set course.\n\nAfter they embark on simultaneous runs, the skiers are judged against each other on the same factors as traditional moguls — including turns, speed and air. The winner is determined by judges — who all have five votes they can divide between the athletes — and whomever has the most votes moves on to the next round.\n\nFor the Milan Cortina Olympics, the same athletes will be competing in both traditional moguls and dual moguls, so all 30 qualified competitors have two chances to win a medal, per NBC Olympics. The Team USA mogul skiers include Olivia Giaccio, Tess Johnson, Jaelin Kauf, Liz Lemley, Charlie Mickel, Nick Page, Dylan Walczyk and Landon Wendler.\n\nThe women's dual moguls finals are scheduled for Feb. 14 and the men's finals are slated for the following day, Feb. 15.\n\nAnother medal event that viewers will witness for the first time is the women's doubles luge. The sport has been a staple at the Winter Olympics ever since the 1964 Games and included men's singles, women's singles and doubles.\n\nAlthough women were not explicitly ineligible from the doubles portion of the event, no women had previously competed, and it had traditionally been a men's event.\n\nThe women's double luge will resemble the men's in that two athletes will team up and lie on their back while riding a single sled and steering it with their bodies at extremely high speeds. Similar to other luge events, the team with the lowest cumulative time after two separate runs wins.\n\nLongtime partners Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby will make history by representing Team USA in the historic event on Feb. 11.\n\nSkelton, the high-speed sledding event where athletes lie on their stomach and race head-first down an icy course, was first introduced in the Winter Olympics in 1928 but wasn't included as an official sport until 2002, with both men's and women's events.\n\nFor the first time since then, skeleton has launched a mixed team relay. The new event features pairs made up of one man and one woman from the same country. In a single heat, the woman will begin the course before the man immediately follows.\n\nBoth individual times are combined into a final team time, and the lowest time among competitors wins. Team members Mystique Ro and Austin Florian will be competing on behalf of the U.S. on Feb. 15.\n\nAnother sport that has added a women's event is the large hill ski jumping program. The men's large hill event has been a signature sport at the Games ever since the inaugural Winter Olympic Games in 1924.\n\nThe men's normal hill event was later added in 1964, and the women's portion of that competition emerged in 2014. However, the women's large hill event was absent until the 2026 Games.\n\nThe women's large hill ski jumping event features female athletes launching themselves from a large ramp (around 400 feet tall). A panel of judges determine the winners based on several factors, including distance, speed and style.\n\nAnnika Belshaw, Paige Jones and Josie Johnson will compete in the inaugural ski jumping event with Team USA on Feb. 15.\n\nAlpine skiing, which has been part of the Olympics since 1936, introduced a team combined medal event in 2026.\n\nThe team event consists of two athletes working together to race two runs: a downhill and a slalom. One member of the team races the downhill, while the other takes on the slalom. The pair with the fastest cumulative time takes home the gold.\n\nThe new event replaced the super combined event, which showcased just one athlete competing in both portions of the race. The 2026 Olympics will include an event for both women and men's teams.\n\nThe men's inaugural event, which took place on Feb. 9 at the Stelvio Ski Centre, resulted in Switzerland's Franjo von Allmen and Tanguy Nef winning gold. Team USA duo Kyle Negomir and River Radamus competed and placed 16th.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's events, held on Feb. 10, will feature Team USA pairs Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin, Jacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan and Keely Cashman and AJ Hurt.",

    "description": "Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni slams anti-Olympics protesters as 'enemies of Italy and Italians'.",
    "fullText": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has condemned anti-Olympics protesters as “enemies of Italy and Italians” after violence on the fringes of rallies in Milan and the alleged sabotage of train infrastructure.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also joined the criticism on Sunday, condemning violence linked to the protests in Milan on Saturday, stating such behaviour has no place at the Games.\n\nThe incidents ⁠happened on the first full day of competition in the Winter Games that Milan is hosting along with the Alpine town of Cortina d’Ampezzo.\n\nMeloni praised thousands of Italians who are working to keep the Games running smoothly, many of whom are volunteers.\n\n“Then there are those who are enemies of Italy and Italians. The protesters demonstrate ‘against the Olympics,’ causing these images to end up on televisions around the world. After others cut the railway cables to prevent the trains from leaving,” the prime minister wrote in a statement on Facebook on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian Transport Ministry said that an investigation into suspected “terrorism” had been launched after the railway sabotage near the city of Bologna on Saturday and that those responsible would face a multimillion-euro damages claim.\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in Milan on Saturday to protest against the Olympics’ environmental and social consequences, including concerns over excessive public spending and ecological damage.\n\nThe march, which began peacefully, turned tense when some protesters set off smoke bombs and firecrackers near Olympic venues. Milan police responded with tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds, leading to clashes in areas close to the Olympic Village and a nearby highway.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams told reporters on Sunday that peaceful protest is legitimate, but “we draw a line at violence”, which “has no place at the Olympic Games”.\n\nSeparately, protesters have also rallied against Israel’s participation in the games and against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which has deployed agents to provide security to the US delegation at the Games.\n\nDuring Friday’s opening ceremony, Israel’s small delegation marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium to a smattering of “boos” from the crowds. The four Israeli athletes, waving their national flag and smiling, saw the jeers quickly drowned out by the loud music and overall festive atmosphere.\n\nUnited States Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Second Lady Usha Vance, received a similar hostile reception when they appeared on the stadium’s big screen.",

    "fullText": "Milan-Cortina 2026 organisers have \"identified\" a reason for the spate of broken medals at the Winter Olympics and said any athletes affected will have theirs fixed.\n\nTwo of the USA's gold medallists, Breezy Johnson and Alysa Liu, revealed the ribbons had come away from their medals soon after they received them.\n\nJohnson, who won gold in the women's downhill alpine skiing, showed her broken medal at the post-event news conference.\n\n\"So there's the medal. And there's the ribbon,\" she said. \"And here's the little piece that is supposed to go into the ribbon to hold the medal, and yeah, it came apart.\"\n\nLiu highlighted a similar issue in a video on social media after she won gold as part of the USA's squad in the figure skating team event.\n\nThe video shows Liu holding up her medal and the ribbon in separate hands, with the text: \"My medal don't need the ribbon.\"\n\nThe issue also affected the German team who won bronze in the biathlon. An Instagram video shows one of the athletes' medals falling from the ribbon as they jumped up and down in celebration at the team hotel.\n\nGames organisers said on Monday they were giving the problem \"maximum attention\" and have now confirmed they have found a fix.\n\nDramatic or distracting?

Athletes whose medals have been affected are encouraged to return them through the appropriate channels so that they can be promptly repaired and returned.\n\n\"Milan-Cortina 2026 remains fully committed to ensuring that medals, which represent the pinnacle of every athlete's journey, meet the highest standards of quality and care.\"\n\nBBC Sport has asked organisers what the exact issue with the medals was, and what the precise nature of the fix is.\n\nThis is not the first time the quality of medals awarded at Olympic Games has been called into question.\n\nAs of February 2025, a total of 220 requests have been made to replace medals won at the 2024 Summer Games because of wear and tear.\n\nDiver Yasmin Harper, who won Team GB's first medal in Paris, was among the athletes to notice her medal was showing signs of \"tarnishing\".\n\nParis 2024 organisers said any damaged medals would be replaced.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "The American short-track speed skating team will look to get back on the podium at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics after being shutout at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.\n\nEight short-track speeders will represent Team USA in Milano Cortina, including five returning Olympians (Kristen Santos-Griswold, Corinne Stoddard, Julie Letai, Eunice Lee and Andrew Heo) and three first-timers (Kamryn Lute, Brandon Kim and Clayton DeClemente). The U.S. has won 20 Olympic medals in short-track speed skating, most recently John-Henry Krueger's silver in the 1000m at the 2018 PyeongChang Games.\n\nShort-track speed skating was staged as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Calgary Winter Games and officially made its Olympic debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games. The 2000m mixed team relay was added to the program at the 2022 Beijing Games.\n\nUnlike speed skating, where athletes race against the clock, short-track speed skating pits racers against each other, highlighting the importance of strategy in this event. Short-track speed skating, takes place on a shorter track (111.12 meters long) like the name suggests, compared to a speed skating track (400 meters long).\n\nThere will be nine short-track speed skating medal events in Milano Cortina:\n\n2000m mixed team relay: Each team consists of two women and two men.\n\nKristen Santos-Griswol: Santos-Griswold was in medal contention in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Olympics when she was bumped by an opponent and fell. She finished just off the podium in fourth place and contemplated retirement. Santos-Griswol, 31, came back strong and won five medals at the 2024 World Championships, including a 1000m gold, to become the first U.S. skater to win medals at three individual distances (500m, 1,000m, 1,500m) at one world competition. She won her first Crystal Globe for the 2024-25 season, which is awarded to the best overall skater.\n\nCorinne Stoddard: The 24-year-old is looking to improve upon her seventh-place finish in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Stoddard won three medals at the 2024 World Championships and finished the 2025-26 World Tour second overall after winning eight individual medals (3 silver, 5 bronze).\n\nSantos-Griswol and Stoddard will look to dethrone Italian Arianna Fontana, who's set to compete in her sixth Olympics. Fontana has 11 Olympic medals to her name, including back-to-back golds in the 500m. Don't count out South Korea, which leads all countries with 53 total short-track speed skating Olympic medals and 26 gold.\n\nThe 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics are here! \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Short-track speed skating at 2026 Milano Cortina: US stars to watch",

    "fullText": "The big story over the weekend at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi was Lindsey Vonn’s crash in the women’s downhill on Sunday. For Vonn, her Olympic experience in Milan was not supposed to end this way after an iconic career that saw her be one of the best female alpine skiing speed racers of all-time. The crash was simply spectacular, and the 41-year-old Olympic gold medalist from Saint Paul, Minnesota was heard screaming on the course as she was lifted by helicopter.\n\nWith the injury to Vonn, will many sports fans remember who won the Olympic gold medal in the women’s downhill? It just so happened to be another American in Breezy Johnson of Jackson, Wyoming.\n\nInside look at Johnson’s Olympic gold\n\nJohnson posted a winning time of 1:36.10. Emma Aicher of Germany won the silver medal with a time of 1:36.14. Sofia Goggia of Italy won the bronze medal with a time of 1:36.69. Johnson reached the podium by 0.86 seconds over Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon, and Cornelia Hutter of Austria, as they both had a fourth place time of 1:36.96.\n\nAt age 30, this is the first Olympic gold medal for Johnson in her impressive skiing career. She previously won two gold medals at the Alpine Skiing World Championships in Saalbach, Austria. Johnson won gold in the women’s downhill, and gold in the women’s team combined with another American icon in women’s alpine skiing, Mikaela Shiffrin of Vail, Colorado. Due to the fact that Johnson has been a big performance skier in the past, the Olympic gold medal in Cortina should not have been much of a surprise–even to Snoop Dogg, who was watching the women’s downhill with Lindsey’s father.\n\nUSA has two gold medals to date\n\nJohnson’s gold medal is one of two medals for the United States so far. They also placed first in the team figure skating competition. The Americans beat Italy by a single point. The Americans were led by quad and backflip artist Ilia Malinin in the men’s event, and ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates in ice dance.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympics: Did the Lindsey Vonn crash overshadow Breezy Johnson’s Olympic gold? appeared first on The Big Lead.",
