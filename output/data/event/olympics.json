Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Olympics stand as the most prestigious sporting event worldwide.\n\nEvery two years, athletes from hundreds of nations gather in a single location, alternating between summer and winter Games. They compete for medals and national pride, pushing the world's top competitors.\n\nItaly is honored to host the 2026 Winter Olympics from February 6 to February 22. This will be Italy's fourth time hosting the Olympics and its first since 2006.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2026 Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nMORE: Who are the biggest USA Olympic hockey snubs?\n\nThe 2026 Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo has previously hosted the Olympics, but only the Summer Games. This is the first time Milan is hosting the Olympics, and it is also Cortina d'Ampezzo's first time hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nHere's a list of each time Italy has hosted the Olympics:\n\nMilan and Cortina d'Ampezzo host 15 Olympic venues. Below is a full list of the sports scheduled at each location.\n\nMilano San Siro Olympic Stadium\n\nMilano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nCortina Curling Olympic Stadium\n\nCurling, wheelchair curling, Paralympic closing ceremony\n\nAlpine skiing, para alpine skiing\n\nTesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium\n\nCross-country skiing, Nordic combined, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing\n\nAlpine skiing, ski mountaineering\n\nOlympic closing ceremony, Paralympic opening ceremony\n\nThe time difference can significantly affect viewers wanting to watch the Olympic Games. Fortunately, the Winter Games pose less of a challenge for those in the Eastern Time Zone. Italy is six hours ahead of EST and nine hours ahead of Pacific Time.\n\nThe 2021 Tokyo Olympics experienced a harsh 14-hour time difference, making viewing difficult. In contrast, the 2026 Games will be more accessible for U.S. fans to watch live without disrupting their sleep routines.\n\nMORE: When will the Olympics be in USA?\n\nHosting the Olympic Games is a great honor, but it comes with high costs. The organizers of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics have announced an operating budget of approximately \"1.7 billion euros\" ($1.9 billion).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will provide approximately $1 billion in extra funding for the February 6-22 Games. At the same time, the Italian government is investing over $1 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance access to the venues.\n\nAlthough this appears substantial, Russia reportedly invested $51 billion to host the 2014 Sochi Games, a cost that is expected to remain an Olympic record for many years to come.\n\nThe Milano Cortina Olympics will welcome thousands of athletes from across the world for the 2026 Winter Games. They'll stay in one of the six Olympic Villages spread across northern Italy.\n\nThe locations include Milan, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo, Anterselva (Antholz), and Cortina.\n\nIt is said that after the games, some villages will be converted into student housing.",

    "fullText": "Sam Bennett may have been the most notable snub from Team Canada's Olympic hockey roster.\n\nTurns out, the Florida Panthers star will be playing in the Olympics anyway.\n\nBennett was added to the roster as an injury replacement on Tuesday. The Lightning's Anthony Cirelli was hurt in the Stadium Series game on Sunday and will have to miss the tournament.\n\nBennett was just injured, too, but TSN's Darren Dreger says it was \"nothing serious.\" The news of Bennett as a replacement for Cirelli, and no announcement about the Panthers' injured Brad Marchand, may be a good sign for Marchand's chances of also suiting up at the Olympics.\n\nMORE: How Connor McDavid is to the Oilers what Josh Allen is to the Bills\n\nCirelli, as a faceoff guy and penalty-killing type, had a very specific role for the Canadian team. Bennett fits that pretty well, and he does bring a type of grit that Cirelli also has.\n\nBennett is a winner. He has been a part of back-to-back Stanley Cup championships with the Panthers. He was also on Canada's victorious 4 Nations Faceoff team.\n\nAt 29 years old, this may have been Bennett's best chance of making an Olympic team.\n\nThis season in 55 games with the Panthers, Bennett has 19 goals, 23 assists and 101 blocks shots.\n\nMORE: How Olympic roster freeze may create a second NHL trade deadline\n\nTeam Canada squeezed Bennett off the initial roster because it decided to keep both Bo Horvat and Nick Suzuki on the initial roster.\n\nHopefully, Bennett didn't make any plans for the Olympic break. Because after it was in doubt, he has some hockey to be played and a gold medal to chase.\n\nBilly Heyen is a freelance writer with The Sporting News.

I have been working really hard to come into these Games in a much different position,\" she said in a media conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"I know what my chances were before the crash and I know that my chances aren't the same as it stands now, but I know there is still a chance.\n\n\"As long as there is a chance, I'll try. That's where I am.\"\n\nThe four-time world champion retired from the sport in 2019 but made a stunning comeback in December 2024 following a partial replacement of her right knee.\n\nShe arrived in Cortina at the top of the World Cup downhill standings, with two race wins and three more podium finishes, and as one of the favourites for the gold medal.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn’s status for the Winter Olympics is uncertain. While competing in her final downhill event before the upcoming world competition, Vonn crashed on the course and had to be airlifted to a nearby facility for treatment.\n\nThe skier lost control while attempting to land a jump during a World Cup downhill event, becoming tangled in the safety nets lining the course. When Vonn was able to get up, she was limping and favoring her left knee, using her poles to steady herself.\n\nHere are the latest injury updates for Vonn following her crash while preparing for the Winter Olympics.\n\nMORE: When do the Winter Olympics start\n\nVonn released a statement on her Instagram. She said, \"I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams. This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics...but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over. I will give more information when I have it. It's not over until it's over.\"\n\nVonn, as expected, did not race in Saturday's Super-G race. Her skiing coach, Chris Knight texted the Associated Presssaying that Vonn \"is preparing for Cortina as usual.\" Vonn herself posted on Instagram, announcing her withdrawal from the Super-G race and said that she is \"doing my best right now...\"\n\nThe U.S. Ski team also released a statement on Friday, backing up Vonn. \"Lindsey Vonn crashed in today's Cras Montana World Cup downhill and injured her left knee, however her Olympic dream isn't over yet.\"\n\nVonn had been running the fastest time at the first checkpoint before her injury. She landed a jump off-balance, then lifted her left arm and pole to try to regain her balance, and tried to brake. This caused her to be spun around, and she ended up in the nets.\n\nReports suggest that Vonn had an \"anxious expression\" and had a long embrace with teammate Jacquelin Wiles before going into the medical tent for treatment.\n\nMORE: Why were \"Heated Rivalry\" stars chosen as Winter Olympic torchbearers?\n\nVonn was competing in her final downhill competition before the Winter Olympics. She had gone over a jump, but didn't land correctly. Vonn was trying to regain her balance, but ended up spinning out and sliding down the course. Unable to control herself, she slid hard into the protective netting in what looked like a bad crash.\n\nWishing Lindsey Vonn a speedy recovery following her crash in Crans-Montana ❤️ pic.twitter.com/hZ6PcPVvW3\n\n— TNT Sports (@tntsports) January 30, 2026\n\nAfter being checked by medical personnel, Vonn was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nHere is video confirmation of Lindsey Vonn being airlifted to the hospital after her crash.\n\nHeartbreaking. #FISAlpine | #WorldCupCransMontanapic.twitter.com/Ck2oNc9lff\n\n— Team USA Olympics Updates and Coverage (@TeamUSAOLYCov) January 30, 2026\n\nVonn was also not the only one to crash. Three different competitors crashed, including Vonn.  Austria's Nine Ortlieb and Norway's Marte Monsen also crashed. Ortlieb crashed in the same area as Vonn, and Monsen nearly made it to the end before crashing into the nets and had to be taken away in a sled.\n\nFrench skier Romaine Miradoli completed her run, but said that the snow falling caused bad visibility issues. She said, \"You can't see, and it's bumpy everywhere.\" When pressed further and asked if the course was dangerous, Miradoli responded, \"We just couldn't see well.\"\n\nThe event was cancelled after Vonn's crash, per the AP.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team USA winter Olympic hockey team\n\nVonn was checked by the onsite medical team, but further evaluation was needed, especially given her knee favoring. Due to winter conditions and snow, she was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nMORE: Meet the USA Olympic figure skating team for the Winter Olympics\n\nThe International Ski and Snowboard Federation CEO Urs Lehmann told reporters, \"I know she hurt her knee, I talked to her. I don’t know if it’s really heavy and (if) she won’t miss the Olympics. Let’s wait for what the doctors are saying.”\n\nVonn's first scheduled event is the women's downhill on February 8.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team Canada's Winter Olympic team\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics are set for Friday, February 6.

    "description": "Olympics fans can expect a unique dual-city setting, new events and even a new sport, and more TV coverage here in the United States than ever.",
    "fullText": "Summon the heroes! The 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are almost here, and athletes from around the world are heading to northern Italy in hopes of skating, skiing, snowboarding, and sledding their way to the medal podium.\n\nAnd this year’s games are different from previous editions of the Winter Olympics, with a unique dual-city setting, new events, and even a new sport, and more TV coverage here in the United States than ever.\n\nHere are those details and more.\n\nFor the first time in Olympic history, two cities are hosting the games: Milan, Italy’s second-largest city, and Cortina d’Ampezzo, an Italian ski resort more than 250 miles away. And the action will play out at more than a dozen venues in those cities and elsewhere in northern Italy.\n\nAs NBC News reports, Milan will host ice skating, speed skating, ice hockey, and the opening ceremony; Cortina will host Alpine skiing, bobsled, curling, and luge; the Anterselva/Antholz region will host biathlon and cross-country skiing; Livigno will host freestyle skiing and snowboarding; Bormio will host men’s Alpine skiing and ski mountaineering; Tesero will host cross-country skiing; Predazzo will host ski jumping; and Verona will host the closing ceremonies.\n\nThe 2026 games are introducing ski mountaineering as a new Olympic sport, according to an Olympics.com FAQ. With medals awarded for men’s and women’s sprints and a mixed-gender relay, “skimo” has athletes alternating between racing on skis and racing on foot as they navigate a mountainous course.\n\nSki mountaineering is the only new sport at this year’s games, but viewers will see new events in returning Olympic sports: Women’s Doubles in luge, Women’s Large Hill in ski jumping, Mixed Team in skeleton, Men’s and Women’s Dual Moguls in freestyle skiing, and Team Combined in alpine skiing.\n\nBoth the 2026 Olympic Winter Games and the ensuing Paralympic Winter Games will award gold, silver, and bronze medals imagined by the Milano Cortina 2026 design team and crafted by the Italian State Mint and Polygraphic Institute (IPZS) using recycled metal recovered from production waste, per Olympics.com.\n\nThe medal design features interlocking halves representing several dual concepts, according to NBC Olympics. Those dual concepts include Milan and Cortina, urban and alpine, Olympic and Paralympic, and the athletes and the teams behind them.\n\nMilano Cortina 2026 medals revealed!\n\nThe medals for the Olympic Winter Games @milanocortina26 have a unique design that combines two halves symbolising the athlete’s journey and all those who have walked beside them along the way.\n\nDiscover: https://t.co/EiFV2cgObf pic.twitter.com/wFAlxAJ4YS\n\n— IOC MEDIA (@iocmedia) July 15, 2025\n\nEighty-six delegations will represent their home countries at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes who meet International Olympic Committee specifications will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, according to Sports Illustrated. Making their Winter Olympics debut at the 2026 games are Benin, Guinea-Bissau, and the United Arab Emirates, the magazine adds.\n\nThis year’s Olympic and Paralympic Games boast an emblem dubbed “Futura,” representing the number “26” drawn in a single motion. “Influenced by the themes of sport, solidarity and sustainability, ‘Futura’ illustrates a dynamic and modern design that reflects some of the fundamental values of the Olympic and the Paralympic Winter Games,” IOC Milano Cortina 2026 Coordination Commission Chair Sari Essayah said in a statement, per Olympics.com.\n\nThe Milano Cortina 2026 organizing committee’s choice of motto for the 2026 Olympics and Paralympics is “IT’s your vibe,” with “IT” capitalized as a play on Italy’s country code, according to the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe mascots of the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are the stoats Milo and Tina, named after the two host cities. Tina is the Olympic mascot, a white stoat who “believes in the power of beauty.” And Milo is the Paralympic mascot, a brown stoat who was born without one paw but “learned to use his tail and turn his difference into a strength,” Olympics.com explains. The two stoats will be joined by six snowdrop flowers symbolizing rebirth and collectively called The Flo.\n\nNearly four years ago, the song “Fino all’alba” (“Until the Dawn”) won a song contest in Italy to become the official anthem for the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, according to Inside the Games. The song, which received 72 percent of the vote, is the work of the La Cittadina of San Pietro Martire, a youth music group in the town of Seveso, Italy.\n\nIn a press release, NBCUniversal touts that it will provide the biggest Winter Olympics ever with the media corporation’s most comprehensive Winter Games coverage, totaling more than 3,200 hours in all. NBC’s Primetime in Milan will offer three hours of coverage each night, and NBC is also extending coverage into daytime to provide more Olympics programming hours on the network than it did for any previous Winter Games. Peacock, meanwhile, will stream live coverage of every event in every sport. And USA Network and CNBC, two cable channels now owned by Versant following that company’s spinoff from NBCUniversal, will also carry coverage of the games.\n\n2026 Winter Olympic Games, February 6 through February 22, NBC, Peacock, USA Network & CNBC\n\n2026 Winter Paralympic Games, March 6 through March 15, NBC, Peacock, USA Network & CNBC\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "We are days away from the start of the 2026 Winter Olympics – here's what you need to know in six charts.",
    "fullText": "The 25th Winter Olympics is almost here – it's back in Europe and will feature a record 116 medal events, three of which will be in the new sport of ski mountaineering.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nGreat Britain have never won more than five medals – or more than one gold – at a single Winter Olympics, but that could change in 2026.\n\nMedal 'targets' have become medal 'ranges' at recent Olympics, and for Milan-Cortina the funding body UK Sport is hoping GB athletes will win between four and eight medals, while Team GB chef de mission Eve Muirhead says there is an \"opportunity to get the most we ever have\".\n\nBritish athletes won nine medals at the most recent World Championships in Winter Olympic sports – across bobsleigh, curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton and snowboard.\n\nAnd that does not include the likes of snowboarder Mia Brookes and freestyle skier Kirsty Muir who have won World Cup events this season and are considered genuine medal hopes.\n\nHowever, GB set a target of three to seven medals for the 2022 Winter Olympics and that did not go to plan. The team did not win anything until the final weekend, when they picked up a gold and silver in curling, avoiding embarrassment but falling short of expectations.\n\nThe Winter Olympics have come a long way since their 1924 debut, which featured 11 female athletes – and roughly 25 times more men.\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee (IOC),, external about 1,300 female athletes will be at Milan-Cortina. Of the 116 medal events, 50 will be in women's competition (the most ever) and 12 will be mixed. The upshot is that women will compete in a Winter Games-record 53.4% of all medal events.\n\nTwelve of the 16 disciplines will be fully gender-balanced in athlete numbers – another Games record. Among the new women's events are luge doubles and the ski jumping individual large hill, while there is also a mixed skeleton relay.\n\nThere is another sign of the progress made with equality: these Games are the first to be overseen by new IOC president Kirsty Coventry, the first woman to be elected to the organisation's most powerful position.\n\nBut there is still work to be done: Nordic combined remains the sole Winter Olympic sport not open to women, with the IOC deciding in 2022 not to include a women's event, external on the 2026 programme despite lobbying from leading athletes.\n\nIce hockey is one of the biggest draws of the Winter Olympics, and the return of NHL stars after an absence of 12 years has only heightened the anticipation.\n\nNHL-contracted players were denied a chance to compete at the 2018 Games while Covid put paid to their 2022 participation – and even 2026 has been touch and go after major issues with the readiness of the main rink and the condition of the ice.\n\nThe return of NHL players has also reignited the USA's hopes of a first Olympic men's ice hockey title since the 1980 'Miracle on Ice' gold – further boosted by the fact that Russia are banned from competing.\n\nHowever, although NHL sides are all based in either the USA or Canada, it's not just those countries who benefit from players from the league being at the Winter Olympics. All but one of the 12 teams at the Olympics will have NHL representation, with 2022 champions Finland and semi-finalists Slovakia and Sweden having rosters well stocked with NHL players.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo will become the fourth location to host the Winter Olympics twice, following St Moritz (1928 & 1948), Innsbruck (1964 & 1976) and Lake Placid (1932 & 1980).\n\nThe growth of the Winter Olympics from 1956 to 2026 – five times as many events and almost four times as many athletes – means it would be impossible today for a ski resort like Cortina to stage the Olympics single-handedly. The 2026 Games will be the most geographically widespread, with events in multiple regions and cities, including Milan, which is Italy's second biggest city.\n\nThe IOC also prizes sustainability, and spreading events around – something president Kirsty Coventry says will be \"the new normal\", external – meaning less new infrastructure is required.\n\nOne venue that will be 'recycled' in 2026 is Cortina's Olympic Ice Stadium. In 1956, it staged the opening ceremony, ice hockey and the figure skating, the last time that competition was held outdoors. Seventy years later, and now with a roof, it will host the curling.\n\nNot since 2018 has there been a new name at the top of the list of most Winter Olympic golds, but 2026 could change that.\n\nGerman lugers Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win their seventh and eighth golds in Milan-Cortina, which would move them level with the Norwegian trio of biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen and cross country skiers Bjorn Daehlie and Marit Bjorgen.\n\nIt would arguably be a greater achievement as biathlon and cross country skiing offer more medal opportunities than luge. Daehlie, Bjorgen and Bjorndalen won gold in 53%, 33% and 30% respectively of the Olympic events they competed in. The 'Two Tobis' have won all six of theirs (100%).\n\nBut they could all be overtaken by another cross country skier, Johannes Hosflot Klaebo, who is already a five-time Olympic champion. The Norwegian won all six titles, external at last season's World Championships – similar form at the Olympics could power him to the top of the all-time golds leaderboard.\n\nHosting an Olympics usually results in a boost in medals – but it's not always the case, as Italy discovered the last time they hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006.\n\nThey had won 13 medals in 2002 in Salt Lake City but only managed 11 in Turin – although they did win five golds as opposed to four in the USA four years previously.\n\nThe Italian Olympic Committee has set a minimum target of 19 medals, which is one short of their biggest haul of 20. That was achieved in 1994 – including a record seven golds – when their team included the likes of skiing greats Alberto Tomba, Deborah Compagnoni and Stefania Belmondo.\n\nItaly's 2026 hopes have already suffered a few setbacks, with flagbearer Federica Brignone, external and freestyle skier Flora Tabanelli, external both fighting fitness battles while another alpine hope, Marta Bassino,, external has already been ruled out.\n\nBut there are others with golden credentials, including speed skater Davide Ghiotto, snowboarder Maurizio Bormolini and curling pair Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini.\n\nAnd there's always Arianna Fontana – at the age of 15, the short track skater won bronze in Turin in 2006. Now 20 years later, she is Italy's most successful Winter Olympian, and aiming to win a medal at a sixth consecutive Games.\n\nBBC Sport to show 450 hours of Winter Olympics\n\nJeffries and Pendry complete 53-strong GB squad\n\nUS to send ICE agents to Winter Olympics, prompting Italian anger",

    "fullText": "Sunday, February 8, will be a legendary day for sports fans because of Super Bowl LX, and the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games will be happening on the same day. But also for NBC and their streaming platform, Peacock, as they will be presenting both events live all day in 4K HDR. Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "description": "NBC is the broadcast home of Super Bowl LX, the Winter Olympics, and much more in 2026. We'll show you how to watch NBC without cable.",
    "fullText": "NBC has long been a popular channel to have in your TV line-up, but the network's upcoming broadcasts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LX make it all but necessary. Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to live stream the network, even if you don't have cable or an antenna. Keep reading to learn how to watch NBC online.\n\nNBC is the home of beloved sitcoms such as \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\" and flagship procedurals like the \"Law & Order\" and \"Chicago\" universes. In addition to a massive selection of currently airing scripted programming (in addition to series like \"Saturday Night Live\"), the network has become a key player in the news and sports scene. The \"Today\" show and NBC News have long been among the network's main draws, but NBC has increasingly invested in sports over the years, becoming a must-have destination for fans of the NFL, NBA, and the Olympics. NBC is also the broadcast home of flagship events, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl LX, and the 2026 Emmy Awards.\n\nWhether you're hoping to stream NBC live or get caught up with past network programming on-demand, we've got you covered. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about tuning in to the network without cable, including a breakdown of NBCUniversal's direct streaming service, Peacock.\n\n*NBC is only available in select regions on Sling.\n\nNBC's direct streaming counterpart is Peacock, a one-stop shop for all things NBCUniversal. There are three tiers of service, ranging from Peacock Select ($8 a month) to Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month). Select is fairly pared-down and doesn't offer live events, so we recommend Premium or Premium Plus to unlock the full suite of on-demand offerings from the streaming service.\n\nPeacock has a massive collection of-demand seasons of NBC and Bravo shows, among other programming. New episodes typically land on the streaming service the day after their linear broadcast, so if you don't mind waiting a day (and watching with ads), the $11 a month Premium option should do the trick. However, if you'd like to stream NBC live and watch on-demand programming without ads, you'll need Peacock Premium for $17 a month. Both Premium and Premium Plus will carry the Super Bowl and the Olympics.\n\nPeacock Premium Plus subscription is $17 a month. The extra cost gets rid of most ads, allows you to download select titles, and also comes with your local NBC channel.\n\nDirecTV is another solid way to live stream NBC, along with other popular channels. In our guide to the best live TV streaming services, DirecTV ranks as the best cable alternative. NBC is available in several packages, including all signature plans and a couple of cheaper genre packs. Signature plans start at $90 a month for the Entertainment plan, which carries NBC and 90+ other channels (including pretty much anything you'd find in a standard cable plan).\n\nNBC is also available in MyNews and MySports genre packs. MyNews costs $40 a month and comes with 10+ popular news channels, while MySports costs $70 a month and offers around 20 sports networks and access to ESPN Unlimited. All DirecTV plans come with a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nIf you're looking for more of a budget-friendly pick, Sling TV will also allow you to live stream NBC and a handful of other channels. It's a great budget live TV service, but it's important to note that local channel coverage (like NBC) varies from region to region, so you should see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. NBC-friendly plans (where available) include Sling Select and Sling Blue.\n\nSling Select offers around 10 channels and costs $25 a month when local networks are involved. Sling Blue carries 40+ channels and costs $50 a month for those with local channel access. If you're looking for a more comprehensive cable alternative, you can get Sling Orange + Blue for $65 a month.\n\nFor just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.",

    "description": "Plus, viewing plans for every type of fan.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Winter Olympics will kick off in Milano Cortina, Italy, beginning on Friday, Feb. 6. With more than 3,200 hours of winter sports coverage spread across broadcast, cable, and digital streaming platforms, finding what you want to watch can feel like a full-time job. So here's where and when you can watch the Olympics.\n\nWatching the Olympics is a deeply personal experience. Some love the technical precision of a perfect luge run; others dig the emotional narrative of an underdog’s journey to the podium; and some just want to catch the meme of the week as it happens. Because everyone's \"perfect Olympics\" is unique, I’ve also put together a viewing guide designed for the way you might want to experience the 2026 Games.\n\nNBCUniversal has the exclusive rights to show the Olympics in the U.S. this year, and the network is practically going all-Olympics from the opening ceremony on Feb. 6 to the closing on Feb. 22. If you're watching the Olympics in the old-school \"turn on the TV\" way, the 2026 Winter Olympics are on broadcast channel NBC and cable channels CNBC and USA Network. If you're streaming the games, you'll be doing it from Peacock.\n\nDuring primetime, NBC is showing Primetime in Milan, three hours of curated Olympics coverage, nightly, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT, except Super Bowl Sunday, when Primetime in Milan will start at 10:45 p.m. ET.\n\nIn the daytime, NBC will be broadcasting five hours of coverage daily focusing mainly on more popular Winter Olympics coverage like snowboarding, skiing, figure skating, and hockey. Daytime Olympics programming will begin at 7 a.m. ET most days, and continue through the early afternoon, depending on the daily lineup.\n\nNBC is also airing a nightly wrap-up of each day's events after the local news; the Olympics' opening ceremony on Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET; live coverage of the closing ceremonies at 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 22, with an encore showing at 9 p.m.; and 4K Olympics coverage on Super Bowl Sunday, beginning at 7 a.m. ET.\n\nNBC-owned cable networks USA Network and CNBC will also feature Olympics content during the games.\n\nUSA Network: USA Network will be devoted to Olympics coverage nearly 24/7 during the games, showing a mix of live events and encore showings of past events. Because of the six-hour time difference from Italy to the U.S., USA Network will show live Olympic events nightly beginning around 2 a.m. ET, and feature continuing coverage through the early afternoon.\n\nCNBC: CNBC is devoted to curling (really). The cable network plans to broadcast a nightly \"Best of Curling\" show on weeknights at 5 p.m. ET, with long form coverage on weekends.\n\nIf you are planning to stream the Olympics, you'll be doing it on Peacock, NBC's streaming platform. Peacock will stream every single session of all 116 medal events live, as well as offering full-event replays of every event available on-demand.\n\n\"I want to be part of the conversation, but I don't need to watch biathlon at 4 a.m.\"\n\nIf you want high production values, dramatic stories of inspiring athletes, and exciting contests curated by sports broadcasting pros, the mainstream coverage is for you. Don't miss the opening ceremonies on Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, and catch as much of NBC's primetime coverage as you have time for. It's bound to be packed with crowd-pleasing events, give you lots of background on different athletes, and Olympics breaking news, but without a lot of obscure or boring sports.\n\nPro tip: \n\nIf you religiously follow a single sport in the Olympics, be it hockey or snowboarding, and you really don't care about, say, inspirational ice-dancer stories, your best bet is Peacock's Sports Hub, where you can watch every qualifying heat and every medal contest of only the sport you like, either live or on-demand.\n\nPro tip: Coordinate your calendar with NBC's interactive schedule to make sure you know when everything is happening.\n\n\"Half the fun of the Olympics is dishing about it.\"\n\nIf the Olympics is better as a shared experience, watch NBC.com's broadcast coverage in one window, and check out the social media feeds of NBC's \"Creator Collective,\" where TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube influencers like Kylie Kelce, Anna Sitar, and Jordan Howlett will be watching along.\n\nPro tip: Don't sleep on Reddit communities r/olympics and r/WinterOlympics2026.\n\n\"I'm irrationally passionate about a sport I'd never heard of before today.\"\n\nIf you love to discover strange new sports, the Winter Olympics are going to be fun. Skip the mainstream coverage on NBC and browse through Peacock's Sports Hub catalog for sports you've never heard of.\n\nPro tip: Don't miss the debut of Ski Mountaineering (\"SkiMo\"), the only brand-new sport at the 2026 Games. It’s a grueling hybrid where athletes who hate ski lifts for some reason hike up steep mountains before carving down high-speed technical descents.\n\n\"I absolutely cannot get enough Olympics and I want to watch as much as is humanly possible.\"\n\nIf you have a lot of time on your hands and want to see literally everything, you'll need Peacock, and to get familiar with its \"Discovery Multiview\" feature, which lets you watch up to four sporting events at the same time.\n\nPro tip: Go to the NBC Olympics Full Schedule and use the \"My Stuff\" feature to build a personalized calendar before the games start to plan your epic Olympic binge.\n\n\"I want to feel the snow in my face without leaving my house.\"\n\nIf you want the highest resolution, most immersive Olympic experience possible without traveling to Italy, do not miss 4K All-Day on NBC and Peacock on Sunday, Feb. 8 for 17 hours of 4K HDR coverage of both the Olympics and the Super Bowl. And download the Peacock app for your Meta Quest 3 or 3S headset to watch the Olympics in augmented reality, or check out the \"spatial cinema\" broadcast of the Olympics on your Apple Vision Pro.\n\nPro tip: NBC is rolling out a new streaming feature called Rinkside Live for Olympic hockey and figure skating. It lets viewers choose from multiple curated feeds of \"immersive, never-before-seen views.\"",

    "title": "Alysa Liu Quit Figure Skating to Focus on 'Living' Life. Now She's ‘More Excited’ Than Ever About the 2026 Olympics (Exclusive)",
    "description": "The U.S. figure skater tells PEOPLE how her time away from the sport revitalized her love for it",
    "fullText": "Alysa Liu is ready for her second Winter Olympics\n\nThe 20-year-old tells PEOPLE she is \"more excited\" than ever to compete, after taking a break following the 2022 Beijing Olympics\n\n“I was checked out. I was just there for the Olympic experience,\" she says about being a member of Team USA four years ago\n\nAlysa Liu has been here before — but not like this.\n\nThe U.S. figure skater, 20, will make her return to the Olympic stage next month with a newfound drive and sense of purpose after the shocking announcement following the 2022 Beijing Games that she would retire from the sport entirely.\n\nLiu's unexpected announcement caught many around the skating world off guard, since she was seen a rising star in the sport at just 16 years old. The California native had already medaled at the World Figure Skating Championships and was only expected to get better.\n\nBut after more than a year away from ice skating, Liu now tells PEOPLE exclusively that she’s “more excited” about figure skating than ever before — especially the last time the Olympics came around.\n\n“I was not there for the skating at all in my head,” Liu tells PEOPLE exclusively, looking back four years ago. “I was checked out. I was just there for the Olympic experience.”\n\nBut as Liu has explained in a number of media appearances in recent weeks, she had grown exhausted of the all-consuming lifestyle Olympic-level figure skating asks of its competitors and wanted a chance to step back and live what she described to NBC News as a “normal, teenage-girl, older-sister life.”\n\n“I really had nothing going on with my life, you know? Just training,” Liu said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. “I would live at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado, in a dorm by myself. I would eat their food. I went to the rink, skated, ate lunch there, skated some more. Went back to the dorm. I didn’t go anywhere. I didn’t see anything. I was just there,” she said. “And so all that, I was like, ‘Skating is not worth it.’ Like, this is not worth it.' ”\n\nSo after finishing short of the podium in 2022, Liu moved out of the Olympic Training Center in Colorado and moved on from figure skating. Or so she thought.\n\nFor nearly more than a year, Liu returned to a semi-normal teenage life: She went on vacation, spent time with family, graduated high school and began attending UCLA, where she now studies psychology. But during a 2024 ski trip with her family to Lake Tahoe, Liu found herself falling back in love with the adrenaline rush of winter sports, as she told NBC Sports, and felt a pull back to get back on the ice.\n\nIt wasn’t until early 2025 when Liu felt like she was fully invested in the sport for the first time.\n\n“That's when I was like, ‘I'm doing this for real,’ “ she tells PEOPLE with a reawakened excitement for the upcoming Winter Games in Italy.\n\nLiu says living her life and “doing a ton of other things,” including “trying out every hobby in existence” made her realize that her true calling was figure skating all along. “It made me realize what I like to do,” Liu says. “A lot of aspects in figure skating actually follow in line with my interests.”\n\nOne of which includes fashion design, something she’s taken the reins of herself after years of letting others consult and pick her outfits for her. The UCLA student says she’ll find herself up until 2 a.m. some nights after practice working out ideas for new costumes to wear on the ice. “In figure skating, we have these gorgeous dresses and I love to design them,” Liu says. “I work really closely with my dress designer on them, so that part of figure skating I like.”\n\nLiu’s redetermined grasp on figure skating has already proved fruitful with a stunning gold medal finish at the 2025 World Championships.\n\n“She hates this term, but we almost call it Alysa 2.0,” Phillip DiGuglielmo, Liu’s coach, told NBC. “It’s like a reboot, in a way.” Liu’s “reboot” already has critics listing her as a top contender to medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, alongside a strong Team USA that also includes Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito.\n\nLiu says her confidence level feels “more or less the same” as it did when she first stepped into the Olympic spotlight at 16 years old.\n\n“But I’m more excited for the figure skating part of it all now,” she says, thinking ahead to the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nGold or not, for Liu, simply getting back to the point of excitement has been an achievement far beyond what she might have imagined just four years ago.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

Our team for 2026 is now complete, and we're ready for the final push towards the Games.\"\n\nUK Sport believes Team GB could win between four and eight medals at next month's Games.\n\nAmong the GB medal hopes are Snowboard World Championship gold medallists Mia Brookes and Charlotte Bankes, and freestyle skier Zoe Atkin, the world champion in the women's halfpipe.\n\nThe nation's best medal haul at a Winter Games is five, achieved at Sochi 2014 and matched in Pyeongchang four years later, but Team GB came home from Beijing in 2022 with just two medals.\n\nThe BBC will broadcast more than 450 hours of live action from the Games, which run from Friday 6 to Sunday 22 February.",

    "description": "The U.S. speed skater tells PEOPLE about her and Team USA hockey star Hilary Knight's first dates during the 2022 Winter Olympics",
    "fullText": "Nearly a decade into her competitive speed skating career, Brittany Bowe finally achieved her dream of standing on an Olympic podium at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut when you ask her about her memories of that time, she’s quick to point out that it was actually falling for girlfriend Hilary Knight that stands out the most.\n\n“That was the biggest win coming out of Beijing for sure,” Bowe, 37, tells PEOPLE about meeting her partner, the U.S. women’s ice hockey captain, that February.\n\n“Hilary and I have known each other for a number of years through different Team USA events, a number of different Olympics, but that's the first time we really did have time to connect and get to know one another,” Bowe says. “And it was everything other than glamorous, that's for sure! Hilary would ask, like, ‘Oh, do you want to go for a walk after dinner?’ And that was our first date, going to walk around the Olympic Village masked because everyone was so fearful of getting COVID.”\n\nSoon, the couple’s walking dates became dinner dates.\n\n“[It was] a very unique way to meet someone, but it was also kind of cool because we felt like we were in this bubble,” Bowe recalls. “We didn't have the family, the friends, no outside distractions. And we really had a lot of time just to get to know each other.”\n\nFour years later, the two share a home in Salt Lake City, and will soon be packing their bags for what may be each of their final Winter Olympics. (They'll be leaving behind the fancy handmade Italian coffee machine they recently purchased to prepare for the trip: “We've been watching hours of videos,” Knight laughed to PEOPLE.)\n\nNow, however, their focus will both be on bringing home medals as part of Team USA – Bowe as a veteran member of the U.S. speed skating squad, and Knight as the captain of the U.S. women’s hockey team.\n\nBowe is excited for the 2026 Winter Games — particularly the return to fans in the stands, as they were still barred from attending in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“I know both of our families are really excited to watch both of us compete,” Bowe says. “My family's already got their hockey tickets, and her family's getting the speed skating tickets. So, just to have more people in the stands that love you, support you, are part of your journey — that will make it really special.”\n\nA Florida native who first took up inline skating after a local coach noticed her gliding down the rink at a friend’s birthday party, Bowe didn’t seriously consider ice skating until she found herself watching old friends from her inline days compete for Team USA at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n“My path to the Olympics is definitely not linear,” says the former Florida Atlantic University point guard, who set aside her plans to make it to the WNBA after becoming infatuated with ice skating during those 2010 Winter Games.\n\nDespite not being “an adrenaline junkie at all” when she’s off the ice, \"I love pushing myself to the limit\" in competition, Bowe says. She adds that winning is “an addiction” that gives her “no better feeling in the world.”\n\nAnd when the 2026 Winter Olympics come to a close, regardless of the outcome, her lifelong dream of having an Olympic career will have been accomplished.\n\n“More than anything, [I’m excited about] just being able to compete and represent my country,” Bowe says. “I can't think of a better way to end my career than with the flag on me and my family in the stands.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "fullText": "Snowboarder Scotty James parlayed a never-before-landed trick combination into his fifth straight X Games title on the halfpipe Saturday and tied Shaun White with eight overall gold medals at the biggest event this side of the Olympics.\n\nIn the final major contest before next month's Milan Cortina Games, the 31-year-old Aussie capped off his winning run with two straight backside 1440-degree jumps. That's two tricks spinning with his back facing down the hill to start, one while riding forward, the other riding backward — or “switch.” They are among the toughest on the halfpipe.\n\nJames briefly put his hand onto the snow to stay upright after the second jump, but the judges rewarded him anyway. His score of 95 easily beat second-place finisher Haku Shimasaki of Japan.\n\n“I felt I wanted to do something for myself and for halfpipe and to push backside riding as much as I can,” said Scott, who wore his trademark red boxing gloves and celebrated by crowd surfing into the hundreds of fans who watched the action in Aspen, Colorado. “Tonight, I think it always was the plan. I wanted to come out and do the first back-to-back backside 14s, and I'm pumped.”\n\nJames is looking like the favorite heading into the Milan Cortina Olympics. Last week, he won the Laax Open in Switzerland — a contest in which defending Olympic champion Ayumu Hirano suffered a nasty fall and broke bones in his face, throwing his status for next month's Olympic halfpipe contest into limbo.\n\nJames has Olympic silver and bronze medals. In a documentary on his life that dropped earlier this Winter, he made no secret that he needs the Olympic gold to round out an otherwise impeccable career.\n\nJames has also shown a triple cork — three head-over-heels flips — as part of his repertoire this season, though the back-to-back 1440s was something nobody had seen.\n\nHe said he has always admired groundbreakers, such as slopestyler Mark McMorris, 2014 Olympic halfpipe champion Iouri Podladtchikov (the iPod) and White, and wanted to use this latest X Games performance to add something new.\n\n“I get a chip on my shoulder every year, thinking maybe I wouldn't be expected to show up and try again and win again,” he said. “I managed to do that today, and I'm speechless, honestly.”\n\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina are finally taking place, with thousands of athlete federations heading to Italy before the event begins. As always, the Games commence with an opening ceremony, but this one has a special historical significance.\n\nFor the first time in Winter Olympics history, the Milan Cortina Opening Ceremony will adopt a multi-centered approach, allowing athletes at various competition venues across Italy to participate. While the main ceremony is scheduled at San Siro Olympic Stadium, athletes, spectators, and local communities nationwide will join the celebration through multiple athlete parades and two cauldrons.\n\nCertainly, each Opening Ceremony typically has a theme.

This theme celebrates Italian values, history, and culture, emphasizing their deep connection to the Olympic spirit.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about when the Olympics start, including the opening ceremony date, time, and schedule.\n\nOpening ceremony time: 2 p.m. ET\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympic Games will start on Friday, Feb. 6, with the opening ceremony.

Shaun White, three-time Olympic snowboarding champion, will join them in the broadcast booth.\n\nThe ceremony generally lasts about three hours, which is typical, though there isn't a fixed length. Later that evening, viewers can watch an \"enhanced encore\" at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics will take place in Italy from February 6th through the 22nd. Venues across Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo will host these events.\n\nThere are 15 Olympic venues spread across Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.

All of it is rewarding for a player who is on the up and up.\n\nOn top of being voted in as an All-Star starter, Maxey was the top vote getter among American-born players. That fact has to make one wonder whether the star guard would play for Team USA in the 2028 Olympics should the opportunity arise.\n\n\"I would love to play for Team USA,\" Maxey said on Monday. \"If I got that honor, it would be a blessing. I think it’s in LA, right? So, it’s in the United States. That would be really cool. Just to represent the country in the country and if that’s something that I have the opportunity to do, then I’ll definitely be there for it.\"\n\nMaxey will certainly be in the mix. One has to believe due to what he has done with the Sixers, he will be on Team USA's radar. The Olympic competition is heating up and one has to believe everything will come down to Maxey, Detroit Pistons star Cade Cunningham, and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in terms of the guards Team USA will look at.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers star Tyrese Maxey discusses 2028 Team USA Olympic possibility",
