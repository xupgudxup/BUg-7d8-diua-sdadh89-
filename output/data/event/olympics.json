    "title": "Winter Olympics 2026: How Milan Cortina Games will make history with two cauldron lightings at Opening Ceremony",
    "description": "For the first time in Olympics history, there will be two cauldrons at the Opening Ceremony.",
    "fullText": "History will be made at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics. During the Opening Ceremony Friday, Olympic torches will be used to light two separate cauldrons, the first time that's ever happened in the history of the event.\n\nThe lightings, which will take place simultaneously, will occur in two separate locations. One is located in Milan at the Arco della Pace. The second is located in Cortina d’Ampezzo in Piazza Dibona. Olympic organizers decided on two cauldrons as a way to show harmony and unity between both host cities of the 2026 Olympics.\n\nThe cauldrons are meant to evoke the work of Leonardo da Vinci, particularly his knots, which appeared in his paintings and manuscripts.\n\nWhile Olympic organizers have not announced the exact time the cauldrons will be lit, it will likely occur near the end of the Opening Ceremony, which will start at 2 p.m. ET and run for roughly three hours. That should result in the cauldrons being lit in the final 30-45 minutes of the Opening Ceremony on Friday.\n\nOlympic organizers tend to keep details about the Opening Ceremony a secret, so there's been no official announcement on who was chosen to light the two Olympic cauldrons Friday.\n\nTypically, the host country chooses current or former Olympic athletes for the honor. At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, French track and field star Marie-José Pérec, who won three gold medals during her career, was one of the two people selected to light the cauldron. The other was French judo gold medalist Teddy Riner, who also won three gold medals during his Olympic career.\n\nDuring the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, skier Zhao Jiawen and cross-country skier Dilnigar Ilhamjan were chosen for the honor. Both athletes took part in the 2022 Olympics, though did not medal in their events.\n\nItaly could turn to skiers Deborah Compagnoni and Alberto Tomba for the honor if it wanted to highlight successful Olympians from the past. Compagnoni and Tomba each won three gold medals at the Winter Olympics during their careers. Neither were selected to carry the torch leading up to the cauldron lightings, so it's possible organizers are saving Compagnoni and Tomba for this moment.\n\nThe Milan Cortina Opening Ceremony will take place Friday, Feb. 6, at roughly 2 p.m. ET. It will be 8 p.m. in Italy when the Opening Ceremony kicks off. The entire event is expected to take roughly three hours and will feature a parade of athletes from each country, as well as performances by Mariah Carey, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and Italian actor Sabrina Impacciatore.\n\nThe event will stream live on Peacock at 2 p.m. ET, and will be aired in primetime on NBC at 8 p.m. ET.",

    "fullText": "MILAN — A team full of star power, the United States women got a balanced attack, including two goals from their 13th forward and a hard-working goal from their fourth line, as the Americans opened the 2026 Olympics with a 5-1 win against the Czech Republic, also known as Team Czechia.\n\nIn just 6:45 of ice time, Hayley Scamurra scored two goals and fourth-liner Joy Dunne scored her first career Olympic goal as the United States rolled. Czech goalie Klára Peslarová was tested early and often, making 37 saves on 42 shots, while Aerin Frankel stopped all but one of the 14 shots she faced.\n\nThe game was played with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in attendance with his wife and kids, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Vance stood up and cheered for five American goals scored by Scamurra, Dunne, Alex Carpenter and Hilary Knight.\n\nCarpenter and Tessa Janecke each had two points. Defender Laila Edwards had an assist in her first-ever Olympic hockey game and became the first Black woman to play for the U.S. at an Olympic women’s hockey tournament.\n\nCzechia next plays Friday against Switzerland, while the Americans are at least scheduled to play Finland on Saturday.\n\nFinland’s game against Canada on Thursday was postponed until Feb. 12 due to a norovirus outbreak on the Finnish team. Thirteen players were quarantined at the athletes’ village after being either stricken by or exposed to the virus.\n\nUSA GM Katie Million said the IOC hasn’t given direction yet as to whether Saturday’s game will go on as scheduled, but there is a medical meeting scheduled for Thursday night and they hope more information will be shared.\n\nHeading into Thursday’s game, only Hockey Hall of Fame forwards Jayna Hefford and Hayley Wickenheiser had scored in five Winter Olympics. We can now add Hilary Knight, who is playing in her fifth and final Olympics, to that list.\n\nHer goal was a beauty as she took Carpenter’s pass in the neutral zone, lowered her shoulders and outhustled the defender to the net for her first goal of the tournament and to give Team USA a 4-1 lead.\n\nIt was Knight’s 13th goal at the Olympics, which puts her just one off the United States record held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. It was also her 28th point — four away from Jenny Potter’s all-time record.\n\nThe goal came after coach John Wroblewski tweaked the lines from the United States’ four Rivalry Series wins. He cited chemistry as the big reason he added Hannah Bilka to the top line alongside Carpenter and Knight; all three play together on a line for the PWHL Seattle Torrent. Britta Curl-Salemme was also moved up to the second line with Minnesota Frost teammate Taylor Heise and Abbey Murphy, while Janecke moved from first-line left wing to fourth-line center.\n\nAfter Wednesday’s practice, Wroblewski spoke about Joy Dunne and how it was only a matter of time that Dunne scored for Team USA.\n\nTo fact check the coach: Dunne has scored in a U.S. jersey, at the 2024 women’s world championship in Utica, but the point still stands. That it was only a matter of time before she found the back of the net in Milan.\n\nDunne is a player Wroblewski felt really earned her roster spot on the Olympic team through the little details of her game. She has size (5-foot-11) and incredible compete. She wins puck battles and she’s strong on the back check.\n\nSo even though she hadn’t scored since 2024, Wroblewski saw her as a valuable player to have on this talented roster — and someone to watch.\n\nThe goal came off a sweet setup from Janecke – the first of two goals in 1:23 as the Americans quickly turned a 1-0 lead into 3-0 to seize control.\n\nTwo minutes after taking an interference penalty on Edwards, Czech forward Barbora Jurickova jumped out of the penalty box to score Czechia’s lone goal of the game.\n\nJurickova, who started the game as the Czech’s 13th forward, skated in alone against Frankel with all five American power-play players pushing into the zone. As their time on the advantage expired, Abbey Murphy had a shot blocked and, on a beautiful play, Natálie Mlýnková spotted Jurickova coming out of the box.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nToronto Sceptres, Minnesota Frost, Vancouver Goldeneyes, New York Sirens, Montreal Victoire, Ottawa Charge, Seattle Torrent, Boston Fleet, NHL, Olympics, Women's Hockey, Women's Olympic Ice Hockey, Olympics, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "The Ohio State Buckeyes women's hockey team is currently No.2 in the country. However, they will be spending the next few weeks without one of their best players, Junior forward Joy Dunne. Dunne is in Italy right now, playing for Team USA at the Winter Olympics. And she is making the most of her time away from Columbus.\n\nIn Team USA's first game, a Group A round robin match against Czechia, Dunne picked up her first ever Olympic goal in her first ever Olympic game. Dunne's opportunity was created by Tessa Janecke (who currently plays for Penn State), who stole the puck in the offensive zone. Her push to the goal was turned away, but she got the puck behind the net before finding a slashing Dunne on a perfect centering pass. Dunne slammed the puck home for an easy goal and a 2-0 Team USA lead.\n\nTWO GOALS IN 83 SECONDS. The USA makes it 3-0 thanks to Joy Dunne and Hayley Scamurra!\n\n📺 USA & Peacock pic.twitter.com/pZjgx3PGAu\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 5, 2026\n\nLater in the second period, former Buckeye Hannah Bilka also assisted on a goal that stretched Team USA's lead to 4-1.

    "fullText": "All eyes are on Milan and Cortina as the 2026 Winter Olympics get underway. However, not all the news has been positive in the lead up to these Olympics, as frustrating construction issues have caused massive headaches around the rink set to host the men's and women's hockey tournaments.\n\nBack in December 2025, news broke that the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena was beset by construction issues that delayed tests of the rink. Originally, the rink was supposed to house Olympic-sized ice, but reports then surfaced that the arena will have an ice surface smaller than NHL standard, which is already smaller than the international dimensions. Not only that, there was reportedly no Plan B if the arena wasn't ready in time, which meant work had to be done around the clock to get Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena up and running.\n\nThen in January 2026, just a few short weeks away from the Olympics, reports surfaced that while the playing surface, practice facilities and dressing rooms were finished, other parts of the arena might not be done in time. The arena also is set to house fewer people than expected, as original plans had 16,000 seats in the arena while the latest count sits at 11,800 seats.\n\nThe doom and gloom over Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena's construction certainly cast a pall over the start of the Olympic festivities. However, based on recent reports, it seems as if things have fallen into place for the arena. The NHL was reportedly pleased by the mid-January ice test and members of the French team have since taken to the rink to practice with no glaring issues. French captain Pierre-Édouard Bellemare told The Associated Press that skating \"feel[s] like you're on a lake a little bit\" but overall the verdict was \"not bad\" even if some final touches still needed to be done.\n\nOf course, once fans get into the arena and more players and media begin to arrive, it's possible other issues arise or are brought to light. For now though, it seems as if the arena will be up and running to house the hockey tournaments this February.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: The Milan Cortina Olympic hockey arena issues, explained",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva's former coach is back at the Winter Olympics, this time working with a Georgian athlete, and the World Anti-Doping Agency isn't happy about it.\n\nWADA president Witold Banka said Thursday at the Milan Cortina Games that he's not comfortable with Eteri Tutberidze’s presence at the competition. She is accredited with Georgia as the coach of European champion Nika Egadze.\n\nValieva, then aged 15, was at the center of a legal battle during the 2022 Beijing Games when a sample she gave two months earlier tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine. The revelation came after Valieva won team gold with other Russian skaters. She was later disqualified from that event, which upgraded the United States to gold. Valieva was a contender for the women’s gold medal but placed fourth and was criticized rink-side by Tutberidze.\n\n“It’s not our decision the coach is here,” Banka said Thursday at a news conference in Milan. “The investigation found no evidence that this particular person was engaged in this doping process, so there’s no legal basis to exclude her from the presence during the Olympic Games.”\n\n“But of course, if you ask me personally about my feelings,” he continued, “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here in the Olympic Games, for sure.”\n\nThe Georgian Figure Skating Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nValieva's ban expired in December, despite legal efforts to have it overturned.\n\nRules have been changed to raise the minimum age for skaters to 17 in time for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

It was just not our time this year, but very well could have been.\n\n\"We have qualified for the World Championships in the relay so will be looking to make amends there in March.\"",

I had a few that slipped up, but I called myself a bad word, and moved on,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We're very happy with how we're performing and excited to get GB off on the right foot.\"\n\nHow Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear\n\nGB skeleton team appeal after new helmet shape ruled out",

This discrepancy exists because the IOC allows certain territories and dependencies to compete as independent entities, even if they lack full United Nations representation. For instance, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico send their own distinct Olympic delegations rather than competing as part of the United States.\n\nMORE: Inside the venues for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics\n\nThe IOC suspended Russia and Belarus from the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, but 12 athletes from those countries will still compete.

I thought it was over.

    "description": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympics athlete, you pick yourself up and try again.",
    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training; when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "fullText": "Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris crashed on Wednesday night and had to be stretchered off the course during big air training ahead of the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nIt's unclear what happened exactly, but the Canadian snowboard team described the crash as “heavy” in a statement. Specifics of McMorris' condition are not yet known, either.\n\n“Snowboarder Mark McMorris had a heavy crash this evening during big air training,” the team said in a statement on social media. “Canadian Olympic Committee and Canada Snowboard staff are attending to him. We will provide more information as it becomes available.”\n\nThe 32-year-old is making his fourth Olympic appearance for Canada. Qualifying for the big air competition is set for Thursday night, one day before the Opening Ceremony. It’s unknown if McMorris will be able to compete anymore.\n\nMcMorris has won three bronze medals in his Olympics career. He claimed third in slopestyle in each of the past three Olympics, and he finished in 10th in the big air competition in both the PyeongChang Olympics in 2018 and the Beijing Olympics in 2022. He has won four of his 12 X Games gold medals in the big air competition, too, which was only added to the Olympics in 2018. In the big air competition at the Olympics, riders take off from a ramp that is more than 165 feet tall.\n\nMcMorris, per the CBC, suffered life-threatening injuries after he slammed into a tree during a backcountry ride in 2017. That resulted in him having a rod placed in his leg, a plate in his arm and another plate in his jaw. Despite that and other significant injuries, McMorris said last month that he felt he was in good health entering these Games.\n\nThe men’s big air final is set for Saturday night at the Livigno Snow Park. Qualification for the men’s slopestyle will start on Monday, Feb. 16.",

Please do not exploit me in your political agendas.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump last year referred to Khelif as a \"male boxer\" after he had signed an executive order that prevents transgender women from competing in female categories of sports.\n\nA new body, World Boxing, was granted provisional recognition as the sport's international governing federation by the IOC in February 2025.\n\nIt has introduced mandatory genetic tests for athletes to \"determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete\".\n\nWhen announcing the change, it cited Khelif - and later apologised for that.\n\nKhelif lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) over World Boxing's introduction of mandatory tests in August.\n\nA hearing on that case is still pending.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds overcame a power cut and the loss of the first end to get Team GB's Winter Olympics off to a winning start in the mixed doubles curling against Norway.\n\nThe Scottish duo, who are considered serious medal contenders in this event, cut relaxed figures inside the quirky, partially-wooden Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium in Italy, which was built for the 1956 Games.\n\nEven the loss of light in parts of the venue during an ugly opening end didn't discomfit last year's world silver medallists, who took three in the second end and would never trail again in the first of their nine round-robin matches.\n\nMouat and Dodds ultimately won 8-6 to right the wrongs of the 2022 semi-final, in which they spurned a lead to lose to the Norwegian pair before going on to be beaten by Sweden in the bronze-medal match.\n\nAnd it sets them up nicely for Thursday's ties against Estonia (09:05 GMT) and the Czechs (18:05) - both of whom lost their openers - live across the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nThe pounding music and disco lights lent a sense of occasion to the first action of this year's Games in the high-end Italian resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nThe snow which had hammered down all day in the Dolomites had turned to sleet by the time the four matches started in front of a healthy crowd inside the 3,500-capacity arena.\n\nBut many of those spectators were cast into darkness for four or five minutes early on until someone put some change in the meter, the scoring screens flickered back into life and play resumed.\n\n\"I didn't mind the lights going off,\" said Mouat. \"It was a bit of a boogie, a rave... it was like a nightclub.\"\n\nWhen the dancing stopped, Norway's husband and wife team of Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien initially took control before the sides fell into a cagey contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds seized the initiative in a splendid second end - the final accounting reached after some lengthy deliberation with the measuring stick - and led 4-3 at the break after edging a tight fourth against the 2002 silver medallists.\n\nThe interval did check the momentum of the childhood friends a little, as Norway - who also won bronze in 2018 - drew level again.\n\nNedregotten's flawless play was keeping Norway in it - wife Skaslien's struggles threatening a little domestic disharmony - but even his efforts could not prevent Team GB snatching three in the sixth end thanks to a stunning Dodds throw.\n\nThat opened a three-shot lead with two ends to play.\n\nAnd, although the Norwegians invoked the powerplay to cut the deficit to one, Mouat and Dodds did likewise in the last end to close out a statement 8-6 win.\n\n\"It took us a bit of time to work out one end was curling more than the other, but once we did we took a step up in performance and took control from there,\" Dodds said.\n\n\"It's a good confidence builder to start the week.\"",

    "description": "The \"Today\" anchor stepped away from Milano Cortina coverage as her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, remains missing",
    "fullText": "Sports commentator and former tennis player Mary Carillo will replace Savannah Guthrie as co-host of the NBC’s Opening Ceremony for the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games after the “Today” host pulled out, following her mother’s disappearance.\n\nGuthrie had been originally scheduled to host the Opening Ceremony with Terry Gannon, who will remain on. Ahmed Fareed will now host “Olympic Late Night” from Feb. 7 to 9, replacing Craig Melvin.\n\nMelvin will remain stateside rather than traveling to Milan for the Games.\n\n“Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family. They continue to have our full support,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented commentators who will step in and fill these roles.”\n\n“Mary is one of the most experienced Olympic commentators ever and a master storyteller,” she added. “She and Terry will lead the American audience through one of the world’s greatest global moments. With his skill and versatility, Ahmed has proven time and again he can step into any hosting role, and we’re thrilled he’s available to handle our late night coverage before heading to Los Angeles for NBA All-Star Weekend.”\n\nThe Milan Games will be Carillo’s 17th Olympics that she has covered — she was already scheduled to be a correspondent in Milan. Of Italian descent herself, the commentator has a personal connection with the host city. This year will be her 14th Olympic assignment with NBC.\n\nAs previously announced, Shaun White will join the Opening Ceremony commentators in the booth during the Parade of Athletes. Following her Opening Ceremony duties, Carillo will cover the Games as a SportsDesk reporter.\n\nGuthrie’s 84-year-old mother Nancy has been missing since late Saturday night. The case has escalated from a missing-person to a suspected abduction with authorities saying they found signs of forced entry in her Arizona home.\n\nLive coverage of the Opening Ceremony begins Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, with primetime coverage scheduled for 8 p.m. ET/PT on both NBC and Peacock.\n\nThe post NBC Sports Taps Mary Carillo to Fill In for Savannah Guthrie at Winter Olympics appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - have been told their helmets do not meet safety standards only days out from the competition starting.\n\nThe British team have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for sport (Cas) after the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) said the helmets \"did not comply with the IBSF skeleton rules based on its shape\".\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) said the helmet was designed with safety in mind.\n\nThe team would currently not be able to wear the helmets in competition, but the Cas ruling will be heard on Thursday, with the result expected on Friday, before competition begins on 12 February.\n\nThe British skeleton team enjoyed a successful 2024-25 season, with Matt Weston winning overall World Cup gold and Marcus Wyatt silver, winning all seven races between them.\n\nThat success came using a different helmet, and the BBSA told BBC Sport the helmet it had hoped to use for the Games in Italy is a new design for the 2026-27 season, which begins towards the end of the year.\n\nIt said it has tried to be \"innovative\" with the new design, which it believes to \"be in the current rules\".\n\nIt said the new helmet has been designed to comply with new rules imposed by the IBSF for the 2026-27 season, which are aimed at improving safety, and that it is proven to be safer than any other helmets being used.\n\nThe rules set out the safety standards helmets must meet and have stipulations about the shape. For example, the helmet must not have any additionally attached aerodynamic elements.\n\nThe team wore the new helmets last week at a training session in Switzerland but have also brought the old helmets to Cortina.\n\nAt the 2010 Games the USA and Canada lodged a protest moments after British slider Amy Williams won the gold medal, alleging the small ridges on her helmet were illegal, but the protest was thrown out.\n\nAt the 2018 Games British medallists Lizzy Yarnold, Laura Deas and Dom Parsons wore specialised skin suits featuring drag-resistant ridges, the legality of which was also questioned by rival teams.\n\nWeston is the heavy favourite for the gold medal in Cortina, with the men's event beginning on 12 February and the women's on 13 February.\n\nLizzy Yarnold, two-time British skeleton Olympic champion\n\nThere will always be a different kit which is being worked on - whether it's the helmets, the sled, the suits itself - they will all go through a process of making sure that they abide by the rules and it's the best kit possible for the athletes.\n\nI think there's always likely to be noise around equipment. The British team wore this helmet in Switzerland last week, so it's not a hidden thing.\n\nBut the noise around it is almost very anticipated, because whenever you bring in new equipment it has to go through the process of being checked.\n\nWhether there is an element of gamesmanship having a new helmet, I don't think that is at play.\n\nI don't know whether the athletes will have a preference on which helmet they use but they know they are performing well and can still perform well with the old helmet.\n\nThey will be happy with all of the different versions of equipment, so their role is simply just focusing on the matter at hand.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Olympics stand as the most prestigious sporting event worldwide.\n\nEvery two years, athletes from hundreds of nations gather in a single location, alternating between summer and winter Games. They compete for medals and national pride, pushing the world's top competitors.\n\nItaly is honored to host the 2026 Winter Olympics from February 6 to February 22. This will be Italy's fourth time hosting the Olympics and its first since 2006.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2026 Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nMORE: Who are the biggest USA Olympic hockey snubs?\n\nThe 2026 Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo has previously hosted the Olympics, but only the Summer Games. This is the first time Milan is hosting the Olympics, and it is also Cortina d'Ampezzo's first time hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nHere's a list of each time Italy has hosted the Olympics:\n\nMilan and Cortina d'Ampezzo host 15 Olympic venues. Below is a full list of the sports scheduled at each location.\n\nMilano San Siro Olympic Stadium\n\nMilano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nCortina Curling Olympic Stadium\n\nCurling, wheelchair curling, Paralympic closing ceremony\n\nAlpine skiing, para alpine skiing\n\nTesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium\n\nCross-country skiing, Nordic combined, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing\n\nAlpine skiing, ski mountaineering\n\nOlympic closing ceremony, Paralympic opening ceremony\n\nThe time difference can significantly affect viewers wanting to watch the Olympic Games. Fortunately, the Winter Games pose less of a challenge for those in the Eastern Time Zone. Italy is six hours ahead of EST and nine hours ahead of Pacific Time.\n\nThe 2021 Tokyo Olympics experienced a harsh 14-hour time difference, making viewing difficult. In contrast, the 2026 Games will be more accessible for U.S. fans to watch live without disrupting their sleep routines.\n\nMORE: When will the Olympics be in USA?\n\nHosting the Olympic Games is a great honor, but it comes with high costs. The organizers of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics have announced an operating budget of approximately \"1.7 billion euros\" ($1.9 billion).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will provide approximately $1 billion in extra funding for the February 6-22 Games. At the same time, the Italian government is investing over $1 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance access to the venues.\n\nAlthough this appears substantial, Russia reportedly invested $51 billion to host the 2014 Sochi Games, a cost that is expected to remain an Olympic record for many years to come.\n\nThe Milano Cortina Olympics will welcome thousands of athletes from across the world for the 2026 Winter Games. They'll stay in one of the six Olympic Villages spread across northern Italy.\n\nThe locations include Milan, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo, Anterselva (Antholz), and Cortina.\n\nIt is said that after the games, some villages will be converted into student housing.",

    "description": "The Panthers star gets some news.",
    "fullText": "Sam Bennett may have been the most notable snub from Team Canada's Olympic hockey roster.\n\nTurns out, the Florida Panthers star will be playing in the Olympics anyway.\n\nBennett was added to the roster as an injury replacement on Tuesday. The Lightning's Anthony Cirelli was hurt in the Stadium Series game on Sunday and will have to miss the tournament.\n\nBennett was just injured, too, but TSN's Darren Dreger says it was \"nothing serious.\" The news of Bennett as a replacement for Cirelli, and no announcement about the Panthers' injured Brad Marchand, may be a good sign for Marchand's chances of also suiting up at the Olympics.\n\nMORE: How Connor McDavid is to the Oilers what Josh Allen is to the Bills\n\nCirelli, as a faceoff guy and penalty-killing type, had a very specific role for the Canadian team. Bennett fits that pretty well, and he does bring a type of grit that Cirelli also has.\n\nBennett is a winner. He has been a part of back-to-back Stanley Cup championships with the Panthers. He was also on Canada's victorious 4 Nations Faceoff team.\n\nAt 29 years old, this may have been Bennett's best chance of making an Olympic team.\n\nThis season in 55 games with the Panthers, Bennett has 19 goals, 23 assists and 101 blocks shots.\n\nMORE: How Olympic roster freeze may create a second NHL trade deadline\n\nTeam Canada squeezed Bennett off the initial roster because it decided to keep both Bo Horvat and Nick Suzuki on the initial roster.\n\nHopefully, Bennett didn't make any plans for the Olympic break. Because after it was in doubt, he has some hockey to be played and a gold medal to chase.\n\nBilly Heyen is a freelance writer with The Sporting News. He is a 2019 graduate of Syracuse University who has written about many sports and fantasy sports for The Sporting News. Sports reporting work has also appeared in a number of newspapers, including the Sandusky Register and Rochester Democrat & Chronicle",

    "fullText": "American downhill skier Lindsey Vonn says she has ruptured her left anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) but is still \"very hopeful\" she can compete at the Winter Olympics in Italy.\n\nThe 41-year-old was airlifted to hospital in Switzerland on Friday after crashing in the final World Cup race before the Games.\n\nThe former Olympic champion said her knee feels \"stable, strong and is not swollen\" and she feels \"confident\" she will make the women's downhill event in Cortina on Sunday.\n\n\"This is obviously not what I hoped for. I have been working really hard to come into these Games in a much different position,\" she said in a media conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"I know what my chances were before the crash and I know that my chances aren't the same as it stands now, but I know there is still a chance.\n\n\"As long as there is a chance, I'll try. That's where I am.\"\n\nThe four-time world champion retired from the sport in 2019 but made a stunning comeback in December 2024 following a partial replacement of her right knee.\n\nShe arrived in Cortina at the top of the World Cup downhill standings, with two race wins and three more podium finishes, and as one of the favourites for the gold medal.",

So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"\n\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein prior to his death in custody in 2019.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said in a statement obtained by news agency AFP.\n\nHe also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Epstein\".\n\n\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" Wasserman said.\n\n\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nWhile the files do not show any wrongdoing on the part of those featured, including Wasserman, they have raised renewed questions for those who associated with the influential financier.\n\nThe BBC has approached Wasserman for comment.\n\nWasserman founded a sports and entertainment agency in 2002, and is a trustee of the non-profit Clinton Foundation, according to the Olympics website.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell agreed last month to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.\n\nThe committee also summoned both former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify.\n\nThe former president appeared in photographs with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.\n\nEpstein, who was convicted of sexual offences in 2008, was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn’s status for the Winter Olympics is uncertain. While competing in her final downhill event before the upcoming world competition, Vonn crashed on the course and had to be airlifted to a nearby facility for treatment.\n\nThe skier lost control while attempting to land a jump during a World Cup downhill event, becoming tangled in the safety nets lining the course. When Vonn was able to get up, she was limping and favoring her left knee, using her poles to steady herself.\n\nHere are the latest injury updates for Vonn following her crash while preparing for the Winter Olympics.\n\nMORE: When do the Winter Olympics start\n\nVonn released a statement on her Instagram. She said, \"I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams. This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics...but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over. I will give more information when I have it. It's not over until it's over.\"\n\nVonn, as expected, did not race in Saturday's Super-G race. Her skiing coach, Chris Knight texted the Associated Presssaying that Vonn \"is preparing for Cortina as usual.\" Vonn herself posted on Instagram, announcing her withdrawal from the Super-G race and said that she is \"doing my best right now...\"\n\nThe U.S. Ski team also released a statement on Friday, backing up Vonn. \"Lindsey Vonn crashed in today's Cras Montana World Cup downhill and injured her left knee, however her Olympic dream isn't over yet.\"\n\nVonn had been running the fastest time at the first checkpoint before her injury. She landed a jump off-balance, then lifted her left arm and pole to try to regain her balance, and tried to brake. This caused her to be spun around, and she ended up in the nets.\n\nReports suggest that Vonn had an \"anxious expression\" and had a long embrace with teammate Jacquelin Wiles before going into the medical tent for treatment.\n\nMORE: Why were \"Heated Rivalry\" stars chosen as Winter Olympic torchbearers?\n\nVonn was competing in her final downhill competition before the Winter Olympics. She had gone over a jump, but didn't land correctly. Vonn was trying to regain her balance, but ended up spinning out and sliding down the course. Unable to control herself, she slid hard into the protective netting in what looked like a bad crash.\n\nWishing Lindsey Vonn a speedy recovery following her crash in Crans-Montana ❤️ pic.twitter.com/hZ6PcPVvW3\n\n— TNT Sports (@tntsports) January 30, 2026\n\nAfter being checked by medical personnel, Vonn was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nHere is video confirmation of Lindsey Vonn being airlifted to the hospital after her crash.\n\nHeartbreaking. #FISAlpine | #WorldCupCransMontanapic.twitter.com/Ck2oNc9lff\n\n— Team USA Olympics Updates and Coverage (@TeamUSAOLYCov) January 30, 2026\n\nVonn was also not the only one to crash. Three different competitors crashed, including Vonn.  Austria's Nine Ortlieb and Norway's Marte Monsen also crashed. Ortlieb crashed in the same area as Vonn, and Monsen nearly made it to the end before crashing into the nets and had to be taken away in a sled.\n\nFrench skier Romaine Miradoli completed her run, but said that the snow falling caused bad visibility issues. She said, \"You can't see, and it's bumpy everywhere.\" When pressed further and asked if the course was dangerous, Miradoli responded, \"We just couldn't see well.\"\n\nThe event was cancelled after Vonn's crash, per the AP.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team USA winter Olympic hockey team\n\nVonn was checked by the onsite medical team, but further evaluation was needed, especially given her knee favoring. Due to winter conditions and snow, she was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nMORE: Meet the USA Olympic figure skating team for the Winter Olympics\n\nThe International Ski and Snowboard Federation CEO Urs Lehmann told reporters, \"I know she hurt her knee, I talked to her. I don’t know if it’s really heavy and (if) she won’t miss the Olympics. Let’s wait for what the doctors are saying.”\n\nVonn's first scheduled event is the women's downhill on February 8.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team Canada's Winter Olympic team\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics are set for Friday, February 6.

    "description": "Olympics fans can expect a unique dual-city setting, new events and even a new sport, and more TV coverage here in the United States than ever.",
    "fullText": "Summon the heroes! The 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are almost here, and athletes from around the world are heading to northern Italy in hopes of skating, skiing, snowboarding, and sledding their way to the medal podium.\n\nAnd this year’s games are different from previous editions of the Winter Olympics, with a unique dual-city setting, new events, and even a new sport, and more TV coverage here in the United States than ever.\n\nHere are those details and more.\n\nFor the first time in Olympic history, two cities are hosting the games: Milan, Italy’s second-largest city, and Cortina d’Ampezzo, an Italian ski resort more than 250 miles away. And the action will play out at more than a dozen venues in those cities and elsewhere in northern Italy.\n\nAs NBC News reports, Milan will host ice skating, speed skating, ice hockey, and the opening ceremony; Cortina will host Alpine skiing, bobsled, curling, and luge; the Anterselva/Antholz region will host biathlon and cross-country skiing; Livigno will host freestyle skiing and snowboarding; Bormio will host men’s Alpine skiing and ski mountaineering; Tesero will host cross-country skiing; Predazzo will host ski jumping; and Verona will host the closing ceremonies.\n\nThe 2026 games are introducing ski mountaineering as a new Olympic sport, according to an Olympics.com FAQ. With medals awarded for men’s and women’s sprints and a mixed-gender relay, “skimo” has athletes alternating between racing on skis and racing on foot as they navigate a mountainous course.\n\nSki mountaineering is the only new sport at this year’s games, but viewers will see new events in returning Olympic sports: Women’s Doubles in luge, Women’s Large Hill in ski jumping, Mixed Team in skeleton, Men’s and Women’s Dual Moguls in freestyle skiing, and Team Combined in alpine skiing.\n\nBoth the 2026 Olympic Winter Games and the ensuing Paralympic Winter Games will award gold, silver, and bronze medals imagined by the Milano Cortina 2026 design team and crafted by the Italian State Mint and Polygraphic Institute (IPZS) using recycled metal recovered from production waste, per Olympics.com.\n\nThe medal design features interlocking halves representing several dual concepts, according to NBC Olympics. Those dual concepts include Milan and Cortina, urban and alpine, Olympic and Paralympic, and the athletes and the teams behind them.\n\nMilano Cortina 2026 medals revealed!\n\nThe medals for the Olympic Winter Games @milanocortina26 have a unique design that combines two halves symbolising the athlete’s journey and all those who have walked beside them along the way.\n\nDiscover: https://t.co/EiFV2cgObf pic.twitter.com/wFAlxAJ4YS\n\n— IOC MEDIA (@iocmedia) July 15, 2025\n\nEighty-six delegations will represent their home countries at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes who meet International Olympic Committee specifications will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, according to Sports Illustrated. Making their Winter Olympics debut at the 2026 games are Benin, Guinea-Bissau, and the United Arab Emirates, the magazine adds.\n\nThis year’s Olympic and Paralympic Games boast an emblem dubbed “Futura,” representing the number “26” drawn in a single motion. “Influenced by the themes of sport, solidarity and sustainability, ‘Futura’ illustrates a dynamic and modern design that reflects some of the fundamental values of the Olympic and the Paralympic Winter Games,” IOC Milano Cortina 2026 Coordination Commission Chair Sari Essayah said in a statement, per Olympics.com.\n\nThe Milano Cortina 2026 organizing committee’s choice of motto for the 2026 Olympics and Paralympics is “IT’s your vibe,” with “IT” capitalized as a play on Italy’s country code, according to the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThe mascots of the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are the stoats Milo and Tina, named after the two host cities. Tina is the Olympic mascot, a white stoat who “believes in the power of beauty.” And Milo is the Paralympic mascot, a brown stoat who was born without one paw but “learned to use his tail and turn his difference into a strength,” Olympics.com explains. The two stoats will be joined by six snowdrop flowers symbolizing rebirth and collectively called The Flo.\n\nNearly four years ago, the song “Fino all’alba” (“Until the Dawn”) won a song contest in Italy to become the official anthem for the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, according to Inside the Games. The song, which received 72 percent of the vote, is the work of the La Cittadina of San Pietro Martire, a youth music group in the town of Seveso, Italy.\n\nIn a press release, NBCUniversal touts that it will provide the biggest Winter Olympics ever with the media corporation’s most comprehensive Winter Games coverage, totaling more than 3,200 hours in all. NBC’s Primetime in Milan will offer three hours of coverage each night, and NBC is also extending coverage into daytime to provide more Olympics programming hours on the network than it did for any previous Winter Games. Peacock, meanwhile, will stream live coverage of every event in every sport. And USA Network and CNBC, two cable channels now owned by Versant following that company’s spinoff from NBCUniversal, will also carry coverage of the games.\n\n2026 Winter Olympic Games, February 6 through February 22, NBC, Peacock, USA Network & CNBC\n\n2026 Winter Paralympic Games, March 6 through March 15, NBC, Peacock, USA Network & CNBC\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "fullText": "The 25th Winter Olympics is almost here – it's back in Europe and will feature a record 116 medal events, three of which will be in the new sport of ski mountaineering.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nGreat Britain have never won more than five medals – or more than one gold – at a single Winter Olympics, but that could change in 2026.\n\nMedal 'targets' have become medal 'ranges' at recent Olympics, and for Milan-Cortina the funding body UK Sport is hoping GB athletes will win between four and eight medals, while Team GB chef de mission Eve Muirhead says there is an \"opportunity to get the most we ever have\".\n\nBritish athletes won nine medals at the most recent World Championships in Winter Olympic sports – across bobsleigh, curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton and snowboard.\n\nAnd that does not include the likes of snowboarder Mia Brookes and freestyle skier Kirsty Muir who have won World Cup events this season and are considered genuine medal hopes.\n\nHowever, GB set a target of three to seven medals for the 2022 Winter Olympics and that did not go to plan. The team did not win anything until the final weekend, when they picked up a gold and silver in curling, avoiding embarrassment but falling short of expectations.\n\nThe Winter Olympics have come a long way since their 1924 debut, which featured 11 female athletes – and roughly 25 times more men.\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee (IOC),, external about 1,300 female athletes will be at Milan-Cortina. Of the 116 medal events, 50 will be in women's competition (the most ever) and 12 will be mixed. The upshot is that women will compete in a Winter Games-record 53.4% of all medal events.\n\nTwelve of the 16 disciplines will be fully gender-balanced in athlete numbers – another Games record. Among the new women's events are luge doubles and the ski jumping individual large hill, while there is also a mixed skeleton relay.\n\nThere is another sign of the progress made with equality: these Games are the first to be overseen by new IOC president Kirsty Coventry, the first woman to be elected to the organisation's most powerful position.\n\nBut there is still work to be done: Nordic combined remains the sole Winter Olympic sport not open to women, with the IOC deciding in 2022 not to include a women's event, external on the 2026 programme despite lobbying from leading athletes.\n\nIce hockey is one of the biggest draws of the Winter Olympics, and the return of NHL stars after an absence of 12 years has only heightened the anticipation.\n\nNHL-contracted players were denied a chance to compete at the 2018 Games while Covid put paid to their 2022 participation – and even 2026 has been touch and go after major issues with the readiness of the main rink and the condition of the ice.\n\nThe return of NHL players has also reignited the USA's hopes of a first Olympic men's ice hockey title since the 1980 'Miracle on Ice' gold – further boosted by the fact that Russia are banned from competing.\n\nHowever, although NHL sides are all based in either the USA or Canada, it's not just those countries who benefit from players from the league being at the Winter Olympics. All but one of the 12 teams at the Olympics will have NHL representation, with 2022 champions Finland and semi-finalists Slovakia and Sweden having rosters well stocked with NHL players.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo will become the fourth location to host the Winter Olympics twice, following St Moritz (1928 & 1948), Innsbruck (1964 & 1976) and Lake Placid (1932 & 1980).\n\nThe growth of the Winter Olympics from 1956 to 2026 – five times as many events and almost four times as many athletes – means it would be impossible today for a ski resort like Cortina to stage the Olympics single-handedly. The 2026 Games will be the most geographically widespread, with events in multiple regions and cities, including Milan, which is Italy's second biggest city.\n\nThe IOC also prizes sustainability, and spreading events around – something president Kirsty Coventry says will be \"the new normal\", external – meaning less new infrastructure is required.\n\nOne venue that will be 'recycled' in 2026 is Cortina's Olympic Ice Stadium. In 1956, it staged the opening ceremony, ice hockey and the figure skating, the last time that competition was held outdoors. Seventy years later, and now with a roof, it will host the curling.\n\nNot since 2018 has there been a new name at the top of the list of most Winter Olympic golds, but 2026 could change that.\n\nGerman lugers Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win their seventh and eighth golds in Milan-Cortina, which would move them level with the Norwegian trio of biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen and cross country skiers Bjorn Daehlie and Marit Bjorgen.\n\nIt would arguably be a greater achievement as biathlon and cross country skiing offer more medal opportunities than luge. Daehlie, Bjorgen and Bjorndalen won gold in 53%, 33% and 30% respectively of the Olympic events they competed in. The 'Two Tobis' have won all six of theirs (100%).\n\nBut they could all be overtaken by another cross country skier, Johannes Hosflot Klaebo, who is already a five-time Olympic champion. The Norwegian won all six titles, external at last season's World Championships – similar form at the Olympics could power him to the top of the all-time golds leaderboard.\n\nHosting an Olympics usually results in a boost in medals – but it's not always the case, as Italy discovered the last time they hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006.\n\nThey had won 13 medals in 2002 in Salt Lake City but only managed 11 in Turin – although they did win five golds as opposed to four in the USA four years previously.\n\nThe Italian Olympic Committee has set a minimum target of 19 medals, which is one short of their biggest haul of 20. That was achieved in 1994 – including a record seven golds – when their team included the likes of skiing greats Alberto Tomba, Deborah Compagnoni and Stefania Belmondo.\n\nItaly's 2026 hopes have already suffered a few setbacks, with flagbearer Federica Brignone, external and freestyle skier Flora Tabanelli, external both fighting fitness battles while another alpine hope, Marta Bassino,, external has already been ruled out.\n\nBut there are others with golden credentials, including speed skater Davide Ghiotto, snowboarder Maurizio Bormolini and curling pair Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini.\n\nAnd there's always Arianna Fontana – at the age of 15, the short track skater won bronze in Turin in 2006. Now 20 years later, she is Italy's most successful Winter Olympian, and aiming to win a medal at a sixth consecutive Games.\n\nBBC Sport to show 450 hours of Winter Olympics\n\nJeffries and Pendry complete 53-strong GB squad\n\nUS to send ICE agents to Winter Olympics, prompting Italian anger",

    "fullText": "Sunday, February 8, will be a legendary day for sports fans because of Super Bowl LX, and the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games will be happening on the same day. But also for NBC and their streaming platform, Peacock, as they will be presenting both events live all day in 4K HDR. Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "description": "NBC is the broadcast home of Super Bowl LX, the Winter Olympics, and much more in 2026. We'll show you how to watch NBC without cable.",
    "fullText": "NBC has long been a popular channel to have in your TV line-up, but the network's upcoming broadcasts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LX make it all but necessary. Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to live stream the network, even if you don't have cable or an antenna. Keep reading to learn how to watch NBC online.\n\nNBC is the home of beloved sitcoms such as \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\" and flagship procedurals like the \"Law & Order\" and \"Chicago\" universes. In addition to a massive selection of currently airing scripted programming (in addition to series like \"Saturday Night Live\"), the network has become a key player in the news and sports scene. The \"Today\" show and NBC News have long been among the network's main draws, but NBC has increasingly invested in sports over the years, becoming a must-have destination for fans of the NFL, NBA, and the Olympics. NBC is also the broadcast home of flagship events, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl LX, and the 2026 Emmy Awards.\n\nWhether you're hoping to stream NBC live or get caught up with past network programming on-demand, we've got you covered. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about tuning in to the network without cable, including a breakdown of NBCUniversal's direct streaming service, Peacock.\n\n*NBC is only available in select regions on Sling.\n\nNBC's direct streaming counterpart is Peacock, a one-stop shop for all things NBCUniversal. There are three tiers of service, ranging from Peacock Select ($8 a month) to Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month). Select is fairly pared-down and doesn't offer live events, so we recommend Premium or Premium Plus to unlock the full suite of on-demand offerings from the streaming service.\n\nPeacock has a massive collection of-demand seasons of NBC and Bravo shows, among other programming. New episodes typically land on the streaming service the day after their linear broadcast, so if you don't mind waiting a day (and watching with ads), the $11 a month Premium option should do the trick. However, if you'd like to stream NBC live and watch on-demand programming without ads, you'll need Peacock Premium for $17 a month. Both Premium and Premium Plus will carry the Super Bowl and the Olympics.\n\nPeacock Premium Plus subscription is $17 a month. The extra cost gets rid of most ads, allows you to download select titles, and also comes with your local NBC channel.\n\nDirecTV is another solid way to live stream NBC, along with other popular channels. In our guide to the best live TV streaming services, DirecTV ranks as the best cable alternative. NBC is available in several packages, including all signature plans and a couple of cheaper genre packs. Signature plans start at $90 a month for the Entertainment plan, which carries NBC and 90+ other channels (including pretty much anything you'd find in a standard cable plan).\n\nNBC is also available in MyNews and MySports genre packs. MyNews costs $40 a month and comes with 10+ popular news channels, while MySports costs $70 a month and offers around 20 sports networks and access to ESPN Unlimited. All DirecTV plans come with a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nIf you're looking for more of a budget-friendly pick, Sling TV will also allow you to live stream NBC and a handful of other channels. It's a great budget live TV service, but it's important to note that local channel coverage (like NBC) varies from region to region, so you should see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. NBC-friendly plans (where available) include Sling Select and Sling Blue.\n\nSling Select offers around 10 channels and costs $25 a month when local networks are involved. Sling Blue carries 40+ channels and costs $50 a month for those with local channel access. If you're looking for a more comprehensive cable alternative, you can get Sling Orange + Blue for $65 a month.\n\nFor just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 Winter Olympics will kick off in Milano Cortina, Italy, beginning on Friday, Feb. 6. With more than 3,200 hours of winter sports coverage spread across broadcast, cable, and digital streaming platforms, finding what you want to watch can feel like a full-time job. So here's where and when you can watch the Olympics.\n\nWatching the Olympics is a deeply personal experience. Some love the technical precision of a perfect luge run; others dig the emotional narrative of an underdog’s journey to the podium; and some just want to catch the meme of the week as it happens. Because everyone's \"perfect Olympics\" is unique, I’ve also put together a viewing guide designed for the way you might want to experience the 2026 Games.\n\nNBCUniversal has the exclusive rights to show the Olympics in the U.S. this year, and the network is practically going all-Olympics from the opening ceremony on Feb. 6 to the closing on Feb. 22. If you're watching the Olympics in the old-school \"turn on the TV\" way, the 2026 Winter Olympics are on broadcast channel NBC and cable channels CNBC and USA Network. If you're streaming the games, you'll be doing it from Peacock.\n\nDuring primetime, NBC is showing Primetime in Milan, three hours of curated Olympics coverage, nightly, beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT, except Super Bowl Sunday, when Primetime in Milan will start at 10:45 p.m. ET.\n\nIn the daytime, NBC will be broadcasting five hours of coverage daily focusing mainly on more popular Winter Olympics coverage like snowboarding, skiing, figure skating, and hockey. Daytime Olympics programming will begin at 7 a.m. ET most days, and continue through the early afternoon, depending on the daily lineup.\n\nNBC is also airing a nightly wrap-up of each day's events after the local news; the Olympics' opening ceremony on Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET; live coverage of the closing ceremonies at 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 22, with an encore showing at 9 p.m.; and 4K Olympics coverage on Super Bowl Sunday, beginning at 7 a.m. ET.\n\nNBC-owned cable networks USA Network and CNBC will also feature Olympics content during the games.\n\nUSA Network: USA Network will be devoted to Olympics coverage nearly 24/7 during the games, showing a mix of live events and encore showings of past events. Because of the six-hour time difference from Italy to the U.S., USA Network will show live Olympic events nightly beginning around 2 a.m. ET, and feature continuing coverage through the early afternoon.\n\nCNBC: CNBC is devoted to curling (really). The cable network plans to broadcast a nightly \"Best of Curling\" show on weeknights at 5 p.m. ET, with long form coverage on weekends.\n\nIf you are planning to stream the Olympics, you'll be doing it on Peacock, NBC's streaming platform. Peacock will stream every single session of all 116 medal events live, as well as offering full-event replays of every event available on-demand.\n\n\"I want to be part of the conversation, but I don't need to watch biathlon at 4 a.m.\"\n\nIf you want high production values, dramatic stories of inspiring athletes, and exciting contests curated by sports broadcasting pros, the mainstream coverage is for you. Don't miss the opening ceremonies on Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, and catch as much of NBC's primetime coverage as you have time for. It's bound to be packed with crowd-pleasing events, give you lots of background on different athletes, and Olympics breaking news, but without a lot of obscure or boring sports.\n\nPro tip: \n\nIf you religiously follow a single sport in the Olympics, be it hockey or snowboarding, and you really don't care about, say, inspirational ice-dancer stories, your best bet is Peacock's Sports Hub, where you can watch every qualifying heat and every medal contest of only the sport you like, either live or on-demand.\n\nPro tip: Coordinate your calendar with NBC's interactive schedule to make sure you know when everything is happening.\n\n\"Half the fun of the Olympics is dishing about it.\"\n\nIf the Olympics is better as a shared experience, watch NBC.com's broadcast coverage in one window, and check out the social media feeds of NBC's \"Creator Collective,\" where TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube influencers like Kylie Kelce, Anna Sitar, and Jordan Howlett will be watching along.\n\nPro tip: Don't sleep on Reddit communities r/olympics and r/WinterOlympics2026.\n\n\"I'm irrationally passionate about a sport I'd never heard of before today.\"\n\nIf you love to discover strange new sports, the Winter Olympics are going to be fun. Skip the mainstream coverage on NBC and browse through Peacock's Sports Hub catalog for sports you've never heard of.\n\nPro tip: Don't miss the debut of Ski Mountaineering (\"SkiMo\"), the only brand-new sport at the 2026 Games. It’s a grueling hybrid where athletes who hate ski lifts for some reason hike up steep mountains before carving down high-speed technical descents.\n\n\"I absolutely cannot get enough Olympics and I want to watch as much as is humanly possible.\"\n\nIf you have a lot of time on your hands and want to see literally everything, you'll need Peacock, and to get familiar with its \"Discovery Multiview\" feature, which lets you watch up to four sporting events at the same time.\n\nPro tip: Go to the NBC Olympics Full Schedule and use the \"My Stuff\" feature to build a personalized calendar before the games start to plan your epic Olympic binge.\n\n\"I want to feel the snow in my face without leaving my house.\"\n\nIf you want the highest resolution, most immersive Olympic experience possible without traveling to Italy, do not miss 4K All-Day on NBC and Peacock on Sunday, Feb. 8 for 17 hours of 4K HDR coverage of both the Olympics and the Super Bowl. And download the Peacock app for your Meta Quest 3 or 3S headset to watch the Olympics in augmented reality, or check out the \"spatial cinema\" broadcast of the Olympics on your Apple Vision Pro.\n\nPro tip: NBC is rolling out a new streaming feature called Rinkside Live for Olympic hockey and figure skating. It lets viewers choose from multiple curated feeds of \"immersive, never-before-seen views.\"",

    "title": "Alysa Liu Quit Figure Skating to Focus on 'Living' Life. Now She's ‘More Excited’ Than Ever About the 2026 Olympics (Exclusive)",
    "description": "The U.S. figure skater tells PEOPLE how her time away from the sport revitalized her love for it",
    "fullText": "Alysa Liu is ready for her second Winter Olympics\n\nThe 20-year-old tells PEOPLE she is \"more excited\" than ever to compete, after taking a break following the 2022 Beijing Olympics\n\n“I was checked out. I was just there for the Olympic experience,\" she says about being a member of Team USA four years ago\n\nAlysa Liu has been here before — but not like this.\n\nThe U.S. figure skater, 20, will make her return to the Olympic stage next month with a newfound drive and sense of purpose after the shocking announcement following the 2022 Beijing Games that she would retire from the sport entirely.\n\nLiu's unexpected announcement caught many around the skating world off guard, since she was seen a rising star in the sport at just 16 years old. The California native had already medaled at the World Figure Skating Championships and was only expected to get better.\n\nBut after more than a year away from ice skating, Liu now tells PEOPLE exclusively that she’s “more excited” about figure skating than ever before — especially the last time the Olympics came around.\n\n“I was not there for the skating at all in my head,” Liu tells PEOPLE exclusively, looking back four years ago. “I was checked out. I was just there for the Olympic experience.”\n\nBut as Liu has explained in a number of media appearances in recent weeks, she had grown exhausted of the all-consuming lifestyle Olympic-level figure skating asks of its competitors and wanted a chance to step back and live what she described to NBC News as a “normal, teenage-girl, older-sister life.”\n\n“I really had nothing going on with my life, you know? Just training,” Liu said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. “I would live at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado, in a dorm by myself. I would eat their food. I went to the rink, skated, ate lunch there, skated some more. Went back to the dorm. I didn’t go anywhere. I didn’t see anything. I was just there,” she said. “And so all that, I was like, ‘Skating is not worth it.’ Like, this is not worth it.' ”\n\nSo after finishing short of the podium in 2022, Liu moved out of the Olympic Training Center in Colorado and moved on from figure skating. Or so she thought.\n\nFor nearly more than a year, Liu returned to a semi-normal teenage life: She went on vacation, spent time with family, graduated high school and began attending UCLA, where she now studies psychology. But during a 2024 ski trip with her family to Lake Tahoe, Liu found herself falling back in love with the adrenaline rush of winter sports, as she told NBC Sports, and felt a pull back to get back on the ice.\n\nIt wasn’t until early 2025 when Liu felt like she was fully invested in the sport for the first time.\n\n“That's when I was like, ‘I'm doing this for real,’ “ she tells PEOPLE with a reawakened excitement for the upcoming Winter Games in Italy.\n\nLiu says living her life and “doing a ton of other things,” including “trying out every hobby in existence” made her realize that her true calling was figure skating all along. “It made me realize what I like to do,” Liu says. “A lot of aspects in figure skating actually follow in line with my interests.”\n\nOne of which includes fashion design, something she’s taken the reins of herself after years of letting others consult and pick her outfits for her. The UCLA student says she’ll find herself up until 2 a.m. some nights after practice working out ideas for new costumes to wear on the ice. “In figure skating, we have these gorgeous dresses and I love to design them,” Liu says. “I work really closely with my dress designer on them, so that part of figure skating I like.”\n\nLiu’s redetermined grasp on figure skating has already proved fruitful with a stunning gold medal finish at the 2025 World Championships.\n\n“She hates this term, but we almost call it Alysa 2.0,” Phillip DiGuglielmo, Liu’s coach, told NBC. “It’s like a reboot, in a way.” Liu’s “reboot” already has critics listing her as a top contender to medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, alongside a strong Team USA that also includes Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito.\n\nLiu says her confidence level feels “more or less the same” as it did when she first stepped into the Olympic spotlight at 16 years old.\n\n“But I’m more excited for the figure skating part of it all now,” she says, thinking ahead to the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nGold or not, for Liu, simply getting back to the point of excitement has been an achievement far beyond what she might have imagined just four years ago.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "description": "The U.S. speed skater tells PEOPLE about her and Team USA hockey star Hilary Knight's first dates during the 2022 Winter Olympics",
    "fullText": "Nearly a decade into her competitive speed skating career, Brittany Bowe finally achieved her dream of standing on an Olympic podium at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut when you ask her about her memories of that time, she’s quick to point out that it was actually falling for girlfriend Hilary Knight that stands out the most.\n\n“That was the biggest win coming out of Beijing for sure,” Bowe, 37, tells PEOPLE about meeting her partner, the U.S. women’s ice hockey captain, that February.\n\n“Hilary and I have known each other for a number of years through different Team USA events, a number of different Olympics, but that's the first time we really did have time to connect and get to know one another,” Bowe says. “And it was everything other than glamorous, that's for sure! Hilary would ask, like, ‘Oh, do you want to go for a walk after dinner?’ And that was our first date, going to walk around the Olympic Village masked because everyone was so fearful of getting COVID.”\n\nSoon, the couple’s walking dates became dinner dates.\n\n“[It was] a very unique way to meet someone, but it was also kind of cool because we felt like we were in this bubble,” Bowe recalls. “We didn't have the family, the friends, no outside distractions. And we really had a lot of time just to get to know each other.”\n\nFour years later, the two share a home in Salt Lake City, and will soon be packing their bags for what may be each of their final Winter Olympics. (They'll be leaving behind the fancy handmade Italian coffee machine they recently purchased to prepare for the trip: “We've been watching hours of videos,” Knight laughed to PEOPLE.)\n\nNow, however, their focus will both be on bringing home medals as part of Team USA – Bowe as a veteran member of the U.S. speed skating squad, and Knight as the captain of the U.S. women’s hockey team.\n\nBowe is excited for the 2026 Winter Games — particularly the return to fans in the stands, as they were still barred from attending in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“I know both of our families are really excited to watch both of us compete,” Bowe says. “My family's already got their hockey tickets, and her family's getting the speed skating tickets. So, just to have more people in the stands that love you, support you, are part of your journey — that will make it really special.”\n\nA Florida native who first took up inline skating after a local coach noticed her gliding down the rink at a friend’s birthday party, Bowe didn’t seriously consider ice skating until she found herself watching old friends from her inline days compete for Team USA at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n“My path to the Olympics is definitely not linear,” says the former Florida Atlantic University point guard, who set aside her plans to make it to the WNBA after becoming infatuated with ice skating during those 2010 Winter Games.\n\nDespite not being “an adrenaline junkie at all” when she’s off the ice, \"I love pushing myself to the limit\" in competition, Bowe says. She adds that winning is “an addiction” that gives her “no better feeling in the world.”\n\nAnd when the 2026 Winter Olympics come to a close, regardless of the outcome, her lifelong dream of having an Olympic career will have been accomplished.\n\n“More than anything, [I’m excited about] just being able to compete and represent my country,” Bowe says. “I can't think of a better way to end my career than with the flag on me and my family in the stands.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "fullText": "Snowboarder Scotty James parlayed a never-before-landed trick combination into his fifth straight X Games title on the halfpipe Saturday and tied Shaun White with eight overall gold medals at the biggest event this side of the Olympics.\n\nIn the final major contest before next month's Milan Cortina Games, the 31-year-old Aussie capped off his winning run with two straight backside 1440-degree jumps. That's two tricks spinning with his back facing down the hill to start, one while riding forward, the other riding backward — or “switch.” They are among the toughest on the halfpipe.\n\nJames briefly put his hand onto the snow to stay upright after the second jump, but the judges rewarded him anyway. His score of 95 easily beat second-place finisher Haku Shimasaki of Japan.\n\n“I felt I wanted to do something for myself and for halfpipe and to push backside riding as much as I can,” said Scott, who wore his trademark red boxing gloves and celebrated by crowd surfing into the hundreds of fans who watched the action in Aspen, Colorado. “Tonight, I think it always was the plan. I wanted to come out and do the first back-to-back backside 14s, and I'm pumped.”\n\nJames is looking like the favorite heading into the Milan Cortina Olympics. Last week, he won the Laax Open in Switzerland — a contest in which defending Olympic champion Ayumu Hirano suffered a nasty fall and broke bones in his face, throwing his status for next month's Olympic halfpipe contest into limbo.\n\nJames has Olympic silver and bronze medals. In a documentary on his life that dropped earlier this Winter, he made no secret that he needs the Olympic gold to round out an otherwise impeccable career.\n\nJames has also shown a triple cork — three head-over-heels flips — as part of his repertoire this season, though the back-to-back 1440s was something nobody had seen.\n\nHe said he has always admired groundbreakers, such as slopestyler Mark McMorris, 2014 Olympic halfpipe champion Iouri Podladtchikov (the iPod) and White, and wanted to use this latest X Games performance to add something new.\n\n“I get a chip on my shoulder every year, thinking maybe I wouldn't be expected to show up and try again and win again,” he said. “I managed to do that today, and I'm speechless, honestly.”\n\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina are finally taking place, with thousands of athlete federations heading to Italy before the event begins. As always, the Games commence with an opening ceremony, but this one has a special historical significance.\n\nFor the first time in Winter Olympics history, the Milan Cortina Opening Ceremony will adopt a multi-centered approach, allowing athletes at various competition venues across Italy to participate. While the main ceremony is scheduled at San Siro Olympic Stadium, athletes, spectators, and local communities nationwide will join the celebration through multiple athlete parades and two cauldrons.\n\nCertainly, each Opening Ceremony typically has a theme. The creative team for the Milan-Cortina event selected \"Armonia,\" which means \"harmony\" in Italian. This theme celebrates Italian values, history, and culture, emphasizing their deep connection to the Olympic spirit.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about when the Olympics start, including the opening ceremony date, time, and schedule.\n\nOpening ceremony time: 2 p.m. ET\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympic Games will start on Friday, Feb. 6, with the opening ceremony.

Shaun White, three-time Olympic snowboarding champion, will join them in the broadcast booth.\n\nThe ceremony generally lasts about three hours, which is typical, though there isn't a fixed length. Later that evening, viewers can watch an \"enhanced encore\" at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics will take place in Italy from February 6th through the 22nd. Venues across Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo will host these events.\n\nThere are 15 Olympic venues spread across Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.

He was voted an All-Star starter and will be receiving a signature shoe from New Balance. All of it is rewarding for a player who is on the up and up.\n\nOn top of being voted in as an All-Star starter, Maxey was the top vote getter among American-born players. That fact has to make one wonder whether the star guard would play for Team USA in the 2028 Olympics should the opportunity arise.\n\n\"I would love to play for Team USA,\" Maxey said on Monday. \"If I got that honor, it would be a blessing. I think it’s in LA, right? So, it’s in the United States. That would be really cool. Just to represent the country in the country and if that’s something that I have the opportunity to do, then I’ll definitely be there for it.\"\n\nMaxey will certainly be in the mix. One has to believe due to what he has done with the Sixers, he will be on Team USA's radar. The Olympic competition is heating up and one has to believe everything will come down to Maxey, Detroit Pistons star Cade Cunningham, and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in terms of the guards Team USA will look at.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers star Tyrese Maxey discusses 2028 Team USA Olympic possibility",
