Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMonday's matchup with Switzerland looms as a classic trap game for the U.S. women's hockey team.\n\nWith the most anticipated game of the Olympics — USA vs. Canada — coming up Tuesday, the Americans will need to stay focused and take care of business against the Swiss.\n\nCoach John Wroblewski's team has rolled through his first two games in Group A play, beating Czechia and Finland by a combined score of 10-1 and totaling 91 shots on goal to just 25 for the opposition. Seven players have scored for Team USA, with Alex Carpenter, Hayley Scamurra and Hilary Knight netting two goals apiece.\n\nKnight's goal against Finland was the 14th of her Olympic career, tying the U.S. record shared by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. If the captain scores again in Milan, she'll stake sole claim to the record.\n\nThe Swiss opened the tournament with a shootout win over Czechia but fell 4-0 to Canada on Saturday. The U.S. will try to dismiss them in similar fashion ahead of Tuesday's showdown to end group play.\n\nHere's how to watch all the action from Milan.\n\nUSA vs. Switzerland will air live on USA Network with Kenny Albert on play-by-play and AJ Mleczko providing analysis. Fans can stream the game on Peacock, which will carry every event of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics live.\n\nThe NBC-owned streaming service's sports programming features live coverage of NFL Sunday Night Football, the NBA, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Premier League soccer, Big Ten football and basketball, Notre Dame football, Big East and Big 12 basketball, PGA Tour golf, and more.\n\nThe USA vs. Switzerland game is set to begin at 2:40 p.m. ET, or 8:40 p.m. local time in Milan. The game will be played at the Santagiulia IHO Arena in Milan, Team USA's first contest in the venue that will host the semifinals and medal-round games.\n\nLatest Olympics news and updates\n\n2026 Winter Olympics viewer's guide\n\nDay-by-day TV, streaming schedule for 2026 Winter Olympics",

    "description": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's behaviour towards her pupils was branded \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it was hard to see her returning - but she is back for Milan-Cortina 2026.",
    "fullText": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's \"tremendous coldness\" was described as \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it may have been hard to imagine her returning to her sport's biggest stage.\n\nFour years later, the highly successful coach is at Milan-Cortina - and not everyone is happy about it.\n\nTutberidze and her training methods were under the spotlight at Beijing 2022 amid the Kamila Valieva doping scandal that rocked the Games, and it was the then-IOC president Thomas Bach who gave the stinging assessment of the coach.\n\nRather than comforting 15-year-old gold medal favourite Valieva when she left the ice in tears after falling several times, Tutberidze had instead asked the youngster \"why did you stop fighting?\"\n\nBach said he had been \"very, very disturbed\" by what he had seen and that it did not give him \"much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past, nor as far as it concerns the future\".\n\nWell, that future is here and so too is Tutberidze.\n\nNot only is Tutberidze back at the Olympics, but she is apparently coach to another Russian teenage medal hope.\n\nThat skater is 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, who is here as a neutral athlete (AIN) as Russia's team are banned from the Games because of the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Tutberidze is not officially listed as the teenager's coach in the media guide for these Games and it remains to be seen whether she will be at rinkside when Petrosian competes.\n\nWhoever she is with, there will be many eyes on Tutberidze, with the shadow of Valieva and Beijing 2022 set to loom large.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTutberidze's official coaching role is with the Georgia figure skating team and she was at Milano Ice Skating Arena for the team event to watch one of her longest-serving pupils, Nika Egadze.\n\nEgadze stormed to victory at the 2026 European Championships in Sheffield, where Tutberidze shared a warm hug with her skater after a gold medal-winning performance, and other athletes spoke positively about the coach.\n\nIt was a different story at Milano Ice Skating Arena as Egadze endured two error-strewn routines, with Georgia missing out on a medal.\n\nIn the short programme he made two early errors, failing to land the triple toe loop in his first technical element.\n\nAs he continued his performance, the TV cameras caught Tutberidze in passing - standing at rinkside, arms folded.\n\nEgadze did enough to pull the performance around and help earn Georgia fifth place in qualifying, progressing to the final. When he came off the ice, the hug from Tutberidze seemed curt.\n\nShe joined the Georgian squad as they waited for the results. Generally, waiting teams will laugh and joke, even if they know elimination is coming.\n\nInstead, the 11 skaters and team members sat stony-faced as the scores were announced.\n\nIf this was an indicator of the atmosphere in the team, it is certainly not positive, but it may have just been a moment of nervous focus.\n\nPerhaps Tutberidze was minding her body language on Sunday as Egadze struggled even \n\nHis coach gave him a pat on the hand as the numbers came in. Despite Egadze scoring only 154.79 for the free skate - 27 points lower than his season best - there was no berating.\n\nThe attention comes at a Games which began for Georgia with their team being roundly booed in San Siro when they entered the stadium during the opening ceremony.\n\nOfficial views on Tutberidze's presence in Milan vary.\n\nGiven she has not been personally implicated in any doping scandals and has not broken any rules, Tutberidze has every right to be at the Olympics.\n\nShe has rejected any suggestions of wrongdoing in her career as a coach and said in 2022 she was baffled by Bach's remarks.\n\n\"There was an investigation at the time and no issues were found that could be actioned against that individual,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a media conference on Sunday.\n\n\"If you are going to take action against someone, you need evidence, and from what I gather there isn't any.\"\n\nHowever, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) president Witold Banka said on Thursday he does not \"feel comfortable with her presence here\",, external while Britain's 1980 Olympic champion and BBC pundit Robin Cousins was unequivocal in his disdain.\n\n\"This comes down to the International Olympic Committee and International Skating Union - coaches are not part of the team,\" Cousins told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So when they ban a team, the coach of said team is not part of that. That is not correct, as far as I am concerned. I would not have her anywhere near Milan, personally.\n\n\"Is that because of behaviour, or Russia being banned? All of the above.\n\n\"The way we watched everything unfold, someone has to take the blame. Any skater would say the most important person is the coach; you trust them, you give yourself to them. That is not how you treat a student.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, a television documentary - The Tutberidze Method - was released in Russia, celebrating her track record in training medal winners.\n\nTwo of Tutberidze's skaters have won women's gold and silver medals at the past two Olympics, but both were amid drama.\n\nAs the Valieva saga played out, Beijing 2022 champion Anna Shcherbakova was left barely celebrating victory – later saying she felt \"emptiness\" – while silver medallist Alexandra Trusova was so disappointed to miss out on gold that she said before the medal ceremony that she never wanted to skate again.\n\nFour years before that, in 2018, favourite Evgenia Medvedeva was sobbing after being upstaged by 15-year-old training partner Alina Zagitova.\n\nIn the run-up to those two Games, Tutberidze's skaters had been hot favourites, dominating the World Championships and European Championships.\n\nLittle has been seen of Petrosian recently on the international stage because of Russia's ban from competition. The only real sighting of her was at September's qualifying event in Beijing, where she won gold, but not all the top skaters were there.\n\nPetrosian has also won the past three national championships – making it 11 years in a row for Tutberidze skaters – and she is the first woman to land a quadruple loop in competition, but she was injured last year and has struggled with errors this season.\n\nFollowing the Valieva episode, the minimum age for competitors was raised from 15 to 17, an age that has not been far off retirement age for some of Tutberidze's skaters in the past because of a combination of injury and a drop in technical skills.\n\nIt has been reported that her training model centres around female skaters peaking before they hit puberty., external\n\nItalian Daniel Grassl, who went to work with Tutberidze in Moscow in 2023, described her as a \"very good\" coach, adding: \"She can be a little bit cold but she was warm with us, and was supporting us.\"\n\nValieva, a mercurial talent who performances drew worldwide attention, was eventually banned for four years over her failed drugs test, but there were no sanctions for any of her entourage.\n\nHer team have always insisted the failed test - for heart medication trimetazidine - was the result of contaminated cutlery which had been tainted by her grandfather's medication, while Wada called for those behind the failed test to face justice because \"the doping of children is unforgivable\".\n\n\"Wada is not behind the decision to accredit the coach [for Milan-Cortina],\" Banka said. \"The investigation found no evidence this person [Tutberidze] engaged in the topic, so there is no legal basis to exclude her.\"\n\nValieva, now 19, has only just returned to skating, finishing sixth in the semi-finals of the Russian Jump Championships last week. She is no longer coached by Tutberidze.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

It was an exercise in why sanctioned sport is healthy for the world, as both sides were able to express their dissatisfaction by hurling fists at each other.\n\nIt was a moment that set the sports world on fire.\n\nThe Canadiens got the last swing and landed the knockout blow by winning the Four Nations tournament in an American barn.

Or as the official IIHF rules state:\n\nThat doesn’t take it entirely off the table, but I highly doubt anyone is willing to risk suspension from the first games involving NHL players in over 10 years.

I’ve got the first.”\n\nFormer Team Canada focal point Rick Nash told FOX News, “As a player, I can guarantee you, the only thing on your mind is a gold medal. You don’t care if it’s Norway, Latvia, the US, or whoever.”\n\nWe might not see the staged fights, but one thing is for certain.\n\nThis hockey tournament is going to be a grueling physical battle, and they will only play one anthem when it’s time to hand out the hardware.\n\nThat moment will feature copious amounts of glory and pride, but standing on the silver or bronze level could be an unforgettable but painful memory.

Then, she tore her ACL in a crash days before the Olympics, only to confirm she planned to compete anyway.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nThe 41-year-old lined up for her first medal shot in the Women's Downhill on Sunday, having clocked the third fastest time in her second raining run on Saturday.\n\nRunning 13th in the order, Vonn made a confident start but clipped a flag with her right shoulder and fell heavily. She was audibly distressed as she received medical attention before a helicopter arrived to carry her off the slope, as is customary when competitors are injured.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking the latest updates.\n\nMORE:Doctors explain why Lindsey Vonn was able to compete with torn ACL\n\nVonn was airborn as her right arm got caught in between the posts of a marker flag. She then lost her balance and hit the snow hard. She rolled over multiple times before coming to a stop on her back.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic champion could be heard crying out in distress as medical staff attended her on the slope. The BBC reporter and former Olympian, Chemmy Alcott, said background music had to be played to the stunned crowd because it was \"uncomfortable\" for spectators watching on.\n\nCompatriot Breezy Johnson, who had set the fastest time, was in tears as she watched on from the paddock near the finish line. Johnson was later confirmed as Olympic champion.\n\nThe following brief statement was offered by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard team: \"Lindsey Vonn fell in the Olympic downhill and will be evaluated by medical staff.\"\n\nLater on Sunday, the U.S. Ski team released an updated statement that Vonn did in fact sustain an injury during her crash, but that she is in stable condition:\n\nUpdate: Lindsey Vonn sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.\n\n— U.S. Ski & Snowboard Team (@usskiteam) February 8, 2026\n\nVonn was eventually airlifted off the slope by a helicopter, at which point she received a standing ovation.

According to the BBC, the doctor who performed Vonn's knee surgery travelled in the helicopter.\n\nGraham Bell, a five-time Olympic skier, said: \"I had Vonn down for a medal. I would have done the exact same thing in Vonn's position, I would have raced.\n\n\"It can be done, she was doing it, she was fast in training, she took the risk and it didn't pay off.\"\n\nAustrian skier Nina Ortlieb also crashed in her run, although she was able to land safely and proceed to the finish line. Cande Moreno then fell heavily at the top of the course and appeared to have badly hurt her knee.\n\nLindsey Vonn saw promising results in her two practice runs, but she suffered a brutal crash early in her run on Sunday and had to be airlifted via helicopter for medical attention.\n\n🚨🇺🇸 American Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn airlifted by helicopter after crashing in downhill skiing.\n\nVonn came out of retirement to compete again at 41.

    "fullText": "MILAN — The 2026 Winter Games are off to a promising start for host nation Italy with gold, silver and bronze on the first day of medal events.\n\nBut it was Switzerland’s Franjo Von Allmen who captured the first gold medal of the Milan Cortina Olympics on Saturday.\n\nThere were no Americans on the podium, though Lindsey Vonn impressed in her second training run ahead of the women’s downhill on Sunday.\n\nItalian speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida celebrated her 35th birthday by winning the host nation’s first gold medal of these Olympics — in the 3,000 meters. It’s also Italy’s first gold in women’s speedskating at any Winter Games.\n\nCompeting in her fourth Olympics, Lollobrigida outskated Ragne Wiklund of Norway for her first Olympic gold after winning silver and bronze in Beijing four years ago.\n\nHer great aunt was the late Gina Lollobrigida, a star actress of the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nItaly had a strong day on the slopes, as well, with Alpine skiers Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris taking silver and bronze, respectively, in the men’s downhill — the first medal event of the Games.\n\nHowever, neither could beat Von Allmen’s time of 1 minute, 51.61 seconds in Bormio.\n\nThe 24-year-old Swiss skier was the leader after his downhill run, but the wait for his rivals to finish was nerve-racking.\n\n“I tried to enjoy the moment, but I didn’t quite realize what was going on today,” von Allmen said after his first Olympic race.\n\nParis, 36, was delighted with his bronze after coming away empty-handed in his four previous Olympics.\n\n“It’s my fifth Olympics, and getting the first medal in front of the home crowd, that’s really special,” Paris said.\n\nIn Cortina, Lindsey Vonn completed another downhill training run and was set for Sunday’s medal race despite tearing her left ACL a little more than a week ago.\n\nThe 41-year-old American crossed the line in third position and told The Associated Press “all good.”\n\nShe has been wearing a large brace on her injured knee.\n\nYuma Kagiyama landed near-perfect quads and scored 108.67 points in his short program to help Japan put pressure on the defending champion U.S. in the figure skating team event.\n\nMalinin, the two-time reigning world champion, was second with 98.00.\n\nBut a brilliant free skate by Madison Chock and Evan Bates pushed the U.S. score to 44 points — five more than Japan ahead of the men’s, women’s and pairs free skates to decide the medals Sunday.\n\nJessie Diggins, the most decorated American cross-country skier ever, finished eighth in the 20-kilometer women’s skiathlon in Tesero. She finished more than 2 minutes behind winner Frida Karlsson of Sweden.\n\n“I had a crash on the first lap, where my tip just disappeared in the slush, and unfortunately it was a tough spot where you lose all your momentum,” the 34-year-old Minnesota native said.\n\nU.S. Vice President JD Vance sat with influencer and boxer Jake Paul as they watched the U.S. women’s hockey team beat Finland 5-0 on Saturday. Paul’s fiancee, Jutta Leerdam, is a speedskater for the Netherlands.\n\nFinland played two days after the team’s game against Canada had to be postponed because of a stomach virus affecting players. Switzerland played Canada a day after announcing that one of its players tested positive for the norovirus. Canada won 4-0.\n\nNorway — the nation with the most medals in Winter Olympics history — got its first gold of the Games in the women’s ski jumping. It was unexpected.\n\nAnna Odine Stroem of Norway won the normal hill competition ahead of Slovenian favorite Nika Prevc, who has dominated the sport this season. Nozomi Maruyama of Japan won bronze.\n\nKira Kimura won Japan’s first gold medal at these Games — in men’s snowboarding big air in Livigno. His teammate, Ryoma Kimata, picked up the silver medal.\n\nDefending champion Su Yiming of China took bronze, keeping 17-year-old American Oliver Martin off the podium.\n\nBig air consists of one single jump off a huge ramp, where the rider varies spins, flips and h",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Tourists to Milan during the Winter Olympics hoping to see Leonardo da Vinci’s “ The Last Supper” were in for an unwelcome surprise: Access to the masterpiece is closed to the public for 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe painting, created between 1494 and 1498 by the Italian Renaissance artist, is located on a wall inside the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a church and Dominican convent still used by friars. It is a major attraction for appreciators of art and devout Catholics alike.\n\nTourists stuck at the police cordon down the street leading to Santa Maria delle Grazie were disappointed. Antonio Rodríguez, who traveled from Spain with friends, said they would have no other chance to see the painting nor the adjacent church since they only traveled for the weekend.\n\n“We didn’t know we would face this,” said Rodríguez, adding he had no plans to attend events related to the Games. \"We would have gone somewhere else in the city.”\n\nA sign on the wall outside Il Cenacolo Vinciano stated that access to the landmark would be closed all day on Feb. 5, 6 and 7, and the morning of Feb. 8, without giving any reason. Staff there told a reporter from The Associated Press they were not authorized to provide any information.\n\nVIPs still allowed in on Saturday\n\nUnbeknownst to frustrated visitors, multiple groups of VIPs were exempt from the restrictions on Saturday.\n\nAmong them were U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his family, according to a statement from the vice president's office. They visited the morning after he met Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and attended the Games' opening ceremony.\n\nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, which he has said brought him a sense of spiritual fulfillment. He visited Rome and Vatican City during Holy Week last year, and was among the last world leaders to meet Pope Francis before his passing. They sat down together on Easter Sunday after a long-distance tangle over the Trump administration’s migrant deportation plans.\n\nIn addition to Vance, many foreign delegations have visited The Last Supper and the Brera Art Gallery in recent days, including those of China, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, Angelo Crespi, the director of Grande Brera that oversees both institutions, said in a statement.\n\n“We interpret our role responsibly, not only in terms of tourism but also in terms of international relations,” he said.\n\nTraffic in the area surrounding the religious site on Saturday was diverted. People walking along nearby streets said public transportation was disrupted, as well.\n\n“The trams were changed without any notice,” said Fedeli Gioia. “This whole area is blocked because someone is going to see Il Cenacolo? And where does that leave us citizens?”\n\nA painting that — with care and luck — has survived for centuries\n\nThe Last Supper — described by renowned writer Giorgio Vasari as “a beautiful and marvelous thing” in his writings — is preserved under strict conservation conditions.\n\nInstead of creating a fresco that would have allowed the paint to be absorbed by plaster, Leonardo used a dry technique that made it much more vulnerable to deterioration. Environmental damage and repeated restoration attempts altered its appearance and prompted ongoing conservation efforts.\n\nNowadays, visits last about 15 minutes for a maximum number of 40 people at a time and temperature and humidity are strictly controlled.\n\nLeonardo’s painting depicts the moment after Jesus tells his apostles: “One of you will betray me.” The scene’s composition has had other interpretations by previous artists, but Leonardo reinterpreted it, placing Jesus at the center and arranging the apostles in four groups of three figures.\n\nAside from conservation issues derived from the dry technique used by Leonardo, the mural suffered deterioration when the refectory housing it was used as a stable in the late 1700s during the French occupation of Milan by Napoleon’s troops. Later, it was severely damaged when Allied bombing struck the Santa Maria delle Grazie complex in 1943 during World War II.\n\nIt made a controversial appearance, of sorts, in the Paris Olympics in 2024. A scene in the opening ceremony evoked the painting, and included DJ Barbara Butch — an LGBTQ+ icon — wearing a silver headdress resembling a halo while flanked by drag artists and dancers.\n\nFrance’s Catholic bishops said it mocked Christian symbolism, and the Vatican said it “deplored the offense” caused to Christians by the scene.\n\nA group of Japanese tourists was among the would-be visitors behind the police cordon on Saturday. They photographed the church from a distance and listened to a guide’s explanation in the middle of the street.\n\nLuisa Castro, a Filipina who has lived in Milan for 20 years, was hoping to visit Santa Maria delle Grazie with friends.\n\n“We are Catholics from the Philippines and we seldom have time to visit a church like this,” she said. “Unfortunately, the vice president of America came to see the Last Supper and we could not enter.”\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "After eight matches and five days of competition at the Winter Olympics, Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds have finally been beaten in Cortina.\n\nIt was Switzerland who eventually did what Norway, Estonia, Czech Republic, Sweden, Korea, Canada and the United States couldn't in the curling mixed doubles in the Dolomites.\n\nTheir 7-5 victory will mean more to them than it would have to the Great Britain duo, as they pursue the semi-final spot that Mouat and Dodds have already clinched.\n\nHowever, the Scottish pair were eager to preserve their 100% record, both to further stamp their authority on the competition and to ensure they have the hammer - the right to throw last - in Monday's semi (18:05 GMT) and in whichever medal match they find themselves in on Tuesday.\n\nMouat and Dodds will have another chance to do both of those things when they conclude their round-robin matches against Italy at 18:05 - live on the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics: GB in curling action, plus mixed biathlon medals - watch\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\n\"The energy will be electric so we're looking forward to that and hopefully causing some drama in the stands,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nTo do so, they will have to rediscover their best form against the hosts, whose every successful shot sends a cascade of noise rolling down the wooden bleachers of this quirky arena.\n\nThe Italians overwhelmed the Czech Republic at the same time as Switzerland were inflicting defeat on Team GB.\n\nThe married Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwaller-Huerlimann started aggressively, stealing shots in both the second and third ends to establish a 4-0 advantage.\n\nMouat and Dodds righted themselves a little with two to go into the break at 4-2, then stole two to pull themselves level.\n\nThe Swiss nudged ahead again and, although GB took two to lead for the first time going into the final end, they were unable to prevent their opponents snatching a decisive two to close out victory.\n\n\"We put ourselves against the wall a bit,\" Dodds told BBC Sport. \"I had a couple of overthrows which put us in a lot of bother but we're still in a very good position.\"\n\nNorway's Johannes Hosflot Klaebo clinched the first of a potential six gold medals at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in the 10km+10km skiathlon.\n\nIt takes the 29-year-old's career Olympic gold tally to six, just two behind the all-time winter record.\n\nThat is held by the Norwegian trio of biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen and cross country skiers Bjorn Daehlie and Marit Bjorgen, who are all retired.\n\nTeam GB's Andrew Musgrave came 10th in his fifth Games - just short of his best Olympic finish of seventh in 2018 - with fellow Briton Joe Davis 16th.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit disappointed,\" Musgrave told BBC Sport after the race.\n\n\"I felt like it was so fast on the first section and straight away I was struggling - it was hot and I was overheating.\n\n\"My chances of a good finish were over after the first lap.\"\n\nMathis Desloges took silver after being spared punishment for cutting a corner on the course, earning France their first medal, with Norway's Martin Lowstrom Nyenget third.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

She lost her balance and crashed, with her left leg, which had sustained a significant ACL injury just over a week ago, gave way.\n\nVonn was heard crying out in agony as medical staff surrounded her. After a significant pause in the time trial proceedings, she was placed on a stretcher and airlifted to a hospital. It was a devastating sight, as the 2010 downhill Winter Olympic champion, who has won four World Cups in a storied career, left the snow for what is almost certainly the final time.\n\nCompeting against a field of world-class downhill skiers, Vonn was competing as the 13th of 36 racers in Cortina d’Ampezzo.\n\nBBC Sport reporter Chemmy Alcott, a former skier who was often Vonn’s competition in the past, was visibly distressed by the event and noted that Vonn was given a standing ovation as the helicopter carrying her took off.\n\nThe Women’s Downhill has now resumed, as the Olympic world awaits news on Vonn’s conditions.\n\nVonn had trained well and set the third-quickest time in practise runs yesterday. Her teammaker, the reigning women’s downhill world champ Breezy Johnson, had earlier set the fastest time and looks set to have won the gold.\n\nVonn was considered to be the highest-profile athlete at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. She had come out of retirement to put in a series of outstanding performances that placed her among the major favorites for a medal.\n\nWe included the star, who represented by WMG/IMG in our recent article on potential breakout stars from the Olympics, which began on Friday and runs until February 22.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn's Winter Olympic dream ended in screams of pain on Sunday after she crashed out of the women's downhill, failing in her audacious bid to medal in her favoured discipline at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe American star had been trying to claim the fourth Olympic medal of her career despite suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee just over a week ago, but her race ended after just 13 seconds in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nShe cried in anguish and pain after her awful fall high up the course, medical staff surrounding the distraught 41-year-old on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste where has enjoyed much success in the past.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic downhill champion hit the firm snow face first soon after pushing off from the gate.\n\nShe then rolled down the slope with her skis still attached, which could likely cause further serious damage to her knee.\n\nVonn's Olympic dream now lies in tatters after her brave effort to achieve the seemingly impossible, an attempt which ended with her being taken away in a helicopter as fans in the stands saluted her with loud applause.\n\nHer US teammate Breezy Johnson, sitting in the leader's chair, held her face in shock. At the time Vonn crashed, Johnson, the world downhill champion, was in front of Germany's Emma Aicher by just 0.04sec following her powerful run.\n\nJohan Eliasch, the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) who was watching the race in Cortina, said Vonn's crash was \"tragic, but it's ski racing I'm afraid\".\n\n\"And I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport because this race has been the talk of the Games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"I hope she will have a speedy recovery and back on skis very, very soon.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to say she shouldn't have been racing today (with) that type of injury. It's obviously her decision.\"\n\nOne of world sport's most recognisable faces and an alpine skiing icon, Vonn has insisted that she could not only compete but win against the world's best women skiers, some of whom like Aicher are nearly half her age.\n\nVonn said ahead of the Games that she was planning on also competing in the team combined event on Tuesday and the super-G two days later.\n\nBut that now looks unlikely, a potential long lay-off perhaps heralding the end of her comeback to skiing in her early 40s.\n\nVonn retired in 2019 but returned to compeition in November 2024 following surgery to partially replace her right knee to end persistent pain.\n\nHad she not crashed in the last World Cup downhill ahead of the Olympics, in Crans Montana at the end of January, Vonn would have been a serious contender for gold in Cortina.\n\nVonn had finished on the podium in every previous World Cup downhill race this season, including two victories in St. Moritz and Zauchensee, and claimed two more top-three finishes in the super-G.\n\nBut retirement looms for Vonn following a disastrous end to one of the biggest stories of the Winter Olympics.",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn crashed out of the women's downhill competition at the Winter Olympics nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee.\n\nThe 41-year-old had successfully completed two training runs on the iconic Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina but crashed early in her run.\n\nShe was tended to for a lengthy period on the slope before being airlifted off the piste.\n\nVonn was taking a huge risk by competing on Sunday having suffered the ACL injury in Switzerland in the last World Cup race before the Games.\n\nBut she was determined to take to the course in what she says will be her final Olympics.\n\nStunned spectators in the stands applauded towards the helicopter as it carried her away from the piste which has brought her so much success in the past - with 12 of her 84 World Cup wins coming here.\n\nVonn had been unsure what her knee was capable of withstanding but had targeted the downhill as her favoured event while also being entered in the super-G and team events.\n\nIt is now unlikely she will compete in any of those, meaning her Olympic career has likely come to a devastating end.\n\nVonn was the 13th skier to go in the women's downhill and clipped the first gate which put her off balance as she was turning when she crashed.\n\nThe treatment she needed after the crash led to a significant delay to the competition, which compatriot Breezy Johnson led at the time.\n\nJohnson held her head in her hands as she watched her team-mate carried away by the helicopter.\n\nVonn had appeared relaxed in the training runs and in the morning before the race. Her coach Aksel Lund Svindal said on Friday that he felt confident she could pull off something spectacular.\n\nNo stranger to a comeback, Vonn retired from the sport in 2019 as the most decorated female skier at the time but had suffered several serious leg injuries.\n\nShe made a shock return to the sport in 2024 having had a partial knee replacement in her right knee.\n\nVonn was tipped for the podium in Cortina following a successful 2025-26 season, in which she reached the podium in all five races, winning two.\n\nBut this latest crash leaves a significant doubt over whether Vonn will ski competitively again.\n\nWinter Olympics: Johnson set for downhill gold after US team-mate Vonn's crash - watch\n\nVonn knew the risk she was taking by competing on Sunday and had even hit back at a doctor on social media who claimed the injury was \"not a fresh tear\".\n\nShe responded by saying her ACL is \"100% torn\" and had hoped to defy the odds by replicating the Olympic downhill gold medal she won in Vancouver in 2010.\n\nVideos on social media had shown her training in the gym after she said she had no pain or swelling of the knee, while two smooth runs in the build-up to the race had given her, and her team and fans, confidence.\n\nFour-time British Olympian Chemmy Alcott was emotional on BBC coverage and said she \"never believed\" it would end in this way.\n\n\"What we saw [is] that the top of the piste is really hard for a fit athlete. It is brutal, think about her family, her team and herself.\n\n\"We have to be realistic - the risk was really high, the risk she takes when she falls will double that. Her body will not be able to take that.\"\n\nAlcott added that the long delay would also mean the snow on the piste would begin to melt in the midday sun, and therefore it would be unlikely that anyone would beat Johnson's time of one minute 36.10 seconds.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Italian police fired tear gas and a water cannon at dozens of protesters who threw firecrackers and tried to access a highway near a Winter Olympics venue on Saturday.\n\nThe brief confrontation came at the end of a peaceful march by thousands against the environmental impact of the Games and the presence of U.S. agents in Italy.\n\nPolice held off the violent demonstrators, who appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink, after the skirmish. By then, the larger peaceful protest, including families with small children and students, had dispersed.\n\nEarlier, a group of masked protesters had set off smoke bombs and firecrackers on a bridge overlooking a construction site about 800 meters (a half-mile) from the Olympic Village that's housing around 1,500 athletes.\n\nPolice vans behind a temporary metal fence secured the road to the athletes’ village, but the protest veered away, continuing on a trajectory toward the Santagiulia venue. A heavy police presence guarded the entire route.\n\nThere was no indication that the protest and resulting road closure interfered with athletes’ transfers to their events, all on the outskirts of Milan.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Milan as head of the American delegation that attended the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nHe and his family visited Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” closer to the city center, far from the protest, which also was against the deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to provide security to the U.S. delegation.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S. is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.\n\nAt the larger, peaceful demonstration, which police said numbered 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts to represent trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to beating drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, one a profanity-laced anti-ICE anthem.\n\n“Let’s take back the cities and free the mountains,” read a banner by a group calling itself the Unsustainable Olympic Committee. Another group called the Association of Proletariat Excursionists organized the cutout trees.\n\n“They bypassed the laws that usually are needed for major infrastructure project, citing urgency for the Games,” said protester Guido Maffioli, who expressed concern that the private entity organizing the Games would eventually pass on debt to Italian taxpayers.\n\nHomemade signs read “Get out of the Games: Genocide States, Fascist Police and Polluting Sponsors,” the final one a reference to fossil fuel companies that are sponsors of the Games. One woman carried an artificial tree on her back decorated with the sign: “Infernal Olympics.”\n\nThe demonstration followed another last week when hundreds protested the deployment of ICE agents.\n\nLike last week, demonstrators Saturday said they were opposed to ICE agents’ presence, despite official statements that a small number of agents from an investigative arm would be present in U.S. diplomatic territory, and not operational on the streets.",

    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - will not be able to wear their new helmets because they do not comply with the sport's rules around shape.\n\nThe British team had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) on Thursday to overturn the decision by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nBut Cas say the helmet is a departure from the standard helmet shape and has clearly been designed to specifically enhance aerodynamic performance because the back of the helmet protrudes.\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) stressed that the helmet was designed with safety in mind and to comply with new safety regulations due to be introduced by the IBSF at the start of the 2026-27 season.\n\nThose rules are not in place at the Olympics but British skeleton have essentially tried to get ahead of the curve by designing and using their new helmet in Italy.\n\nInstead they will wear the ones they wore during the last World Cup season.\n\nA picture seen by BBC Sport shows that the helmet is pointed at the back - similar in appearance to a track cycling helmet.\n\nNatalie Dunman, executive performance director at the BBSA, said: \"Based on the strength of the case we put forward, naturally we are disappointed in [the] decision.\n\n\"However, this does not affect our final preparations and nor has the discourse affected the athletes' focus or optimism going into the Games.\n\n\"Our athletes have been winning medals all season, and throughout the Olympic cycle, in their current helmets and we remain in a strong position to continue that trend.\"\n\nWhen asked about the helmet prior to the verdict, Team GB's skeleton racers said they had no preference on which helmet they used at the Olympics.\n\nThey arrive at the Games as heavy favourites to win medals with world champion and overall World Cup winner Matt Weston leading the charge for gold while compatriot Marcus Wyatt is also fancied to go well.\n\nThe British team wore the new helmets at a training session last week in Switzerland with the IBSF ruling them out on 29 January before the BBSA appealed against the ban on Thursday.\n\nOfficial skeleton training in Cortina begins on Monday with the men's event beginning on 12 February, while the women's starts on 13 February and the team event is on 15 February.\n\nThe helmet is the most important bit of kit both for safety and aerodynamics - how quickly the slider can travel down the track.\n\nDoctor Bryce Dyer, a professor of sport technology at the University of Bournemouth, says that because skeleton is head first it is essential that the helmet is aerodynamic to cut through the air.\n\n\"The airflow over that section is really, really important,\" he said. \"Any kind of gain they can make with the shape and the general performance of it, then obviously the higher the speed gap is going to achieve and therefore the better chances of the medal.\n\n\"The funny thing with aerodynamics is that the faster you go, the more resistance actually gets thrown against you. So you need the most aerodynamically efficient shape you can obtain.\"\n\nIt is here that the British team's case appears to have been decided, with Cas agreeing with the IBSF that the overall shape incorporates prohibited spoilers (attachments), protruding edges or aerodynamic elements.\n\n\"Even that [aerodynamic helmet] will only yield a very, very small increase in velocity. But that could be just enough,\" said Dyer.\n\nWith the margin between winning gold and going home empty handed \"hundredths of a second\", two-time world champion Weston knows that innovation in aerodynamics is key to the \"minor gains\" needed.\n\nWhile the BBSA say they are disappointed with the decision, the British team know they are in a strong position without the new helmets.\n\nBetween them, Weston and Wyatt have won all seven World Cup races this season while three women have qualified for the Olympics for the first time in British history.\n\nWhen discussing the matter before the verdict was announced, Wyatt, Weston and women's skeleton rider Tabitha Stoecker all said they did not mind which helmet they wore at the Games.\n\n\"All of our success has been with the other helmet - for me this is the tiniest little thing in the background,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\"I'm not worried, whatever we end up wearing I think we're in with a great shout of bringing some medals home.\"\n\nThree-time overall World Cup winner Weston added: \"I have other things I can focus on and other things I'm working on to maximise my performance coming into the Olympics.\n\n\"If these new helmets get though then great it's an added bonus. But if not then we are in a pretty solid place.\"\n\nStoecker added: \"We've been competing in our regular training helmets all year and having amazing results.\n\n\"With or without that [helmet] I think we all feel really confident in the team and in our abilities and what we're going to be able to lay down at the Games.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold said: \"It's good to get the decision out of the way before official training has begun. The athletes are likely to be unaffected mentally and their preparation is unaffected.\n\n\"I personally like to see developments in elite sport, innovation is important, maybe this process will develop the rules further and create more clarity within the rules, and therefore allow for some innovation.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "After suffering an injury prior to the Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and realizing three minutes into her free skate that she wouldn't be receiving a medal, Bonaly decided to pull out her signature move, a backflip with a landing on one blade, which was then illegal in competition.\n\n\"I wanted to do something to please the crowd, not the judges,\" she said, according to the Miami Herald and the Washington Post. \"The judges are not pleased no matter what I do, and I knew I couldn't go forward anyway because everybody was skating so good.\"\n\nThe Huffington Post reported Bonaly is one of only a few female skaters to have ever performed the move in competition, and the only skater, male or female, to ever land a one-foot backflip.\n\nIn one of the biggest scandals in sports history, Nancy Kerrigan was physically attacked and struck in the leg on January 6, 1994, which put her at risk of never skating again.\n\nAt the time, she was the top ice skater in the US and a gold medal hopeful for the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\nHarding pleaded guilty to failing to cooperate with prosecutors. She was fined $160,000 and barred from ever participating in skating competitions again.\n\nHarding's ex-husband, her former bodyguard, and two others spent time in prison for their connections to the scheme after pleading guilty to charges.\n\nFor more than two decades, Harding denied knowing anything about their plot, but in a 2018 ABC special, she admitted she had an inkling the men were behind it. However, she's maintained she had no part in planning the attack.\n\nThe error during the women's all-around threw many athletes off their game, and some fell. Eighteen gymnasts used the vault before one flagged the issue to organizers.\n\nFive gymnasts took the opportunity to re-perform their vaults after the botched vault setting was revealed, ABC News reported.\n\nThe International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) said the organizations tasked with overseeing the equipment were reprimanded, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\"It was checked. Believe me, it was checked. I'm sure triple-checked,\" Slava Corn, then-president of the media commission for FIG, said following the error, AP reported.\"And, quite frankly, I don't think we'll ever have an error like this again.\"\n\nAt the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Jones became the first woman to win five track-and-field medals at a single Olympics. Three of her medals were gold.\n\nHowever, in 2007, Jones admitted she had used steroids to prepare for the games and gave up her medals.\n\n\"I have let my country down, and I have let myself down,\" Jones said at a press conference outside court in 2007. \"I recognize that by saying that I'm deeply sorry, it might not be enough and sufficient to address the pain and the hurt that I have caused you. Therefore, I want to ask for your forgiveness for my actions, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\"\n\nIn January 2008, she was sentenced to six months in prison for lying to federal investigators about her steroid use ahead of the Olympics and for her involvement in a separate check fraud case.\n\nIn 2025, Jones, who went on to play professional basketball after her prison term, told The Athletic she has moved on from the scandal. \"You not only have done your physical time, but you've done your mental time, as well,\" Jones told herself.\n\n\"You've apologized more times than you ever needed to. Now it's time for you to live your life,\" she added.\n\nThe story began when Ryan Lochte's mother told USA Today that he'd been robbed at gunpoint. He repeated the claim to other outlets, saying he and his teammates had been robbed at gunpoint by men posing as police.\n\nHowever, police in Brazil said they were unable to confirm their account with witnesses. Within days, Conger and Bentz told police that Lochte had made up the story.\n\nInstead, an investigation found that after the four men had asked their taxi driver to pull over at a gas station, they engaged in public urination and vandalism. They were then confronted by armed security guards, police said.\n\nA week after his initial claims, Lochte admitted to exaggerating their original story in an interview with NBC, saying, \"If I hadn't exaggerated the story or told the entire story, none of this would have happened. I was coming from the France house, I was highly intoxicated, and I made immature accusations. If I had not done that, none of this would have happened.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"truly, 110% sorry.\"\n\nLochte was given a 10-month suspension from domestic and international competitions, while Feigen, Bentz, and Conger were given four-month suspensions for failing to come forward about what actually happened that night, The New York Times reported.\n\nSha'Carri Richardson, one of the fastest female runners in the US, was excluded from the US relay team in 2021 after testing positive for THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis, at the US Olympic Team Trials. She later admitted she had taken marijuana after learning from a reporter that her biological mother had died.\n\n\"I'm not making an excuse or looking for empathy in my case,\" the then-21-year-old athlete said in an interview with NBC's \"Today\" show. However, she added that finding out about her mother's death and dealing with the relationship they had \"was a very heavy topic.\"\n\nUSATF said in a statement: \"First and foremost, we are incredibly sympathetic toward Sha'Carri Richardson's extenuating circumstances and strongly applaud her accountability — and will offer her our continued support both on and off the track.\n\n\"While USATF fully agrees that the merit of the World Anti-Doping Agency rules related to THC should be reevaluated, it would be detrimental to the integrity of the US Olympic Team Trials for Track & Field if USATF amended its policies following competition, only weeks before the Olympic Games,\" the statement continued.\n\nRichardson did make the 2024 Paris Olympics, however, and earned silver and gold medals there.\n\nIn 2021, German coach Kim Raisner was ejected from the Olympic competition following an incident involving athlete Annika Schleu and her horse, Saint Boy. When Saint Boy refused to jump during the show-jumping round of the women's event, Raisner was heard encouraging Schleu to \"really hit it, hit\" the horse to get it to jump, and even struck Saint Boy herself.\n\nFollowing the incident, animal safety at the event was called into question. The Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne, which oversees the pentathlon, said the incident caused \"distress both inside and outside the global UIPM Sports community.\"\n\n\"UIPM regrets the trauma suffered by Saint Boy in this high-profile incident and has penalized the coach who violated the UIPM Competition Rules by striking the horse from outside the ring,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\n\"Although no athlete or horse was physically injured on August 6, the best possible safeguards must be in place to minimize risk in future,\" it added.\n\nUltimately, the UIPM's executive board voted to remove horse riding from the modern pentathlon. The change came into effect after the 2024 Paris Olympics, and obstacle course racing will replace the equestrian event at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nKamila Valieva, a skater competing for the Russian Olympic Committee, was embroiled in a doping scandal after it emerged she had tested positive for trimetazidine, a drug the World Anti-Doping Agency categorizes as a \"hormone and metabolic modulator,\" as reported by The Associated Press.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that the drug can \"bolster endurance and improve circulation,\" potentially giving athletes who do not need to use the drug a competitive advantage.\n\nValieva's lawyers said her positive test was the result of a mix-up with her grandfather's medicine.\n\nAfter news of the skater failing the drug test in December 2021 emerged in early February 2022, Valieva was suspended from competition. However, the decision was appealed and overturned, allowing Valieva to continue with the competition. The IOC later challenged that decision, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport lifted her suspension.\n\nUltimately, Valieva was allowed to skate, a move that drew backlash from the skating community, including commentators Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir.\n\nAmerican sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson said she believed she was treated differently from Valieva over their positive tests because she is Black; the IOC denied that was the case.\n\nThe skater earned first place in the women's short program on February 15, 2022, but she placed fourth in the women's free skate two days later after two falls, keeping her out of medal contention.\n\nThe IOC had said it would not hold a medal ceremony if she were in the top three.\n\nIn a July 2024 press release, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) said it received a video of six-time dressage medalist Dujardin \"engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare,\" noting that \"the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during a training session conducted by Ms. Dujardin at a private stable.\"\n\nThe Guardian reported Dujardin whipped a horse more than 20 times during the session.\n\nShe was issued a one-year suspension, a fine, and barred from the Paris Games.\n\nDujardin released a statement on Instagram, writing that the video showed her \"making an error of judgment.\"\n\nShe added, \"What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils; however, there is no excuse. I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.\"\n\nDujardin finished her statement with an apology and said she would \"cooperate fully\" during investigations.\n\nThe women's artistic gymnastics floor exercise final was full of drama. Team USA gymnast Jordan Chiles was initially awarded a score of 13.666, placing fifth.\n\nHer coach, Cecile Landi, appealed the score based on the routine's difficulty, and officials re-evaluated it, awarding Chiles a 13.766, bumping her from fifth to third place and allowing her to receive the bronze medal instead of Romania's Ana Bărbosu.\n\nAfter the competition, Team Romania filed an inquiry about Team USA's request to review Chiles' score, arguing that the challenge wasn't submitted within the 60-second limit.\n\nOn August 10, the Court of Arbitration ruled that Team USA's appeal was four seconds late and reinstated her original score of 13.666, putting Bărbosu back in third place.\n\nThe IOC agreed with the court and released a statement that it is \"in touch with the NOC of Romania to discuss the reallocation ceremony and with USOPC regarding the return of the bronze medal.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics and the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee released a joint statement defending Chiles and Landi's original inquiry, writing, \"The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics released an additional statement on X that Landi requested to file the inquiry 47 seconds after the publishing of Chiles' score, writing, \"The time-stamped video evidence submitted by USA Gymnastics Sunday evening shows Landi stated her request to file an inquiry at the inquiry table 47 seconds after the score is posted, followed by a second statement 55 scores after the score was originally posted.\"\n\nIn January 2026, Switzerland's federal court said the case would be returned to the Court of Arbitration for further review, in light of new video evidence.\n\nAlgerian boxer Imane Khelif faced scrutiny throughout the Olympics due to the spread of misinformation about her sex.\n\nThe controversy began after Italy's Angela Carini withdrew from her competition against Khelif, refusing to shake her hand and saying she'd \"never been hit with such a powerful punch.\"\n\nCarini's actions reignited debate over the International Boxing Association's (IBA) 2023 decision to disqualify Khelif from the world championships.\n\nThe IBA — which was banned from the Olympic family in 2023 — said Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting failed \"to meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams repeatedly defended Khalif and Yu-ting against the unspecified tests and the scrutiny they faced. No evidence was presented publicly that Khelif violated Olympic eligibility rules.\n\n\"The whole process is flawed,\" Adams said, per the AP, adding, \"From the conception of the test, to how the test was shared with us, to how the tests have become public, is so flawed that it's impossible to engage with.\"\n\nKhelif and Yu-ting went on to win gold medals in their respective weight classes.\n\nAfter Khelif's win, she said, \"I'm a woman like any other woman. I was born a woman, I lived a woman, I competed as a woman.\"\n\nEleven members of China's swim team for the 2024 Olympics were involved in a 2021 doping scandal, NBC reported.\n\nThese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned drug that's used to treat heart-related conditions, in 2021, but the results didn't come to light until 2024.\n\nChina said the athletes' levels of trimetazidine were the result of contaminated food, which the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted. Thus, none of the swimmers was sanctioned.\n\nAll of the athletes were allowed to compete in Tokyo, including Wang Shun, who won the gold medal in the men's 200-meter individual medley. He also won the bronze medal in the same event this year.\n\nAP reported that Shun, through a translator, said, \"Chinese swimmers only compete cleanly.\"\n\nThe city of Paris invested $1.5 billion to clean the River Seine, which had been closed to swimmers for more than a century because of pollution levels. Mayor Anne Hidalgo even swam in the water to prove its safety.\n\nA representative for Paris 2024 told Business Insider in a statement that \"this project to make the Seine swimmable after 100 years is a major achievement.\"\n\nHowever, even after the 2024 Olympics got underway, there were concerns about levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river, and the men's triathlon was rescheduled, the AP reported.\n\nOlympic athletes ultimately swam in the Seine, but the reviews left something to be desired.\n\n\"While swimming under the bridge, I felt and saw things that we shouldn't think about too much,\" Jolien Vermeylen of Belgium told Dutch television station VTM, Metro reported.",

    "fullText": "Swiss Alpine skier Franjo von Allmen was crowned the first champion of the 2026 Winter Olympics as Italians Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris won their nation's first medals in the downhill.\n\nVon Allmen blazed down the iconic Stelvio in a time of one minute 51.61 seconds, 0.20 seconds quicker than fellow 24-year-old Franzoni.\n\nParis, the veteran on the podium at 36, was half a second slower than Von Allmen as he pipped Swiss great and runaway World Cup leader Marco Odermatt to the bronze medal.\n\n\"It feels kind of like a movie, not really real,\" said Von Allmen.\n\n\"I can't tell you what it means to me.\"\n\nWhen the last Olympics took place, Von Allmen was yet to make his World Cup debut but he has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top.\n\nHe won World Championship gold in 2025 - the youngest man to win the downhill title in 36 years - with that victory coming before he won the first of his four titles on the World Cup circuit.\n\nBut it hasn't been any easy run to glory.\n\nAt 17, after the sudden death of his father, he struggled to finance his promising ski career.\n\n\"My racing career was hanging in the balance,\" he told Swiss outlet Blick., external\n\nHe decided to crowdfund, and eventually raised enough money to continue for another season, after which he made the jump on to the Swiss national squad.\n\nHe credits training as a carpenter with \"shaping him\", and has previously spent his summers working on construction sites.\n\nBut that will not be necessary now, having become the fifth Swiss Olympic downhill champion since 1948.\n\nVonn disputes doctor's knee injury claim\n\nGB on brink of mixed semis after another win\n\nSwiss skiers had held all three podium positions before the Italians entered the start gate, with Franzoni and Paris knocking off Alexis Monney and then Odermatt with impressive performances in sunny Bormio.\n\nParis is seen as a king of this course, having won seven World Cup titles across both downhill and the Super-G, and he won a first Olympic medal at his fifth Games.\n\n\"Getting the first medal in front of the home crowd, that's really special,\" he said.\n\nBut for the Italians, their medal success comes in what has been an emotionally difficult season, five months after the death of their team-mate Matteo Franzoso in a training crash.\n\nFranzoso suffered a head injury in a collision with a fence in La Parva, Chile, in September.\n\nLast month, after winning World Cup gold at prestigious Kitzbuhel, Franzoni said he had raced with Franzoso \"in his mind\" after the two had shared a room at the course a year previously.\n\n\"To share the podium with Franjo, after [doing so at] the junior world championships [in 2022], he's such a great guy,\" said Franzoni.\n\n\"Also with Domi, I really wanted to share a podium with him. I don't know if he'll continue racing next year but this is the biggest stage to share.\"\n\nAs a junior, Franzoni used to race against Jannik Sinner, who was a standout skier before pursuing tennis.\n\nIn fact, Sinner, now a four-time Grand Slam champion, once beat Franzoni in 2009, something he was made aware of after the latter's super-G victory in Wengen earlier this year.\n\nSinner followed Franzoni on social media and the pair have since struck up a friendship.\n\n\"Receiving a message from a champion like him gave me a lot of motivation,\" said Franzoni after his Kitzbuhel win.\n\n\"I thought, 'If he wrote to me, it means I'm doing something right'.

    "description": "Chris Lillis said he's \"heartbroken\" by what's happening at home, but \"would never want to represent\" another country",
    "fullText": "Skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess talked about the \"mixed emotions\" that come with representing the U.S. amid political turmoil at the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nLillis said he's \"heartbroken\" by what's happening in the U.S.\n\nAnti-ICE protestors staged a rally in Milan on Feb. 6\n\nTwo Team USA athletes are speaking out about what it means to them to represent their country before the rest of the world amid a season of political turmoil at home.\n\nWhile several athletes skirted around the question of politics with diplomatic answers about representing personal values at the 2026 Winter Olympics, freestyle skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess acknowledged that wearing red, white and blue at this point in history comes with mixed emotions during a press conference on Friday, Feb. 6.\n\nLillis, 27, said that he loves the United States and “would never want to represent” any other country at the Games. Still, he acknowledged that he’s “heartbroken” over what’s happening in the U.S. amid President Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\n“A lot of times, athletes are hesitant to talk about political views and how we feel about things. I feel heartbroken about what’s happening in the United States,” he said. “I’m pretty sure you’re referencing ICE and some of the protests and things like that. I think that as a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we’re treating our citizens as well as anybody, with love and respect.”\n\nHe continued, “I hope that when people look at athletes competing in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent.”\n\nHess, meanwhile, said it “brings up mixed emotions” to represent the United States at the 2026 Games.\n\n“It’s a little hard. There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t,” the skier, 27, said. “I think for me, it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home… all the things that I believe are good about the United States.”\n\nHess noted that “just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S.”\n\n“I just kind of want to do it for my friends and my family and the people that support me getting here,” he said.\n\nThe immigration conversation in the U.S. has become heated in recent months, especially after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alexi Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota.\n\nICE tactics — including the nearly two-week detainment of a 5-year-old boy — have drawn outrage from some, prompting protests nationwide and abroad. Citizens of Milan, the main home of the 2026 Winter Olympics, staged an anti-ICE protest on Friday, Feb. 6, while Vice President JD Vance’s appearance at the opening ceremony later that day prompted boos from the crowd when he was shown on screen at the stadium.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

Kyle Negomir (1:53.20) posted the best time of the four Americans in the field for a 10-place finish.\n\nThe other two U.S. skiers, Bryce Bennett (1:53.45) and Sam Morse (1:53.68), placed 13th and 19th, respectively.\n\nA field of 36 skiers each got one crack at the downhill course.

They compete in the free dance on Saturday.\n\nJapan are second and pushing hard after Kaori Sakamoto triumphed in the women's singles short programme.\n\nThe team competition concludes on Sunday after the free skating finals.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's mixed doubles curlers moved to the brink of the Winter Olympics semi-finals with three matches still to play, as a statement victory over heavyweights Canada maintained their 100% record.\n\nUS honorary coach, hype man and rapper Snoop Dogg was not in the house on Saturday, but Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds made their own headlines, roaring into a 5-1 lead after just three ends before closing out a 7-5 triumph.\n\nThe sense is six wins should be enough for a place in the last four and the British pair have already hit that mark to sit top of the round-robin standings.\n\nOnly the US - who GB play at 13:35 GMT live on BBC Two - had beaten Canada's Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman so far. But the husband-and-wife team could not compete with childhood friends Mouat and Dodds.\n\nThree points in the opening end set the tone - and sent a cascade of noise rolling down from the wooden bleachers in the quirky Cortina Curling Stadium - and a series of judicious shots ensured the Scots kept their opponents at arms length.\n\nThe GB pair led 5-2 at the halfway interval, before two more fabulous closing throws by Dodds left it at 7-3 with two ends remaining.\n\nCanada were done at that stage, and looked poised to concede as Dodds lined up a final stone to take a point in the seventh. But a rare overthrow instead gifted them two and extended the contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds did not falter, though, blanking that final end to all but seal a semi-final spot.\n\nElsewhere, Kirsty Muir enjoyed a confident start to her Olympic campaign, placing third in freeski slopestyle qualifying.\n\nMuir, one of Team GB's best medal hopes, scored a best of 64.98 from her two runs in Livigno.\n\nThat put the 21-year-old behind Switzerland's Mathilde Gremaud and China's Eileen Gu - the gold and silver medallists from Beijing 2022 respectively - in the standings.\n\nGu, a triple medallist from four years ago, is one of the biggest global stars at these Games but avoided an early shock after crashing off the first rail of her opening run.\n\nAfter almost a year out with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, Muir has won three World Cup golds in the past year, including two in slopestyle.\n\nThe Olympic final takes place on Monday from 11:30 GMT.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Italy welcomed the world with a snow-capped spectacle during the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Olympics, pushing past pre-Games tension.",
    "fullText": "Spread across more than 265 miles in four different cities from the snowy Dolomites to the sunny — for now — streets of Milan, the Milan-Cortina Olympics delivered one message.\n\nThe most widespread Olympic Games in history showcased Italy’s idyllic snow-capped mountains, cutting-edge city life and celebrated winter legacy in the opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Games on Friday. The unique setup that required four ceremonies in Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina d'Ampezzo used movie magic on video screens, a golden ring and Italian icon Andrea Bocelli to bridge the distance between host cities Milan and Cortina and unite the Olympics behind the athletes who will compete across seven sports zones in the next 16 days.\n\n“Let these Games be a celebration of what unites us, of everything that makes us human,” International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry said in her speech, her first at an Olympic Games under her leadership. “This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be — together.”\n\nThe theme for Milan-Cortina’s opening ceremony was armonia, or harmony. The Games needed it.\n\nThese Olympics appear to be the most disconnected ever. The sprawling footprint covers seven different competition zones. The 2026 Games are the first to be officially hosted by two cities.\n\nBut the geographical distance is small compared to the geopolitical canyon the Games hope to bridge.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine is keeping most Russian athletes out of the competition. Only 32 athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports were allowed and will have to compete as individual neutral athletes. They will not hear their national anthems or wear their national flags. Ukrainian athletes marched into San Siro Stadium — where athletes competing in ice sports participated in the opening ceremony — to loud cheers.\n\nWhen talk of protest or political conflict arose this week, Coventry tried to downplay it to keep the focus on the Games. She called controversy about LA28 chairman Casey Wasserman and ICE agents in Milan \"sad\" distractions. The United States was at the center of much of the contention after reports concerning the presence of U.S. immigration agents in Milan prompted anti-ICE protests. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee tried to cool tensions by clarifying that the organization does work with the federal government to help secure the Games, but the USOPC works with the Diplomatic Security Service, which falls under the jurisdiction of the State Department and not Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.\n\nPresident Trump’s recent comments about the United States taking control of Greenland from Denmark also angered European allies.\n\nOn Friday, an American fan walked around the concourse at San Siro Stadium in a sweatshirt that read in multiple languages: “Sorry for our president.”\n\nWhen Vice President JD Vance, sitting in the presidential suite, was shown on the video screen at San Siro, the cheers that showered U.S. athletes when they entered the stadium turned into jeers. Vance attended multiple events this week, including the U.S. women’s hockey’s group stage opener Thursday and the team figure skating competition Friday.\n\nThe 323-athlete U.S. delegation led by flag bearers speedskater Erin Jackson in Milan and bobsled athlete Frank Del Duca in Cortina was the largest in the nation's Winter Olympics history and the largest of any country at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nAthletes marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium, the home of AC Milan and Inter Milan, across a spiral-shaped stage. The four ramps converging into a circle represented the connection between Milan, Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina.\n\nEven if athletes of a country were not competing in Milan and were unable to attend the opening ceremony, a sign-holding volunteer dressed in a silver floor-length puffer dress strutted across the stage while screens showed athletes marching in during ceremonies at other Olympic locations around Italy.\n\nIn Cortina, a Brazilian athlete did a backflip after talking through a golden ring portal, a shared symbol at each ceremony. While Olympians in Milan walked into a packed stadium with flashing lights and thumping techno music played by a DJ at a turntable that looked like ice, the mountain ceremonies took place through the streets. Fans assembled on either side of the walkway for the parade of athletes.\n\nThe ceremony hit on the quintessential northern Italian experience. A plate of risotto was among the first images shown on the video board in the countdown video as the ceremony approached, followed by the picturesque snowy peaks of the Dolomites. As a fashion capital of the world, Milan used runway models dressed in green, white and red outfits designed by Giorgia Armani to represent the Italian flag. There was even a two-minute video on Italian hand gestures.\n\nItaly, as the host nation, marched in last to deafening applause and cheers from the crowd in Milan. In about two years, the United States will have the honor of closing the parade of athletes when L.A. hosts the 2028 Summer Games. The opening ceremony is also planned to take place in multiple locations, with the Coliseum and SoFi Stadium co-hosting the event.\n\nTo unite the Italian host cities, the Olympic flame was passed out of the stadium as Bocelli belted and the torch simultaneously reached two cauldrons. In Milan, the pulsating cauldron inspired by the sun will burn at Arco della Pace. In Cortina, it will light up Piazza Angelo Dibona.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "An enthusiastic welcome for American athletes at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics opening ceremony quickly soured when cameras focused on Vice President JD Vance.\n\nTeam USA, led by speedskater and flag bearer Erin Jackson, was among the final delegations to parade into Milan’s San Siro stadium on Friday.\n\nWhile the crowd cheered for the athletes, jeers and whistles erupted as Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, appeared on stadium screens, waving American flags.\n\nCommentators highlighted this distinct shift in the crowd’s reception.\n\n“There’s the vice president and his wife, Usha; those are not, oh, those are a lot of boos for him,” one commentator said on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s coverage.\n\nThe Independent’s Flo Clifford reported from inside San Siro stadium, “A largely positive reception for the U.S. contingent. There are thousands of American fans in the stadium - but very definite boos and jeers for vice president JD Vance and his wife, second lady Usha Vance, who the camera pans to waving American flags for a few brief seconds.”\n\nSupport for the U.S. among its allies has been eroding as the Trump administration has taken an aggressive posture on foreign policy, including imposing tariffs, military action in Venezuela and threats to invade Greenland.\n\nOn social media, viewers at home noted hearing the boos as well. It comes after International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry urged spectators to be “respectful” toward U.S. athletes after worldwide backlash over Trump’s immigration raids and the killing of two Americans by border officers in Minnesota.\n\nJeers also rang out when Israel's delegation entered the stadium.\n\nBesides Milan, athlete parades were held in three other locations: Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livigno and Predazzo. The Games are staged across a vast area of northern Italy, making them the most geographically dispersed Winter Olympics in history.",

Because through you, we see the very best of ourselves,\" she told the athletes.\n\n\"You remind us that we can be brave. That we can be kind. That we can get back up, no matter how hard we fall.\n\n\"The spirit of the Olympic Games is about so much more than sport. It is about us - and what makes us human.\n\n\"This is the magic of the Olympic Games: inspiring us all to be the best that we can be, together.\"\n\nWhile events such as curling, figure skating and ice hockey have already begun, the first five gold medals of the Games will be won on Saturday.\n\nAll you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nHow Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear\n\nSnoop Dogg, selfies and a clean sweep for GB curlers\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

My \"job\" was being the parent of an Olympic athlete.\n\nMy daughter, Gwen Jorgensen, was set to compete in the women's triathlon, and our family had flown from Wisconsin to Rio de Janeiro to support her.\n\nThough we'd watched her compete in London four years prior, she was favored to win this time, putting added pressure on her and our family.\n\nWhen our family arrived at the airport, my first thought wasn't about wandering the city or soaking up the sun on the beach.\n\nInstead, it was about delivering a package to Gwen's hotel room for her coach. (She chose to avoid the Olympic Village this time, and instead stayed in a hotel on Copacabana Beach, within walking distance of the triathlon's start line.)\n\nThen, I was tasked with buying bottled water. When traveling, Gwen avoids ice cubes, tap water, and local foods as a precaution against illness — no churros or rodízio-style meat for her, which the rest of us enjoyed later.\n\nWhen I arrived at her hotel with several gallons, Gwen was so busy that she grabbed the water and rushed me back out the door. I only saw her for a few seconds.\n\nTo be fair, her schedule was packed. That day, in addition to doing three workouts (swimming, biking, and running), she had booked an interview, scheduled a massage, and planned for a nap, the last two of which were necessary to be ready for the biggest race of her life.\n\nOver the next few days, I only saw Gwen for a few minutes at a time, usually to perform a task for her, like picking up energy drinks, clothes, and sunglasses from sponsors, like Red Bull and Oakley.\n\nThe night before the race, I couldn't sleep. My head played a loop of the catastrophes that could ruin a race: a crash, a flat tire, fatigue, heat, or injury. Gwen had experienced them all.\n\nAnd now, there was added pressure from the media to win the USA's first Olympic gold medal in triathlon.\n\nIn the morning, our growing group of friends and family (more supporters had joined us in Rio) gathered in the hotel lobby to walk to Copacabana Beach, where Gwen would begin the race by swimming 1.5 kilometers in the ocean.\n\nOur daughter had received two comped tickets to share with us, and the rest of our group paid for their seats. We sat together in the bleachers, in an area athletes would circle past several times during the 40-kilometer bike ride and 10-kilometer run that followed the swim.\n\nMy heart was pounding as a gunshot signified the beginning of the race and the competitors dove into the water.\n\nTriathlon is a low-profile sport, so there were no TV cameras to record me closing my eyes every time Gwen descended a dangerous, winding hill or cheering as she battled for the lead. I'm doubtful there's any footage of how I hugged my husband and anyone within arm's reach as our daughter crossed the finish line in first place, crying in amazement at her own success.\n\nI tried to remember those moments: Gwen congratulating the other athletes, Gwen embracing her husband and then her coach, Gwen waving at us from the podium with a gold medal around her neck.\n\nI anticipated spending the rest of the day celebrating with my daughter, but it would be hours before we reunited.\n\nAfter the podium, an escort whisked Gwen off for interviews and photos. Meanwhile, I was led to an open-air NBC studio on the beach, where she'd appear later.\n\nWhen Gwen finally arrived, she hugged me, handed me the medal, and was then ushered to a chair for hair and makeup.\n\nAlthough it was mid-afternoon, she hadn't eaten lunch, so her sister fed her bites from a takeout box while professionals aimed a blow dryer at her hair and dabbed foundation on her skin.\n\nAs Gwen got up from the chair, she gave me one more hug and asked if I had any deodorant. She hadn't gotten a chance to shower and was worried she smelled bad. Even gold medalists still need their parents.\n\nAfter the interview, Gwen disappeared once more, saying we wouldn't see her again until 9 p.m. for a celebration at the Team USA House.\n\nAt the party, my family and I heaped appetizers onto our plates and sipped wine, as photos of Gwen and her teammates flashed on giant screens around the room.\n\nEventually, Gwen spoke, thanking those who had invested in her success, including me, my husband, and her sister, acknowledging that her win was only possible because of so many.\n\nI knew she appreciated everything we did, but it made me proud to hear her say it.\n\nMy day ended at midnight, and I barely slept as I replayed the race in my head and anticipated more celebrations to come.\n\nAlthough I've experienced local triathlons and global championships, nothing compares to the Olympics. I was privileged to be behind the scenes, playing a small part in the process.\n\nGwen may have been the favorite, but racing is unpredictable, and wins are never guaranteed.\n\nWhen my daughter's dream came true, I was the one with misty eyes at the ceremonies. Gwen had spent her tears at the finish line, years of pressure finally released.",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn successfully completed her mandatory downhill training run at the Winter Olympics just one week after rupturing her left anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nThe 41-year-old announced on Tuesday that she had suffered the knee injury in a crash, which saw her airlifted to hospital, at the final World Cup race before the Games in Switzerland.\n\nBut Vonn, the Olympic downhill champion in 2010, completed a smooth run at the Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina in one minute 44.33 seconds, 1.39 seconds off the fastest time of the day.\n\nIn a powerful news conference earlier this week, Vonn had expressed her determination to compete in Sunday's downhill race but was unsure whether she would also make it to the team and Super-G events, which take place on 10 and 12 February respectively.\n\nSkiers must complete at least one training run to be able to compete in Sunday's race and will have the option of a second practice run on Saturday.\n\nIn a session heavily delayed because of foggy weather at the top of the course and already postponed from Thursday because of adverse weather conditions, many of the skiers missed gates on what was a soft course.\n\nThat means overall times might look fast but are somewhat deceptive - while missed gates in Sunday's race will result in disqualification.\n\nVonn appeared largely untroubled by her knee, which is supported by a brace, opting for an aggressive line to ensure she did not miss a gate in tough weather conditions and fist bumping compatriot Breezy Johnson after crossing the line.\n\nAfter finishing the run she was asked: \"All good?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" she replied, and walked away having said she would not speak to any media following the session.\n\nHer Norwegian coach and double Olympic gold medallist Aksel Lund Svindal did speak to reporters and said he thinks Vonn still has a chance of winning a medal.\n\n\"From what I saw today I think she can,\" he said.\n\n\"There were reserves today. She looked symmetrical. You've seen earlier this season that when she skis well, she can win. It's going to be hard but I think she could possibly bring that on Sunday.\"\n\nVonn has said that her knee is not swollen or painful and that is why she felt \"confident\" she could compete, posting a video on her Instagram of her doing a barbell squat in the gym on Thursday.\n\nThe four-time world champion was one of the favourites for the gold medal in Cortina prior to her injury and leads the standings in the downhill World Cup.\n\nVonn is aiming for a remarkable comeback having retired from the sport in 2019 before returning in December 2024 following a partial replacement of her right knee.\n\nWhat's happening and when at the Winter Olympics\n\nAll you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nChemmy Alcott, four-time Olympic Team GB skier\n\nIt's fair to say the girls expected a much more substantial base than what they skied on in this training run - there was a lot of head bobbling entering the finish and a bit of a lack of trust.\n\nThat's because of the warm weather - it's kind of like a sugar coating on the top of the slope so they're not getting that confidence or purchase on the outside ski.\n\nFor Vonn, it's fantastic to get the run in and it all came down to experience for her.\n\nShe knows this hill, this is one of her favourite hills and watching her ski with one ACL on that terrain you could tell that she reads the terrain and knows it.\n\nI think it will be a massive confidence boost for her, especially in these conditions where a lot of the other athletes struggled and she delivered a good performance.\n\nThere's things to work on, a few times you could see a bit of backing off on that knee but she successfully skied at 80mph with a torn ACL.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

The ski resort in the Dolomites was previously the host in 1956.\n\nThe competitions will take place in seven different locations in northern Italy as 2,900 athletes will compete for gold, silver, and bronze medals until February 22.\n\nThe main opening ceremony will begin at 8 pm (1900 GMT) in Milan's San Siro stadium. Italian President Sergio Mattarella will officially open the 25th Winter Games with a speech.\n\nThe musical program will feature many prominent figures, such as pop star Mariah Carey and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\nThe traditional athlete parade will also take place in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Predazzo, and Livigno.\n\nAlso for the first time, there's going to be two Olympic cauldrons: one at the Arco della Pace in Milan and another at Piazza Dibona in Cortina.\n\nIt's still unknown who will light them up, but according to media reports Olympic alpine skiing champions Alberto Tomba and Deborah Caompagnoni will take the prestigious task.\n\nSeveral prominent political figures will be in attendance. More than 50 heads of state and government are expected to be at the San Siro.\n\nUS President Donald Trump won't attend the ceremony, but US Vice President JD Vance landed in Milan on Thursday. Germany will be represented by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nThe opening ceremony, as well as the entire Games, will take place under tight security amid fears of attacks and sabotage.

    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics are upon us and Italy is ready - almost - to host 'the greatest show on Earth'.\n\nSome 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on snow and ice over the next 16 days.\n\nThe Games are spread out across hundreds of miles in northern Italy, from fashionable Milan to chic Cortina d'Ampezzo, to the fellow Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.\n\nHere is everything you need to know.\n\nWhy 2026 could be GB's most successful Winter Olympics\n\nWhat's on when? Winter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\nWhile the action began on Wednesday, the Games officially get under way on Friday when the opening ceremony takes place at Milan's iconic San Siro stadium.\n\nA who's who of stars are set to appear, including multiple Grammy Award winner Mariah Carey and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\nGiven the vast distances between the Olympic venue 'clusters', it's not possible for all athletes to be in Milan. But fear not, those based elsewhere will not miss out on the fun.\n\nA second ceremony, including its own Olympic cauldron, will take place in Cortina, while other satellite ceremonies will occur in Predazzo and Livigno.\n\nFigure skater Lilah Fear and bobsleigh pilot Brad Hall have the honour of carrying the Great Britain flag. Fear will do so in Milan, while Hall will be in Cortina.\n\nBBC coverage of the opening ceremony starts from 18:30 GMT, live on BBC Two and iPlayer.\n\nBBC Sport to show 450 hours of Winter Olympics\n\nCould it be that Great Britain - a land of no ice track, Eddie the Eagle and an average of 13 days of snow per year - is becoming a winter sports nation? Whisper it quietly, but the next few weeks could prove it so.\n\nTeam GB's best medal haul from a Winter Games is five - at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 - but UK Sport says up to eight medals could be won this time around.\n\nSo who could be standing on the podium?\n\nTeam GB have two of the best men's skeleton athletes in two-time world champion Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatt. Between them, they won every World Cup gold medal this season.\n\nTake your pick of snowboarders Mia Brookes and Charlotte Bankes, and freestyle skiers Kirsty Muir and Zoe Atkin, as to who could win the nation's first Olympic gold or silver medal on snow.\n\nOn the ice, Lewis Gibson and Lilah Fear - widely seen as the next Torvill and Dean - are very much in with a shout of winning a first British Olympic figure skating medal since 1994, while Britain's curlers look set to add to their two medals from 2022.\n\nGet to know the Team GB Winter Olympics squad\n\nYour Winter Olympics need-to-know guide in six charts\n\nVonn, Gu and Malinin - global stars to follow at Milan-Cortina 2026\n\nFor the first time since the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, a new sport has been added to the Winter Olympic programme.\n\nSki mountaineering - or skimo - will take place in the resort of Bormio and features three medal events: men's and women's sprint, and the mixed relay.\n\nAthletes start by sprinting uphill with adhesive skins on their skis to provide traction. They then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot.\n\nAfter a further uphill section on skis, they remove the skins and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThere are no British athletes competing in skimo at the Games.\n\nA string of new events have also been added to the programme for Milan-Cortina: men's and women's dual moguls, men's and women's luge doubles, men's and women's team alpine combined, women's large hill individual in ski jumping, and the mixed relay team in skeleton.\n\nMilan and Cortina were selected as host cities in 2019 and while existing facilities have largely been used, new venues have been created for ice hockey and the sliding sports.\n\nA year out from the Games starting, the Cortina Sliding Centre - rebuilt on a century-old track at a cost of more than £72m - was facing a race against time to be ready.\n\nWhile that race was won, with the opening races of the bobsleigh and skeleton season taking place on the new track in November, the same cannot be said for the Milano Santagiulia ice hockey stadium.\n\nAs recently as Sunday, Olympic organisers said the stadium would not be completely finished in time for Thursday's first match of the Games - but they were \"absolutely certain\" all scheduled fixtures will be played there.\n\nThe 11,800-capacity stadium has been beset by delays and controversies - including a boycott warning from the National Hockey League (NHL).\n\nThe rink in Milan, approved by the International Ice Hockey Federation, is shorter than the minimum requirement in the NHL, leading to suggestions there could be an increase in high-speed collisions. The quality of the ice has also been questioned.\n\nFrom an Olympics controversies perspective, things didn't get any better for hosts Italy when their biathlete Rebecca Passler was kicked out of the Games because of a failed doping test on Monday.\n\nItalian biathlete fails doping test before Olympics\n\nIce hockey venue will not be ready for start of Olympics\n\nAthletes with Russian or Belarusian passports have been banned from many sports since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn September, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it would allow athletes from the two nations to compete at the Winter Games under a neutral flag and strict conditions, as they did at the 2024 summer Olympics.\n\nThose conditions include showing they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military.\n\nIn total, 20 competitors from Russia and Belarus are set to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) at Milan-Cortina across eight sports.\n\nHowever, four of the 13 Russian athletes approved to compete have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThey are figure skater Petr Gumennik, cross-country skiers Savelii Korostelev and Dariya Nepryaeva, and speed skater Kseniia Korzhova.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but stated that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity",

    "fullText": "Snoop Dogg might have taken most of the attention in the Cortina Curling Stadium early on Friday, but Team GB's duo delivered a big-ticket performance of their own to maintain their 100% record in the Winter Olympics mixed doubles.\n\nThe swaggering rap legend - in the high-end Italian mountain resort as a Team USA hype man and \"honorary coach\" - even felt the urge to claim a selfie with Jen Dodds and Bruce Mouat after their fourth win of the competition.\n\n\"He's just asked for a photo with us, so I'm feeling pretty good about myself,\" Mouat told BBC Sport, before Dodds disclosed that Mr Dogg \"said he'd heard about Bruce\".\n\nIf he and Dodds continue this form, he won't be the only one who has.\n\nIt was another day, another victory for last year's world silver medallists; this time the fancied Sweden - who beat them to bronze in 2022 - who were the victims.\n\nThe Scottish duo delivered a display that showed as much gallus as guts, their 7-4 win takes them top of the standings as the only unbeaten team and within touching distance of the semi-finals.\n\nThe curling cognoscenti reckon six wins in the nine round-robin games could be enough to earn a place in Monday's last four, and the GB duo are well on the way.\n\nThey can edge closer when they return to the ice for the fifth time to face South Korea, who have lost all three of their matches, at 13:35 GMT, live on the BBC.\n\nOlympic skater given Minions music permission\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\nMouat has been calling himself all the bad swears during three patchy opening games amid the Dolomite mountains in the north of Italy, but one of the sport's leading lights lifted it against the Swedes.\n\nAnd in Dodds, he has a partner who has been consistently superb so far. Only Sweden's Isabella Wranaa had been statistically better but she was no match here.\n\nWhen Dodds asked her questions, she struggled to find answers. Indeed, at one stage, she battered her brush off the side of the sheet after an errant throw as the sibling bonds between her and partner Rasmus began to fray.\n\n\"The difference was the two girls. Isabella wasn't making shots, but Jen was,\" said BBC Sport pundit Jackie Lockhart.\n\nAt that stage, the GB pair were four points up - a second consecutive night without much sleep after a quick turnaround from Thursday's win over Czech Republic proving no impediment - but the lead was narrowed to 4-3 at the break.\n\nAnother two in the fifth end cleaved open the advantage again before the teams traded points in the next two to leave Sweden needing four in the final end to win.\n\nThey got none, as the end was blanked. A stunning Mouat throw proved decisive, evincing a first-pump from the restrainted Scot and earning him an audience with Snoop moments later.\n\n\"Can you say you won pretty? It was just a lot better from me and happy we're making opponents play tough shots,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nUp in the Italian Alps, snowboarder Txema Mazet-Brown was the first Team GB athlete in action at the Livigno Snow Park.\n\nMaking his Olympic debut, the 19-year-old placed 21st in big air qualifying with a score of 151.75, with only the top 12 progressing to Saturday's final.\n\n\"I'm happy with the riding, it could have been a bit better with the cleanliness of one [run], but not bad overall,\" Mazet-Brown told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Standing up there, you realise that this is one of the biggest events in the world. I'm proud, for sure. You get a little tingling, some butterflies, but that's a good thing - it's really special.\"\n\nMazet-Brown will return to action on 16 February in slopestyle qualifying, an event he says he came to Italy \"more ready\" for.",

They played a key role in fundraising to send her to Turin to compete on the ice, and still proudly remember their involvement.\n\nOne of them being Emma Dainton, who along with Colin Harris, canoed a 35-mile route from Pewsey to Bath along the Kennet and Avon Canal.\n\nEmma said: \"It was so quiet on the canal until a swan chased us for a while, and we joked about it and we cheered each other on.\"\n\nDuring the Games, Emma was travelling in Australia and watched the heats on TV with her fellow backpackers.\n\n\"I told them all about Shelley and how I was part of her fundraising team and she was from my village,\" she added.\n\nBack at home, nothing could prepare landlord Jerry Kunkler for the world's media and fans cramming into his Moonrakers pub.\n\n\"My phone kept ringing and ringing, all the local and national media wanted to come to the pub, it was all happening.\n\n\"I had to get up early for breakfast TV and was able to talk to Shelley live from Turin. It was a whirlwind,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Games, Shelley was greeted by a champion's welcome when she arrived home.\n\nLocal newspaper reporter Nigel Kerton organised an open-top bus parade to travel through the village.\n\nNigel recalls how he phoned a bus company to see if it was possible.\n\n\"I had a dream for this to happen. You see football teams do it after cup finals, so why not for Shelley.\n\n\"It left the train station and we could see the crowds building. There must have been thousands there,\" he added.\n\nShelley said she was in disbelief when she returned home and saw how many people had turned up to cheer her home.\n\n\"There were so many friends from school I recognised and just people I saw around the village,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she will always feel grateful to those that supported her and the strong community that Pewsey still has today.\n\n\"It is just stunning around here, there's a great community spirit. I always appreciate what they did for me,\" she added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "title": "Crotch-gate: The biggest controversy heading into the Winter Olympics involves … ski jumping?",
    "description": "Ski jumping has been pushed into the spotlight after a whistleblower uncovered a cheating scandal that involves, of all things, crotch manipulation.",
    "fullText": "MILAN — Adrian Livelten hunched over a sewing machine last March on the eve of the men’s ski jumping competition at the Nordic World Ski Championships.\n\nThe suit technician for Norway’s national ski jumping team brazenly made alterations to suits belonging to the country’s two top contenders after those suits had already passed inspection. Livelten did this in plain view of Norway ski jumping head coach Magnus Brevik, seated in a chair halfway across the room.\n\nWhat neither Livelten nor Brevik realized at the time was that someone was recording them in secrecy from behind a curtain, someone who intended to distribute the video far and wide the following day. The damning footage shared by the anonymous whistleblower shook the sport of ski jumping, bringing out into the open the cheating that happened behind closed doors.\n\nWhen officials from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) seized suits belonging to reigning Olympic champion Marius Lindvik and fellow Norwegian Johann André Forfang, they found rules violations that initially went unnoticed during the competition. Stiffer, non-elastic thread had been sewn into the suits to pull down the crotch area during flight, increasing the surface area and creating more aerodynamic lift in a sport where inches can be the difference between medaling and missing the podium.\n\n\"Probably the most shocking part was that it was Norway because they’ve always been considered one of the more standup teams,” said Johnny Spillane, the first American to medal in the sport of Nordic combined, which consists of ski jumping and cross-country skiing. \"Everyone is going to push the limits. That hasn't changed and that probably will never change, but this was deliberately altering a suit after it had been tested in order to cheat. This was the most blatant cheating I've heard of.\"\n\nThe Norway cheating scandal highlighted two irrefutable facts about the crotch-obsessed sport of ski jumping on the precipice of the 2026 Winter Olympics. There is, as Finnish coach Petter Kukkonen put it last April, “a culture of cheating” in ski jumping. And the battleground between unscrupulous teams and rule-upholding regulators is often below the belt.\n\nMale ski jumpers must wear tight-fitting suits that are no more than 4 centimeters larger than their body measurements at any point. Most national teams seek to find every millimeter they can because a bigger, baggier suit catches more wind and provides more lift during flight than a smaller one does.\n\nFittingly, the most advantageous place to enlarge a ski jumper’s suit is the crotch area. Adding just a centimeter of fabric to the circumference of that part of a suit increases flight distance by approximately 2.8 meters — or more than 9 feet — according to a study published by Frontiers in Sports and Active Living in October 2025.\n\nAthletes chasing that competitive advantage have resorted to trickery when having their body dimensions measured prior to a competition. The more they reduce the distance between their inseam and the floor when FIS equipment controllers record their body measurements, the lower regulators will allow the crotch of their suit to hang while airborne.\n\nIn November 2020, Kukkonen told Finland’s leading tabloid newspaper that athletes were stuffing dish cloths and sponges in their underwear during body measuring. In a recent appearance on the Skirious Problems podcast, Austria’s Mika Vermeulen revealed that when he competed in nordic combined earlier in his career, veterans told him before his first body measuring, “It’s very important to tape your c*** back.”\n\nVermeulen later described ski jumpers putting modeling clay in their underwear to lower their crotch-to-floor measurement by five centimeters.\n\n“People used to cheat a f*** ton,” Vermeulen said.\n\nSalacious stories like those were already pushing ski jumping out of the margins and into the mainstream entering these Olympics. Then the German tabloid Bild sparked further curiosity in January when it reported that ski jumpers have worn condom-like sleeves filled with hyaluronic acid to enlarge themselves before measurement.\n\n“When I read that article, all I could do was shake my head,” USA Ski Jumping and Nordic Combined sport director Anders Johnson said. “If that is really what other people were doing previously, I can't believe that that's how far people have taken it.”\n\nOn Thursday, the alleged scandal went to the top of the performance-enhancing food chain when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was asked about it just 24 hours before the Opening Ceremony of the 2026 Olympics.\n\n\"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that [an enlarged crotch area in their suits] could improve performance,” WADA president Witold Banka said. “If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"\n\nCheating in ski jumping isn’t a new phenomenon. Athletes have been pushing boundaries and exploiting loopholes ever since the sport’s governing body began setting rules restricting how far they can fly.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Austrian national team unveiled suits that were highly permeable in the front but did not allow air to pass through in the back. The resulting parachute effect helped Austrian jumpers take gold and silver in the men’s large-hill event at the 1976 Winter Olympics. Seventeen-year-old Austrian prodigy Toni Innauer set a world record the following month and then bettered it two days later.\n\nThe success of those suits inspired copycat attempts, some well-executed, others not so much. Former American ski jumper Jeff Hastings recalls an early 1980s competitor who “put a garbage bag in the back of his suit to try to get the ‘76 Austrian effect.”\n\n“Everybody could hear him up there rustling like crazy,” Hastings said. “It wasn’t even effective but he was just trying to get a little advantage.”\n\nDetailed rules governing the air permeability of ski jumping suits soon went into effect, but that didn’t deter athletes eager to find even the slightest competitive advantage. Retired ski jumpers have admitted to coating the back of their suits with hairspray or slathering on wood glue in an effort to reduce air flow, improve lift and fly longer.\n\n“You name it, people have tried it,” Spillane said.\n\nAs the sport’s deep-pocketed superpowers stopped buying suits from third-party manufacturers and started hiring sophisticated specialists to produce them in-house, new opportunities to cheat have materialized over the past 10-15 years. Teams sought to gain an advantage by creating custom suits for athletes that exceeded their body measurement by as much as possible without resulting in a disqualification.\n\nThe ideal place to add material is where the legs converge, according to Dr. John Goff, visiting physics professor at the University of Puget Sound and author of the book Gold Medal Physics. The crotch area of the suit is naturally stretched wide with a jumper’s legs in a “V” position during flight. It’s also close to the body’s center of gravity, helping an athlete gain lift without sacrificing control.\n\n“The crotch region, where the legs part, is kind of a sharp transition point,” Goff said. “If you can put some kind of material there to smooth that out, you can reduce the turbulence and increase the lift for the skier. That can have a pretty big influence on the flight.”\n\nFor FIS regulators seeking to prevent teams from gaining an advantage, the process starts with athletes stripping down to their underwear. Athletes must have their body dimensions measured before competitions in the presence of an FIS equipment controller, a team official and a qualified doctor or nurse.\n\nSince 2023, those measurements have sometimes been taken with the help of a 3D body scanner. Before then, it was always a manual process. As American Nordic Combined skier and 2018 Olympian Ben Berend once detailed in a blog post, that made the crotch measurement part of this process particularly awkward.\n\n“The process consists of standing with your feet 40 cm apart wearing nothing but underwear,” Berend wrote in 2016. “Then a metal rod is moved up as high as possible until it hits your junk. The measurement is essentially junk to floor in centimeters.”\n\nThe intrusiveness doesn’t end once the measuring process is over. Athletes also must endure what FIS described in a 2023 memo as a “visual crotch area inspection.” A supervising doctor or nurse checks the athlete “for any irregularities in the genital area” — in other words an artificial prosthesis in the athlete’s underwear that could reduce the crotch-to-floor measurement.\n\nAs a result of stories like the ones shared by Kukkonen and Vermeulen, the process is fraught with suspicion that national teams are finding ways to bypass the rules.\n\nA friend recently sent Hastings a screenshot of one of the world’s top-ranked ski jumpers in mid-flight last year.\n\n“The crotch on his suit practically came down to his knees,” Hastings said. “I’m exaggerating a little bit, but it looked like he had a diaper on.”\n\nBetween suspicious images like that one, unconfirmed gossip about which teams were cheating and the knowledge of how much difference a little extra fabric can make, Johnson admits it creates a toxic culture.\n\n“If one team starts cheating, then two or three start doing it,” Johnson said. “Once you have the best nations in the world doing it, then everyone kind of has to follow suit. It just spreads like wildfire and then once it does, it’s really hard to get back.”\n\nThe chicanery mostly occurred in secret until the anonymous whistleblower shined a spotlight on Norway’s dishonesty and turned the birthplace of ski jumping into a symbol for everything wrong with the sport. Austria, Slovenia and Poland filed formal protests against the Norwegians during the World Championships and called for their results to be annulled.\n\n“This is doping, just with a different needle,” former German Olympic champion Jens Weissflog told the German newspaper Bild at the time.\n\nLindvik and Forgang claimed ignorance, insisting they never would have jumped had they known their suits were rigged. When their coaches backed them, the Norwegian ski jumpers received suspensions of just three months, enabling them to return in time for the 2025-26 World Cup season and the Olympics, where the men’s competition begins on Feb 9.\n\nThe penalty was harsher for Livelten, Brevik and Norway assistant coach Thomas Lobben, each of whom confessed to being part of the conspiracy. On January 15, an independent ethics panel backed the FIS’s request for a punishment strong enough to serve as a deterrent against future cheating, suspending the trio for 18 months apiece.\n\n“In (the panel’s) view, now is indeed the appropriate time to put down a clear marker to what is not acceptable,” the panel’s scathing ruling read.\n\nFor many in American ski jumping circles, the Norway cheating scandal entangled close friends. In 2022, USA Ski Jumping signed a formal partnership with the Norwegian national team for the current Olympic cycle to hold joint training camps and coaching clinics and to collaborate on sports science.\n\nWhile Johnson doesn’t condone what Norway did, he also bristles at how the Norwegians have become “the scapegoat for a much broader issue within our sport.”\n\n“There has been a lot of hypocrisy from other nations,” Johnson said. “I don’t have any personal beef with any of these teams, but it was incredibly disappointing for me to see the response from some of the nations. I think everyone needs to take a look at themselves in the mirror. No one can say they were fully clean. They can only claim they are because they didn’t get caught.”\n\nEmbarrassed by the Norway scandal, FIS has since hired new equipment control coordinators and introduced sweeping reforms for the 2025-26 season. The changes include increased use of 3D scanners for pre-event body measurements, more precisely defined rules for how suits can be cut and shaped and more training for equipment controllers who oversee pre- and post-jump inspections.\n\nHarsher sanctions can now be issued for rules violations during 3D measurement or for the manipulation of a suit after it has passed inspection. Athletes disqualified for an equipment violation during a competition will receive a yellow card. A further transgression will result in a red card and suspension from the following event.\n\nTo Johnson and many others in the ski jumping community, the most notable change is one that has gone unmentioned in any FIS press release.\n\nIn the past, Johnson found that “it was much easier for FIS to discard or disqualify athletes from smaller nations because they didn’t have that political pull in the sport.” This year, highly ranked jumpers from prominent nations have been cited for equipment violations, athletes like Slovenia’s Timi Zajc, who was tied for second place at an event in Germany earlier this winter when he was disqualified for suit violation.\n\n“This year, it doesn’t seem to matter if you’re from Austria or Slovenia or Poland or the United States,” Johnson said. They’re enforcing the rules for everyone.”\n\nAs the world’s top ski jumpers prepare to showcase their talents on the Olympic stage this month, the obvious question is whether the competition will be fair. Will the threat of stricter rules and tougher punishments be enough to deter cheaters? Or will the pursuit of Olympic glory tempt some countries to try to skirt the rules?\n\n“Going into this Olympics, I have a lot more faith and trust in the system,” Johnson said, “but I still have my reservations that teams are really going to be in compliance, that they’re not going to be trying something new.”",

    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "For the first time in Olympics history, there will be two cauldrons at the Opening Ceremony.",
    "fullText": "History will be made at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics. During the Opening Ceremony Friday, Olympic torches will be used to light two separate cauldrons, the first time that's ever happened in the history of the event.\n\nThe lightings, which will take place simultaneously, will occur in two separate locations. One is located in Milan at the Arco della Pace. The second is located in Cortina d’Ampezzo in Piazza Dibona. Olympic organizers decided on two cauldrons as a way to show harmony and unity between both host cities of the 2026 Olympics.\n\nThe cauldrons are meant to evoke the work of Leonardo da Vinci, particularly his knots, which appeared in his paintings and manuscripts.\n\nWhile Olympic organizers have not announced the exact time the cauldrons will be lit, it will likely occur near the end of the Opening Ceremony, which will start at 2 p.m. ET and run for roughly three hours. That should result in the cauldrons being lit in the final 30-45 minutes of the Opening Ceremony on Friday.\n\nOlympic organizers tend to keep details about the Opening Ceremony a secret, so there's been no official announcement on who was chosen to light the two Olympic cauldrons Friday.\n\nTypically, the host country chooses current or former Olympic athletes for the honor. At the 2024 Olympics in Paris, French track and field star Marie-José Pérec, who won three gold medals during her career, was one of the two people selected to light the cauldron. The other was French judo gold medalist Teddy Riner, who also won three gold medals during his Olympic career.\n\nDuring the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, skier Zhao Jiawen and cross-country skier Dilnigar Ilhamjan were chosen for the honor. Both athletes took part in the 2022 Olympics, though did not medal in their events.\n\nItaly could turn to skiers Deborah Compagnoni and Alberto Tomba for the honor if it wanted to highlight successful Olympians from the past. Compagnoni and Tomba each won three gold medals at the Winter Olympics during their careers. Neither were selected to carry the torch leading up to the cauldron lightings, so it's possible organizers are saving Compagnoni and Tomba for this moment.\n\nThe Milan Cortina Opening Ceremony will take place Friday, Feb. 6, at roughly 2 p.m. ET. It will be 8 p.m. in Italy when the Opening Ceremony kicks off. The entire event is expected to take roughly three hours and will feature a parade of athletes from each country, as well as performances by Mariah Carey, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and Italian actor Sabrina Impacciatore.\n\nThe event will stream live on Peacock at 2 p.m. ET, and will be aired in primetime on NBC at 8 p.m. ET.",

    "fullText": "MILAN — A team full of star power, the United States women got a balanced attack, including two goals from their 13th forward and a hard-working goal from their fourth line, as the Americans opened the 2026 Olympics with a 5-1 win against the Czech Republic, also known as Team Czechia.\n\nIn just 6:45 of ice time, Hayley Scamurra scored two goals and fourth-liner Joy Dunne scored her first career Olympic goal as the United States rolled. Czech goalie Klára Peslarová was tested early and often, making 37 saves on 42 shots, while Aerin Frankel stopped all but one of the 14 shots she faced.\n\nThe game was played with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in attendance with his wife and kids, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Vance stood up and cheered for five American goals scored by Scamurra, Dunne, Alex Carpenter and Hilary Knight.\n\nCarpenter and Tessa Janecke each had two points. Defender Laila Edwards had an assist in her first-ever Olympic hockey game and became the first Black woman to play for the U.S. at an Olympic women’s hockey tournament.\n\nCzechia next plays Friday against Switzerland, while the Americans are at least scheduled to play Finland on Saturday.\n\nFinland’s game against Canada on Thursday was postponed until Feb. 12 due to a norovirus outbreak on the Finnish team. Thirteen players were quarantined at the athletes’ village after being either stricken by or exposed to the virus.\n\nUSA GM Katie Million said the IOC hasn’t given direction yet as to whether Saturday’s game will go on as scheduled, but there is a medical meeting scheduled for Thursday night and they hope more information will be shared.\n\nHeading into Thursday’s game, only Hockey Hall of Fame forwards Jayna Hefford and Hayley Wickenheiser had scored in five Winter Olympics. We can now add Hilary Knight, who is playing in her fifth and final Olympics, to that list.\n\nHer goal was a beauty as she took Carpenter’s pass in the neutral zone, lowered her shoulders and outhustled the defender to the net for her first goal of the tournament and to give Team USA a 4-1 lead.\n\nIt was Knight’s 13th goal at the Olympics, which puts her just one off the United States record held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. It was also her 28th point — four away from Jenny Potter’s all-time record.\n\nThe goal came after coach John Wroblewski tweaked the lines from the United States’ four Rivalry Series wins. He cited chemistry as the big reason he added Hannah Bilka to the top line alongside Carpenter and Knight; all three play together on a line for the PWHL Seattle Torrent. Britta Curl-Salemme was also moved up to the second line with Minnesota Frost teammate Taylor Heise and Abbey Murphy, while Janecke moved from first-line left wing to fourth-line center.\n\nAfter Wednesday’s practice, Wroblewski spoke about Joy Dunne and how it was only a matter of time that Dunne scored for Team USA.\n\nTo fact check the coach: Dunne has scored in a U.S. jersey, at the 2024 women’s world championship in Utica, but the point still stands. That it was only a matter of time before she found the back of the net in Milan.\n\nDunne is a player Wroblewski felt really earned her roster spot on the Olympic team through the little details of her game. She has size (5-foot-11) and incredible compete. She wins puck battles and she’s strong on the back check.\n\nSo even though she hadn’t scored since 2024, Wroblewski saw her as a valuable player to have on this talented roster — and someone to watch.\n\nThe goal came off a sweet setup from Janecke – the first of two goals in 1:23 as the Americans quickly turned a 1-0 lead into 3-0 to seize control.\n\nTwo minutes after taking an interference penalty on Edwards, Czech forward Barbora Jurickova jumped out of the penalty box to score Czechia’s lone goal of the game.\n\nJurickova, who started the game as the Czech’s 13th forward, skated in alone against Frankel with all five American power-play players pushing into the zone. As their time on the advantage expired, Abbey Murphy had a shot blocked and, on a beautiful play, Natálie Mlýnková spotted Jurickova coming out of the box.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nToronto Sceptres, Minnesota Frost, Vancouver Goldeneyes, New York Sirens, Montreal Victoire, Ottawa Charge, Seattle Torrent, Boston Fleet, NHL, Olympics, Women's Hockey, Women's Olympic Ice Hockey, Olympics, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nMILAN — What does four-time tennis major winner just do after reaching the semifinals of the 2026 Australian Open?\n\nVolunteer at the 2026 Winter Olympics, of course.\n\nFormer world No. 1 player Jannik Sinner was spotted as a volunteer for the Olympics of his home country of Italy. In a social media video, he is seen checking tickets for a train alongside Paralympic fencing champion Bebe Vio, who is also from Italy.\n\nma jannik controllore??? non mi sento bene😭😭 pic.twitter.com/4mqeCgcfVK\n\n— sconnessa (@alexiuss11) February 5, 2026\n\nIt's proof that Sinner kept his promise, as he was the first official volunteer named for the Milano Cortina Games. He did it as he used to ski when he was younger.\n\n\"I am proud to represent the passion for these extraordinary disciplines and the desire to contribute to the success of such a unique event,\" Sinner said in September 2024.\n\nIt's a quick turnaround of jobs for Sinner after he just finished up the Australian Open less than a week before the video surfaced. A two-time winner of the event, he advanced all the way to the semifinals of the event on Jan. 30, where he lost in five sets to Novak Djokovic.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jannik Sinner volunteers at 2026 Winter Olympics after Australian Open",

    "fullText": "The Ohio State Buckeyes women's hockey team is currently No.2 in the country. However, they will be spending the next few weeks without one of their best players, Junior forward Joy Dunne. Dunne is in Italy right now, playing for Team USA at the Winter Olympics. And she is making the most of her time away from Columbus.\n\nIn Team USA's first game, a Group A round robin match against Czechia, Dunne picked up her first ever Olympic goal in her first ever Olympic game. Dunne's opportunity was created by Tessa Janecke (who currently plays for Penn State), who stole the puck in the offensive zone. Her push to the goal was turned away, but she got the puck behind the net before finding a slashing Dunne on a perfect centering pass. Dunne slammed the puck home for an easy goal and a 2-0 Team USA lead.\n\nTWO GOALS IN 83 SECONDS. The USA makes it 3-0 thanks to Joy Dunne and Hayley Scamurra!\n\n📺 USA & Peacock pic.twitter.com/pZjgx3PGAu\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 5, 2026\n\nLater in the second period, former Buckeye Hannah Bilka also assisted on a goal that stretched Team USA's lead to 4-1. The Americans would go on to win by a final score of 5-1. Team USA and Canada are the prohibitive favorites to meet in the eventual Gold Medal game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buckeyes Wire: Watch: Ohio State's Joy Dunne scores first Olympic goal for Team USA",

    "fullText": "All eyes are on Milan and Cortina as the 2026 Winter Olympics get underway. However, not all the news has been positive in the lead up to these Olympics, as frustrating construction issues have caused massive headaches around the rink set to host the men's and women's hockey tournaments.\n\nBack in December 2025, news broke that the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena was beset by construction issues that delayed tests of the rink. Originally, the rink was supposed to house Olympic-sized ice, but reports then surfaced that the arena will have an ice surface smaller than NHL standard, which is already smaller than the international dimensions. Not only that, there was reportedly no Plan B if the arena wasn't ready in time, which meant work had to be done around the clock to get Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena up and running.\n\nThen in January 2026, just a few short weeks away from the Olympics, reports surfaced that while the playing surface, practice facilities and dressing rooms were finished, other parts of the arena might not be done in time. The arena also is set to house fewer people than expected, as original plans had 16,000 seats in the arena while the latest count sits at 11,800 seats.\n\nThe doom and gloom over Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena's construction certainly cast a pall over the start of the Olympic festivities. However, based on recent reports, it seems as if things have fallen into place for the arena. The NHL was reportedly pleased by the mid-January ice test and members of the French team have since taken to the rink to practice with no glaring issues. French captain Pierre-Édouard Bellemare told The Associated Press that skating \"feel[s] like you're on a lake a little bit\" but overall the verdict was \"not bad\" even if some final touches still needed to be done.\n\nOf course, once fans get into the arena and more players and media begin to arrive, it's possible other issues arise or are brought to light. For now though, it seems as if the arena will be up and running to house the hockey tournaments this February.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: The Milan Cortina Olympic hockey arena issues, explained",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva's former coach is back at the Winter Olympics, this time working with a Georgian athlete, and the World Anti-Doping Agency isn't happy about it.\n\nWADA president Witold Banka said Thursday at the Milan Cortina Games that he's not comfortable with Eteri Tutberidze’s presence at the competition. She is accredited with Georgia as the coach of European champion Nika Egadze.\n\nValieva, then aged 15, was at the center of a legal battle during the 2022 Beijing Games when a sample she gave two months earlier tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine. The revelation came after Valieva won team gold with other Russian skaters. She was later disqualified from that event, which upgraded the United States to gold. Valieva was a contender for the women’s gold medal but placed fourth and was criticized rink-side by Tutberidze.\n\n“It’s not our decision the coach is here,” Banka said Thursday at a news conference in Milan. “The investigation found no evidence that this particular person was engaged in this doping process, so there’s no legal basis to exclude her from the presence during the Olympic Games.”\n\n“But of course, if you ask me personally about my feelings,” he continued, “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here in the Olympic Games, for sure.”\n\nThe Georgian Figure Skating Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nValieva's ban expired in December, despite legal efforts to have it overturned.\n\nRules have been changed to raise the minimum age for skaters to 17 in time for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

It was just not our time this year, but very well could have been.\n\n\"We have qualified for the World Championships in the relay so will be looking to make amends there in March.\"",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds built on their opening Winter Olympics mixed doubles curling win as a stunning four-point haul in the penultimate end secured victory over Estonia in Cortina.\n\nThe Team GB duo - who beat Norway in their opener on Wednesday - were kept honest by the Estonian debutants, but their class ultimately told in the latter stages to force an early end to the contest and a 10-5 triumph.\n\n\"We've played them a lot and knew we'd have to step up our performance from last night and we did that,\" Dodds told BBC Sport.\n\nThe GB duo will have a few hours off before facing the Czech Republic in their third round-robin game at 18:05 GMT on Thursday - live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\n\"We probably only got five or six hours sleep last night, so a nap is needed this afternoon,\" Dodds added.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nGB started with the hammer, took two in accomplished first end, and looked like they might enjoy a comfortable start to the day in Italy.\n\nEstonia responded by doing the same, though, after a slight Dodds error with her last stone. \"Sorry, Bruce,\" said the 34-year-old, who was slightly errant again with her opening rock of the third end.\n\nBut Dodds, peerless against Norway, righted herself to deliver a magnificent final store and restore GB's two-point advantage.\n\nThe Estonians should have pulled level again, but a Marie Kaldvee mistake ensured they still trailed at the break. \"It's been a bit of back and forth,\" was how 2022 Olympic gold medallist Vicky Wright described it.\n\nKaldvee was slack again upon the resumption and Mouat - fuelled by an interval munch of mango - delivered with GB's final stone to extend the advantage to 6-3 with three ends remaining.\n\nEstonia - who overcame a four-point deficit in the final end against Switzerland in their opener - employed their powerplay in the sixth and moved back within one after capitalising on a rare Mouat error.\n\nGB played their own powerplay in response and made full use of it, a furious double sweep by both Mouat and Dodds earning a decisive four points after some deliberation with the measuring stick.\n\nThat opened up a five-point chasm, which persuaded the Estonians to shake hands and concede defeat with an end to spare.\n\n\"That was better from me today. I had a few that slipped up, but I called myself a bad word, and moved on,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We're very happy with how we're performing and excited to get GB off on the right foot.\"\n\nHow Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear\n\nGB skeleton team appeal after new helmet shape ruled out",

This discrepancy exists because the IOC allows certain territories and dependencies to compete as independent entities, even if they lack full United Nations representation. For instance, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico send their own distinct Olympic delegations rather than competing as part of the United States.\n\nMORE: Inside the venues for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics\n\nThe IOC suspended Russia and Belarus from the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, but 12 athletes from those countries will still compete.

    "fullText": "Two figure skaters are preparing to compete at their first Winter Olympics.\n\nKristen Spours and Ed Appleby, who train at the Link Centre in Swindon in Wiltshire, have both overcome challenges ahead of the Milan-Cortina Games, which officially begin on Friday.\n\nSpours had back surgery shortly after qualifying in March 2025 and was forced to take four months away from the sport, whilst Appleby injured his ankle during the off-season.\n\nSpours said her Olympic story was \"less about medals and more about resilience\".\n\nThree weeks after qualifying at the World Championships, Spours ruptured a disc in her back and underwent spinal surgery.\n\n\"I was done at that point. I thought it was over. I couldn't fathom a world where I would ever be back,\" she said.\n\nThe 25-year-old took four months away from her sport to recover.\n\nIn November, just over six months after her surgery, she won a national title at the British Championships.\n\n\"I think you often don't stand back and look at how far you've come.\n\n\"I've worked my life to become an Olympian and that's my story,\" Spours added.\n\nHospital patients face car park charge 'confusion'\n\nNew health centre to ease hospital pressures\n\nResident safe after fire badly damages bungalow\n\nEd Appleby, 21, travels from his home in Colchester to train in Swindon.\n\nDespite his ankle injury, he defended his British title in November 2025.\n\n\"We know that the hard work has been done, we just need to follow it through,\" said Appleby.\n\nAppleby said he had dedicated the past few years completely to training and had taken a break from education after his A-levels, but plans to go to university in September.\n\nHe said the ambition for this Olympics is not a medal but a \"sense of achievement to actually be there and soak up the moment and just make the most of that experience\".\n\nChris Boyadji, who coaches the pair, said seeing them compete would be a \"magical moment\".\n\nBoyadji said the injury worries resulted in a \"slow start\" to the season but that they both \"fought very well and I'm very pleased that we're in this position right now\".\n\n\"I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish with the skaters,\" he added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "description": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympics athlete, you pick yourself up and try again.",
    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training; when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "fullText": "Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris crashed on Wednesday night and had to be stretchered off the course during big air training ahead of the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nIt's unclear what happened exactly, but the Canadian snowboard team described the crash as “heavy” in a statement. Specifics of McMorris' condition are not yet known, either.\n\n“Snowboarder Mark McMorris had a heavy crash this evening during big air training,” the team said in a statement on social media. “Canadian Olympic Committee and Canada Snowboard staff are attending to him. We will provide more information as it becomes available.”\n\nThe 32-year-old is making his fourth Olympic appearance for Canada. Qualifying for the big air competition is set for Thursday night, one day before the Opening Ceremony. It’s unknown if McMorris will be able to compete anymore.\n\nMcMorris has won three bronze medals in his Olympics career. He claimed third in slopestyle in each of the past three Olympics, and he finished in 10th in the big air competition in both the PyeongChang Olympics in 2018 and the Beijing Olympics in 2022. He has won four of his 12 X Games gold medals in the big air competition, too, which was only added to the Olympics in 2018. In the big air competition at the Olympics, riders take off from a ramp that is more than 165 feet tall.\n\nMcMorris, per the CBC, suffered life-threatening injuries after he slammed into a tree during a backcountry ride in 2017. That resulted in him having a rod placed in his leg, a plate in his arm and another plate in his jaw. Despite that and other significant injuries, McMorris said last month that he felt he was in good health entering these Games.\n\nThe men’s big air final is set for Saturday night at the Livigno Snow Park. Qualification for the men’s slopestyle will start on Monday, Feb. 16.",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds overcame a power cut and the loss of the first end to get Team GB's Winter Olympics off to a winning start in the mixed doubles curling against Norway.\n\nThe Scottish duo, who are considered serious medal contenders in this event, cut relaxed figures inside the quirky, partially-wooden Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium in Italy, which was built for the 1956 Games.\n\nEven the loss of light in parts of the venue during an ugly opening end didn't discomfit last year's world silver medallists, who took three in the second end and would never trail again in the first of their nine round-robin matches.\n\nMouat and Dodds ultimately won 8-6 to right the wrongs of the 2022 semi-final, in which they spurned a lead to lose to the Norwegian pair before going on to be beaten by Sweden in the bronze-medal match.\n\nAnd it sets them up nicely for Thursday's ties against Estonia (09:05 GMT) and the Czechs (18:05) - both of whom lost their openers - live across the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nThe pounding music and disco lights lent a sense of occasion to the first action of this year's Games in the high-end Italian resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nThe snow which had hammered down all day in the Dolomites had turned to sleet by the time the four matches started in front of a healthy crowd inside the 3,500-capacity arena.\n\nBut many of those spectators were cast into darkness for four or five minutes early on until someone put some change in the meter, the scoring screens flickered back into life and play resumed.\n\n\"I didn't mind the lights going off,\" said Mouat. \"It was a bit of a boogie, a rave... it was like a nightclub.\"\n\nWhen the dancing stopped, Norway's husband and wife team of Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien initially took control before the sides fell into a cagey contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds seized the initiative in a splendid second end - the final accounting reached after some lengthy deliberation with the measuring stick - and led 4-3 at the break after edging a tight fourth against the 2002 silver medallists.\n\nThe interval did check the momentum of the childhood friends a little, as Norway - who also won bronze in 2018 - drew level again.\n\nNedregotten's flawless play was keeping Norway in it - wife Skaslien's struggles threatening a little domestic disharmony - but even his efforts could not prevent Team GB snatching three in the sixth end thanks to a stunning Dodds throw.\n\nThat opened a three-shot lead with two ends to play.\n\nAnd, although the Norwegians invoked the powerplay to cut the deficit to one, Mouat and Dodds did likewise in the last end to close out a statement 8-6 win.\n\n\"It took us a bit of time to work out one end was curling more than the other, but once we did we took a step up in performance and took control from there,\" Dodds said.\n\n\"It's a good confidence builder to start the week.\"",

Ahmed Fareed will now host “Olympic Late Night” from Feb. 7 to 9, replacing Craig Melvin.\n\nMelvin will remain stateside rather than traveling to Milan for the Games.\n\n“Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family. They continue to have our full support,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented commentators who will step in and fill these roles.”\n\n“Mary is one of the most experienced Olympic commentators ever and a master storyteller,” she added. “She and Terry will lead the American audience through one of the world’s greatest global moments. With his skill and versatility, Ahmed has proven time and again he can step into any hosting role, and we’re thrilled he’s available to handle our late night coverage before heading to Los Angeles for NBA All-Star Weekend.”\n\nThe Milan Games will be Carillo’s 17th Olympics that she has covered — she was already scheduled to be a correspondent in Milan. Of Italian descent herself, the commentator has a personal connection with the host city. This year will be her 14th Olympic assignment with NBC.\n\nAs previously announced, Shaun White will join the Opening Ceremony commentators in the booth during the Parade of Athletes. Following her Opening Ceremony duties, Carillo will cover the Games as a SportsDesk reporter.\n\nGuthrie’s 84-year-old mother Nancy has been missing since late Saturday night. The case has escalated from a missing-person to a suspected abduction with authorities saying they found signs of forced entry in her Arizona home.\n\nLive coverage of the Opening Ceremony begins Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, with primetime coverage scheduled for 8 p.m. ET/PT on both NBC and Peacock.\n\nThe post NBC Sports Taps Mary Carillo to Fill In for Savannah Guthrie at Winter Olympics appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "The British skeleton team appeal after their new helmets for the Winter Olympics are ruled unsafe.",
    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - have been told their helmets do not meet safety standards only days out from the competition starting.\n\nThe British team have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for sport (Cas) after the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) said the helmets \"did not comply with the IBSF skeleton rules based on its shape\".\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) said the helmet was designed with safety in mind.\n\nThe team would currently not be able to wear the helmets in competition, but the Cas ruling will be heard on Thursday, with the result expected on Friday, before competition begins on 12 February.\n\nThe British skeleton team enjoyed a successful 2024-25 season, with Matt Weston winning overall World Cup gold and Marcus Wyatt silver, winning all seven races between them.\n\nThat success came using a different helmet, and the BBSA told BBC Sport the helmet it had hoped to use for the Games in Italy is a new design for the 2026-27 season, which begins towards the end of the year.\n\nIt said it has tried to be \"innovative\" with the new design, which it believes to \"be in the current rules\".\n\nIt said the new helmet has been designed to comply with new rules imposed by the IBSF for the 2026-27 season, which are aimed at improving safety, and that it is proven to be safer than any other helmets being used.\n\nThe rules set out the safety standards helmets must meet and have stipulations about the shape. For example, the helmet must not have any additionally attached aerodynamic elements.\n\nThe team wore the new helmets last week at a training session in Switzerland but have also brought the old helmets to Cortina.\n\nAt the 2010 Games the USA and Canada lodged a protest moments after British slider Amy Williams won the gold medal, alleging the small ridges on her helmet were illegal, but the protest was thrown out.\n\nAt the 2018 Games British medallists Lizzy Yarnold, Laura Deas and Dom Parsons wore specialised skin suits featuring drag-resistant ridges, the legality of which was also questioned by rival teams.\n\nWeston is the heavy favourite for the gold medal in Cortina, with the men's event beginning on 12 February and the women's on 13 February.\n\nLizzy Yarnold, two-time British skeleton Olympic champion\n\nThere will always be a different kit which is being worked on - whether it's the helmets, the sled, the suits itself - they will all go through a process of making sure that they abide by the rules and it's the best kit possible for the athletes.\n\nI think there's always likely to be noise around equipment. The British team wore this helmet in Switzerland last week, so it's not a hidden thing.\n\nBut the noise around it is almost very anticipated, because whenever you bring in new equipment it has to go through the process of being checked.\n\nWhether there is an element of gamesmanship having a new helmet, I don't think that is at play.\n\nI don't know whether the athletes will have a preference on which helmet they use but they know they are performing well and can still perform well with the old helmet.\n\nThey will be happy with all of the different versions of equipment, so their role is simply just focusing on the matter at hand.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Olympics stand as the most prestigious sporting event worldwide.\n\nEvery two years, athletes from hundreds of nations gather in a single location, alternating between summer and winter Games. They compete for medals and national pride, pushing the world's top competitors.\n\nItaly is honored to host the 2026 Winter Olympics from February 6 to February 22. This will be Italy's fourth time hosting the Olympics and its first since 2006.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2026 Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nMORE: Who are the biggest USA Olympic hockey snubs?\n\nThe 2026 Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo has previously hosted the Olympics, but only the Summer Games. This is the first time Milan is hosting the Olympics, and it is also Cortina d'Ampezzo's first time hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nHere's a list of each time Italy has hosted the Olympics:\n\nMilan and Cortina d'Ampezzo host 15 Olympic venues. Below is a full list of the sports scheduled at each location.\n\nMilano San Siro Olympic Stadium\n\nMilano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nCortina Curling Olympic Stadium\n\nCurling, wheelchair curling, Paralympic closing ceremony\n\nAlpine skiing, para alpine skiing\n\nTesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium\n\nCross-country skiing, Nordic combined, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing\n\nAlpine skiing, ski mountaineering\n\nOlympic closing ceremony, Paralympic opening ceremony\n\nThe time difference can significantly affect viewers wanting to watch the Olympic Games. Fortunately, the Winter Games pose less of a challenge for those in the Eastern Time Zone. Italy is six hours ahead of EST and nine hours ahead of Pacific Time.\n\nThe 2021 Tokyo Olympics experienced a harsh 14-hour time difference, making viewing difficult. In contrast, the 2026 Games will be more accessible for U.S. fans to watch live without disrupting their sleep routines.\n\nMORE: When will the Olympics be in USA?\n\nHosting the Olympic Games is a great honor, but it comes with high costs. The organizers of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics have announced an operating budget of approximately \"1.7 billion euros\" ($1.9 billion).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will provide approximately $1 billion in extra funding for the February 6-22 Games. At the same time, the Italian government is investing over $1 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance access to the venues.\n\nAlthough this appears substantial, Russia reportedly invested $51 billion to host the 2014 Sochi Games, a cost that is expected to remain an Olympic record for many years to come.\n\nThe Milano Cortina Olympics will welcome thousands of athletes from across the world for the 2026 Winter Games. They'll stay in one of the six Olympic Villages spread across northern Italy.\n\nThe locations include Milan, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo, Anterselva (Antholz), and Cortina.\n\nIt is said that after the games, some villages will be converted into student housing.",

    "description": "The Panthers star gets some news.",
    "fullText": "Sam Bennett may have been the most notable snub from Team Canada's Olympic hockey roster.\n\nTurns out, the Florida Panthers star will be playing in the Olympics anyway.\n\nBennett was added to the roster as an injury replacement on Tuesday. The Lightning's Anthony Cirelli was hurt in the Stadium Series game on Sunday and will have to miss the tournament.\n\nBennett was just injured, too, but TSN's Darren Dreger says it was \"nothing serious.\" The news of Bennett as a replacement for Cirelli, and no announcement about the Panthers' injured Brad Marchand, may be a good sign for Marchand's chances of also suiting up at the Olympics.\n\nMORE: How Connor McDavid is to the Oilers what Josh Allen is to the Bills\n\nCirelli, as a faceoff guy and penalty-killing type, had a very specific role for the Canadian team. Bennett fits that pretty well, and he does bring a type of grit that Cirelli also has.\n\nBennett is a winner. He has been a part of back-to-back Stanley Cup championships with the Panthers. He was also on Canada's victorious 4 Nations Faceoff team.\n\nAt 29 years old, this may have been Bennett's best chance of making an Olympic team.\n\nThis season in 55 games with the Panthers, Bennett has 19 goals, 23 assists and 101 blocks shots.\n\nMORE: How Olympic roster freeze may create a second NHL trade deadline\n\nTeam Canada squeezed Bennett off the initial roster because it decided to keep both Bo Horvat and Nick Suzuki on the initial roster.\n\nHopefully, Bennett didn't make any plans for the Olympic break. Because after it was in doubt, he has some hockey to be played and a gold medal to chase.\n\nBilly Heyen is a freelance writer with The Sporting News. He is a 2019 graduate of Syracuse University who has written about many sports and fantasy sports for The Sporting News.
