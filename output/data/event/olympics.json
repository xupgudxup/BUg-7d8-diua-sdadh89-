    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia 76ers star Tyrese Maxey is on his way to becoming one of the more popular players in the league. He was voted an All-Star starter and will be receiving a signature shoe from New Balance. All of it is rewarding for a player who is on the up and up.\n\nOn top of being voted in as an All-Star starter, Maxey was the top vote getter among American-born players. That fact has to make one wonder whether the star guard would play for Team USA in the 2028 Olympics should the opportunity arise.\n\n\"I would love to play for Team USA,\" Maxey said on Monday. \"If I got that honor, it would be a blessing. I think it’s in LA, right? So, it’s in the United States. That would be really cool. Just to represent the country in the country and if that’s something that I have the opportunity to do, then I’ll definitely be there for it.\"\n\nMaxey will certainly be in the mix. One has to believe due to what he has done with the Sixers, he will be on Team USA's radar. The Olympic competition is heating up and one has to believe everything will come down to Maxey, Detroit Pistons star Cade Cunningham, and New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson in terms of the guards Team USA will look at.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers star Tyrese Maxey discusses 2028 Team USA Olympic possibility",
