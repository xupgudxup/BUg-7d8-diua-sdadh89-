    "fullText": "Ana Vitória is already familiar with the feeling of wearing the Amarelinha, but every new opportunity is considered special. A silver medalist at the 2024 Olympics, the midfielder was cut from the 2025 Copa América due to an injury. Back with the National Team for the first friendlies of this year, the athlete stated that she is happy to join the team.\n\n“It's always a happy moment when we have the opportunity to be here with the Brazilian National Team. This is the dream of all of us since childhood. I was very sad when I was cut from the Copa América, but that's in the past. I'm here again and I'm very happy about it,” she said.\n\nIn January of this year, the midfielder was announced by Corinthians. She had already played for the club between 2017 and 2018, before going to play in European football. After seven seasons in the Old Continent, Ana Vitória is back in Brazil and couldn't contain her happiness when talking about it.\n\nAna Vitória during training with the Brazilian National Team in Costa RicaCredits: Lívia Villas Boas/Staff Images/CBF\n\n“Being back in Brazil is something very special. I left very young, at 18 years old. It was a very good experience, it was an opportunity I needed to seize. But there came a time when I missed our country, our culture. We start playing football because we love it so much, and I think Brazilians have a special way of being happy playing football,” she stated.\n\nThe Brazilian National Team faces Costa Rica on Friday (27th), at 10 PM (Brasília time), at the Alejandro Morera Soto Stadium in Alajuela. Regarding the match, Ana Vitória highlighted that, despite the short time, the team is well prepared.\n\n“The expectation is good. We've been training well. Even though it's a short training period, we had three days to prepare, and with the videos and explanations on the field, everything is becoming very clear.”\n\nAna Vitória during training with the Brazilian National Team in Costa RicaCredits: Lívia Villas Boas/Staff Images/CBF\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "A \"distasteful joke\" by US President Donald Trump has overshadowed the achievement of female athletes at the Winter Olympics, says USA women's ice hockey captain Hilary Knight.\n\nUSA won both men's and women's ice hockey gold for the first time at the Milan-Cortina Games this month.\n\nThe men's team received a congratulatory call from Trump, who invited them to his State of the Union address and said he would have to ask their female counterparts as well or he \"probably would be impeached\".\n\nThe women's team later declined an invitation from Trump to attend Tuesday's speech in Washington DC.\n\n\"It was sort of a distasteful joke, and unfortunately that is overshadowing a lot of the success, the success of just women at the Olympics carrying for Team USA and having amazing gold medal feats,\" five-time Olympic medallist Knight told ESPN.\n\nThe men's team was criticised after several players appeared to laugh when Trump made his comment, but Knight said: \"I think there's a genuine level of support there and respect. That's being overshadowed by a quick lapse.\n\n\"The guys were in a tough spot, so I think it's a shame this storyline and narrative has kind of blown up and [is] overshadowing that connection and genuine interest in one another and cheering each other on.\"\n\nKnight, 36, ended her Olympic career with 15 goals, the most by any US male or female player.\n\nShe said she hopes the Trump controversy proves to be a \"really good learning point, to really focus on how we talk about women, not only in sport but in industry\".\n\nShe said: \"Women aren't less than, and their achievements shouldn't be overshadowed by anything else other than how great they are.\"",

    "description": "\"The battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting,” the Olympic athlete said",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn speaks candidly about her mental and physical recovery\n\nThe professional athlete suffered a horrific injury while skiing at the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nShe required a medical airlift and five surgeries, and is now expected to be in a wheelchair for the next two months\n\nLindsey Vonn is beginning to process the severity of her injury at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Feb. 24, the alpine ski racer, 41, admitted, “Today was a hard day.”\n\n“My physical battle began the second I got hurt but the mental battle started today,\" Vonn wrote. \"It hit me like a ton of bricks. It’s a battle I’m used to because I’ve done it so many times. I have always learned from every injury. Each one has made me a better and stronger person in different ways… but the battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting.\"\n\nThe athlete — who won four World Cup overall championships with titles in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012 — added that someone close to her likened her to a “master at the psychological game of life…”\n\n“I don’t know if that’s true…. I do know hard days are coming but I will find a way back to the top of the mountain of life,” she concluded.\n\nOn Feb. 8, just 13 seconds into her run in the women’s downhill event during the Milan Cortina Games, Vonn suffered a horrifying crash one week after tearing her ACL.\n\nAfter approximately 15 minutes of medical staff tending to the skier, she was placed on a stability board before being airlifted by helicopter to a hospital.\n\n\"Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,\" Vonn said, breaking her silence on social media the following day. \"It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\"\n\nElsewhere in her lengthy Feb. 9 Instagram post, the Olympian said her \"ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,\" adding that she \"sustained a complex tibia fracture\" that would “require multiple surgeries to fix properly.\"\n\nLast week, following her fifth surgery, Vonn confessed that she was “struggling a bit” due to “the extent of the trauma.”\n\nIn keeping with her promise to keep her fans updated on her recovery, on Monday, Feb. 23, she said the crash was so bad that it almost resulted in her leg being amputated.\n\n\"After two weeks, I finally made it out of the hospital. It has been quite the journey and by far the most extreme and painful and challenging injury I've ever faced in my entire life times one hundred. I'll give you the full rundown,\" Vonn said in her Instagram video.\n\nShe added that because of her complex tibia fracture, in which “everything was in pieces,\" including her \"muscles, nerves and tendons,” extreme measures needed to be taken.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n\"Dr. Tom Hackett saved my leg. He saved my leg from being amputated,\" she said, becoming emotional.\n\nVonn, who won a gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games in the women's downhill event, is expected to be in a wheelchair for the next couple of months as she recovers. However, she ended her video on a positive note.\n\n\"It's going to be a long road, but I always fight,\" she said. \"I'll keep going. No regrets. I just appreciate all the love and support. It's been amazing. Overwhelming to an extent. I wish it had ended differently, really, but I'd rather go down swinging than not trying at all.\"",

    "fullText": "An Italian athlete who competed in the 2026 Winter Olympics pulled out before his competition was over\n\nTommaso Giacomel underwent heart surgery after “struggling to breath and to move” during the sporting event\n\nThe 25-year-old biathlete is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital later this week, according to the Italian Winter Sports Federation\n\nAn Olympic athlete who competed in the Milan Cortina Games has undergone heart surgery just days after forfeiting.\n\nItalian biathlete Tommaso Giacomel is set to be discharged from Milan's Galeazzi Hospital on Thursday, Feb. 26 following an ablation procedure that was described as a “complete success,” the Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI) announced Tuesday, Feb. 24.\n\nDays before the FISI shared the update, the 25-year-old athlete shared a post to social media explaining why he felt the need to withdraw from his final ​​biathlon race at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\n“Right after the second prone my body somehow stopped working properly and I was really struggling to breath and to move, therefore I had to stop. Worst feeling I have ever experienced in my life so far,” he wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.\n\nGiacomel’s single photo upload was a selfie of him in a hospital bed with several medical sensors attached to his exposed chest.\n\n“I tried to ski really slow the first part of the third lap but my body wasn’t allowing me to ski anymore,” he continued.\n\nThe athlete added that in the moment, he felt “frustration, anger, [and] disappointment.”\n\n“It’s devastating. It’s devastating to stop but there wasn’t anything I could do against my own body today. Absolutely not the end of the games I was hoping for but I will never give up. 4 years fly by fast and I will try again in France,” Giacomel said.\n\nHe ended his post by letting his supporters know that doctors would continue running medical checks in the coming days to find the root cause of his health issues.\n\n“Get well soon, Tommy! You’ll come back stronger,” the official account for the International Biathlon Union commented.\n\n​​Biathlon is a winter sport that merges cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. It began in 19th-century Scandinavia, originating in ski warfare, and developed from the sport of military patrol.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FISI said their organization’s medical commission completed a series of diagnostic tests on Giacomel in collaboration with Professor Daniele Andreini.\n\nGiacomel “underwent a CT scan, an MRI scan, and a maximal exercise test, all of which were normal.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“A subsequent electrophysiological study revealed an atrial conduction abnormality, which recommended a subsequent ablation, which has already been performed and was a complete success,” the FISI said.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the hospital on Thursday, the Italian athlete who has competed in the Biathlon World Cup since 2019, will have routine check-ups in two weeks.\n\nGiacomel is expected to return to regular training following the completion of those check-ups, FISI said.",

I'd love to be there again in 2030 to try to get that one medal we don't have.\n\n\"Me and Grant are the two oldest in the team at 33 right now, so we'd be 37, which in terms of being a sports person is quite old, but for curling maybe not.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with BBC Breakfast, Hardie explained: \"I think that's why myself and Hammy were quite emotional on the podium. At the age of 33, you don't know if you'll get to another Olympics.\n\n\"One was a dream, two was even better. Two medals from two is amazing.\n\n\"I think we'll sit down in the summer and see what the next four years looks like.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was the same when we sat down four years ago after Beijing. What can we do different? How can we get back an change things?\n\n\"To end up with the same [medal], it's not a wasted four years because it's very special to come home with a silver, [but] it still obviously hurts because you know you wanted the gold.\"\n\nThe team have been together for almost a decade with skipper Mouat, 31, believing their closeness has played a key role in their success on the world stage.\n\n\"We know each personality so well now,\" he said. \"It's quite important you're saying the right thing to each person to get the best out of them.\n\n\"It's things we've worked on with sports psychologists. I think it's all worked in our favour and now we're sitting here with two Olympic medals.\n\n\"It's testament to all the hard work we've put in.\"\n\nMcMillan revealed their personality traits had been among the \"insights\" studied at the outset of putting the rink together.\n\n\"Bruce is that caring person, Grant's the analytical data-driven [one], always thinks before he speaks. I don't,\" said McMillan.\n\n\"I think it's great having four very different characters to help build one team,\" Hardie added.\n\n\"Nine years together working on it, it's something that clicked pretty early and it's went from strength to strength.\"\n\nNot the medal they wanted - but GB curlers bring spotlight to sport\n\nGB curlers denied Olympic gold at death yet again\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race",

    "description": "Whoopi Goldberg wonders if maybe the FBI wanted Patel out of the country for a bit simply so they could get work done without him",
    "fullText": "The hosts of “The View” were largely disgusted by video footage showing FBI director Kash Patel partying with the U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team in Milan this weekend, but Whoopi Goldberg offered a more “positive” spin on it. The ABC moderator suggested that maybe the FBI told Patel to go, simply to get him out of the way.\n\nIn the footage, Patel is seen celebrating in the locker room with the victorious U.S. team on Sunday, yelling and drinking. But, a spokesperson for the FBI insisted Patel was in Milan on official business, and that’s why he used a taxpayer-funded plane to get there. His trip to the Olympics just happened to coincide.\n\n“Maybe the folks in the FBI said ‘Yeah Kash, go do that,’ so they don’t have to deal with him,” Whoopi suggested on Monday. “Because they know he doesn’t know what he’s doing. They know that he is incompetent, they know he’s just — he’s a joke. And he’s a joke to the rest of the world, and because, for most of the people working in the FBI, it is not a joke, they’re the ones whose eyes are on the ball.”\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the women at the table weren’t so optimistic. Host Ana Navarro was quick to remind viewers that Patel has been accused of misusing the FBI plane before, and that he wasn’t the only one.\n\n“The bottom line is these people have no care about wasting taxpayer money, and they behave — I don’t even know what Kash Patel was doing there,” she said.\n\nBeyond the use of taxpayer money, the optics of Patel’s trip bothered host Sara Haines more, considering how many things are going on in this country.\n\n“Right now, the world doesn’t feel settled or stable, and you’ve got the head of the FBI, and the visual of chugging a beer in a locker room,” she said. “I just think it doesn’t — he’s already under scrutiny for a thousand reasons, because this administration has not been the defining of competence.”\n\n“So I think when you have someone like that, with all that’s going on, and then that’s what you see, I just think it’s a bit of an insult to the American people,” Haines continued.\n\nHaines lamented that she misses the days when FBI directors weren’t so prominent, which prompted guest host Amanda Carpenter to explain why that was the case and precisely why she was so bothered by the footage as well.\n\n“The reason we don’t see them is because they’re usually busy,” she said. “There’s a lot of things to do. And god forbid something happens, and it could’ve been prevented, and it wasn’t because he was concerned about hanging around in the men’s hockey locker room.”\n\n“The View” airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET on ABC.\n\nThe post ‘The View’: Whoopi Wonders If FBI Told Kash Patel to Go to the Olympics ‘So They Don’t Have to Deal With Him’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Vermont’s secret sauce isn’t maple syrup.",
    "fullText": "This essay was reprinted from Peggy Shinn’s website. Read more of Slate’s 2026 Olympics coverage here.\n\nThe United States hauled in 33 medals at the 2026 Winter Olympics, its most ever at a Games outside North America. If you think that’s impressive, consider that more than 20 percent of those went to athletes who grew up or trained in Vermont, a state with fewer residents than many midsized cities. That list includes Mikaela Shiffrin, Ryan Cochran-Siegle, and Paula Moltzan, who won gold, silver, and bronze medals respectively in Alpine skiing; Mac Forehand, who got silver in free-skiing big air; and Ben Ogden (two silvers) and Jessie Diggins (a bronze) in cross-country.\n\nNaturally, the national media went looking for a simple, pithy explanation. The New York Times wondered if there was something in the water (or fine, the snow). The Associated Press floated maple syrup as the secret sauce. That theory gets a boost from the fact that Cochran-Siegle’s clan owns Slopeside Syrup, which sells single-serve packets of syrup marketed as “all natural athletic fuel.”\n\nBut the real explanation is rooted deeper than tree sap and snow. It is based on the old-fashioned concepts of family and community, and a culture that treats winter not as an inconvenience but as infrastructure. Vermont doesn’t send more Olympians to the Winter Games per capita than any other state because the state is buried in snow. (Yes, it often is, though less reliably than it used to be.) It’s because when winter lasts half the year, you either resent it or organize around it. Similar to the Norwegians and their “joy for all” concept of athlete development, we Vermonters choose the latter.\n\nTo fend off cabin fever, we have a long tradition of getting outdoors and making the best of the cold and snow: ice fishing, snowmobiling, skiing in all forms, and snowboarding, too. (The first ski lift in the United States was built here.)\n\nI’m an eighth-generation Vermonter, which is to say I was basically issued a pair of skis at birth. My mom had my sister and me wobbling around the backyard as toddlers, skis clipped on over snow boots. Our dad added figure skates to the mix. When we weren’t carving up ice, we were outside engineering questionable sled jumps and hurling ourselves off them with the confidence of children who assume snowbanks are soft.\n\nMy daughter came up through the Pico Ski Club program, where we volunteered with the cheerful masochism that defines winter parenting. (Gatekeeping in minus-15-degree windchill, anyone?) The friendships we made there have outlasted seasons, gear swaps, and growing pains. Around here, winter sports aren’t boutique hobbies or résumé padding for Olympic dreams. They’re what you do on a Saturday. Or a Tuesday after school.\n\nFor homegrown Olympic silver medalists like Cochran-Siegle and Ogden, their routes to the Olympics began not with corporate sponsorships but with parents in puffy jackets running youth programs on volunteer time. And those parents might just be NCAA champions and/or Olympic medalists themselves. In a small state like Vermont, with a limited tax base for public programs and few deep pockets, volunteer-run kid programs mean parents don’t have to have hedge-fund incomes to afford registration fees. At least not when kids are young.\n\nOgden grew up in Landgrove—a hamlet with more porcupines than residents—and started in the Bill Koch League, an all-volunteer cross-country ski program founded in 1977 after Vermonter Bill Koch became America’s first Olympic medalist in the sport. The goal there isn’t to mint Olympians. It’s to create lifelong skiers. Kids play games and race for lollipops. Parents treat Saturday practice as a social event and a chance to enjoy skiing themselves, ending with hot chocolate at the touring center.\n\nIt may take a village to raise a ski racer. In Vermont, it also creates one.\n\nTalented athletes can graduate to one of the state’s ski academies, which function as finishing schools for skiing and snowboarding. Burke Mountain Academy, founded in 1970, has produced dozens of Olympians, Shiffrin among them. It was founded to meet a couple of needs: sell some midweek lift tickets and give kids who want to keep skiing through high school a place to both study and train. Other ski academies have popped up around the state. Stratton Mountain School counts Ogden among its alumni. Killington Mountain School recently sent snowboarder Jess Perlmutter to her first Olympics, where she finished sixth in slopestyle at age 16.\n\nThese academies draw ambitious teenagers from around the country. Shiffrin followed her older brother to Burke, and their mom moved to the village near the school. Forehand commuted from Connecticut every weekend before his family relocated full time. Vermont is happy to claim them all.\n\nSome of these transplants never leave. Moltzan rediscovered her love of skiing after attending the University of Vermont. She stayed and bought a house in Waitsfield. “The Green Mountain State is the best state in the whole 50 states,” she said after winning the second run of the women’s slalom at the 2026 Games.\n\nOgden, a proud lifelong Vermonter, also stayed after graduating from UVM. He now skis professionally with Stratton’s SMS T2 team and often trains alongside current students. In Vermont, Olympians aren’t distant legends; they’re older teammates.\n\nDiggins, now a four-time Olympic medalist, has long called the Stratton program home. She credits team dinners, send-off parties, and the feeling that entire towns are tracking her splits for helping to fuel her success. Ogden says he feels a “mental boost” from knowing his state is watching. In a small place, support isn’t abstract. After he won his second silver medal at the Milan Cortina Games, he said, “Vermonters have been such a huge part of my success this week and honestly, every other aspect of me.”\n\nCochran-Siegle’s pathway to success started way back with his grandparents. In 1960, Mickey and Ginny Cochran built a backyard rope tow on the hill behind their house in Richmond so their kids could ski after school without needing to drive an hour to one of the state’s larger ski areas. Over the next decade and a half, all four of their children would make the Olympics. Barbara Ann Cochran—Cochran-Siegle’s mother—won gold in slalom at the 1972 Olympics.\n\nThe Cochrans did not keep their ski hill to themselves. They opened it to the community. Lift tickets cost 25 cents. If a kid lacked proper gear, Ginny found it. If they were hungry, she fed them. In 1998, Cochran’s became a nonprofit. No child is turned away for lack of money. Families who can pay more do.\n\nTo keep things affordable, Cochran’s—and many of Vermont’s youth ski programs—runs on the backs of volunteers. That volunteerism isn’t incidental. Vermont consistently ranks at the top nationally for civic participation, with more than 40 percent of residents volunteering in some capacity. At a typical youth race, parents might be course marshals, timing officials, or simply extra eyes on the hill.\n\nAt Cochran’s, the family’s legacy still anchors the place. Barbara Ann, her siblings Marilyn and Lindy, and their extended families have coached there for decades. Two-time Olympian Jimmy Cochran now manages the hill. Their stated goal remains disarmingly modest: foster fun, not necessarily champions.\n\nAsked what advice his mother gave him before winning both of his Olympic silver medals, at the 2022 and 2026 Games, Cochran-Siegle said it was very simple: “She just tells me to go out and have fun.” And what’s more fun than a tiny state dominating the world’s preeminent sporting event?",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn says she nearly lost her leg after a heavy crash at the Winter Olympics - and has thanked the doctor who saved her from needing an amputation.\n\nThe American skiing great, 41, has had multiple operations since breaking her leg and ankle in the women's downhill event in Italy on 8 February.\n\nSpeaking in an Instagram video on Monday,, external she paid tribute to her surgeon for saving her leg and described the injury as \"the most extreme, painful and challenging\" of her career.\n\nVon said her leg was \"in pieces\" and that she had compartment syndrome, a pressure inside a muscle, which restricts blood flow - and that the surgeon performed a fasciotomy, an emergency operation, to relieve the pressure.\n\n\"Dr Tom Hackett saved my leg - he saved it from being amputated,\" she said.\n\n\"He cut open both sides of my leg, so it was open and let it breathe so to speak. He saved me.\"\n\nVonn, who returned to the United States last week after four operations in Italy, said she has now left hospital and been moved to a hotel, describing it as a \"huge step\".\n\nShe added that she will be in a wheelchair \"for a while\" because in addition to the broken leg, she has also broken her ankle.\n\nVonn was racing at the Olympics in Cortina nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee when she struck a gate 13 seconds into her downhill run.\n\nShe was airlifted off the piste and diagnosed with a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.\n\nHaving returned to the USA, Vonn explained she had a six-hour reconstructive operation on Wednesday, but also needed a blood transfusion as she had \"low haemoglobin due to all the blood loss and surgeries\".\n\nShe added: \"I turned a corner, and now I am out. It's going to be a long road, I'm in a wheelchair right now, very much immobile. I hope I can be on crutches in a little bit, but we'll see and be on them for at least two months.\"\n\nVonn said it could take a year for her bones to heal, adding: \"Then I will decide if I want to take out all the metal or not, and then go back into surgery and finally fix my ACL [anterior cruciate ligament].\"",

    "fullText": "American hockey history isn’t just a collection of wins and losses — it’s a story about belief, identity, and moments that seemed to stop time. For many fans, everything begins with the stunning triumph at the 1980 Winter Olympics, when a team of young, largely unknown Americans shocked the world under the leadership of Herb Brooks. That victory didn’t just elevate a program — it transformed how the country saw itself on the ice. Suddenly, hockey wasn’t a niche northern pastime; it was a stage where American grit and possibility could shine.\n\nIn the decades since, the sport has evolved dramatically. New generations of players — men and women alike — have pushed the United States into consistent global contention. Rivalries intensified, particularly with Canada, and Olympic tournaments became emotional touchstones that fans still replay in their minds years later. Each era has delivered moments that felt defining in their own way: heartbreaking near-misses, redemptive victories, and performances that inspired young players across the country to lace up skates for the first time.\n\nThat long arc of growth reached a remarkable milestone at the 2026 Winter Olympics, where American hockey achieved something once almost unimaginable. By then, the sport in the United States had matured into a powerhouse — deeper, faster, and more confident than ever before.\n\nLooking back across these moments reveals more than highlights. It shows how a program grew from a miracle into a sustained force — and how certain games became shared national memories.\n\nLong before Olympic spotlights and sold-out arenas, this was where American women’s hockey first proved what it could become. The team played with the quiet confidence of pioneers — athletes who knew they were building something bigger than one tournament. Winning the inaugural title didn’t just earn a medal; it established belief, identity, and momentum. In hindsight, it feels like the first brick in the foundation of everything that followed.\n\nThis team felt young, fast, and just a little fearless — the kind of group that grows on fans game by game. Their run to the final built a sense that something special might be unfolding, especially as they kept rising to every challenge. The championship game ended in heartbreak when Sidney Crosby scored in overtime, a moment that stung instantly. Still, it felt less like an ending and more like a signal that American men’s hockey had fully rejoined the world’s elite.\n\nPlaying at home brought enormous energy — and enormous pressure. Every shift felt magnified, every bounce louder, every mistake heavier. Falling short in the gold medal game hurt deeply, especially in front of a home crowd that believed all the way. But that loss hardened the program, sharpening a competitive edge that would define the next two decades.\n\nYears of frustration finally found release in one of the most dramatic finishes the sport has seen. In the shootout, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson skated in with patience and pulled off a move so smooth it looked almost unreal. Then Maddie Rooney held steady under crushing pressure, sealing the win with calm composure. The celebration felt less like a party and more like a collective exhale after years of chasing redemption.\n\nEverything about this moment felt brand new — the Olympic stage, the spotlight, the chance to define a sport’s future in real time. The Americans embraced that pressure and played like they intended to set the standard from day one. Winning the first Olympic gold in women’s hockey instantly gave the program identity and confidence. It felt like watching a rivalry — and a legacy — begin right before the world’s eyes.\n\nThis was the kind of achievement people used to imagine but never quite expect to see — total Olympic supremacy in both tournaments. The men delivered a tense overtime victory, finished by Jack Hughes and preserved by a brilliant performance from Connor Hellebuyck. The women matched the drama, rallying late as Hilary Knight forced overtime before Megan Keller struck the championship winner. Taken together, the wins felt historic not just for the medals — but for what they said about how far American hockey had come.\n\nFew sporting moments feel frozen in time the way this one does. A group of young Americans, many barely known outside hockey circles, faced a global powerhouse and simply refused to be intimidated. Guided by coach Herb Brooks, they played with relentless belief until the impossible became real. When the clock finally ran out, it felt like an entire country had experienced the same surge of joy all at once.\n\nFrom improbable beginnings to historic dominance, the biggest moments in American hockey trace a powerful evolution. What started as a single, unforgettable shock to the world gradually became a pattern of excellence built over generations. Together, these milestones don’t just mark victories — they tell the story of how belief turned into legacy.\n\nOLYMPICS: Team USA flag bearers revealed for 2026 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nNFL: Predicting the 2026 NFL free agent signings\n\nMLB: Detroit Tigers drop unreal alternate jerseys for 2026 MLB season\n\nNBA: Charlotte Hornets share update after LaMelo Ball’s car crash\n\nNHL: 2026 Winter Olympics men’s hockey, NHL payrolls for final four teams\nSPORTS MEDIA: Olympics reporter apologizes for drinking, slurring words during live segment\n\nThe post From ‘Miracle on Ice’ to 2026: Ranking America’s biggest hockey moments appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Jack Hughes drops Connor McDavid 'greatest player ever' praise after Olympics win originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith the Olympics gold medal match loss, Connor McDavid has yet again fallen short of winning the ultimate prize at a tournament. Fans started buzzing about how the Edmonton Oilers legend was 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride'. While these chirps may have come at the height of the Americans winning the gold medal after 46 years, Team USA and New Jersey Devils' Jack Hughes knew that McDavid was still the best player out there.\n\nHughes ended up scoring the gold medal-winning goal against Team Canada. He will always remain as a legend in all of America and with the Devils. But, he was tasked with a really tough task of guarding McDavid all night. Prior to his insane goal, he had to shut the Oilers legend one last time too.\n\nHe got real on how difficult the task was because of the Canadian star's prowess on the ice, via Dan Rosen of NHL.com.\n\n\"When the best player in the world, maybe ever, comes down on you in overtime in the gold medal game and you’re a forward, my first thought was ‘I  have got to gap up. Then I was like, ‘I can’t gap up, he’ll just blow right by me.’ So, I just sunk in and hopefully he can’t get around me because there’s not enough space in between me and the net. And that’s honestly kind of what happened,\" he declared.\n\nHughes' effort only came out of instinct because of what was at stake and who skated down towards him. McDavid was eventually named the Most Valuable Player for men's hockey at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. This came after he ran the Canadian offense as much as he could up until the gold medal game. The Oilers legend scored two goals while also dishing out 11 assists in the tournament.\n\nThe bane of the best players in their field is the constant challenge of opposing players leveling up when coming across them. Hopefully, McDavid is able to dispel the 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride' narrative once he returns with the Oilers.",

    "fullText": "German public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF registered record numbers of viewers during the Milan/Cortina Winter Olympics, which closed on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the broadcasters, never before have so many people followed the TV coverage of the Winter Games in the country.\n\nAn average of 3.173 million people watched the live broadcasts on the two free-to-air TV channels, representing a market share of 23.2%.\n\nThe reach is almost twice as high as in the previous Games in Beijing in 2022 (1.67 million), which, however, took place in a different time zone.\n\nBut all the relevant figures are also significantly higher than those for Turin, where the last Winter Games in Germany's time zone took place 20 years ago.\n\n\"In times like these, people are particularly receptive to the Olympics. People love emotional moments,\" ARD sports coordinator Axel Balkausky said.\n\nThe men's doubles in luge had the largest audience as 6.79 million people watched the event live. The biathlon, Germany's most popular winter sport, was shortly behind with 6.63 million fans tuning in to watch the mixed relay.\n\nDuring the Olympics, millions of sports fans are also enthusiastic about disciplines that are usually hardly noticed.\n\n\"Every four years, people specifically search for curling,\" Balkausky said.\n\nParticularly striking was the reach among young people: according to the broadcasters, some 35% of viewers were between 14 and 29 years old.\n\nParallel to the large number of viewers watching traditional television, there was also enormous reach on the internet with up to seven live streams.\n\nARD recorded more than 85 million video views, while ZDF had more than 50 million views by Saturday.\n\n\"The digital figures are going through the roof. We were successful in every way,\" Balkausky celebrated.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump responded publicly after Team USA secured a gold medal in men’s hockey at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Following the team’s overtime victory over Canada in Milan, the president shared a message congratulating the players and later spoke with them directly as celebrations continued.\n\nDonald Trump congratulated the United States men’s hockey team after its gold medal victory at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Coach Mike Sullivan said, “The players just had the President on, I don’t know what it was, what do you call it, FaceTime, whatever, in the locker room. He just spoke to the group, expressing how proud he was of the group and congratulating everybody on the win.” Captain Auston Matthews said, “He called and just congratulated us.”\n\nThe United States defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to secure the gold medal. Sullivan said the game “was an inspiration to our country. I can’t tell you how many texts I’ve received over the last day or so about watch parties at 8 o’clock in the morning. I think from a viewership standpoint, the United States, there were a lot of people paying attention, the President included.” The team was scheduled to return to NHL duties on February 23, and its flight was diverted from New York’s JFK airport to Miami because of a storm in the northeast.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social: “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!.” He added, “LOTS OF WINNING!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.” The White House also shared a social media image depicting a bald eagle and a goose following the victory.\n\nThe post followed prior political tensions between the United States and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the World Economic Forum, “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” After the Olympics, Carney wrote, “You’re coming home with 21 hard-fought Olympic medals.”\n\nOriginally reported by Vritti Johar on Mandatory.com.\n\nThe post Donald Trump Has a Message for Team USA Hockey appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "Mikaela Shiffrin, 30, may be a three-time Olympic gold medalist, but there was a time when just hearing the name of the Games felt overwhelming.\n\nOn Friday's episode of \"Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce,\" Shiffrin said getting ready for one of the biggest competitions in sports took years of work, much of it away from cameras and crowds.\n\n\"My Olympic experiences have been so wildly different. Now it's four, and I'm really aware, right now, of all of the work that's gone into — actually, not the medal — but the work that's gone into showing up on race day, and being able to show up with the mentality and the skiing that I wanted to do,\" Shiffrin told podcast host Kylie Kelce.\n\nThe grind continued even away from the slopes, she said, especially when it came to managing the pressure that comes with the Games.\n\n\"Even this summertime, the amount of conversations I had with my psychologist talking about all the different feelings surrounding the Olympics, and like desensitizing to the word, and imagining the vibe, imagining the colors,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nShe added that she even visited Paris two summers ago to get a feel for the Olympic atmosphere and \"desensitize\" herself to it.\n\nNot only that, Shiffrin has structured her life around staying physically and mentally ready at all times.\n\n\"There's just so much life outside of the sport, but we do so much of our life, you know, it's all geared towards the sport,\" Shiffrin said, adding that she hasn't had alcohol in two years because it tends to make her sick.\n\n\"And I'm like, I can't afford to be sick, literally ever. So, we're just going to not have any alcohol. Like, we're going to drink electrolytes, man,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nIt still throws her off that something she's trained for over years can be decided in seconds.\n\n\"But you spend so much time doing all of this work and training for something, and then the moment it happens is, you know, 47 seconds, or like in the blink of an eye, and it's just really weird,\" she said.\n\nShiffrin is widely considered the greatest alpine ski racer of all time, with 108 World Cup wins. She made her Olympic debut at the 2014 Sochi Games at age 18, winning her first Olympic gold in slalom and becoming the youngest athlete in history to do so.\n\nOn Wednesday, nearly a decade later, she earned another gold medal in slalom — her first Olympic victory since 2018.\n\nThis isn't the first time Shiffrin has spoken about the steps she takes to stay focused.\n\nSpeaking to WDSU News on Friday, she said she deliberately avoided social media in the lead-up to her races at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\"If I was scrolling my feed or something, I just knew I was going to come across things that would get into my brain that would be not at all conducive to the experience that my team and I came for,\" Shiffrin said.\n\nOn Saturday, she told NBC Sports that she chose not to \"set expectations\" for herself heading into the Milan Cortina Games — a mindset she said ultimately helped her ski her best.\n\n\"On race day, I felt like I skied my best skiing, and that was really my goal,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics have officially ended following the closing ceremony in northern Italy.\n\nIt took place at Verona Olympic Arena, despite none of the sporting events happening in the city, which is 75 miles from Milan.\n\nAfter beginning with a tribute to classic Italian opera, flagbearers representing the 92 competing nations entered the stadium through large props from Aida and accompanied by a tribute to Italian film music.\n\nThe 'Drop of Fire' – the Olympic flame carried in a small glass vessel – was brought into the ancient arena to light up the rings before the parade of athletes.\n\nWhile athletes are supposed to come in all mixed together, here they were still largely in national groups.\n\nThe final medals from Milan-Cortina 2026 were awarded in the women's and men's 50km mass start cross-country skiing events, before a tribute to the Games volunteers.\n\nThe ceremony finished with performances from popular Italian musicians Major Lazer and singer-songwriter Achille Lauro.\n\nIn her speech to close the Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry said: \"You have been incredible – every one of you. Brave. Fearless. Full of heart and passion. You left it all on the snow and ice.\n\n\"Two unforgettable weeks, living every moment to the fullest. You gave everything – and you shared it with all of us.\n\n\"This is the true Olympic spirit: competing, embracing, lifting each other up, whatever the result. You showed us what excellence, respect, and friendship look like in a world that sometimes forgets these values.\n\n\"You showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone. A place where sport brings us together.\"\n\nIt ended a Games which saw 116 medal events, and historic sporting success for several of the competing nations – including Great Britain.\n\nTeam GB won five medals, including three golds, to finish 15th in the table. Britain has never previously won more than one gold at a Games before.\n\nMatt Weston, the male flagbearer, won two golds in skeleton – the men's event and the team competition with Tabby Stoeker.\n\nThe female GB flagbearer was Charlotte Bankes, who won gold in the team snowboard cross with Huw Nightingale; it was the first Olympic event on snow won by British athletes.\n\nTeam GB also won silver in the men's curling, while Zoe Atkin claimed bronze in women's ski halfpipe on the final day.\n\nBrazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen took the men's giant slalom title to register a first Winter Olympic gold won by a South American nation.\n\nWhy 2026 marks a Winter Olympic turning point for Team GB\n\nWeird and wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics\n\nUSA win men's Olympic ice hockey gold for first time in 46 years\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGeorgia earned their first Winter Olympic medal with silver in pairs figure skating, while Spain collected their first gold medal for 54 years in the men's ski mountaineering. Benin, Guinea-Bissau and United Arab Emirates competed in their first Winter Games.\n\nFor hosts Italy, Milan-Cortina marked their best Winter Games with 10 golds among 30 medals to put them fourth in the table.\n\nNorway topped the medals table for the fourth successive Games. They collected 18 medals, including six for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, the king of cross-country skiing.\n\nHad Klaebo, who set a record for the most golds won by an individual athlete at a single Games, competed as a nation on his own, he would have been ninth in the medal table. Fittingly, his sixth gold - in the men's 50km cross-country skiing - was presented at the closing ceremony as the final medal awarded at the Games.\n\nThe oldest individual medallist was Elana Meyers Taylor of the United States, who broke the Games record by winning monobob gold, aged 41.\n\nSkiing great Lindsey Vonn saw her Olympic career end with a broken leg.\n\nThe Games also had controversial moments.\n\nUkraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a remembrance helmet featuring artwork depicting athletes killed during the Russian invasion of his country.\n\nBut the IOC said this contravened Games rules and, after Heraskevych refused to back down, disqualified him from competing.\n\nThere was also a silver medal, in men's ski mountaineering, for Russian athlete Nikita Filippov. He competed as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) because Russia were banned from the Games because of their aggression in Ukraine.\n\nFilippov, along with other AIN competitors, was allowed to take part in the closing ceremony having been banned from the opening event.\n\nMen's curling gold medallists Canada had their campaign dogged by allegations of cheating.\n\nThe ceremony included the handover of the Olympic flag to the delegation representing the French Alps, which will host the next Winter Games in 2030.\n\nThe presidents of the two French regions to host the Games, Renaud Muselier and Fabrice Pannekoucke, enthusiastically accepted the flag from Coventry.\n\nThere was a performance of the sixth verse of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, as it was deemed to be more universal and less patriotic. The arrangement changed throughout into a more contemporary style with an electronic base.\n\nAs well as a video showcasing the Alps, there was also a performance by 25 musicians and 24 athletes – the first time Olympians have featured in the artistic elements of the closing ceremony.\n\nRelive the 2026 Winter Olympics on BBC iPlayer (UK only)",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Johnny Gaudreau's No. 13 jersey was hanging in the U.S. locker room throughout the Olympics, and Dylan Larkin and Matthew Tkachuk carried it around the ice after the U.S. beat Canada in overtime to win the country's first gold medal at the Games since 1980.\n\nThen, the tribute to the late player known as “Johnny Hockey” went even further.\n\nThe oldest two of Johnny and Meredith Gaudreau's three children were in attendance, along with their grandparents, Guy and Jane, and they got to be part of the celebration. Larkin and Werenski brought 3-year-old Noa and 2-year-old Johnny Jr. on the ice for the team photo, which also had Gaudreau's jersey in it. To a man, players said he should have been with them.\n\n“It meant everything,\" said Werenski, who assisted on Jack Hughes' golden goal in overtime. \"This is something John would have been at. And to see his family here supporting us and seeing his kids, bringing them on the ice, we talked about playing for him, making him proud and I think we did that. Super special to see them and to have kids on the ice, he was a huge part of USA Hockey.”\n\nJohnny and his brother, Matthew, died in August 2024 when they were struck by an SUV while riding bicycles near their hometown in New Jersey on the eve of their sister Katie’s wedding.\n\n“He’s with us here in spirit for the whole tournament,\" captain Auston Matthews said. “To have his jersey out there in the team photo and have his kids come out and be with us, we’re obviously thinking of him.”\n\nAn elite player a decade into his NHL career and the all-time U.S. leading scorer in international play, Johnny Gaudreau was on track to be in Milan. Guy Gaudreau said USA Hockey told the family that their oldest son was on the projected roster.\n\n“He obviously would have been on this team — and been a huge part of it,” forward J.T. Miller said. “A guy I grew up with and against and knew pretty well. It’s more than hockey, at that point. ... He deserved better, and he had a big part in how things went down today.”\n\nLarkin, who was also clsoe to Gaudreau, dedicated what is just the third U.S. men's hockey gold in history to Gaudreau and former USA Hockey executive Jim Johannson, who died unexpectedly just before the 2018 Olympics.\n\n“This is for the guys who wore this jersey before us,” Larkin said. \"All those people should be here. Johnny especially, Matty his brother. To get it done today, it’s just an unbelievable feeling.’’\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

(AP) — Driven by their own emotion and the cheers of a frenzied, star-spangled crowd, the United States hockey team has delivered what may well be the most stunning upset in Olympic history and stands on the verge of a medal at the 1980 Winter Games.\n\nCall it Team Excitement. This ambitious, energetic squad of college kids ignored adversity and bounced from behind on third period goals by Mark Johnson and Mike Eruzione to score a stunning 4-3 upset victory over the defending champion Soviet Union Friday night.\n\nWith roars of “USA! USA! USA!” ringing in their ears, America’s comeback kids rode the red-hot, 36-save goaltending of Jim Craig to a sensational victory that set off a wild celebration, first on the ice and then all over this Olympic town.\n\nJust as the hockey game ended, fireworks exploded over Mirror Lake – part of the traditional awards ceremony saluting Friday’s medal winners, including American slalom racer Phil Mahre. But the coincidence was just too good for the flag-decked crowd that spilled happily into the narrow streets of this tiny village after the American hockey victory.\n\n“In all due respect to that team and to the (American) silver medal team in 1972, this has to be the biggest win in our Olympic history,” said Coach Herb Brooks.\n\nWhen the United States swept to the Olympic gold in 1960, the Soviet Union was not yet the hockey powerhouse it is today. The Russian team America beat 20 years ago was still refining its game. The one America beat Friday night is acknowledged by most hockey people to be the finest unit in the world – and that includes professionals, who these Soviets have often handled with ease.\n\nBrooks knew all that when he delivered his pre-game speech to his team. It was simple and to the point. This is what he told newsmen: “You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here. This moment is yours. You’re meant to be here at this time. Let’s have poise and possession with the puck.”\n\nAnd then he sent Team Excitement on the ice.\n\nThree times the young Americans fell behind by a goal and each time they came back, first on a goal by Buzz Schneider and then one by Mark Johnson.\n\nJohnson’s goal came with a single slim second left on the clock in the first period. But the Soviets regained the lead again in the second period and limited the Americans to two shots on goal in those 20 minutes. Again, they seemed in control.\n\nThen, midway through the final period, Johnson and captain Mike Eruzione scored goals just 81 seconds apart, putting the United States in front.\n\nStill, there were 10 minutes to play and that can be an eternity. It seemed like one for the Americans, who turned back every Soviet thrust and then exploded in joyful excitement at the final buzzer. They tackled each other and rolled happily on the ice like so many excited kids, while the Soviets stood and waited for the traditional handshaking ceremony.\n\nThe loss was the first in Olympic competition for the Soviets since 1968 and left the Americans needing only a victory over Finland Sunday to clinch the gold. But the Russians still have a shot at the gold. To win it, they would have to beat Sweden Sunday and hope that Finland defeats the United States.\n\nSweden tied Finland 3-3 in Friday night’s other medal round game. That left the United States with three points, the Soviets and Swedes with two and Finland with one in the mini-tournament to determine the medals.\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — For a change, it was the Soviet hockey players who looked on in envy. Downcast, they leaned on their sticks, awaiting the ceremonial handshake that concludes every international contest.\n\nUsually, it is they who act the gracious winner’s role. But this time, this one Friday at the Winter Olympics, it was the Americans’ turn; their 4-3 victory had made the conquerors the conquered.\n\nHockey gold medal hopes are alive and well in Lake Placid. The Americans are one victory over Finland away from making their gold medal dream a reality.\n\n“I’m going to bite myself to make sure it’s true,” said right wing John Harrington.\n\nOh, it’s true all right – just as true as the dramatic pre-game pep talk by Coach Herb Brooks; as true as the winning burst of third-period goals by Mark Johnson and Mike Eruzione in a 1:21 span ... just as true as the phone call from President Jimmy Carter to the clamorous American dressing room.\n\n“He said we had made the American people very proud; that we reflected the ideas of the country and what we stand for,” said Brooks, who – along with the entire American Olympic delegation – has been invited to the White House Monday.\n\nThe invitation stands no matter what happens Sunday, and any number of things might. The Americans, this dramatic victory theirs forever, could still finish out of the medals chase if badly beaten by Finland. They could win a bronze, or a silver, or a gold.\n\nThis is how it stands: After Friday’s two medals round games (Sweden and Finland tied 3-3 in the other), the Americans have three points, the Soviets and Swedes two, and Finland one. If Sweden ties the Soviet Union Sunday and Finland beats the Americans, all would have three points. If Finland’s victory is a big one, the infamous “goal differential” (goals given up subtracted from goals scored) would break the tie and leave the U.S. with nothing to show for its smashing, upset triumph Friday.\n\nIf virtually anything else happens other than a lopsided U.S. loss, the Americans will win a medal.\n\n“But we’ll worry about that tomorrow,” said Mark Johnson after the Americans had knocked goalie Vladislav Tretiak out of the game, rallied from three one-goal deficits, and stunned the Soviet team that has won the last four Olympic golds and was heavily favored to repeat.\n\nIf the Soviets went ahead, the Americans rallied. Finally, on a power play at 8:39 of the third period, a Dave Silk pass bounced off the skate of defenseman Sergei Starikov and bounded right to Johnson. A five-foot shot was all it took for a 3-3 tie, and Eruzione netted a 25-footer at the 10-minute mark to settle the issue.\n\nFor the fifth time in the six games they have played her, the Americans gave up the first goal. Vladimir Krutov tipped an Aleksei Kasatonov shot past goalie Jim Craig at 9:12 of the opening period.\n\nBuzzy Schneider brought the United States back at 14:03, powering a 55-foot shot over Tretiak’s left shoulder and marking the beginning of the end for the internationally acclaimed net-minder. Tretiak’s vulnerability is long shots, and his muff of another one helped the Americans tie it with one second left in the period.\n\nSergei Makarov had fought away from a Johnson check to flip a 15-foot shot past Craig at 17:34, but – with the clock winding down and the crowd of 8,500 screaming “U-S-A, USA,” the U-S-A stormed back. Dave Christian took a 100-foot shot on Tretiak, who kicked it directly in front of Johnson.\n\nA few fakes later, the game was tied 2-2 and Tretiak was gone. Vladimir Myshkin, who beat the National Hockey League all-stars 6-0 to win the Challenge Cup for the Soviets last February, took over.\n\nHe fared no better, and the Soviets suffered their first loss in an Olympic hockey game since 1968, when the Czechs beat them 5-4 at Grenoble, France.\n\nPeople charged into the streets when it was over, waving the flags they had brought to the game, hollering the chant that is their trademark and going every bit as crazy as the players did themselves.\n\n“We went nuts,” said (Rob) McClanahan. “ What do you do when you win a game like this? You whoop it up. You hug each other. You shake hands.”\n\nAP Corporate Archives contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — The first female president in the International Olympic Committee’s 132 years got a proper stress test in the first games of her history-making leadership.\n\nKirsty Coventry was widely seen as having good overall success at the Milan Cortina Winter Games that also gave a taste of challenges set to be tougher running into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n“An incredible games, and an incredible experience for me as my first in this role,” she told IOC colleagues Sunday.\n\nCoventry insisted in Milan pre-games that “our game is sport,” yet playing politics was inevitable.\n\nShe started the Winter Games building “very good chemistry” with U.S. Vice President JD Vance — who was booed at the opening ceremony — and had seemed likely to close it with U.S. President Donald Trump, who she has not yet met. He did not travel as many expected for Sunday's men’s ice hockey final that the U.S. won.\n\nIn between, political pressure on Coventry was intense during the days-long drama of the Ukraine skeleton racer’s helmet memorializing athletes and coaches killed in the Russian military invasion.\n\nCoventry’s face-to-face, trackside meeting with Vladyslav Heraskevych early Feb. 12 that failed to avert his disqualification has helped define her leadership style.\n\nHer tears in a subsequent meeting with international media is a powerful image of her presidency — though Heraskevych himself wasn't impressed.\n\nThe next day, at a news conference in Milan, a list was detailed to Coventry of IOC issues with its own finances, plus future Olympic hosts, their officials and governments.\n\n“It’s a job only a woman could do,” she said with relish, “and I’m looking forward to continuing to do it.”\n\nThe Ukrainian political strategy had been “a baptism of fire” for the new president, the former IOC marketing director Michael Payne told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nCoventry going directly to engage Heraskevych in sports diplomacy was a shift from her predecessors Thomas Bach and Jacques Rogge, who also were Olympic athletes.\n\nAt age 42, having swum for Zimbabwe as recently as the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Coventry is just 13 months older than a huge star at these games, Lindsey Vonn.\n\n“We saw at these games her values and her humanity,” IOC member Tricia Smith, a silver medalist in rowing for Canada at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, told The Associated Press. “And I think that’s exceptionally positive for the Olympic Movement as we move forward.”\n\nThe 72-year-old Bach sat next to Coventry again Sunday at the IOC’s meeting: He in suit and tie, she in smart casual knitwear that is becoming her signature look.\n\nThe generational change is clear for the Olympics, which wants and needs to stay relevant with athletes who are increasingly their own tech-savvy brands.\n\nAfter seven years as sports minister in the government of Zimbabwe, Coventry was no management rookie.\n\nOne of her four IOC vice presidents, Pierre-Olivier Beckers, said in Milan that people who had thought she was too young to lead were wrong.\n\n“I think she’s maturing at an incredible pace,” Beckers told reporters, adding she was “a joy for people like me to work with. Her ability to surround herself, to listen to people, all advisors, to make up her mind quickly, is just astonishing.”\n\nOne aspect of Coventry's management style that drew negative reactions, online and in Milan, was criticizing staff in her last set-piece media event Friday.\n\nCoventry is one of the more transparent leaders among the Olympic sports bodies mostly based in Switzerland. She had four scheduled news conferences in Milan within 20 days, plus an impromptu media session after meeting Heraskevych.\n\nOn Friday, she publicly lost patience when asked about news developments that she said she was unaware of — on the topics of Russian doping, an Olympic bid from Germany, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino attending Trump's Board of Peace launch Thursday.\n\nClearly frustrated, Coventry eventually said “maybe someone needs to be dismissed because I’m not aware of that either” and asked of her media team: \"What happened guys? Where are we?”\n\nCoventry has a big 2026 with signature policy to be decided under the “Fit for the Future” banner. Reviews are ongoing into how the IOC picks games hosts, Olympic sports and sponsor programs, plus protecting female sports.\n\nKey meetings are in the IOC's Swiss home city Lausanne on June 24-25 with more likely late in the year.\n\nThe next Olympics is a constant focus. There is a pressing issue around L.A. Games organizing chief Casey Wasserman, that was persistent in Milan over news of his historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, and Coventry will soon need to meet Trump.\n\n“She can leave (Milan) with a massive sigh of relief. The brand is in robust health,” Payne said Sunday.\n\nHe warned of more politicization of Olympic sports worldwide before the next Olympics in the United States. The IOC winning the appeal brought by Heraskevych will help set limits on how athletes express views.\n\n“L.A. will be a completely different dimension,” Payne said. “It’s going to be complicated, to put it mildly.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "TESERO, Italy — The race marshal has just cried out his five-minute warning, but Jessie Diggins appears lost to it all.\n\nThere is a ritual to these moments, to this preparation, and in her final Olympic appearance, the USA’s most decorated cross-country skier of all time will remain unhurried. Her universe is defined by the particulars.\n\nShe still wears a hefty plaster on her ribs, the blueing medal of a crash that took place just two kilometers into her Olympics on the opening Saturday. “It’s honestly caught me off guard with how much it hurts to ski right now,” she wrote in a post on Instagram.\n\nJust five days later, Diggins won bronze, her fourth Olympic medal overall, in the 10-kilometer freestyle.\n\nHer red headband is already on, bearing, as always, the logo of The Emily Program — the eating disorder charity that helped her through the most difficult moments of her career, which she now wears as a reminder, not to herself but others.\n\nUnder Olympic rules, she will have to take the headband off before the race starts. No such regulations exist for the glitter daubed on her cheeks, battle paint mimicked by hundreds in the grandstand facing her.\n\nNow, and only now, she climbs into her race vest. The number is one. At 34, and in her last season, Diggins leads the World Cup standings. She may well win the crystal globe in Lake Placid next month, her final meet before retirement.\n\nThat number gives her a privilege. She moves to the front of the racers’ queue, a rare pass she has not had to work for. Silence falls, tangible enough to be sketched by charcoal. Then the gun.\n\nAnd so she begins, one final time, pushing pell-mell into a sport increasingly shaped in her image.\n\nSunday was the debut of the women’s 50km at the Olympic Games. Diggins had long advocated for its inclusion, incensed at the inequality with the men’s events, the insinuation that women were only able to race 30km.\n\n“When I got to the World Cup, I didn’t understand why,” she said in a pre-Olympic press conference. “Why do we not get to do these big, epic races that are pretty iconic and pretty legendary in our sport?”\n\nShe got to do it in her final Olympic race. The previous night, the withdrawal of the overwhelming favourite, Sweden’s Frida Karlsson, sparked the obvious question: Could Diggins sign off with an Olympic medal?\n\nOne impediment was the format. The 50km was raced in the classic style, with Diggins far stronger in the freestyle “skate” technique, in which she has taken the vast majority of her World Cup wins. The length, however, was expected to favor Diggins — an athlete with the preternatural ability to dig deeper than human suffering should allow.\n\nIt is why she chimes with so many. Watch her win the team sprint relay in Pyeongchang eight years ago alongside Kikkan Randall, the USA’s first-ever Olympic cross-country gold. It is visible that none of this comes easy as she double-poles herself forward, gasping like a gutted fish.\n\nWatch her at any finish line, and she is liable to collapse, spent, knowing she extracted every ounce of ability that day. “I’m going to die,” she hyperventilated after her bronze in the 10km.\n\nBut this is only part of Diggins’ relationship with pain. She has been open about her eating disorder, first suffering from bulimia in her teens, managing it, becoming an Olympic champion, and relapsing in 2023.\n\n“If someone out there is watching this or listening to this or reading this, and they’re struggling, you can do this too,” she said during these Olympics. “And I know that because when I was 18, I thought that would be my life. And I thought my life would actually be quite short because of my eating disorder. I was in a really tough place.”\n\nRecovery came, an effort she calls the most difficult push of her career. Diggins learned to weaponise her vulnerability, to use her experience to help others. In a sport known for its unhealthy relationship with weight, she is the biggest advocate for breaking the taboo. The U.S. cross-country team, pushing a wider trend across the sport, has now made body image an open conversation.\n\n“You can survive without an eating disorder in professional sports,” she wrote in a blog post for The Emily Program updated this January. “More than that, you can thrive. The eating disorder I once relied on hurt my career in the short term. It did not ruin my life.”\n\nOver the past seven years, she has lived by a mantra: Just because I’m good at being in pain, it doesn’t mean I always have to be.\n\nDiggins is hurting now. Dropped by the leaders at the end of the first lap, she hauls her way back on the downhill. Another lap later, and approaching the 15km mark, she is down to sixth and struggling with her skis.\n\n“I was doing everything I could to make them work,” she said post-race. “I knew I had to switch them early.”\n\nShe veers to the left, strapping on her alternate pair. With 30 seconds lost, she is now down to ninth. Urgently, she heaves herself back onto the tracks — and stumbles, twice, her knees hitting the snow. The skis bend but do not crack.\n\nHer only option is the same as it ever was. Chase up the course ahead.\n\nThere have been other stumbles by U.S. athletes during these Olympics. Most notoriously, figure skater Ilia Malinin fell twice during last the men’s final, tearing away a gold medal that had looked destined to be his for the past four years. It was visible, and it was public.\n\nIn the days after, Malinin demonstrated his own vulnerability. He spoke openly about the pressure of the Olympics, of his own mental health; he used his own fall to lift others. Malinin is his own man, but this is also the environment Diggins has engendered.\n\nThere are traces of her approach, too, in the performance of Alysa Liu, gold medalist in the women’s final six days later. Liu’s story, having placed well-being above performance before recognising how that self-awareness ultimately made her stronger, has hallmarks of Diggins’ recovery.\n\n“(Diggins) is so valuable because of not only her talent, but because of how she’s really present with us as a team,” Diggins’ teammate, 23-year-old Kendall Kramer, said after the 50km. “She just wants to give tips, pointers and pass the flag to the next generation.\n\n“Going to the World Cup for the U.S. is really hard because we can’t just travel back home. It would be easy for her to keep really to herself, but she’s created such a good environment, a culture that makes our team special.”\n\nDiggins may have four Olympic medals and seven in world championships. But this is the other subtext of her legacy — demonstrating to the winter sport community that there is another way of excellence.\n\nCharging up the slush of the Dolomites, Diggins’ career is not over yet. The middle laps of this race have been a masterclass in tactical planning.\n\nUp front, Sweden’s Ebba Andersson and Norway’s Heidi Weng are too far ahead, but at this moment, Diggins is the quickest athlete on course. Her skis are now fresh, better able to handle the conditions than her fading rivals.\n\nThe dull glint of bronze resembles the low sun in the sky. But for Diggins, perhaps more than any other athlete at these Games, her performance and the result are not distinct; for her, the performance is the result. She forges on, mainly with skiers 10 years her junior.\n\n“Literally every muscle in my body started cramping with three laps to go,” she recalled post-race.\n\nOthers change their skis and begin to recover. Diggins starts to drop back on the uphills — one second off the back, back with the group, two seconds off, back with the group — but remains grimly with her quintet. The pain on her face progresses like erosion; it starts with a trickle of sweat, cracks becoming writ across her forehead, before, where her mouth should be, a yawning chasm.\n\nFive minutes up the course, Andersson drops Weng to win the race. She has her own redemption story — three falls in the women’s 4×7.5km relay, condemning her team to silver. It was the only women’s race in which Sweden failed to take gold — but Andersson’s joy is unbridled here.\n\nThen, after an embrace in the finish area, both still gasping, Andersson and Weng both shade their eyes to stare back up the hill.\n\nThe group is thinning in the fight for bronze, the Austrian and Finnish contenders gone. Diggins has the inside track up the final hill, but Switzerland’s Nadja Kaelin is the only athlete still appearing to possess the ability to glide up the slope.\n\nRounding the crest, they disappear from view. When they reemerge, it is Kaelin double-poling her way to third, followed by Norway’s Kristin Austgulen Fosnæs in fourth. Just five metres behind her, Diggins claws her way to fifth.\n\nHer final effort is all she has. Swaying upright on her skis as she crosses the line, her body veering a little to the right, she collapses on the racing line as if sliced behind the knees. The only motion is her chest’s rise and fall. It is over.\n\nAndersson is straight over, gently touching Diggins on the shoulder. Thirty seconds later, Kaelin has recovered enough to unclip the skis, which now awkwardly sit on her rival’s feet. Diggins is too exhausted to even unclasp her poles from her hands; all she can do is softly pat Kaelin on the calf in thanks. In the world Diggins has created, this is what it looks like to go out on your shield.\n\nIt is some five minutes before she is able to walk, but as she comes back to life, she picks out her father behind the ropes. “I’m so happy,” she tells him. Then a spark and a laugh. “ZERO KICK,” she intones.\n\n“If you had told me even a year ago that I’d be in the fight for a bronze medal in a 50k classic, I would not have believed you,” she elaborates to reporters soon after. “I can confidently say that I could not possibly have tried harder or gotten more out of my body. The fact I was able to come back and finish this race after getting so hurt just two kilometers into my Olympics? I’m just so grateful for the staff behind the scenes.\n\n“I got to end it on a beautiful day and at a venue that I love so much. I’m just really proud of this last Olympics, really grateful, and really happy. I’m leaving here full of joy … and probably needing a new body.”\n\nDiggins may not have finished with a medal, but this was an Olympic career that finished on her terms: unafraid to ask herself questions, journeying deeper than anyone else to find the answers, in a race of her own construction.\n\nAnd surely she always knew, and probably hoped, that it would end like this; lungs and muscles emptied, breath slowly misting into the air, lying spread-eagled on the snow.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nOlympics, Global Sports, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "Three golds, a record-equalling medal haul - the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics has been one to remember for Team GB.",
    "fullText": "If someone had told you 16 days ago that Team GB would win three gold medals at the Winter Olympics, would you have believed it?\n\nTonight, flagbearers Matt Weston and Charlotte Bankes will lead Team GB into the closing ceremony in Verona as the curtains are drawn on a historic Games for the nation.\n\nIn winning five medals, GB has equalled its record best from both 2014 and 2018.\n\nBut it has been the nation's most successful Winter Olympics since the moment snowboarders Bankes and Huw Nightingale won the second of those golds in the mixed team snowboard cross.\n\nNever before had Great Britain won more than one gold medal at a Winter Olympics. That fact has now been buried deep in the snow.\n\nWeston kick-started the golden rush, withstanding the heavy pressure on his shoulders to win the men's skeleton title that was always his to lose.\n\nOn what has come to be known as 'Super Sunday', Bankes and Nightingale won Team GB's first Olympic gold medal on snow, a victory that was followed just a few hours later by Weston and Tabby Stoecker's mixed team success at the Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nOn the penultimate night of competition, the men's curling team - skipped by Bruce Mouat - won their second successive Olympic silver, before freestyle skier Zoe Atkin wrapped up Team GB's Games the next day with bronze in the halfpipe.\n\n\"These Games have been amazing, and a history-making Games,\" Team GB chef de mission Eve Muirhead told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This Games has really proven that we are capable, that we have so much potential, and we're growing. We're a growing winter nation, which is really exciting.\n\n\"With the French Alps [Winter Olympics] in four years time, this is a catalyst to those Games.\"\n\nWeird and wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics\n\nBut for all the medals, there were all the near-misses.\n\nIn total, there were five fourth-place finishes, some of which were by the most narrow of margins.\n\nTake freestyle skier Kirsty Muir, for example. Just 0.41 of a point was the difference between bronze and fourth place in the slopestyle.\n\nHad she not squatted on a landing on her final run, she would have made the podium.\n\nAgonisingly, she then recorded another fourth in the big air.\n\nSnowboarder Mia Brookes, meanwhile, knew she needed to go huge on her final big air run for a chance of a medal - and so she did.\n\nShe landed a competition-first backside 1620 trick - featuring four-and-a-half rotations - but over-rotated at the very last moment.\n\nHad she landed it cleanly, she would have won a medal.\n\n\"Fourths make champions,\" GB Snowsport chief executive Vicky Gosling told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We are fourth in the world. Kirsty's from Aberdeen, she started on the dry slopes. Mia started on the dry slopes in Manchester and then look where they've got to. We should be utterly proud of what we've achieved here.\"\n\nAround the Games, there were plenty of other performances that may not have brought home a medal, but were record-breaking in their own right.\n\nIn cross-country skiing, Andrew Musgrave and James Clugnet recorded a fifth-place finish in the team sprint event, the nation's best Olympic result in the sport.\n\nThat bettered Musgrave's sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle, while Anna Pryce recorded a best British women's result at an Olympics with her 32nd place in the sprint classic.\n\nStoecker, Freya Tarbit and Amelia Coltman all finished in the top 10 of the women's skeleton, while there were more than 20 top-10 finishes in total.\n\n\"I think because of the depth and breadth across so many sports and disciplines, it shows that we are not a one-trick pony,\" said UK Sport's director of performance Kate Baker.\n\n\"We're mixing it with the very best in winter sport. I think we can be really excited about what we've achieved.\"\n\nTeam GB will fly home on Monday, after which the post-Games reviews will begin, by both the British Olympic Association and the individual sports themselves.\n\nOver the four-year cycle leading into the Milan-Cortina Games, UK Sport ploughed £25.5m into winter sports on the Olympic programme, up from £22.2m for the Beijing 2022 cycle.\n\nThe funding for the next cycle, leading up to the 2030 Games, will be confirmed and announced in the summer, though the individual sports have already received a provisional figure for planning purposes.\n\nBut while an important metric, funding isn't just based on the number of medals won, or a reward for it. UK Sport also looks at future potential, as well as the impact and resonance on the watching British public.\n\nBaker told BBC Sport Team GB's athletes had gone \"above and beyond\" in delivering value for money, and asked how that success is now built on, she said: \"The reality is we've been thinking about it for the past four years. Already the work is in place to build for that next Games and indeed the one after.\n\n\"We've got some real talent coming through, there is no shortage of British talent, and we know we can show that we can mix it with the best on the world stage when it matters.\n\n\"The next four years is about supporting that talent that's coming through and also making sure that we do everything we can so that when they get here on finals day, they are absolutely at their best.\"\n\nUK Sport's investment is not an ever-growing pot, however, and sports are being encouraged to work together and share resources where possible to build towards the greater good.\n\nGosling, whose GB Snowsport organisation received £7.3m in UK Sport funding for its 2026 Olympic programme but has had to bring in extra commercial revenue, said: \"We know we have the talent and the capability and the world has now seen it.\n\n\"We can deliver medals with what we have. We have demonstrated that, but we have greater potential than we're demonstrating right now.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is just the start. This is not the peak for us. There's so much more that we can achieve. And I'm super excited because the athletes that are competing and are just near missing, are those athletes that are still very young with a great future ahead of them.\n\n\"And guess what? 2030 is just on the doorstep and we'll be back and we'll be showing them. Let's hope we'll convert those near misses to golds. The world's our oyster.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "The Olympics. There's nothing quite like it.\n\nThe world's greatest sporting showcase - and a hub of weird and wonderful stories.\n\nThink the Australian breakdancer, the 'Muffin Man' and the random guy in his swimming trunks at Paris 2024. The robots at Beijing 2022. The green diving pool at Rio 2016.\n\nThe Games always throws up the unexpected - and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics has been no different.\n\nHere are just some of the stories we didn't think we would be telling from over the past few weeks.\n\nThe Olympics had not even got under way when the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) responded to claims that male ski jumpers were injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.\n\nGerman newspaper Bild reported that jumpers were injecting their genitals with hyaluronic acid - which is not banned in sport - to increase their size before being measured for their suits.\n\nThe bigger the surface area of the suits, the more flight in the air.\n\nAsked about the claims, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related.\"\n\nInternational Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"\n\nThat wasn't the end of the headlines for ski jumping either. Later in the Games, Austria's Daniel Tschofenig was disqualified from the men's large hill individual event for wearing oversized boots - that were just four millimetres larger than the rules permitted.\n\nHow penis injections became a Winter Olympic talking point\n\n'Extremely stupid' - ski jumper disqualified over boots\n\nNorway's Sturla Holm Laegreid won bronze in the 20km individual biathlon - and then confessed live on TV to cheating on his girlfriend.\n\nHe admitted he had an affair three months ago and called it \"my biggest mistake\", adding it had been \"the worst week of my life\" since he told his girlfriend of six months about the affair.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life,\" he said.\n\nThe following day, his ex-girlfriend, writing anonymously in Norwegian newspaper VG, said she \"did not choose to be put in this position\".\n\nShe wrote: \"It's hard to forgive. Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world.\n\n\"We have been in contact and he is aware of my feelings about this.\"\n\nLaegreid wins bronze then confesses to affair on TV\n\nIt happened at Paris 2024 and it's happened again at Milan-Cortina 2026. Breaking medals.\n\nEarly in the Games, two of the USA's gold medallists, Breezy Johnson and Alysa Liu, revealed the ribbon had come away from their medals soon after they received their prize.\n\nJohnson's broke while she was being interviewed by BBC Sport and speaking at a news conference afterwards, she said: \"So there's the medal. And there's the ribbon.\n\n\"And here's the little piece that is supposed to go into the ribbon to hold the medal, and yeah, it came apart.\"\n\nAndrea Francisi, Milan-Cortina 2026 chief Games operations officer, said: \"We are going to pay maximum attention to the medals. Obviously this is something we want to be perfect when the medal is handed over because this is one of the most important moments for the athletes.\"\n\nOlympic bosses investigate why medals are breaking\n\nAccusations of cheating. Swear words being hurled across the ice. Counter-claims of a sting operation with illicit filming. In curling?!\n\nThe drama started when Canada's Marc Kennedy became involved in a heated verbal exchange with Sweden's Oskar Eriksson towards the end of his side's 8-6 win.\n\nThe Swedes believed Kennedy was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones, an illegal move.\n\nBut the cards were signed by both teams at the end, meaning the result would stand in a sport that is proudly self-governed by the players.\n\nAnd then video footage found its way into circulation post-match. Was it premeditated?\n\nThe following day, Switzerland reported Kennedy for the same offence. World Curling then announced they would deploy extra officials for the remainder of the Games to check for double-touching.\n\nCanadian women's skip Rachel Holman was pinged for a double-touch, as was Team GB's Bobby Lammie - both incidents not deliberate and the case of a lingering figure falling on to the granite.\n\nWorld Curling changed its protocol again and teams could now request to have the stone delivery monitored if they had suspicions, and for a minimum of three ends.\n\nSwearing, illicit filming & rule changes - what next in curling cheating row?\n\nWe thought Snoop would be the only Dogg we saw at the Winter Olympics.\n\nAnd then an actual one chased cross-country skiers down the finishing straight in the women's team sprint event.\n\nThe Czechoslovakian Wolfdog had broken free of its owner and made its way on to the course in Tesero, where it then chased a camera over the line.\n\nGreek athlete Konstantina Charalampidou said: \"I became famous with a dog that came across the finish line and everyone wants to interview me now.\n\n\"I wanted to pet him but I didn't have the time and I couldn't find him afterwards.\"\n\nThroughout the season, Spanish figure skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate has skated to a mix of music from the Minions animated film series, all while clad in a yellow T-shirt and blue dungarees like the film's characters.\n\nYet at the Olympics, it seemed that he would have to change his usual routine in the men's singles because of a copyright issue.\n\nBut after negotiations with representatives of Pharrell Williams, singer of Happy - a song that appears in Despicable Me 2 and one of Sabate's selections - an agreement was reached and he was granted permission.\n\nIt didn't bring Sabate any luck, however, as he placed 25th.\n\nOlympic skater given Minions music permission\n\nAt the curling we had the moonwalking technician 'pebbling' the ice while at the figure skating, we saw the incredible skill of the on-ice camera operator.\n\nUp in Livigno, hats off to the 'chief of colour' line painters, spraying blue lines on to the snow with incredibly precise skill on skis, plus a nod to the course slippers, who took their moments in the spotlight by performing the Mobot (a Mo Farah pose) and Usain Bolt's lightning pose as they cleared the halfpipe of loose snow.\n\nAccording to organisers, there is a workforce of approximately 25,000 people at these Games, with 18,000 of them being volunteers.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Freestyle skier Zoe Atkin won bronze in the women's halfpipe to secure Great Britain's fifth medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, equalling the team's record-best haul.\n\nThe 23-year-old had already secured a medal when she dropped into the pipe for her final run and, with the pressure off, improved her score to 92.50 - just half a point shy of silver medal position.\n\nChina's global superstar Eileen Gu won gold, her first of these Games after two silvers, with 94.75, while compatriot Li Fanghui took silver.\n\nIn winning bronze, Atkin matches the achievement of her sister Izzy, who won Team GB's first Olympic medal on skis with slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang eight years ago.\n\n\"I am so happy. I've been looking forward to this for at least the past four years and it was so overwhelming with the crowd and knowing it was the Olympics - so many emotions,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I was so stressed out and I was crying and to put two runs down felt so good and the cherry on top is getting on the Olympic podium.\n\n\"It means so much to me and I've literally dreamed about this moment since watching my sister win her bronze in 2018, so to back her up eight years later feels so good and to have her supporting me here it feels full circle. I am so stoked.\"\n\nWith five medals secured - three golds, one silver and now a bronze - Team GB have matched the record hauls they achieved in Sochi in 2014 and the 2018 Games in South Korea.\n\nBut this was the team's most successful Winter Olympics the moment Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale secured the second of those golds in the mixed team snowboard cross exactly a week ago.\n\nNever before had Great Britain won more than one gold at a single Winter Games.\n\nAtkin came into her second Olympics fresh from winning X Games gold and as the reigning world champion, eager to improve on the ninth-place finish she achieved on her debut in Beijing four years ago.\n\nShe had qualified top of the standings for the final, which was postponed to Sunday morning after heavy snowfall in Livigno the previous day.\n\nThere she remained after the first run, with a score of 90.50, after Gu - the defending champion - had fallen on her opening trick.\n\nOn the second run, the roles reversed. Gu vastly improved with a 94.00, as did Li with 91.50, only for Atkin to fall on her effort.\n\nGu, the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history, boosted her score further on her third and final run, leaving Atkin knowing she would have to be perfect to challenge for gold.\n\nBut with the medal already in the bag, Atkin was smiling at the top of the pipe as she dropped in for one last time, enjoying a pressure-free run and seemingly unbothered that the two points she gained were not enough for a higher step on the podium.\n\nThe top of the icy Winter Olympics halfpipe is a world away from the Californian climes of Stanford University.\n\nAnd yet it is where Atkin's two worlds collide.\n\nAs an Olympic medal-winning skier - and a student at one of the United States' most prestigious colleges.\n\nAtkin, who was born and raised in the US to a Malaysian mother and English father, studies symbolic systems - \"a mix of cognitive science, studying the brain, how it works and the mechanisms of that, combined with computer science and studying those machines,\" as she told BBC Sport before the Games.\n\nOlympic halfpipes are 6.7m high, with Atkin achieving an amplitude of more than 5m during her final.\n\nThat means, should something go wrong mid-air, athletes have a near 12m drop on to pure ice, a risk Atkin had previously struggled to cope with.\n\n\"I have learned so much that has helped me so much being an athlete in an action sport. The tricks and manoeuvres that we're doing inherently have a lot of risk to them,\" she said.\n\n\"I've struggled with fear a lot in the past, especially when I was younger. Learning about the mechanisms of the brain has really helped me apply those learnings and new mindsets and be able to test those theories, in practice, in my sport.\n\n\"It's in those really hard moments that you show yourself what is possible and that is when you really push your limits.\n\n\"I've been able to find my power in that.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAmber Glenn's figure skating career may be winding down.\n\nShe won a team gold medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics with the United States before coming up a bit short in the individual competition.\n\nNow, she's figuring out what's next for her.\n\nGlenn skated in the exhibition gala to cap her Olympics journey, and it sounds like this may very well have been her final Olympics.\n\nAlready 26 years old, Glenn is on the tail end of most figure skating careers.\n\nShe spoke with U.S. Figure Skating and shared these thoughts on her future:\n\n\"I am grateful that my body has held up for this long. I will reevaluate after the season's over and see how I'm doing physically, mentally. I am not opposed to doing a one last season hoorah, just for fun and seeing, 'Hey, let's see if I can do a quad, see what features I can go for.'\"\n\nMORE: Ilia Malinin finishes Olympics with triumphant backflip\n\nIt would be cool to see Glenn skate one final season with joy out there on the ice.\n\nShe's been an inspiration for a lot of figure skating fans, speaking openly about her mental health throughout her athletic path.\n\nGlenn made a crucial mistake in her short program in the individual competition that set her back, but she returned with a tremendous free skate to at least end these Olympics with positive vibes for herself.\n\nSoon, she may move on. But first, there could be a little bit more skating still to do.\n\nMORE: Alysu Liu's smile shines in exhibition gala",

    "fullText": "The speed skating events at the 2030 Winter Olympics will take place outside host nation France, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe Games, known as French Alps 2030, will be mostly spread across south-east France with venue clusters in Nice, Briancon, Savoie and Haut-Savoie.\n\nHowever, the speed skating will take place in pre-existing venues in either Turin in northern Italy, or Heerenveen in the Netherlands.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Games organisers do not want to build new venues that would not have a definite legacy in the host region.\n\nEdgar Grospiron, president of the French Alps 2030 organising committee, said holding the speed skating outside France was a condition agreed with the IOC upon becoming hosts of the Games.\n\n\"This decision has already been taken, so the organising committee has to go on what has already been decided,\" he told a media conference in Milan on Saturday, the day before the 2026 hosts hand over responsibility for the Games.\n\n\"This is so that the Games in the French Alps can be as we want them to be.\n\n\"For the first time we will have a Games with a discipline in another European country. This will be new; we will see if other Games do it.\"\n\nHolding events away from the host city or region is not unprecedented in the Olympics. At Paris 2024, the surfing events were held on the Pacific island of Tahiti - approximately 10,000 miles away from France.\n\nBut Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia, is an overseas territory of France, while the 2030 speed skating will be held in a different independent nation.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGrospiron said about 15% of sports and venues for 2030 have not yet been decided, but that details will be confirmed by June this year.\n\nHe said figure skating - which does not currently have a confirmed location - will take place in Nice, as will curling and ice hockey.\n\nGrospiron also said they will decide on which new sports, if any, will be added to the programme and if any events will be removed.\n\nThe future of Nordic combined - the only event at Milan-Cortina 2026 not to have a women's competition - has not yet been confirmed.\n\nSki mountaineering, which made its debut in 2026, is yet to be confirmed as a medal event in the French Alps.\n\n\"New sports are at the eart of our concerns, this will need to be broached to then decide what our venue plan is like and has to be validated by June by the IOC,\" Grospiron said.\n\n\"We will not do this alone; we will do this hand in hand with federations and venues.\n\n\"For Nordic combined, this is at the helm of the IOC. We will follow the recommendations of the IOC. We are there to listen, to help us finalise our venue plan.\"\n\nThere have been reports of infighting, external among the 2030 organising committee, with director general Cyril Linette allegedly departing amid differences with Grospiron, as well as budget cuts.\n\nGrospiron said they have \"little time, little money\" but were confident the Games would be delivered successfully.\n\n\"We talk every day about wanting to make these Games a success,\" he said. \"The organising committee needs serenity, continuity, then we will show what our teams can do. We are very proud of the work we have been able to do.\n\n\"We know we have very little time, little money. But we can deliver a Games that will honour our vision and ambition.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "TESERO, Italy (AP) — Norway’s Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo set the new gold standard Saturday for the most wins by one athlete in a single Winter Olympics by sweeping all six men's cross-country skiing events at the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nHis half-dozen golds helped catapult Norway to new heights in first-place finishes and total Winter Games medals.\n\nKlaebo has plenty of company atop the podium. The nation has won big on cross-country skis — in classic and freestyle races and Nordic combined in Tesero, and biathlon in Anterselva.\n\nIt also has notable wins in ski jumping, freestyle skiing, Alpine skiing and speedskating.\n\nThe latest records build on Norway’s dominance in the Winter Games: It has more winter medals than any other country and has led the medal count in the past three Olympics.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of some of the key numbers that explain why Norway has been so dominant.\n\nSix of Norway's 18 gold medals through Saturday afternoon were won by Klaebo, though two were for relays involving teammates.\n\nSki jumper Anna Odine Stroem won both the normal and large hills competitions, becoming the first woman to do so because it was the first year women jumped on the bigger hill. Stroem also won a silver in the mixed team event.\n\nNorway won a pair of golds in men’s freestyle skiing. Birk Ruud won freeski slopestyle and Tormod Frostad won men’s freeski big air.\n\nIn alpine skiing, Thea Louise Stjernesund won silver in women’s giant slalom and Henrik Kristoffersen got the bronze in the men’s slalom.\n\nJens Luraas Oftebro stood atop the podium in all three competitions in Nordic combined, the sport that begins with a ski jump and ends with a cross-country ski race. Oftebro won individually on the normal and large hills and again in the team relay.\n\nMen's speedskater Sander Eitrem won gold in the men’s 5000 meter race.\n\nOn the women's side, Ragne Wiklund hauled in three medals: silvers in the 1500 meters and 3000 meters and bronze in the 5000 meters.\n\nKlaebo’s victory in the 50-kilometer mass start race Saturday shattered the nearly 50-year record set by American speedskater Eric Heiden, who won five golds in the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.\n\nAll of Heiden’s wins were in individual races and two of Klaebo’s have come in team events, so Heiden’s record for individual wins still stands.\n\nThe biathlon team won 11 medals, led by Maren Kirkeeide, who won individual gold in the women’s 7.5-kilometer sprint and silver in the 10-kilometer pursuit and was part of the bronze medal-winning four by 6-kilometer relay. On the men's side, Johan‑Olav Botn won gold in the individual 20-kilometer and Johannes Dale‑Skjevdal won in the 15-kilometer mass start.\n\nSturla Holm Laegreid, won four individual medals, two silver and two bronze.\n\nVetle Sjaastad Christiansen won an individual silver and shared a silver in the four by 7.5-kilometer race with Laegreid and Botn.\n\nCross-country skiers captured the most medals, with Klaebo laying claim to nearly half of them — with a little help from his friends in the team relay and sprint titles.\n\nTeammates who won the four by 7.5-kilometer relay with Klaebo all enjoyed some hardware of their own.\n\nMartin Loewstrøm Nyenget won silver in the 50-kilometer mass start and bronze in the 20-kilometer skiathlon. Einar Hedegart also shared gold in the team sprint with Klaebo and won a bronze in the 10-kilometer interval start. Emil Iversen won bronze in the 50-kilometer race.\n\nNorwegian women beat dominant Sweden in the team four by 7.5-kilometer race and Heidi Weng, who was in that foursome, added an individual bronze in the 20-kilometer skiathlon\n\nNorway has won a total of 40 medals: 18 golds, 11 silvers and 11 bronze.\n\nThe gold medals beat its previous record of 16 won at the 2022 Beijing Olympics for the most won by a nation in a single Winter Olympics.\n\nThe total medal count with Norway's cross-country sweep on Saturday also set a Winter Olympics record, though the 116 medal events this year is more than in the past.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "A mom shares what it's like raising a teenage ski athlete in the US Ski Team pipeline and the family sacrifices required along the way.",
    "fullText": "I'm the mom of an elite teenage athlete. My husband was a downhill skier as a teenager, and he taught our boys, Gavin and Deacon, to ski when they were about two or three. I don't ski at all.\n\nGavin was a shy and reserved kid, but he was a different kid on the mountain. He was so confident. We used to say that skiing was like oxygen to him. It's where he is at his best.\n\nGavin began skiing with the Bristol Mountain Freestyle team when he was around 8 years old. It's a feeder into the US Ski Team. It was apparent quickly that he was very good in the air. In 2024, when he was 14, he was invited to Lake Placid, N.Y., to participate in the US Ski Team's Project Gold, an aerial camp. He was all in on aerial skiing after that.\n\nNow 15, he is part of the US Ski Team's national development program for aerials. He trains with his national teammates at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid. He also travels for competitions.\n\nHe's a 15-year-old boy. He makes mistakes. But as long as he's working hard, and doing the best he can at school and being a good human, we will continue to make sacrifices for him.\n\nWe have also had conversations with Gavin about the sacrifices that he would have to make on this path. That means school is going to be harder, because he's going to miss a lot of school. He won't be able to see his school friends that much when he's competing and traveling. But, we've always told him, \"We will work hard for you as long as you are working hard for yourself.\"\n\nHe loves what he does, which makes it easy for us to support him. If he ever got to the point where he didn't want to do it anymore, we would never make him. It sounds insane considering the investment we've made, but it's his body, his life. We are also teaching him to advocate for himself because we won't always be with him.\n\nI'm a travel agent, and we like to travel as a family. Before, we'd be off to an island somewhere every break, but now I'm spending that time standing on a mountain. We've definitely had to change our plans several times for him, but we never put that burden on him. This is our family's choice.\n\nMy husband and I divide and conquer a lot. A lot of times, just my husband or just me will travel with Gavin, so that Deacon can be home, in school, and with his friends, pursuing his hobbies. Pat and I are apart a lot, but we also try to take advantage of that one-on-one time with our kids, and the moments we have together with them.\n\nDeacon is the real hero here; he is such a supportive little brother. He goes along for the ride with minimal complaints and is Gavin's biggest fan. He's so proud of him.\n\nWe want him to have fun. He had me write \"have fun\" on his skis, so if he's having a bad day or a couple of bad jumps, he can remind himself that this is fun.\n\nBut it's also serious. We might consider looking for financial sponsors soon, as we try to get him to where he needs to be. We will cross those bridges as they come. The goal is the US Ski Team for the 2034 Olympics. That sometimes feels overwhelming — it's almost a decade away.\n\nMy job as his mom is balance. I have to let go of some control, but I also need to remember that he's 15 and still needs a lot of guidance from us. I am confident in his abilities, and I'm now able to watch him jump without closing my eyes anymore.",

Being able to crown the Olympics with the 50km was unbelievable.\"\n\nKlaebo breaks the previous record of five golds from a single Games, held by American speed skater Eric Heiden since the Lake Placid Olympics of 1980.\n\nIt also extends his own record for most Winter Olympic golds to 11, while he becomes the first athlete to win all six cross-country events at one Games.\n\nOnly US swimming great Michael Phelps, who won 23 gold medals, has more Olympic titles to his name.\n\nBorn in Oslo, Klaebo moved to Trondheim - a haven of cross-country skiing trails - as a young child, a move that has seen him become the greatest to ever do the sport.\n\nNo other man, active or retired, comes close to his record of 116 World Cup wins, while he is also a 15-time world champion, winning all six titles at last year's edition on home snow in Trondheim.\n\n\"After the world championships last year, we knew that it was possible, but to be able to do it, it's hard to find the right words,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"[There were] so many emotions when I'm crossing the finish line.\"\n\nHis sixth Olympic gold at Milan-Cortina adds to the titles he had won earlier in the Games in the skiathlon, sprint classic, 10km interval start free, 4x7.5km relay and the team sprint.\n\nElsewhere in the race, Team GB's Andrew Musgrave placed sixth, almost four minutes behind Klaebo's winning time, while team-mate Joe Davies was 16th.\n\nMusgrave, 35, is appearing at his fifth Olympics - but did not rule out a sixth in four years' time.\n\n\"I'm still young and promising,\" Musgrave joked to BBC Sport.\n\n\"It was a decent Games. I came in good shape, but not quite good enough to fight the Norwegians, they're just so dominant at the moment.\"\n\nIt marks the end of a remarkable Olympics for Great Britain's cross-country team, in which Musgrave and James Clugnet recorded a fifth-place finish in the team sprint event, the nation's best Olympic result in the sport.\n\nThat bettered Musgrave's sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle, while Anna Pryce recorded a best British women's result at an Olympics with her 32nd place in the sprint classic.\n\n\"We've had the best ever women's Olympic result, best ever men's Olympic result, best ever team result.\n\n\"Joe is still young and up and coming, he's doing super good, fighting for top 10s, so the whole team is just showing that we work well together, we've got a good programme.\n\n\"We've had limited resources but we can still show that we can do good results.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "The speed skating events at the 2030 Winter Olympics will take place outside host nation France, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe Games, known as French Alps 2030, will be mostly spread across south-east France with venue clusters in Nice, Briancon, Savoie and Haut-Savoie.\n\nHowever, the speed skating will take place in pre-existing venues in either Turin in northern Italy, or Heerenveen in the Netherlands.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Games organisers do not want to build new venues that would not have a definite legacy in the host region.\n\nEdgar Grospiron, president of the French Alps 2030 organising committee, said holding the speed skating outside France was a condition agreed with the IOC upon becoming hosts of the Games.\n\n\"This decision has already been taken, so the organising committee has to go on what has already been decided,\" he told a media conference in Milan on Saturday, the day before the 2026 hosts hand over responsibility for the Games.\n\n\"This is so that the Games in the French Alps can be as we want them to be.\n\n\"For the first time we will have a Games with a discipline in another European country. This will be new; we will see if other Games do it.\"\n\nHolding events away from the host city or region is not unprecedented in the Olympics. At Paris 2024, the surfing events were held on the Pacific island of Tahiti - approximately 10,000 miles away from France.\n\nBut Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia, is an overseas territory of France, while the 2030 speed skating will be held in a different independent nation.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGrospiron said about 15% of sports and venues for 2030 have not yet been decided, but that details will be confirmed by June this year.\n\nHe said figure skating - which does not currently have a confirmed location - will take place in Nice, as will curling and ice hockey.\n\nGrospiron also said they will decide on which new sports, if any, will be added to the programme and if any events will be removed.\n\nThe future of Nordic combined - the only event at Milan-Cortina 2026 not to have a women's competition - has not yet been confirmed.\n\nSki mountaineering, which made its debut in 2026, is yet to be confirmed as a medal event in the French Alps.\n\n\"New sports are at the eart of our concerns, this will need to be broached to then decide what our venue plan is like and has to be validated by June by the IOC,\" Grospiron said.\n\n\"We will not do this alone; we will do this hand in hand with federations and venues.\n\n\"For Nordic combined, this is at the helm of the IOC. We will follow the recommendations of the IOC. We are there to listen, to help us finalise our venue plan.\"\n\nThere have been reports of infighting among the 2030 organising committee, with director general Cyril Linette allegedly departing amid differences with Grospiron, as well as budget cuts.\n\nGrospiron said they have \"little time, little money\" but were confident the Games would be delivered successfully.\n\n\"We talk every day about wanting to make these Games a success,\" he said. \"The organising committee needs serenity, continuity, then we will show what our teams can do. We are very proud of the work we have been able to do.\n\n\"We know we have very little time, little money. But we can deliver a Games that will honour our vision and ambition.\"",

    "fullText": "As Saturday night prime-time drama goes, curling might seem a strange choice.\n\nEight men sliding 16 stones down an ice sheet to the soundtrack of clunking granite, furious sweeping and hollered commands of \"hard\" and \"curl\".\n\nAnd yet at 18:05 GMT - live on the BBC - millions will find themselves staring at televisions, tablets, laptops and phones to see if Team GB can add a fourth gold medal of these Winter Olympics.\n\nBruce Mouat's rink will face Canada - their oldest rivals - in the men's event in Cortina, high in the Dolomites in the north of Italy.\n\nIt will be the culmination of 11 days of competition which have included controversy, drama and intrigue... as well as the odd bout of boredom.\n\nBut why should you dedicate a couple of hours of your Saturday evening to it? Here's what you need to know...\n\nFour men, one aim - to end 102-year wait for Winter Olympic curling gold\n\nWhat do curlers do when they're not at the Olympics?\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nThe first time curling appeared in the Winter Games was in 1924. That was the last time Britain's men won gold in the event as only three teams competed.\n\nThey have only been among the medals twice since.\n\nMouat's rink had to settle for silver four years ago in Beijing after being edged out by Sweden.\n\nAnd at Sochi 2014, a GB rink lost in the final to a Canadian team skipped by Brad Jacobs, who will lead them again on Saturday.\n\nAmong the British men he beat that day, were current GB coaches Michael Goodfellow and Greg Drummond, as well as David Murdoch, who is now the Canada high performance director.\n\nCanada also beat the British quartet in the round robin this month.\n\nBad omens or just fuel for revenge?\n\nLet's say Canada have had an eventful time of it in Italy.\n\nAccusations of cheating. Swear words being hurled across the ice. Counter-claims of a sting operation with illicit filming... it all got a little bit tasty.\n\nThen we had several days of wondering if Marc Kennedy was prone to leaving a lingering finger or guilty of administering an intentional prod?\n\nThe heat has been drawn from the situation since, but the Canadians seem a good fit for the role of pantomime villains.\n\nIt's fair to say they carry themselves in a certain manner...\n\nDismissed by some as just \"ice bowls\", curling follows a similar cycle.\n\nBroadly ignored for three years and 50 weeks, it registers in the wider public attention when the Olympics comes round, but as little more than wallpaper filling the gaps between the more exciting winter sports.\n\nThen, a few days in, we become hooked. People in offices and pubs find themselves discussing Rebecca Morrison's outrageous draw, or the ferocity with which Hammy McMillan brushes the ice. Or maybe just revelling in the Canadian capers.\n\nCome the end of the round-robin and the medal matches, we've properly bought in - the BBC audience for the semi-final win over Switzerland peaked at 3.4million.\n\nMaybe something worth keeping handy for when people tell you nobody is interested in curling...\n\nThen we'll get to Saturday's gold-medal match. Clammy palms, spiked heart-rates, agonising groans and joyful roars - and that's just Steve Cram in the commentary box.\n\nThe Cortina Curling Stadium is a quirky wee place.\n\nFirst built as an open-air venue to host the 1956 Games, it also played host to scenes from the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only, where James Bond became involved in a contretemps with some ice hockey players. Obviously.\n\nThe wooden bleachers and facings from those days still remain within the shell of a modern building. And when the noise rolls down from those stands... wow, it's loud.\n\nThe absence of the Italian hosts might quieten things down a little, but day-upon-day the British contingent seems to have swelled in this high-end resort town.\n\nFor the semi-final, one fan managed to smuggle a set of bagpipes into the arena. The story goes that they were hidden within a baby's pram to avoid the attention of security.\n\nWill they make it in again on Saturday? We'll see. But regardless, the roar of the kilt-clad masses will be there to support Mouat and his team.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Milan-Cortina 2026 has been one of the most eventful Winter Olympics in history – in sporting and political terms - so it is appropriate that the final medal event could be the most enticing of all.\n\nCanada and United States have been the two best teams in the men's ice hockey competition, and they will duke it out at Milano Santagiulia Arena on Sunday at 13.10 GMT.\n\nFor two of the most storied nations in the sport, however, they have very different Olympic histories.\n\nCanada are aiming to be the first nation to earn 10 men's ice hockey gold medals, most recently winning the title in 2014.\n\nUSA meanwhile have not claimed the men's title since 1980 - the 'Miracle on Ice' triumph over Soviet Union in Lake Placid - and have not beaten Canada in a men's final since 1960.\n\nCanada have beaten the American men in their past two Olympic final meetings - Salt Lake City 2002 and Vancouver 2010. But the USA are looking for a double in Milan after their women's side defeated the Canadians on Thursday.\n\nThe two teams did not have a totally smooth skate to this point. Both needed overtime to win their quarter-finals, while Canada had to come from 2-0 down to beat Finland 3-2 in Friday's semi-final on Friday, scoring the winner with 35 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe Canadians also have fitness issues. They could be without captain Sidney Crosby, who was forced off in their last eight win over Czech Republic with a knee injury and missed the Finland semi. Canada are hopeful to have him for Sunday, but he certainly will not be 100% fit.\n\nThe squad has also been afflicted by a sickness bug, which dramatically revealed itself in the quarter-final when Nathan MacKinnon threw up while sat on the bench.\n\nBut even when impacted by injury and illness, Canada still have the strongest team.\n\n\"In Connor McDavid you have the best player on the planet by a million miles,\" ice hockey commentator Seth Bennett told BBC Sport. \"He was averaging three points a game going into semi-finals.\n\n\"McKinnon is another superstar offensive player. Defensively, Cale Makar is the best defenceman in the world and a gamechanger. All will be judged against him.\n\n\"You mix them up and it's like if you have a computer game and you put all the best players on one team.\"\n\nThey also have some of the best up-and-coming talents in the game, such as 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini who has already scored the most points by a teenager in an Olympic competition.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nUSA meanwhile have stars of their own, but don't have the attacking gifts of the Canadians.\n\n\"The Tkachuk brothers [Brady and Matthew], and Jack Eichel, that attacking line has worked well together,\" Bennett said.\n\n\"What they have not had is much scoring from captain Auston Matthews, he has not yet taken any of the games by the horns. They are OK, but not more than that.\"\n\nHowever, the Americans have the best defenceman at the Games in Quinn Hughes, who scored the crucial winner against Sweden.\n\n\"He might be the best three-on-three player in the world,\" said Bennett. \"He loves to keep possession, and is always looking to make an exciting play.\"\n\nIt sets up a mouth-watering finale of an Olympic ice hockey competition which has benefitted hugely from the return of National Hockey League (NHL) players for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe attendance of players from the top North American league was in doubt for a time over concerns about the ice quality at the unfinished Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, but they have been a major boon for the Games.\n\n\"This is the highest level of hockey we have ever seen at an Olympics,\" said Bennett. \"The NHL players have made it a different world.\n\n\"At the last two Olympics, games have been good but have missed the quality in the final third, the big moments. Players didn't have the skillset to break a game, so saw a lot of tight, dull games\n\n\"Some of what the players have been doing here has been mind-blowing. One of the goals scored for Canada, McDavid saucered this pass from the back door [behind the goal], it lands as McKinnon is shooting, on the half-volley. That's when you recognise it.\n\n\"I have been getting phone calls from people in the hockey world, all they have been saying is, this is so good. There have been periods where Kent [Simpson, BBC co-commentator] and I have just been sat watching, smiling, laughing.\"\n\nCanada have won gold in three of the five Olympics when NHL players have featured and will fancy their chances in a game on Sunday which could be as fascinating in the stands as it is on the ice.\n\nIt is highly likely that Canadian prime minister Mark Carney will be in Milan for the game.\n\nNot only is Canada as a country hockey-mad, but so is Carney - when working as governor of the Bank of England, he would play for a recreational team in Haringey, north London.\n\nThe big question is whether his American counterpart will also be in Italy.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe BBC understands that, as of Friday afternoon, Donald Trump is scheduled to remain in Washington DC - but that could now change.\n\nIt would be a logistical and security nightmare for the International Olympic Committee should he attend, and it would add a major frisson to an already charged game.\n\nTrump's vice president JD Vance attended a USA group stage game, and the Olympic opening ceremony at San Siro where he was loudly booed when he appeared on the stadium's big screen.\n\nAnd the presence of Trump - who previously said he will impose tariffs on imported goods from Canada, while also floating the idea of their northern neighbours becoming the US's 51st state - would turn the Santagiulia Arena into a political cauldron.\n\nHis impact was seen in February 2025, when the Four Nations match between the United States and Canada descended into chaos with three fights breaking out between players in the first nine seconds.\n\nThe crowd at Montreal's Bell Centre for that game loudly booed the US national anthem pre-game - an issue which will be avoided in Milan. What happens after the game depends on the victor.\n\nAnd Bennett thinks the heightened stakes and occasion will mean a less pugilistic occasion.\n\n\"There won't be a repeat of the fights with a gold medal on the line,\" he said. \"They will be at each other though; in every break in play, there will be a cross-check, a word, a push, a scrum.\n\n\"Then when they fly back, they will fly on the same private jets because the NHL will put on transport.\n\n\"For example, you have Matthew Tkachuk for USA and Brad Marchand for Canada, who are both rink rats, they will go head-to-head 100%. Then they will be on the same flight, they are Florida Panthers teammates and will try to win the Stanley Cup together.\"\n\nThe crowd may also be less tense due to the likelihood of more neutrals buying tickets for an Olympic spectacle, rather than a potential grudge match.\n\nSo, if you are a neutral going to the game, who does Seth think you should support?\n\n\"Canada going for their 10th gold, so usually the neutral will go with the underdog,\" he says. \"But that is USA.\n\n\"Canada are a bit arrogant too, but they have all the favourite players. How do you not love a team with all those players?\n\n\"But how do you not love a USA team who are having this much fun?\"",

    "fullText": "MILAN — Polish skater Kamila Sellier suffered a serious injury in the sixth quarterfinal of Friday night’s 1500m short-track speedskate and was taken from Assago Ice Skating Arena to a nearby hospital. Polish officials indicated that she was in good spirits, even raising a thumbs-up as she left the arena.\n\nLate in the quarterfinal, Sellier appeared to lose her footing and slipped, colliding with the United States’ Kristen Santos-Griswold. In the ensuing accident, Santos-Griswold’s skate caught Sellier on the face. Sellier slid into the protective retaining wall, and medical crews raised a sheet around her to protect the scene from the audience. She was stretchered from the ice.\n\nMasakra ....\nFatalnie wyglądał wypadek Kamili Sellier podczas rywalizacji w short tracku na igrzyskach olimpijskich.

Other reports indicated that Sellier had potentially fractured a cheekbone and suffered severe swelling.\n\n“We are waiting for what the hospital tests will show,” Niedźwiedzki said, via translation.\n\nOne of Sellier’s teammates, Natalia Maliszewska, appeared visibly shaken as she spoke with reporters. “My thoughts are with her,” Maliszewska said in Polish. “I can’t think of anything else.”\n\n“These aren't common accidents, but they do happen,” Sellier’s teammate Gabriela Topolska said in Polish. “Kamila already has one of them, from a skate on her face. Kamila has a cut in her skin, with stitches.”\n\nSellier has won several European speed-skating medals, most recently a silver medal in the 2000m mixed relay at the European short track speed skating championships in January.\n\nSantos-Griswold was disqualified from the race, potentially because of an illegal pass that led to the accident. She declined to speak to media after the race, which continued after the injury timeout.",

    "fullText": "MILAN — Federica Brignone has skied in five Winter Olympics, but her experience this year has been unique. For starters, she won her first gold medals. She also had an easier commute.\n\n“I had never arrived at an Olympics with my car,” Brignone, who was born in Milan and lives in Northern Italy, told reporters before the Games. “Usually it was always hotels, all shuttles, everything already organized.”\n\nOlympics Ratings Remain White-Hot as USA Sniffs Double Hockey Gold\n\nAlysa Liu's Figure Skating Gold Breaks 24-Year U.S. Olympic Drought\n\nFigure Skating, Hockey Fans Face Overlapping Schedule\n\nFamiliar comforts may be one of many factors driving the resurgent Olympics performance of Brignone and the rest of her Italian teammates. With a few events remaining this weekend, Italy has won 26 medals and nine golds at this year’s Winter Games, both records for the country. After ranking 10th in the medal table four years ago in Beijing, Italy sits in third so far this year, behind Norway and the United States.\n\nThe host boost is a trend that holds across both the Summer and Winter Olympics in recent decades. Since World War II, 18 of 19 Winter Olympics hosts—and 17 of 19 in the summer—have improved their medal counts from the previous games, with a median increase of 60% and a median gold medal increase of more than 75%. Ironically, the lone exception was Italy in 2006, when it won two fewer medals in Turin than it did in 2002.\n\nHost nations typically have a long run-up of preparation—Italy was awarded the 2026 Games seven years ago—meaning the country can dedicate time, money and infrastructure to its Olympic pursuits. While some countries allocate part of their Olympic budgets or resources to high-performance training, the Italian national team told Sportico that the $6.1 billion (€5.2 billion) Milan Cortina budget did not directly increase the country’s funding for its athlete development.\n\n“The medals are the result of hard work,” a spokesperson for the Italian national Olympic committee (CONI) said in an email. “We have not given the athletes any additional funding. We have assisted them in their preparation and with their staffing needs.”\n\nFrom a medal perspective, the return on investment was a jackpot. Great Britain won 29 golds in 2012, up from 19 in 2008 and still the nation’s biggest haul ever.\n\nTechnical and scientific support for the Italian athletes this year came via the country’s Olympic training centers (Centri di Preparazione Olimpica) and the Institute of Sports Medicine and Science (l’Istituto di Medicina e Scienza dello Sport), the CONI spokesperson said. The result of that push, he added, has shown in other avenues. Italy finished atop the gold medal count at the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics in South Korea, beating out France, Germany and the event hosts. Italy wasn’t in the top 10 for the 2012, 2016 or 2020 iterations of that event.\n\nItalian standouts during these Olympics include Brignone, who Corriere dello Sport hailed as “The Queen”; speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida, who won two gold medals; and the nation’s first-everbiathlon gold medalist Lisa Vittozzi. Italy also secured a surprise bronze medal in the team figure skating event. Pairs skater Sara Conti said afterward that the local support helped her team.\n\n“A competition is a competition,” she told reporters, “but when you feel the public behind you, that makes things much easier.”\n\nThere are a few structural factors that benefit Olympic hosts. For one, organizing committees can push to add new sports or new disciplines, and often do so in ways that boost their medal hauls. The lineup for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, for example, includes newcomers flag football, lacrosse, baseball and softball, all sports where the U.S. teams will likely be medal favorites.\n\nThe Winter Olympics introduces new events more gradually than the Summer Games, but several host countries have capitalized on new medal opportunities. For instance, the United States won both gold medals in skeleton when the discipline was resurrected (after a half-century hiatus) in Salt Lake City in 2002, and Russia won gold in men’s parallel slalom in that snowboarding event’s first iteration in 2014.\n\nThese Winter Games featured one new sport—ski mountaineering, or skimo—which features a number of prominent Italians. The hosts failed to medal in the men’s and women’s sprint on Thursday, but have another shot in Saturday’s mixed relay. Another new medal event, women’s doubles luge, produced an Italian gold. The host nation also auto-qualifies in many Olympic sports and receives additional slots in others, though those rarely result in medals. The Italian men’s hockey team, which didn’t have to qualify for the tournament, was winless in four games and was outscored 22-4.\n\nLastly, there are also more medals available by absence. Due to sanctions from the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Russian contingent has fewer than two dozen athletes at the 2026 Winter Games, competing as “individual neutral athletes,” and they’ve won one medal. By contrast, Russia initially claimed 33 medals, more than the U.S. or Canada, when it hosted the Olympics in 2014. Four of those medals were stripped for doping at those Sochi Games, bringing the final count to 29. Its athletes won 17 and 32 medals in the 2018 and 2022 Winter Games, when they faced separate restrictions due to doping violations.\n\nThe increased medal haul doesn’t mean the local Olympics have been blemish-free for Italy. The spread-out nature of the Games has diluted the overall Olympic energy in Milan. Offensive and gaffe-riddled commentary during the Opening Ceremony prompted the resignation of Paolo Petrecca, the sports head of RAI, the Italian state broadcaster.\n\nMLS Franchise Valuations Ranking List: From Inter Miami CF to CF Montréal\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2026?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings",

    "fullText": "Gold medalist Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo of Norway competes during the team sprint free at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games on Feb 18, 2026. Credit - Davide Barbieri—NordicFocus/Getty Images\n\nWhen Norwegian cross-country skier Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo crossed the finish line first on Feb. 18, giving this country a victory in the men’s team sprint free event, he certified himself as the Winter Olympics GOAT. Klaebo, 29, won his fifth Olympic gold of these Milano Cortina Games, in five events, and became the first Winter Olympian ever to reach the double-digit mark in career gold medals. Klaebo goes for No. 11, on Saturday, in the 50-km mass start classic.\n\nWhile prepping for the most prestigious race on the cross-country program, Klaebo took a break to talk to TIME about a wide range of subjects, including how Norway’s youth sports system produces Olympic champions, why he’s not spending much time with his family and fiancée, cross-country memes, and what’s on his bucket list.\n\n[This interview has been condensed for length and clarity]\n\nYou’ve won five gold medals during these Winter Olympics, set the new all-time winter record with 10 golds in your Olympic career, and if you win the 50-km mass start classic on Saturday, you’d be the first Winter Olympian to ever win six golds at the same Games. So what’s going through your mind right now?\n\nI'm just trying to let everything sink in a little bit. Really eager to do well on Saturday. So it's kind of finding the balance, in terms of how much you will enjoy the moment and how much you are trying to prepare yourself for what's ahead. So far it feels really good. And now, with just one more race to go, it's going to be nice to wrap it all up.\n\nSo what can you do to enjoy the moments, knowing that you’ve still got work to do?\n\nWe have a pretty good team here. So we try to stick together. We are eating long dinners. We have long lunches. When it comes to enjoying it too much, I have my family here and everything and just decided that's going to be too much. I don't have time to do everything. Having my girlfriend here as well, it's been just FaceTime. I haven’t been able to see her more than just saying hi at the stadium. So I think that's kind of the balance we are trying to figure out.\n\nSo you haven't seen your family or your fiancée in person, besides hugging after race victories? You haven’t had long dinners with them or anything? It's just with your team?\n\nAbsolutely. The last time I was back home was the start of January. I was there for two days. Besides that, I haven't been home since the start of December. I have 250 days away from home every single year. I tried to bring my fiancée as much as possible. But during the Olympics, with the accreditation and all these kinds of things, it’s really strict. It's easier for her to stay with my family and just have fun. Then I will join them on Saturday.\n\nWhat are you going to do on Saturday night, win or lose?\n\nWe're going to have a nice dinner. That's kind of the minimum of what we're going to do. When I look back at this Olympics, they will for sure be unbelievable anyways. But it'd be cool to finish it up with this total sweep. So we'll see.\n\nWhat’s been your favorite long meal with your team so far? What have you had to eat?\n\nI'm pretty strict in terms of what I'm eating. During the Olympics, there's a lot of rice, chicken, and vegetables. So it's quite a boring dinner. The nice part is that we're actually sitting there for a long time, just trying to speak about the races. We speak about how privileged we are to be here and to enjoy this. This is my third Olympics. The last one in Beijing, for us athletes, you needed to test for COVID twice per day. We were eating with boxes on the side. It felt more like work. Here it feels like this is what I like to do. This is more my hobby. I think that is making a big difference, mentally especially.\n\nPeople are fascinated by Norway’s Winter Olympic dominance. And a lot has been made about the youth sports system there, that keeping score is not allowed in kids’ games. Is that really true? In cross-country, if you finish first, isn’t it obvious that you won?\n\nWhen you're younger, like 8 to 12, if you're starting first, your name will be first on the start list, but on the side you will see your time. So say that you're 3 min. and 40 sec., and then the last one on the starting list is 3 min. and 28 sec. He was faster, but you needed to go into that and kind of look.\n\nAh, so they don’t put the results in order, just the start.\n\nThe reason is we want everyone to stay along for as long as possible. They try to not focus too much on the results. They're focusing more on participation and that people are there and having fun and enjoying the races, more than who is winning.\n\nAnd you played other sports, I believe, besides cross-country. What are some of the other sports you tried?\n\nI did a lot of things. I played soccer. That was kind of what I wanted to be when I grew up. But it didn't turn up that way. Then I was doing a little bit of track and field. I was cycling a little bit. I tried biathlon. I was playing an instrument. So I did a lot of things when I grew up, but the majority of my time was spent on the soccer field and also out running and doing stuff for cross-country.\n\nDo you think the fact that you played all these different sports at least partially explains why we're seeing these results from you?\n\nI think so. It's good when you are younger to try different sports and to be able to learn different patterns and movements. Then at some point you need to decide for sure. But I didn't decide before I was about 16. I still played soccer until I was close to 20. When you're playing soccer, you're doing shorter sprints, you're being a little bit more explosive. When you're cross-country skiing, it's more like endurance. It's a mix of everything. And that was what I tried to do when I was younger, to see if I can combine it as much as possible. And then these days, I think that has helped me a lot to be able to be at my best.\n\nYour uphill sprint has gone viral. Have you enjoyed seeing the memes? What's your favorite one?\n\nThe one I think is the most fun is you see how fast I'm running, and then when people are just then trying to do the same on the treadmill. You see it's actually quite fast. It's cool to see that cross-country skiing has kind of gone a little bit viral, and to see people getting their eyes opened to what we are doing in cross-country skiing.\n\nI'm from the United States, and on the men’s side, America has had its first Olympic cross-country medalists in 50 years. But cross-country is not beloved like it is in Norway. What do you want people to know in the United States, and other places around the world, about your sport that maybe they don't realize or don't see or don't appreciate?\n\nA lot of people think it's all about endurance. But the good part about doing cross-country skiing is that we're using our legs, we're using the upper body, and you're using your endurance. Meaning that it's one of the healthiest sports you can do when it comes to staying active. I know that in the U.S., it's not possible to go skiing everywhere, as it is in Norway during the winter. But you can go roller skiing, which is pretty much the same. You're still using your upper and lower body and endurance. It's really less injury risk than doing cycling or running.\n\nHas anyone from another sport tried to recruit you?\n\nI’ve gotten some questions about cycling. I'm close to 30 now, so I think it's a little bit too late to start exploring. I think I will stick to cross-country skiing.\n\nMichael Phelps has the all-time Olympic record, with 23 golds. You might get 11 once you’re through here. Might you try to catch him? Is that a goal of yours, to become the all-time gold-medal winner in Olympic history?\n\nThat's going to be hard. Because then I need to do two more Olympics, and I need to win every single event. That will be quite crazy. I’m second. I think I’m going to stay second. It's cool to get the question. But I don't think it's that realistic, to be honest.\n\nBut when I say you're the greatest Winter Olympian of all time, do you agree with that?\n\nIt’s pretty crazy to hear that. It's unbelievable. My goal when I was younger was to be able to do cross-country skiing for a living. It’s just been way more than I could ever expect or dream about.\n\nSome people would try to play down the Winter Olympics GOAT label. But it sounds like you accept that title. Fair?\n\nThe good part is that we actually have the numbers for it. For me, I will never try to go down that lane. To be honest, I think there are so many great athletes participating in the Olympics, whether it's freeskiing or it's skeleton. It's pretty sick to have the record, for sure. But I think it's important to mention that there are so many good athletes out there, and I have a huge respect for what everyone is accomplishing.\n\nYou can obviously do it all in your sport. The sprints and the distance. But what excites you about doing the 50-km distance race? What's the challenge of it?\n\nThere are so many changes during the race. You can feel really good after 20 km and then you can feel terrible after 30 km. You're going through so many different emotions. That’s the beauty about it. At some point you will be really tired, and at some point you will feel like you are unstoppable. You're two hours staying in your own head. You're just kind of working against yourself on so many levels.\n\nAny fun facts people should know about you?\n\nWhen I prepare myself for a race. I always play my PlayStation. So if you see back here, this is kind of my setup. [Shows gaming desk on video.] During summer, I like to play golf. When I had a couple of training camps in Utah, I always used to bring my golf clubs to be able to play a little bit on the rest days.\n\nI’m sure you can keep your anonymity in Utah, though that may soon change.\n\nYeah, it's definitely a big difference. In Utah, it's easy. No one is recognizing you. I can just do my thing. It's actually very good when it comes to the altitude and all the terrain and everything. Roller skiing and cycling. It's really been a perfect place for me to stay.\n\nWhat's difficult about being a celebrity in Norway?\n\nI wouldn't say that it's difficult. But if you're going to just do your grocery shopping, it's not always that you are feeling at your best, stopping and getting your picture taken and everything. That's part of the game. Sometimes you would like to not get recognized. But on the other hand, I feel really privileged that people are watching our races and following us. It's very important for me to give back. I always try to say yes, because I remember how it was when I was younger. I had someone I looked up to and wanted to take a picture with. I would feel bad if that person didn't stop and say hi.\n\nOK, a few quick ones to wrap up. What’s a bucket-list thing you want to do in life that you haven't done yet?\n\nThat's actually a really hard question. I don't know if it's a bucket list, but the plan is to go to the World Cup. I have a few friends that play on the national team in Norway. So I will travel to New York and then fly out to Boston to see the Norwegian team start their World Cup. That's something I'm really looking forward to.\n\nAre you friends with Erling Haaland?\n\nNot really. We have a few of the same sponsors. But Alexander Sørloth, another striker, is a good friend of mine. We normally have a vacation together every year. So we'll go to watch them, and then hopefully in the summer we'll have a vacation when they're done with the World Cup. Hopefully after a long World Cup for Norway.\n\nWe actually did a cover story on Erling last year, and he talked about how he eats cow heart. Do you eat cow heart too?\n\nOh no. I don't eat cow heart. But it’s kind of the same philosophy. It's all about eating clean. So we're eating clean meats. All of us are trying to optimize our body. The nutrition part is very important. I have this place where I always buy my meat. The next thing is going to be cow hearts, I guess.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge you've had in your life, and how did you overcome it?\n\nOne of the biggest ones was when I was 15. That was when I made my decision that I wanted to do cross-country skiing. And at that time I was around 100 in Norway on the result list. I was really small when I was 15. It was hard to compete against people that were twice as high as I was. I really, really struggled on the races. But I kept being patient and focusing on the thing that I could put my energy on, which was my technique and my balance. It took a couple of years before I started to grow. But when I first started to grow, I was starting to fight for the top positions in my country for my age. And that was nice.\n\nEspecially if you complete the six-gold sweep on Saturday and make more Olympic history, you’re going to be in high demand. Now’s the time to, say, meet anyone in the world you want. Who would you love to meet and spend some time with?\n\nIt would be cool to meet some of the big stars on the PGA Tour.\n\nI know that he's not a part of the PGA tour that much right now, but Tiger Woods is one of the biggest there has ever been. He would definitely be up there.\n\nHave you ever been to the Masters?\n\nNever. That would be one of the coolest things to do.\n\nIf you win, you can request an invite right now to the Augusta National folks.\n\nWell, I hope they read this and do the right thing. You deserve it, Come on, Augusta.\n\nWrite to Sean Gregory at sean.gregory@time.com.",

    "description": "All eyes will be on Team GB's Bruce Mouat, Grant Hardie, Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie on Saturday (18:05 GMT) when they take on Canada with a gold medal at stake at the Winter Olympics.",
    "fullText": "It's a Thursday night in November. A pub in Glasgow's Merchant City. Four men, all about the age of 30, are squeezed around a small table, eating and talking about what the next few months might bring. Nobody recognises them.\n\nThat same pub three months later. Screens showing a Celtic game are changed so the patrons can watch the curling. Almost everyone is anxiously staring at the TVs, willing those same four men to reach a Winter Olympic final.\n\nChances are they will be doing the same on Saturday (18:05 GMT), when Team GB's Bruce Mouat, Grant Hardie, Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie take on Canada with a gold medal at stake.\n\n\"Our gold medal,\" as Mouat referred to it after the epic semi-final win over Switzerland in northern Italy on Thursday - a contest which drew 3.4million viewers to the BBC at its peak.\n\nAnd fulfilling what they believe to be their destiny - by upgrading their silver medal from Beijing four years ago - is what these four Scots have travelled to Cortina to do.\n\nSince that 2022 near miss, Team Mouat have come to dominate men's curling, winning two World Championships and adding another couple of European crowns, as well as a record 12 Grand Slam titles.\n\nAt times, they have been unbeatable.\n\nThat cloak of invincibility slipped during the round-robin stages here - leaving qualification out of their hands - but that fright has now been forgotten, replaced with the return of a clear-eyed focus on the task in hand.\n\nBut who are these four young men who have now caught the country's attention? And what makes them more than the sum of their parts?\n\nGB men into Olympic curling final as women squeezed out\n\nWhat do curlers do when they're not at the Olympics?\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nTo understand the dynamic between the quartet, you have to go back almost nine years to when they first came together as a team.\n\nWith the world of curling being as small as it is, they weren't strangers to each other. Hardie and McMillan are 33-year-old cousins from south-west Scotland. Lammie, 29, hails from there, too, and played in a rink previously with 31-year-old Mouat, who knew the others from their shared school days in Edinburgh.\n\nApproaches were made, conversations had, culminating in a meeting.\n\n\"That first time we met, the thing we wrote at the top of our list of goals was to win Olympic gold,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nAfter that, the die was cast. The boys told British Curling they were only willing to join the elite programme as a unit and not individually. Their ultimatum was accepted, success has followed, and now they are considered the best in the world.\n\nMouat is thought to be among the greatest skips to have played the game. Hardie has a reputation as a high-grade tactician and shot maker, while McMillan and Lammie are credited with reinventing the role of a sweeper.\n\nOnce just 'the lads with the brushes', their physicality has evolved the position to the extent that the curling cognoscenti consider it to now be \"a sweeping game\" rather than a throwing one.\n\nBut it is the coalescence of their personalities that amplifies all that sporting talent. And underpinning the team are two key things - total honesty and trust.\n\nMcMillan says if one of them is being an idiot \"the rest can say so\", while the more-measured Mouat describes it as \"knowing the different things to say to get the best out of each other\".\n\nIndividually, they are all very different.\n\nMcMillan is lively enough for all four of them; Hardie is the logic guy, an engineer by trade; Mouat is thoughtful, reflective and calm - while Lammie is the quiet, reliable presence in the background.\n\nIt might be labelled as 'Team Mouat' - as per the convention of naming a rink after the skip - but this is very much a collective. In fact, Mouat is keen to share the spotlight.\n\n\"Bruce is so compassionate and calm and he's very different from a lot of skips,\" explains BBC Sport pundit and 2022 gold medallist Vicky Wright.\n\n\"A lot of them are clearly the leader but the GB team operates so well because they function on a level playing field.\n\n\"The dynamic they've got works so well because they all bring a different aspect to the table and they all respect that. That's a massive part of why they're so successful.\"\n\nIt's instructive to see how comfortable the four of them are in each other's company and with the position they find themselves in.\n\nAll four - and alternate Kyle Waddell - have been right in among it in Cortina this week, be it stopping for a chat in the street or in restaurants, meeting friends and relatives, watching other British athletes compete. Or - in Mouat's case - going pillowcase shopping and \"spending far too much money\" on the morning of the semi-final.\n\nEven in the moments before that crucial match, there was a relaxed focus about them. McMillan and Hardie were sharing a laugh, Mouat picking out familiar faces in the crowd for a smile and a wave, and Lammie was casually studying the Swiss warming up.\n\nAll of that will culminate on Saturday night in the quirky Cortina Curling Stadium, first built as an open-air venue to host the 1956 Games.\n\nIn a place where history looks down from the wooden bleachers, these four will attempt to make their own by becoming the first GB men's rink in 102 years to win Olympic gold.\n\nAchieve that, and maybe the next time they go into that Glasgow pub they might just draw a few glances of recognition.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

So it’s not really about what they think it’s about.”\n\n“And also, because I win. Like if I wasn’t doing well, I think that they probably wouldn’t care as much, and that’s OK for me.

Some athletes strengthened already impressive legacies, while others seized breakthrough moments that signaled the arrival of new contenders on the Olympic stage. Across sports and nations, the day reflected the universal pursuit of mastery — not just to win, but to perform at one’s absolute limit when it matters most.\n\nSport: Figure Skating — Women’s Singles\nMedal: Gold\n\nLiu delivered a performance that felt both technically masterful and emotionally powerful. Her skating showed remarkable control, blending precision jumps with expressive artistry that held the arena’s attention throughout. After stepping away from competition earlier in her career, her return to the top felt deeply personal and inspiring. This gold medal wasn’t just a victory — it was the culmination of resilience, growth, and renewed passion.\n\nSport: Ice Hockey — Women’s Tournament\nMedal: Gold\n\nTeam USA captured gold with a performance defined by grit, discipline, and relentless pressure. They stayed composed through tense moments and executed with confidence when the game demanded it most. Their victory reflected not just talent, but trust built through years of competing together. It was a championship earned through resilience and unity from the first puck drop to the final celebration.\n\nSport: Ski Mountaineering — Women’s Final\nMedal: Gold\n\nFatton powered through the course with impressive endurance and tactical awareness. Her pacing was disciplined, conserving energy before making decisive moves when it mattered most. She looked completely in control of both terrain and tempo. The gold confirmed her status as one of the premier athletes in ski mountaineering’s Olympic debut era.\n\nSport: Ski Mountaineering — Men’s Sprint\nMedal: Gold\n\nCardona Coll delivered an explosive sprint performance marked by speed and precision. He attacked the course with confidence, maintaining momentum through every technical section. His acceleration in the decisive stretch left no room for doubt. The victory showcased both his physical power and sharp race instincts.\n\nSport: Speed Skating — Men’s 1500m\nMedal: Gold\n\nNing skated a brilliantly controlled race, balancing patience with perfectly timed acceleration. His rhythm never faltered, and each lap built momentum toward a commanding finish. The precision of his pacing showed deep strategic awareness. Crossing the line first felt like the natural result of total composure under pressure.\n\nSport: Nordic Combined — Men’s Team Sprint\nMedal: Gold\n\nOftebro and Skoglund combined strength and synchronization to deliver a dominant team sprint performance. Their transitions were seamless, and each leg built momentum rather than merely maintaining it. They raced with clear trust in one another, executing strategy with precision from start to finish. The gold reflected both individual excellence and perfectly matched teamwork.\n\nThe highlights of February 19 captured the balance of intensity and artistry that defines the Winter Olympics. From commanding victories to emotionally charged breakthroughs, the day added meaningful chapters to the story of these Games. It was a reminder that Olympic success is measured not only in medals, but in moments of excellence that endure long after competition ends.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Former 49ers wide receiver announces immediate retirement from football\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin sends 2-word message after winning Olympic gold medal\n\nMLB: MLBPA chooses Tony Clark’s replacement one day after abrupt resignation\n\nNFL: College quarterback who won 7 Super Bowl rings as NFL executive dies\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Red Sox issue, retract, reissue statement about Fanatics uniform snafu\n\nThe post Highlights from Winter Olympics 2026: Thursday, February 19 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Hess found himself in the middle of a firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics after comments he made regarding representing the U.S. in the current political climate.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — Hunter Hess, the American freestyle skier who unexpectedly found himself in the middle of a social media and political firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics, said he has emerged from “probably the two hardest weeks of my life” after being called a “loser” by President Donald Trump.\n\nHess, who essentially went underground after the controversy exploded, spoke after halfpipe qualifying on Friday. He qualified in fifth place and will be one of four Americans in the 12-person final.\n\n“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen,” Hess said. “I’m not going to let a controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. In my original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn’t take it that way. I’m so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA and ride as much as I can.”\n\nHess was one of several American athletes who were asked prior to the Opening Ceremony how they felt representing the U.S. given current domestic political climate and the ICE raids in Minneapolis and violent clashes with protestors dominating news coverage at that time.\n\nHess acknowledged “mixed emotions,” saying there was “obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of” and talked about representing his values and the things he believes in when he wears the Team USA uniform.\n\n“Just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S,” he said.\n\nThough Hess wasn’t the only American athlete to make comments in that vein, his framing inflamed certain sectors of social media and cable news commentators. Hess acknowledged the backlash in an Instagram post but had not spoken to reporters until Friday about what it’s like to have the president come after you as you prepare to compete in the Olympics.\n\nAfter becoming far more famous than he expected, Hess and some members of the halfpipe team left to train in Switzerland.\n\n“It was pretty distracting,” he said. “I had a week that was pretty challenging. Luckily my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that type of criticism. But with my family's help, I was able to get through it. And skiing has saved my life, time and time again, and it seems to have done so again.”\n\nAsked if he would have made the same comments with the benefit of hindsight, Hess said: “I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough.”",

    "fullText": "What country is AIN? Explaining abbreviation for Russian figure skater at 2026 Winter Olympics originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFigure skating is one of the Winter Olympics' signature offerings. No event within its orbit carries more weight than its last — the women's singles.\n\nWomen's singles has long served a platform for the sport's finest talents to shine. From Katarina Witt's dominance with East Germany in the 1984 and 1988 Games to Tara Lipinski's triumphs in the 1998 tournament, the event is a memorable one, offering a spotlight for the sport's finest talents to flaunt their gifts.\n\nThe 2026 iteration of the competition is no exception. Ami Nakai, Kaori Sakamoto and Alysa Liu are some of the standouts who have captivated the masses thus far. So too has Adeliia Petrosian, an 18-year-old who could compete for a podium place.\n\nWhen she takes to the ice, Petrosian sports an unfamiliar flag — one that includes the \"AIN\" abbreviation on it. Just what is Petrosian's country of origin? And why must she compete under the AIN banner? Here's what you need to know.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\n\"AIN\" is the country code for \"Individual Neutral Athletes\", referred to as Athlètes Individuels Neutres in French. The team consists of Russian and Belarusian athletes who meet several criteria, one of which bars athletes who \"actively support\" Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.\n\nRussian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) banner during the 2022 Winter Olympics, an aftershock of a doping scandal which brought about a two-year ban from all major sporting events.\n\nLike FIFA and UEFA, the IOC swiftly moved to bar Russia and Belarus from international competition following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. They've been inconsistent in their willingness to apply that tactic elsewhere: Israel has fielded teams for the 2024 Summer Olympics and 2026 Winter Olympics despite the country committing a genocide against Palestinians, as laid out by numerous human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, the United Nations and Human Rights Watch.\n\nTwenty athletes are presently playing under the AIN banner, including Petrosian and Nikita Filippov, a Russian ski mountaineer who claimed silver in the men's sprint in 2026.\n\nMORE: What's the story behind Alysa Liu's teeth piercings?\n\nPetrosian hails from Moscow. The 18-year-old is widely considered one of Russia's best skaters, capturing three Russian national championships and three Russian Grand Prix Final titles.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics represents just the second time Petrosian has competed in a senior-level event outside of Russia since 2022. Her performances are artful and athletic, pockmarked by dizzying spins and quadruple jumps, the hardest skill to master in the sport.\n\nHer inclusion on the AIN roster has made her the subject of some controversy. Petrosian has never tested positive for steroids or been implicated in doping. But the ROC had its 2022 team event gold medal stripped when one of Petrosian's training mates, then-15-year-old Kamila Valieva, tested positive for a banned substance thought to improve stamina and endurance.\n\nValieva served a four-year ban as a result of the alleged misdeed. The rest of her team — including coach Eteri Tutberidze and choreographer Daniil Gleikhengauz — were spared punishment. Gleikhengauz is Petrosian's coach at the 2026 Winter Olympics, while Tutberidze — officially serving as one of Georgia's figure skating coaches — reportedly accompanied Petrosian during practices, according to The New York Times.\n\nMORE: Youngest, oldest American Olympians in 2026\n\nPetrosian satisfied the International Skating Union's requirements to return to competition as an unaffiliated athlete. The pathway required athletes to complete several steps. The IOC ruled that AIN athletes had to disavow Russia's war with Ukraine and \"not have any ties to military agencies in their countries,\", according to NBC.\n\nMORE: Explaining the differences between ice dancing and figure skating\n\nRussians have found plenty of success in the women's singles event in the Winter Olympics. They nearly swept the podium places in 2018 and 2022, taking gold and silver in each tournament. However, athletes were unable to perform under Russia's banner following the suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee amid the country's doping scandal.\n\nThe last time a Russian won a medal in the women's singles event while competing for Russia was in 2014, when Adelina Sotnikova outshined Japan's Yuna Kim and Italy's Carolina Kostner for the prize.\n\nMORE:Full guide to figure skating scoring system",

    "fullText": "Any Olympic sport requires rigorous training, preparation and immense talent. Every four years, athletes from across the globe compete in the toughest competitions of their lives for the chance at a medal.\n\nHowever, during Wednesday's women's cross-country skiing team sprint race, it was proven that you don't have to be a superhuman to compete in the Olympics.\n\n🐶\nDuring the competition, which involves a six-mile sprint through the snow, Croatian skier Tena Hadzic was making her final stretch toward the finish line when a Czechoslovakian wolfdog managed to enter the course in Tesero, Italy. The two-year-old dog named Nazgul trailed not far behind Hadzic when he managed to cross the finish line among cheers from fans in the stands.\n\nAfter his triumphant Olympic participation, Nazgul was then captured by race officials and returned to his home at a local bed and breakfast near the track. While some may say Nazgul has an unfair advantage in racing in the snow, his viral moment was the highlight performance for many this Olympic season.\n\nNPR interviewed the owners, who revealed, \"He was crying this morning more than normal because he was seeing us leaving — and I think he just wanted to follow us.\" Describing him as \"stubborn, but very sweet,\" Nazgul was reported safe and unharmed during his Olympic run, not before posing for his unofficial bronze medal performance.\n\nAlthough the incident occurred in the midst of a preliminary qualifying round, the top medal contenders had already concluded their participation by the time Nazgul arrived, ensuring no official medal contention was jeopardized.\n\nHadzic also revealed to NPR that although it did cost \"some seconds,\" the entire ordeal was not a \"big deal, because I'm not fighting for medals or anything big.\"\n\nOther athletes, like Greece's Konstantina Charalampidou, told ESPN, \"He was chasing the camera that goes up and down the finish line. He was cute but not aggressive. I wanted to pet him, but I didn't have the time, and I couldn't find him afterwards.\"\n\nWhile it looks like Nazgul won't be returning to fight for an official podium finish, many pet parents are starting to gear up their own pets for the potential of a Pet Olympics in the future, where Nazgul may defend his title.\n\nIn the meantime, the Olympics organization has released Nazgul's photo finish as a testament to his participation in the Olympics, a feat that not many humans will be able to replicate.",

    "fullText": "Rapid uphill sprinting with skis on, lung-busting runs up steps with boots on and a downhill ski race to the finish line.\n\nThe new Winter Olympic sport of ski mountaineering - or skimo for short - made its highly anticipated debut on Thursday in blizzard conditions in Bormio.\n\nSwitzerland's Marianne Fatton added Olympic gold to her world title in the women's sprint event and France's Emily Harrop, who could have competed for Team GB, took silver.\n\n\"It's a magical day. It's history for our sport, and for us as athletes, and it's wonderful,\" said Fatton.\n\n\"It was so emotional. I was like, 'did I really do it?' It was amazing, and I was totally exhausted after the race.\"\n\nSpain's Oriol Cardona Coll took top spot in the men's sprint, the nation's first gold medal at a Winter Olympics in 54 years with their previous one won by Alpine skier Francisco Fernandez Ochoa at Sapporo in 1972.\n\nSilver in the men's event went to Russian athlete Nikita Filippov, who was competing under the neutral banner.\n\nDespite the relentless snowfall, fans poured in and lined the course to cheer on the athletes at the nearly sold-out event with much intrigue surrounding the sport's inaugural Olympic appearance.\n\nSpectators who had braved the conditions were treated to a thrilling competition as athletes pushed themselves to the limit to hike to the top of the hill then ski back down.\n\nThe first new sport added to the Winter Olympics since snowboarding in 1998, skimo is rooted in the 19th Century, before lifts to take skiers up mountains had been invented.\n\nThe sprint events consist of both an ascent and descent, with athletes sprinting uphill with skins on their skis to provide traction, navigating a diamond-shaped obstacle on their way up to a stairway in the mountain.\n\nThey then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot, before a further uphill section on skis.\n\nOnce they reach the top of the course, they remove the skins, and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThe average duration of a race is about three minutes.\n\nThe speed and format of the competition meant fans were quickly invested in the absorbing contest and generated a lively atmosphere.\n\nBBC commentator Matt Chilton said: \"The ski mountaineering event has been so well-received.\n\n\"Televisually, it is superb. For the [in person] fans, they can see everything from the grand stand. They don't miss a moment watching the action directly and on the big screen.\"\n\nSimilar to the summer Olympic sport of triathlon, the transitions are key to a successful race.\n\nThat is ultimately what let Harrop down as she struggled in the second transition, getting the skins caught instead of ripping them off in one clean motion.\n\nHarrop has English parents and could have represented Team GB but opted to compete for France, where she was born and bred.\n\nShe had topped both her heat and semi-final and looked on course for gold in the final but, after the second transition, was trailing behind Fatton and could not catch up on the downhill segment.\n\n\"It means a lot. When I look back to when I started the sport, it wasn't even on the (Olympic) programme,\" Harrop, who started out as an Alpine skier, said.\n\n\"I had an Olympic dream when I was an Alpine skier, and then when I stopped, it was just game over. So now to be here on this stage is mad.\n\n\"The atmosphere is good. The slope itself isn't super technical, but today they made the downhill a little bit more technical than usual, so that was fun.\"\n\nA mixed relay event will take place on Saturday, where one man and woman from each nation completes two laps of the course each with a race typically lasting 30-40 minutes.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Since leaving Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp has been making the most of his break from football management, taking some time to relax away from the touchline.\n\nThis week, he was seen ringing the bell at the Winter Olympics, continuing to enjoy life without the demands of daily training and matches.\n\nDespite his intention to step away from management following his 2024 departure from Liverpool, Klopp has still found himself linked to several high-profile jobs.\n\nRecent reports have suggested he could be in line for one of the vacant roles at either Chelsea or Manchester United. There were even claims that both clubs had reached out to his representatives over a possible return.\n\nBut according to Fabrizio Romano, both clubs have now denied those rumours.\n\nIn a recent update on his YouTube channel, Romano said he has spoken directly with both clubs regarding the speculation.\n\nAccording to him, while both clubs respect what Klopp has achieved, neither made any formal move to bring him in.\n\nRomano explained: “When contacted, both clubs – Manchester United and Chelsea – are playing down those reports, saying that nothing really happened with Jurgen Klopp apart from the admiration they have for one of the best managers in the world.”\n\n“Both clubs absolutely announce that they never had any advanced or concrete negotiations to appoint Jurgen Klopp.”\n\nChelsea have already filled their managerial vacancy by hiring Liam Rosenior. But with United still searching for their next manager, it wouldn’t be a surprise if talk about Klopp resurfaces later in the summer.\n\nReal Madrid are another club who could be looking for a permanent manager this summer, having brought in former Liverpool defender Alvaro Arbeloa as an interim coach. Despite the speculation, Romano says there’s nothing developing between Klopp and the Spanish club.\n\n“On the future of Jurgen Klopp, don’t forget that he’s still very busy with the Red Bull project, still focused on that,” he said.\n\n“With Real Madrid, I keep telling you guys, let’s see what happens with Arbeloa because he’s doing a very good job now. Second step, Jurgen Klopp has some people in the Real Madrid board appreciating him a lot, but at the moment I’m not aware of concrete talks. That’s the status as of today.”\n\nKlopp remains one of football’s most respected figures and could likely walk into any role he wanted. But so far, he’s kept to his word about taking time away from coaching.\n\nWhy PSG passed on Jeremy Jacquet before £60m Liverpool switch\n\nHow Anthony Gordon’s record pace could transform Arne Slot’s Liverpool frontline\n\nJadon Sancho sidesteps question about Liverpool legend during Paris date with Saweetie",

    "fullText": "MILAN — In the immediate aftermath of Sidney Crosby leaving a game because of injury, Jon Cooper said he didn't know Crosby's status and noted, \"I don't even have my poker face on.\"\n\nIt was back on the next day, as Cooper declined to give a definitive answer on the status of Canada's men's hockey team captain, who did not partake in an optional practice on Feb. 19. However, Cooper did not rule him out for the remainder of the 2026 Winter Olympics, which at most would be two games. Canada plays a semifinal game against Finland on Feb. 20 at Milan Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. Win or lose, there's a medal game next.\n\n\"Sid is by no means ruled out of the tournament,\" Cooper said. \"We’ve got the best of the best looking at him. We’re taking this day by day. And we’re not going to put anyone in harm’s way. But if he can play, he’s definitely going to. We’ll know \n\nCanada needed overtime to advance out of a quarterfinal match against Czechia, and had to make do for more than half of it without Crosby.\n\nCrosby was injured on a hard hit from Czechia's Radko Gudas, with Crosby's right leg buckling as he went down. He was also crunched by Martin Necas. Crosby hobbled to Canada's bench, then down the tunnel, and did not return.\n\nInstead, he addressed his teammates during the second intermission, when it was 2-2, essentially urging them to go get the victory.\n\n\"There was a lot more than that,\" Cooper said. \"You know, he's a true leader.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sidney Crosby injury update: Canada’s hockey captain not ruled out at Olympics",

    "description": "Granlund's Finland surges toward Olympic glory, while Gudas and Dostal's medal hopes end in a thrilling quarterfinal overtime loss.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Olympic Games are coming to an end, as all four men’s hockey quarterfinals were played on Wednesday.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks had three players in action: Lukas Dostal (Czechia), Radko Gudas (Czechia), and Mikael Granlund (Finland). Damian Clara’s Italy squad was eliminated on Tuesday, and Jackson LaCombe was a healthy scratch for the fourth consecutive game for the United States.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas, Dostal Advance with Czechia, Clara Eliminated with Italy\n\nFrank Vatrano Talks Shoulder Injury and Tough Season\n\nWith the way the qualifying games shook out after the preliminary round, Czechia found themselves facing Canada for the second time in five games. They had lost 5-0 to open the tournament and were more prepared to face the gold-medal favorite in the quarterfinals.\n\nAn evenly-played first period saw Czechia take a 2-1 lead into the second period, and Canada handily controlled the majority of possession from there. Behind astute interior defending from Gudas and the blueline, Dostal made a handful of big saves and gave his team a chance to win.\n\nOndrej Palat gave Czechia a 3-2 lead late in the third period, but it was answered by Nick Suzuki four minutes later, and the game was sent to overtime, where Mitch Marner advanced Canada to the semis after a minute and a half of OT.\n\nGudas made his presence felt early and often on the defensive side of the puck, not only by providing his trademark physical play, but with keen anticipation skills that disrupted several Canadian attacks through the neutral zone.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those neutral zone pressures sent Canada captain Sidney Crosby to the locker room for the remainder of the game with a lower-body injury. Gudas stepped up on Crosby, as an outlet in the second period, and Crosby seemingly attempted to dodge the hit, but folded on his right leg in an unfortunate way. No penalty was called on the ice.\n\nGudas had an up-and-down tournament, but saved his best hockey for when it mattered most in today’s game. Gudas finished this game with an assist, a high-skilled play where he picked off a cross-ice neutral zone pass and turned it the other way, starting a 3v2. He also registered two penalty minutes and two shots on goal in 19:57 TOI.\n\nHe finished his second, and what will likely be his last, Olympic Games with a point (an assist) in five games played, but he won’t bring a medal home with him.\n\nMuch like the rest of the tournament and his entire 2025-26 season with the Anaheim Ducks, Dostal played very well. However, “very well” is below the superhuman level he needed to perform at if he was to carry his Czech team to the podium at these Olympics.\n\nAs mentioned, he did enough to earn a win in this game, but he didn’t solely win the game for Czechia. He brought his entire arsenal to this quarterfinal matchup: perfect lateral puck tracking, powerful pushes when pucks moved from the goal line to the slot or dots, and terrific rebound control.\n\nThe element that stood out most this tournament, with Czechia’s suspect blueline as a whole, was his ability to knock down dump-ins and individually start breakouts with pinpoint outlets to his defensemen or wingers up the wall.\n\nDostal finished this game by saving 37 of the 41 shots he faced for a .902 SV%. He finished his first Olympic Games medal-less, sporting a 1-3-0 record, and an .886 SV%.\n\nSwitzerland gave Finland quite the scare, as Switzerland had been one of the more impressive and cohesive teams in this tournament, even without the services of star forward Kevin Fiala. Switzerland got a pair of goals late in the first period of what was a high-intensity back-and-forth affair.\n\nSebastian Aho and MIro Heiskanen dashed the Swiss’s hopes of winning in regulation with a pair of late goals that sent the game to overtime, as the Finnish firepower proved too overwhelming and unrelenting for Switzerland. On the ropes, the Finnish coaching staff threw their forward lines into a blender halfway through the game with hopes of igniting a comeback, and they were eventually rewarded.\n\nFinland captain and Ducks’ forward Mikael Granlund started the game in the spot where he started the tournament: on the left wing of Roope Hintz and opposite Mikko Rantanen. As lines were tinkered with, he played with Sebastian Aho and Tuevo Teravainen for a stretch in the second, and played most of the third with Hintz and Kaapo Kakko. It will be curious to monitor how the lines shake out for Finland’s all-important semi-final game against Canada on Friday.\n\nHe was mostly a non-factor on the top line, but provided linemates with steady defensive habits, typically as an F3. When lines began to mix, he earned more puck touches, made several connecting plays to advance pucks up ice, and displayed elite edges multiple times when breaking down defenders along the offensive wall.\n\nGranlund finished this game scoreless with four shots on goal in 20:12 TOI, third-most among Finnish forwards.\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Dostal, Gudas, Czechia Drop Overtime Game to Switzerland, LaCombe Scratched for Third Straight\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Granlund's Finland Dismantles Clara's Italy, LaCombe Scratched for USA\n\nDucks at the Winter Olympics: Gudas Defeats France with Czechia, Granlund Assists in Finland Win Against Rival Sweden",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin not only battled her opponents but Father Time at the 2026 Olympics.\n\nWith her gold medal in slalom, she became the youngest and oldest American ever to win Olympic gold in the event. She first won at 18, and her 2026 victory came at 30.\n\nThe Olympics are the pinnacle of sport, contested on a global stage. Physical fitness is paramount, and Shiffrin will be 34 years old when the next Winter Games arrive.

A lot could change over the next four years, and she would still have to qualify for her events if she does choose to compete.\n\nAfter winning her gold medal in slalom, Shiffrin kept her reaction short and to the point.\n\n— Mikaela Shiffrin ⛷️ (@MikaelaShiffrin) February 18, 2026\n\nBefore winning her gold medal, Shiffrin had been struggling, continually coming up short in events since taking fourth in the 2018 Olympics. She said, \"The irony is I've cared so much about wanting everybody to know the reality and to not want to answer those questions and to be so sick and tired of it. And I’ve felt that way since (being) fourth in South Korea in the slalom.\" And then about the win she said, \"In order to do this today, I kind of needed to accept the possibility that those questions would keep coming. It was like, just don't resist it. Just live in my own moment.”\n\nThe gold medal win moved Shiffrin into a tie with Shaun White and Kaillie Humphries for second-most gold medals for American athletes at the Winter Olympics. She now has four total medals in alpine skiing, which moves her into a tie for most in the event by an American woman.\n\nAbout competing, Shiffrin said, \"The reality of our sport is you lose a lot more than you win. When you look back on my career, I know statistics and everything, but still I've definitely lost a lot more than I've won. So that's the one thing that's certain is that you're not going to win everything.”\n\nShe hasn't committed to her future, but has acknowledged that her career can't continue forever. She said, \"The one thing that's certain is that that wave's going to stop. You don't get to ride that wave forever.\"\n\nMORE: Mikaela Shiffrin snaps Olympics drought with historically dominant slalom gold",

    "fullText": "Amber Glenn is sharing her current mood after a disappointing short program at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics\n\nThe Texas native popped out of a triple jump and dropped to 13th place\n\nGlenn, a mental health advocate, shared two positive messages on social media on Wednesday\n\nAmber Glenn says she is “coping well” one day after skating a disappointing short program that landed her in 13th place at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nOn Tuesday, Feb. 17, the Team USA skater, 26, started strong, landing her triple axel. But she flubbed a jump when she popped out of a triple toe loop, which hurt her final score.\n\nAfterwards, Glenn was seemingly inconsolable as she tearfully skated off the ice to the kiss-and-cry area where she received her score, 67.39, more than 11 points off the lead.\n\nThe following day, the Plano, Texas native shared two posts on social media that gave a status update on her current mood on the eve of Thursday’s final.\n\n“Landing my highest scoring 3Axel,” she wrote over a video of herself celebrating, before she then hung her head, “Messing up the last jump and getting it invalidated.”\n\n“I'm coping well thanks for asking 🤪” Glenn captioned the TikTok.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn her Instagram Stories, the U.S. national champ shared an adorable image of a dog wearing a baseball cap with an inspirational message.\n\n“The world has ended for me many times and yet tomorrow still comes. Keep going,” the post read.\n\nComing into the Olympics, Glenn was a favorite, having earned eight individual first-place finishes since 2024. The athlete, an outspoken mental health advocate, has also won the last three U.S. championships, according to NBC Sports.\n\nDuring the Games, she won a gold medal as part of the team skating event.\n\nWhen she skated off the ice in Milan on Tuesday, commentator Tara Lipinski articulated what many fans were thinking.\n\n“This is heartbreaking to watch,” the 1998 Winter Olympics gold medalist said.\n\nTeammate Alysa Liu’s short program was a success, landing her in third place going into Thursday, but it was Glenn’s emotional state that was on her mind.\n\n“She’s gone through so much and she works so friggen’ hard, like genuinely, such a hard worker and she’s overcome a lot,” Liu told reporters, including PEOPLE. “I just want her to be happy. That’s genuinely all I want. And so I’ll be seeing her later, don’t worry guys. We’ll stick together.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

The minimalist silhouette was paired with metallic pointed-toe heels and added a reflective pop that complements the modern architectural backdrop.

It was a third big hit Crosby took in the period after Gudas and Palát connected on checks with the Team Canada captain.\n\nCrosby recovered and took a stride following the Gudas and Nečas hit, but he was seen shaking his right leg before exiting the ice. After being attended to on Canada's bench, Crosby limped down the tunnel to the locker room. He did not return to the bench for the rest of the game.\n\nCzechia was leading 2-1 at the time of Crosby's injury.",

Gymnast Carlos Yulo won two gold medals at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd now Alpine skier Tallulah Proulx has become the first female athlete from the Philippines to compete in the Winter Olympics — and at 17, the youngest ever from the Southeast Asian country.\n\n“This is a new era for the Philippines and sports on the global stage and I really am grateful that I get to be a part of it,” the U.S.-born Proulx said as she finished 50th in the slalom at the Milan Cortina Games on Wednesday after carrying her country’s flag during the opening ceremony.\n\nShe was 52nd in the giant slalom.\n\nProulx grew up skiing at the Sierra Tahoe resort in California, then moved at age 7 to Iowa and raced at tiny Sundown Mountain before moving on Colorado and then settling in Park City, Utah, where she now resides.\n\nProulx’s father is from the Eastern Samar province in the Philippines’ Eastern Visayas region.\n\n“And I have a lot of relatives, family back there and honestly the response has been so heartwarming,” Proulx said. “Filipinos are just such warm and welcoming people. … I think that’s what makes us really strong and I’m so grateful that I get to be the first Filipina because I show that others can follow in my footsteps and hopefully get more involved into winter sports, which I know is quite hard in the Philippines.”\n\nProulx was slated to visit the Philippines for the first time a few years ago before her trip got canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, she has emersed herself in the country’s culture, thanks to her grandmother.\n\n“Me and my brother grew up with her cooking — all of course the delicious Filipino food and sharing her culture,” Proulx said. “Unfortunately, last year she passed away. … I really wanted to push for this and wanted to represent such an important part of my heritage, both for her and for myself.”\n\nIn Cortina, Proulx traded pins with American slalom standout Paula Moltzan and got a picture with slalom gold medalist Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n“It’s amazing being around these people that I’ve looked up to my whole life,” she said, “and then realize I’m skiing that course next.”\n\nNext up for Proulx: a trip to the Philippines.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Over four decades after the 1984 Winter Olympics, Sarajevo is contending with what to do with its Olympic venues. Many are abandoned and crumbling.",
    "fullText": "Over 40 years ago, the Yugoslavian city of Sarajevo hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics. Many new structures were built, and the Games were seen as something of a reunion since many countries had boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow.\n\nBut six years later, the country would be thrown into turmoil during the Yugoslav Wars, which led to the fall of Yugoslavia. Sarajevo became the capital of a new country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1992, but the fighting didn't end until 2001.\n\nDuring the fighting, Olympic venues became battlegrounds, with ski slopes heavily mined and hotels turned into prisons.\n\nWhile Sarajevo's story is singular, it's not the only former Olympics host city where venues now resemble ghost towns. Olympics host countries famously pour millions of dollars into building new venues, which sometimes fall into disrepair after the crowds have gone home.\n\nMilan Cortina, the host of this year's Olympics, hopes to avoid this costly mistake.\n\n\"The Games are capitalizing on existing infrastructure and local winter sports expertise, aiming to create lasting socio-economic benefits for the local population,\" said Marie Sallois, the IOC director for sustainability.\n\nOf the 13 venues being used across northern Italy, 11 either already exist or are set to be torn down after the games. The country only needed to construct two new permanent venues, per the IOC.\n\nHere's what the 1984 Sarajevo Olympic venues look like in 2026.\n\nThe 1984 Games were the first Winter Olympics to be held in a socialist state and the second consecutive Games to be held in a socialist country after the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\nA destroyed hotel at Mount Igman, where events including ski jumping were held in 1984, is pictured in 2014.\n\nThis is what the bobsled track looked like in 2014 — it's been almost completely left to nature.\n\nSylvia Hui at the Associated Press wrote that year, \"Today, the abandoned concrete construction looks like a skeleton littered with graffiti.\"\n\nNPR reported the Bosnian war led to 100,000 deaths and the \"worst atrocities in Europe since World War II.\"\n\nAccording to Getty, 10 years after the Winter Olympics, \"the hotel was turned into a prison and place of execution for Bosnian Muslims — all overseen by Serb Forces.\"\n\nEven the medal podium was turned into an execution site, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAccording to Getty, \"The area around the 90-meter hill was heavily mined during the Bosnian war.\"\n\nMoss and debris cover the jumps.\n\nThese Olympic rings have fallen into disrepair.\n\nEast Germany's Jens Weißflog and Finland's Matti Nykänen each took home gold medals in ski jumping that year.\n\n\"The remains of destroyed restaurants, hotels, sports facilities and mountain huts were left to rot and the thousands of mines were cleared at a painstakingly slow pace\" after the war ended, The Guardian wrote in 2018.\n\nA photo from 2015 shows downhill bikers using the bobsled tracks for training.\n\nThe walls are covered in tags and street art.\n\nThe track on Mount Trebević was covered in snow when it was photographed in January 2018.\n\nThe cable car follows the same route today as it did during the Olympics.\n\n\"The mountain has slowly returned to something like its former self,\" The Guardian wrote in 2018. \"Hotels, restaurants and cafes have been rebuilt, mines swept away and hikers from all over Sarajevo visit en masse.\"\n\nA wartime cemetery was built right next to the Zetra Olympic Hall.\n\nFollowing the war, the Zetra Ice Hall was rebuilt in 1997 and reopened in 1999. It's still in use and is now known as the Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic Hall.\n\nIn 2024, some of the slopes remain abandoned. Olympics branding, like these rings, was still visible.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarajevo isn't the only city that has to reckon with abandoned Olympic venues. There are empty stadiums all over the world.",
