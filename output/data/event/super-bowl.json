    "description": "A look at what color Gatorade was dumped on the winning coach at Super Bowl 60. Did Mike Vrabel or Mike Macdonald get the bath?",
    "fullText": "Gatorade rose to prominence in the early 1990s due, in part, to a commercial titled “Be Like Mike,” featuring Michael Jordan. A quarter of a century later, two coaches named Mike are facing off on the Super Bowl stage, and there’s a great chance one of them winds up being drenched in Gatorade tonight.\n\nEither the Seahawks’ Mike Macdonald or the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel will likely get the traditional Gatorade shower tonight at Levi’s Stadium. We will post the results of the Super Bowl 60 Gatorade color as soon as the electrolytes hit the turf this evening.\n\nWe will soon have the Super Bowl Gatorade color results. Be sure to check back here immediately after the game to see which color cashed.\n\nThere is so much chaos in the closing minutes and immediate aftermath of the Super Bowl that TV cameras can often miss the Gatorade bath.\n\nThis occurred in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl LV. CBS cameras missed Bucs head coach Bruce Arians getting doused, and there were many minutes of speculation online regarding which color landed on his head.\n\nA video from the stadium went viral shortly after the conclusion of the game, revealing that Arians was drenched in blue Gatorade.\n\nBlue was a favorite heading into this year’s game, as it owned +260 Gatorade color odds. Only orange had shorter odds.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl matchup does not have much background when it comes to Gatorade baths. There is no prior video of Macdonald or Vrabel being hit with a Gatorade bath, as neither has reached the Super Bowl as a head coach before.\n\nNeither was hit with a Gatorade bath in their respective conference championship game this year, either.\n\nHere is a look at what Gatorade color payouts would look like on a $10 bet. Payouts are the total amount you would receive in return on a winning bet. So it’s the $10 you bet upfront plus the amount you actually won.\n\nYellow/Green/Lime (+260): $36.00\n\nNo Gatorade Bath (+5000): $510.00\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "The Super Bowl often features offensive fireworks, but we’ve seen a few that have been defensive battles. Here are the 3 lowest scoring.",
    "fullText": "If you were expecting a defensive affair in Super Bowl LX, the first half has lived up to the billing.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks scored a field goal on their opening drive of the game to take a 3-0 lead, but that has been half of the scoring so far as the first half of Super Bowl LX draws to a close with the Seahawks leading the New England Patriots by just 6-0 thanks to two field goals from Jason Myers late in the second quarter.\n\nSo that has us thinking: What are the three lowest scoring Super Bowls in Super Bowl history?\n\nSuper Bowl IX was played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings. Similar to Super Bowl LX, the first half of Super Bowl IX was a true defensive struggle, as the only points came for Pittsburgh on a safety when Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was taken down in his own end zone.\n\nThe opening kickoff of the second half was fumbled by Minnesota fullback Bill Brown, giving the Steelers incredible field position. Pittsburgh capped off their next possession with a touchdown run from Franco Harris to give Pittsburgh a 9-0 lead.\n\nThe Steelers would go on to win by a final score of 16-9, for a total of 22 points.\n\nSuper Bowl VII capped off a perfect 17-0 season for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nBut interestingly enough, it might be most remembered for how Washington scored their only points of the game, coming on this botched field goal attempt from Miami.\n\nGaro Yepremian’s gaffe aside, the Dolphins took the win, and to date the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\nThat is a total of just 21 points.\n\nInterestingly enough, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history featured the Patriots as well.\n\nTom Brady’s final Super Bowl win with New England came in Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams. While Jared Goff and company had chances, the Rams offense never found the end zone. New England scored the lone touchdown of the game on a short plunge from Sony Michel, and wide receiver Julian Edelman — who caught 10 passes for 141 yards — took home Super Bowl MVP.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl 60 is officially underway, with the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks trading blows for the Lombardi Trophy. On one side is Sam Darnold, a veteran whose career has shifted gears over the past two seasons. On the other is Drake Maye, the second-year quarterback who’s brought some life back to a franchise that got used to yearly Super Bowl trips under Tom Brady.\n\nThe stakes are clear, and the energy inside Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara shows it. But as much as fans are locked into what’s happening on the field, something else has taken over social media. Food. One specific item has blown up online.\n\nMORE: NFL WAGs turn heads on Sports Illustrated swimsuit covers ahead of Super Bowl 60\n\nBefore kickoff, a burger priced at $180 started making the rounds on social media. The reactions have been a mix of disbelief and jokes. Fans better have come hungry, because this is not some casual snack. They also better not have left their wallets at home.\n\nLevy Restaurants made just 200 of what they’re calling the LX Hammer Burger for Super Bowl Sunday. It’s a loaded cheeseburger with braised bone-in beef shank, roasted mirepoix demi-glace, and blue cheese fondue spilling over the sides.

Most people online cannot get past the price, calling it another case of Super Bowl excess.\n\nOne fan wrote, “I’d rather bite my thumb off and eat it rather than paying 180 for that. There is no doubts that the burger might be tasty, but for 180, nah. I’m expecting wagyu beef for that sum.”\n\nAnother commented, “At that price they can keep it\n\nalways eat somewhere other than the stadium!”\n\nThe most expensive concession item at Super Bowl LX is a $180 beef shank burger that feeds 4 people\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) February 8, 2026\n\nSomeone else wrote, “Mortgage just for a burger.”\n\nAnother fan added, “The majority of the people that would buy these aren’t sitting in a regular seat. They’ll be in a luxury box.”\n\nOne other fan chimed in, “Stop trying to normalize expensive concessions. I could doordash everything you see here, with a full 3 course meal and it’d cost half the price.”\n\nOne more fan wrote, “I know they need to make some margin but the markup on this is astronomical, even for stadium food.”\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL fans can’t believe the price of this Super Bowl 60 burger appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "If it's points you crave, then this Super Bowl will likely not be for you. The 45.5-point total for Seahawks vs. Patriots is the lowest Super Bowl Over/Under in 10 years.\n\nThat said, our Super Bowl predictions won't rule out some fireworks this Sunday night at Levi's Stadium based on recent Big Game history. Each of the past three Super Bowls have gone Over the total.\n\nBelow, we will deliver the Seahawks vs. Patriots final score, and the results for whether or not the Super Bowl total went Over or Under the number.\n\nWe will post the answer to the question of whether the Super Bowl total went Over or Under as soon as the final score is set in stone.\n\nUntil then, here are some nuggets of information regarding the total for Super Bowl 60, and Super Bowl odds history.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots were both Top 10 scoring teams this season. Seattle ranked second overall in team scoring, behind only the LA Rams. Mike Macdonald’s team scored an impressive 29.2 points per game this season.\n\nNew England, meanwhile, ranked eighth in the NFL in points scored — putting up 27.2 ppg. In this year’s playoffs, the Seahawks have had a relatively easy time producing points, while it’s been a slog for the Pats.\n\nThe Seahawks put up 41 points in the Divisional Round against the 49ers, and then scored 31 points against the Rams in the NFC Championship game.\n\nMike Vrabel’s squad has had the unfortunate task of dealing with three of the top-ranked defenses in the NFL in their first three games of this postseason. The Pats scored just 16 points against the Chargers in the Wild Card round, 28 points against the Texans in the Divisional Round, and then scored only 10 points against the Broncos in the AFC Championship game.\n\nBoth the Seahawks and Patriots went Over the total in more games than not this season. The Pats have an Over record of 12-8-0 this season. Seattle, meanwhile, has an Over record of 11-8-0.\n\nDrake Maye and the Patriots have gone Under the total in two of their three playoff games played this winter. Chargers versus Patriots had a total of 45.5 and the two teams combined for just 19 points in the Wild Card round.\n\nTexans versus Patriots had a total of 40.5 points and the two teams combined for 44 points. This past round against the Broncos, the total was 42 points and the two teams combined for a measly 17 points.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, they went Over the total in each of their two playoff games this winter. Against the 49ers in the Divisional Round, the total was set at 44.5. The game went Over as the two teams combined for 48 points.\n\nIn the NFC title game, the Over/Under was 44.5 and the two teams rang up 58 points together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

On second and 7 from his own 10-yard line, Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton lost the ball and had to fall on it in the Vikings' end zone. He was touched by Steelers defensive end Dwight White, who was credited with the sack.\n\nIt was the first safety ever in a Super Bowl, giving Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead that stood at halftime. The Steelers went on to defeat the Vikings 16-6 for their first of four Super Bowl wins in a six-year stretch.\n\nFollowing the 2018 season, the Patriots led the Rams 3-0 at the intermission of Super Bowl LIII, the second-lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history, on a 42-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski early in the second quarter.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Despite coming off a four-win season and changing head coaches a year ago, the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nLed by Mike Vrabel and MVP-caliber quarterback Drake Maye, they finished the regular season with a 14-3 record and as the second seed in the AFC playoff picture. As such, they went on to beat the Chargers, Texans and Broncos to punch their ticket to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThere, the NFC’s top seed awaits. The Seattle Seahawks reached the Super Bowl by going 14-3 themselves, and by subsequently beating two division rivals — the 49ers and Rams — in the playoffs.\n\nNow, the two teams meet in Santa Clara with the Vince Lombardi Trophy at play.\n\nHere are our updates live from Levi’s Stadium.\n\nSunday, Feb. 8, 6:30 p.m. ET | Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, CA | Broadcast information | Inactives | Game day roster\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and deferred, putting the defense on the field first to start Super Bowl 60. After a first down run by Kenneth Walker to move the chains, Sam Darnold found a pair of downfield completions to move inside the red zone. New England’s defense then held strong from there to force a field goal. [Patriots 0 : 3 Seahawks]\n\nNew England’s first drive of the day started with three straight touches for Rhamondre Stevenson, including a third-down conversion through the air. After a 12-yard scramble by Maye then set up a 3rd-and-9 after a sack, a blitz off the blindside resulted in a throwaway and punt.\n\nSeattle’s next drive started back up at their own 10-yard line. Immediately facing a 3rd-and-6, Darnold escaped a blitzing Jaylinn Hawkins but missed a wide open Jaxon Smith-Njigba downfield forcing a punt.\n\nA play-action under center pass out of six their O-line group to Kayshon Boutte started the Patriots next drive with a 21-yard gain. Two straight touches to TreVeyon Henderson then set up a 3rd-and-15, where a Seattle blitz got home again for a sack. New England then punted again.\n\nBehind another good punt by Bryce Baringer and coverage by Dell Pettus, Seattle again started inside their own 20. Two run stuffs then set up a 3rd-and-7, where a check down to Barner moved the chains. A big TFL by Craig Woodson and then a pass breakup got Seattle back into a 3rd-and-15 in which Darnold’s pass was incomplete leading to a punt.\n\nNew England continued to struggle to move the football on their next drive, as an incompletion to an open Hunter Henry was followed by a third-down run stop on Stevenson. New England punted again.\n\nFollowing a big time pass breakup downfield by Christian Gonzalez, running back Kenneth Walker found the edge to break free for 30 yards. Two plays later, Walker found running room again escaping for 29 more to move inside the red zone. With Seattle then facing a 3rd-and-12, a pitch to Walker went for a loss again thanks to Woodson. New England forced another field goal. [Patriots 0 : 6 Seahawks]\n\nWith the deficit now six, a long developing second-down sack forced the Patriots into a 3rd-and-17, where a screen to Stefon Diggs went for just five and another punt.\n\nKenneth Walker picked up a pair of first downs to get the Seahawks over midfield. A third down incompletion to Walker then forced a punt by Seattle, which was downed at the 2-yard line.\n\nBacked up on their own end zone, Maye converted a big third-down to DeMario Douglas for a nine-yard gain. Back in a third-and-long after a false start by Will Campbell, Maye uncorked one downfield in a muddy pocket that fell incomplete to Mack Hollins.\n\nWorking over midfield prior to the two-minute warning, Seattle converted a 3rd-and-2 on the ground with 32 seconds remaining. Set up with another 3rd-and-short after using their final timeouts, Darnold’s pass to JSN in the end zone was broken up and nearly intercepted by Gonzalez. New England then held to another field goal.\n\nWith six seconds left in the half, Drake Maye took a knee.",

    "description": "The Patriots coach fell short of Canton in his first year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has expressed admiration for the New England Patriots dynasty in the past, so it was little surprise what he thought about Bill Belichick's Pro Football Hall of Fame snub.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News in an interview conducted Wednesday and aired on Super Bowl Sunday, the president complained about the longtime Patriots coach failing to reach Canton in his first year of eligibility:\n\n\"I thought it was terrible. I mean, he's— won so much, won so many Super Bowls. Great coach. Became a little bit controversial, I guess, after that, this little period after that. During it he was just a great coach. I thought it was very inappropriate.\n\n\"Oh yeah. It's like what have you done for me lately? Well, you know, you have a great career and he has a little bit of a controversial year and a half, two years maybe. But— what difference does that make? No, he should've— he should be in there right at the top.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first person to rail against the snub. He refers twice to \"controversial\" actions on Belichick's part, which could be a reference to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that occurred under the coach's watch. However, he alludes to those controversial years being after Belichick's NFL career so he might simply be referring to the 73-year-old's post-Patriots UNC-Jordon Hudson era.\n\nRegardless, Belichick's snubs came down to more than controversies. As one of the few Belichick \"no\" voters laid out, the matter of voting Belichick was more than \"yes\" or \"no.\" To some, it was \"Belichick\" or \"a group of senior players who might not get another Hall of Fame shot for years.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame's voting process created conditions in which the NFL's all-time leader in playoff wins among head coaches was put in competition for a limited number of votes with three senior players and a contributor, in this case Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThis year, the only one of that quintet to emerge was former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, who was recognized on the field at Super Bowl LX alongside modern-era inductees Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri.",

    "fullText": "Who cares about the 2026 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks? Most football fans are already looking to next year, and hoping their team can make the surprising leap that New England and Seattle did this season.\n\nThe Seahawks’ were No. 19 in the preseason Super Bowl odds this season. The Patriots were No. 21 in the preseason Super Bowl odds. The NFL is king in part because almost every team starts each season with the belief that they can win the championship if everything goes according to plan. Parity is going stronger than ever in the modern game, and the 2025-26 season is all the evidence you need.\n\nIt’s never too early to look ahead to next year. Here’s every team’s Super Bowl LXI odds a year out before the game is played in SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on Feb. 14, 2027. My favorite bets are included after the table.\n\nChicago Bears (+2700): The Bears are due for some regression to the mean in terms of forcing turnovers next year. Chicago’s 22 takeaways led the league, and only Houston (17) was close, with no other team having more than 13. That’s okay: the Bears’ offense is probably due for some positive regression and additional growth from QB Caleb Williams. Williams turns 25 years old in the middle of next season as he starts Year 3 in the NFL, and he already showed massive improvement in the second half of year two. The Bears should use their available cap space to beef up the defensive front, which will hopefully make them less turnover dependent. With rookies like Colston Loveland and Luther Burden II primed to take a bigger step forward, plus a possible breakout year from Rome Odunze in his third season, the Bears should be a better offense and more sustainable defense.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (+1800): The Niners had a season from hell in terms of injuries and still had a really good year. San Francisco will be healthier coming into next season, and the injuries they had this season allowed several talented young players to get their feet wet, which should benefit them next year. Expect the Niners to be an active team in free agency after the likely release of Brandon Aiyuk. Kyle Shanahan is as good as any head coach in the NFL. There’s still blue chip talent up and down this roster. If they went 12-5 in a season where they had a lot of bad luck, I’ll bank on some positive regression next season.\n\nWashington Commanders (+4500): Jayden Daniels has looked like a superstar quarterback when he’s fully healthy, and this offseason the Commanders have the opportunity to load up on talent around him. Washington enters the offseason with the No. 7 overall pick, and tons of cap space to splurge on free agents. Edge rushers, linebackers, and secondary help could all be on the menu for a defense that struggled this season. It would also be nice to get Daniels some weapons with Zach Ertz working through a torn ACL and Deebo Samuel entering free agency. Washington needs a talent infusion, but they have the means to do it, and I like the QB/coach combo of Daniels and Dan Quinn for a deep sleeper.",

    "fullText": "Green Day has never been part of the MAGA agenda. The California rock band has called out Donald Trump and his administration in many of their music performances, and it doesn’t look like they’re stopping any time soon.\n\nIn recent years, the band—consisting of members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool—has replaced the lyrics of their iconic hit “American Idiot.” The song, written in 2004, initially included the lyrics “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda.” Now, when performing the song live, Armstrong sings, “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” The song itself, and the titular album it was written for, was a direct criticism of George W. Bush’s administration and the Iraq war.\n\nTrump Finally Addresses Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Abduction Years After She Called His Behavior 'Crazy' at Town Hall\n\nWhite House Officially Addresses Trump & Vance Feud Rumors After Reports the President Is Prepared to 'Strike' Against the VP's 'Betrayal'\n\nArmstrong also takes a jab at Vice President JD Vance through revised lyrics of “Jesus of Suburbia.” So what’s the beef between the president and the band?\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected into office in November 2016, the band led a chant  “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” during an appearance at the American Music Awards.\n\nDuring the first days of the first Trump administration, Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram about his immigration executive orders that targeted countries with large Muslim populations: “I feel like I’m in a state of shock. The executive orders Trump is signing feels like a vendetta.. Trump is not only taking out his revenge on the people who protested him, but also the average American that just didn’t vote for him.”\n\nHe continued, “These reckless decisions on healthcare, muslim-americans, immigration, environmental protection, freedom of speech, freedom of press, women’s right to choose what to do with their bodies, suggesting sending in the feds to Chicago .. are signs of a man that is trying to redefine what it is that keeps our common union as Americans. This is not just his ‘conservative agenda.’ It’s an all out assault on our civil liberties. His intention is to divide us as Americans. Maybe we don’t agree on all of these issues.. But can’t we see eye to eye on some?”\n\nIn an interview with NME, Armstrong said that Trump supporters were mostly “uneducated white working-class people.” Armstrong added: “That’s the problem right there. There’s this white nationalism that’s been brewing under the radar for a long time. But now [Trump’s] been able to cause people to lash out and blame minorities and it’s really confusing. I mean, blatant misogyny going on at the same time.”\n\n“I’ve got family members from Oklahoma that are big Trump supporters. And there’s no clear answer on why they’re supporting him because he doesn’t even have any policies,” he continued. “How can you have an opinion about who you want for the Leader of the Free World when the guy running doesn’t have answers to any questions?”\n\nWhen the band performed in Washington D.C., Armstrong emphasized that the sentiments didn’t feel as intense or different as other concerts. “Outside of “f—k you,” not a real lot, honestly,” the lead singer told Rolling Stone. “People know how I feel. I feel like going negative is just throwing fuel on the fire. I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue. I think we’re in a crisis mode right now. For me, it’s important to get back to fundamentally what it feels like to be an American. We all come from different backgrounds, but we come together and create this world. It’s like a microcosm for the rest of the world. I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”\n\nWhen asked about their obligations in the Trump administration, Cool said, “I think we have an obligation to put on a fun show and put on a concert that’s memorable, that’s energetic and that spreads joy and open-mindedness. If being open-minded and joyful is against your political beliefs, then you know, fuck you.”\n\nIn June 2025, Armstrong shared his feelings about the president. “Donald Trump in his administration is a fascist government,” Armstrong told the crowd at Download Festival in Donington Park in the U.K. . “And it’s up to us to fight back.”\n\nGreen Day was announced as a performer in the opening ceremonies for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif., a couple of miles away from the band’s roots. When asked about whether he’ll attend the football game, Trump told reporters that he would not and then criticized the performers, which also included halftime performer Bad Bunny. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nIn their first performance of 2026, the band made their stance loud and clear with the iconic “American Idiot” line. During the performance of “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong said, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota. … Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor,” referring to the ICE raids in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of Alex Pretto and Renee Good, while the latter line is a direct reference to homeland security advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nArmstrong also added the same sentiments when the band performed at a Super Bowl pre-show hosted by Spotify and Fanduel on Friday, Feb. 6. “This goes out to all the ICE agents out there. Wherever you are: quit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have.” He added, “come on this side of the line.”\n\n“Because when this is over — and it will be over at some point in time — Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, they’re going to drop you like a bad f—king habit.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "No one was expecting year one of the Ben Johnson era to end in a Super Bowl for the Chicago Bears, but the 2025 season went better than most fans could have expected. But even so, it felt like it ended too soon. The loss in the NFC Divisional Round against the Los Angeles Rams stung because they had worked their magic again, battling back to tie the game with just 19 seconds left.\n\nA Rams three-and-out to start the overtime period, and the Bears were in position to win.\n\nThe end was disappointing, but the season truly felt like the start of something special, and 89% of of fans feel the Super Bowl window is open.\n\nBen Johnson changed the trajectory of the franchise.\n\nHis partnership with Caleb Williams had a rough start, by design, and it got better and better as the year wore on.\n\nChicago finished ninth in points scored and sixth in total offensive yards. The Bears’ top-ten finish in those two categories has occurred only three other times since 1985.\n\nIncluding his three years as offensive coordinator in Detroit, Johnson’s offense has never been out of the top ten in either of those two categories.\n\nThe arrow is pointing up on the offense, and if the Bears attack the defense this offseason as they attacked the offense last year, that side of the ball will more than hold its own in 2026.\n\nOur partners at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Bears odds to win next year’s Super Bowl at +2700.\n\nThe window may be open, but Johnson won’t take it for granted.\n\n“There is no building off of this,” Johnson said at the end of the season press conference. “We go back to square one. We’re back at the bottom again.”\n\nThis is SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the NFL. Throughout the year, we’ll ask questions of the most plugged-in Chicago Bears fans and fans across the country.",

    "fullText": "Tom Brady once found himself puzzled by a debate that resurfaced well beyond the football field.\n\nIn July 2025, the seven-time Super Bowl champion addressed comments made by golf star Scottie Scheffler about family and professional priorities, offering a perspective shaped by his own career.\n\nBrady shared his reaction in a personal reflection published on TomBrady.com, responding to the idea that being an elite athlete and a devoted family man sit in opposition.\n\nHe said, “Scottie said he’d rather be a better father and husband than a good golfer. And my question is: why are those mutually exclusive? Sure, they’re different blocks on the pyramid, but they’re part of the same pyramid.\n\n“They’re connected! For instance, I think part of being a great father is being a great example of doing what it takes to take care of your family. I chose to do it by playing football,” Brady added.\n\nAt the time, Brady’s comments stood out because they challenged a growing narrative around elite sport and sacrifice.\n\nRather than rejecting family-first values, Brady reframed the discussion. In his view, professional excellence and personal responsibility are intertwined rather than competing priorities.\n\nThe tone of the response reflected where Brady was in life then, nearing the end of his playing career and increasingly reflective about his legacy.\n\nBrady expanded on his thinking by explaining how his relentless commitment to football fit into his definition of being present for his family.\n\n“My dedication to the sport, the hours of practice, the moments when I was laser focused, those were times when I believe I was doing the best possible thing for my family and my kids.\n\n“By prioritizing my profession and teaching, by example, what it takes to be really good at your job, what it takes to follow through on commitments, what it takes to be a great teammate; and showing them, also by example, that work is a big part of all of our lives,” Brady added.\n\nThe comments offered insight into how Brady justified the demands of a two-decade career.\n\nHe viewed discipline, preparation, and consistency not as absences from family life, but as lessons delivered through action.\n\nLooking back, the exchange captured a philosophical divide rather than a disagreement. Both perspectives valued family, but differed on how professional ambition fits into that picture.\n\nAs a throwback moment, Brady’s response now reads as a snapshot of an athlete grappling with balance while still defending the path he chose.\n\nIt remains a reminder that conversations about success and family are rarely simple, even among the most accomplished figures in sport.\n\nTom Brady reveals he once took his 11-year-old son to a Super Bowl party hosted by Snoop Dogg\n\nDrake Maye has chance to match Tom Brady record, this could be his reason not to support Patriots\n\nFuture #1 overall pick Fernando Mendoza explains why he grew up idolizing Tom Brady",

Nevertheless, Brady’s lasting impact with the team over the course of his 20-year career in New England has consistently been brought to remembrance ahead of the Super Bowl on February 8.\n\nA win for Maye at Super Bowl LX will make him the second starting quarterback aside from Brady to win a championship for New England, which would draw comparisons to the former franchise great.\n\nLet’s take a look at Brady’s history in Super Bowl appearances:\n\nTom Brady is a seven-time Super Bowl champion.\n\nBrady won the Super Bowl six times (2001, 2003-04, ‘14, ‘16, ‘18) for the New England Patriots. The Michigan product won his seventh Super Bowl for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020 — his first season with the franchise.\n\nBrady owns a 7-3 record across 10 Super Bowl appearances.\n\nThe three-time first-team All-Pro quarterback's three losses in the big game came against the New York Giants (2007, ‘11), followed by the Philadelphia Eagles (2017).\n\nBrady won the Super Bowl MVP five times in his career.

After making the playoffs just five of their first seven seasons, Seattle has been a consistent presence in the postseason.\n\nThat hasn't led to a deluge of Super Bowl runs. In 50 seasons as a franchise, the Seahawks only have one Super Bowl win to show for it. It's a big one, however; a total dismantling of Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 48, 43-8. That's not Seattle's most memorable big game performance however — and I'm not referring to the litany of officiating complaints that followed their 2006 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe picture above lives on in sports bars across New England and in the nightmare of Seattle fans who just wanted Pete Carroll to run the dang ball. The Seahawks' last Super Bowl appearance was a dramatic 28-24 loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl 49 in February 2015. 11 years ago, Seattle faced second-and-goal with 26 seconds left. Rather than handing the ball to Marshawn Lynch, the All-Pro tailback who'd already rushed for more than 100 yards, Russell Wilson instead threw a quick slant undrafted rookie Malcolm Butler stepped in front of to effectively end the game.\n\nThis is the Seahawks' first season advancing beyond the Divisional Round since that devastating loss.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: When was the last time the Seahawks made the Super Bowl?",

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly.

    "fullText": "Super Bowl radio coverage 2026: Station, channel, streaming to listen live to Patriots vs. Seahawks broadcast originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL is down to two: Super Bowl 60 is sure to be cinematic as the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots go head-to-head at Santa Clara’s Levi’s Stadium on Sunday.\n\nHistory is repeating itself in the most dramatic way possible. Eleven years ago, these two teams met in Super Bowl 49, a game that ended with Malcolm Butler’s legendary goal-line interception that broke Seattle’s hearts and cemented a New England dynasty. Now, over a decade later, the Seahawks finally have their chance at revenge on the very same stage.\n\nFor the Seahawks, the road back has been defined by a total cultural shift under Mike Macdonald. While the 2015 squad relied on the original Legion of Boom, this version features a \"Dark Side\" defense that led the NFL in scoring defense this season. They aren't just playing for a ring; they are playing to erase the ghost of the one-yard line.\n\nOn the other side is a Patriots team that has pulled off one of the greatest one-year turnarounds in league history. Led by second-year sensation and MVP finalist Drake Maye and head coach Mike Vrabel, New England is looking to prove that the \"Patriot Way\" didn't leave with Tom Brady.\n\nThe narrative arc of this game is anchored by Seattle's Sam Darnold, whose career resurgence has been the story of the year. From being a castoff to leading a powerhouse, Darnold now faces the franchise that famously saw him \"seeing ghosts\" years ago. Alongside NFL receiving leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the Seahawks' offense is clicking at the perfect time to challenge New England’s gritty, bend-but-don't-break defense that's let up only 26 points this postseason.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 approaches, the league prepares for a sequel 11 years in the making. Whether Seattle finally gets its redemption or New England finds another hero like Butler, this matchup is destined to reshape the legacy of both franchises.\n\nHere is everything you need to know in order to listen to Seahawks vs. Patriots on the radio.\n\nRadio station: SiriusXM channel 225 (Patriots), 226 (Seahawks), 88 (national)\n\nSeahawks radio channel: Seattle Sports Radio 710 AM, KIRO Newsradio 97.3 FM\n\nPatriots radio channel:  98.5 The Sports Hub\n\nYou can listen to Super Bowl 60 live on SiriusXM. Along with the national broadcast on channel 88, there are team-specific broadcasts for both teams; the Seahawks are available on 226, and Patriots on 225.\n\nThose in the Seattle area can listen to the game on 710 AM or 97.3 FM, where Steve Raible, Dave Wyman and Jen Mueller will call the action. In Boston, it can be found on 98.5 The Sports Hub, which is the home for all Patriots games.\n\nListen to every NFL Game live on SiriusXM, where new subscribers can start with a free first month.

Stay ahead of the game with 24/7 news updates and deep-dive analysis across multiple sport-specific channels on the SiriusXM app.\n\nChiefs vs. Eagles will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, February 8.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will be played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nWestwood One, airing on SiriusXM Channel 88, continues its legacy as the NFL's official audio partner for the 39th consecutive season. For Super Bowl 60, most affiliate stations within the competing teams’ networks must broadcast Westwood One's feed, with only the flagship station of each team permitted to carry its local coverage. These local feeds, however, remain accessible through SiriusXM and NFL+ (formerly Game Pass).\n\nThe national broadcast team is headlined by Kevin Harlan delivering play-by-play commentary for his 16th Super Bowl, with Hall of Famer Kurt Warner providing expert analysis. They are joined by sideline reporter Ross Tucker, while Scott Graham anchors the studio coverage for his 17th consecutive season.\n\nFor fans tuning in via the Patriots Radio Network, the game will be called by Bob Socci (play-by-play) alongside former Patriots quarterback Scott Zolak (analyst). Coverage is available on 98.5 The Sports Hub, the Patriots' flagship station, with their SiriusXM broadcast airing on Channel 225.\n\nFor Seattle Seahawks supporters, the local radio broadcast can be found on SiriusXM Channel 226. Coverage is available on Seattle Sports (710 AM) and KIRO NewsRadio (97.3 FM), with the legendary Steve Raible (play-by-play) and Dave Wyman (analyst) calling the action.\n\nMeanwhile, during halftime, SiriusXM’s Caliente (Channel 151) will provide live coverage and commentary of Bad Bunny’s performance at Levi's Stadium.",

    "description": "A new Super Bowl ad from Hims & Hers telehealth touts a blood test for cancer. It's $700, but it's not a replacement for regular screening.",
    "fullText": "A Super Bowl ad airing this weekend by telehealth company Hims & Hers pokes fun at \"rich people\" and their obsession with living longer.\n\n\"All that money doesn't just buy more stuff, it buys more time,\" the ad voiceover says, a gentle nod toward rich and powerful longevity enthusiasts such as Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Bryan Johnson.\n\nYet the commercial also argues our \"wealth gap is a health gap\" and that everyday people should have the same access to high-end biological testing that elite concierge medicine services offer the rich, such as regular blood draws, GLP-1 drugs, and yes, peptides. The latest addition to that mix: cancer screening through a simple blood test.\n\nThe new Hims & Hers test, Grail's Galleri, is part of a growing suite of blood tests and more \"proactive\" care the telehealth company is offering to mere normal folks.\n\nIt is not exactly cheap, though. It requires a $350 annual lab membership, which includes tests that measure cardiometabolic health, to assess risk for conditions like heart disease or high cholesterol, and hormone levels. On top of that, customers can pay for Grail's Galleri blood draw at a discounted rate of $700. That's $250 less than the retail price for Galleri, but still $1,050 all in for a test that, based on current data, has limited ability of telling you whether you have early-stage cancer.\n\nGrail's test uses two vials of blood to screen for over 50 types of cancer, including some tough-to-find types like pancreatic and ovarian cancer, for which routine screening doesn't exist.\n\nIn the US, more than 50% of cancer cases are caught at the later stages 3 and 4, after the disease has started spreading. The ultimate promise of new blood tests like Grail is that many cancers could be caught earlier by looking at a person's blood, instead of waiting for vague symptoms to surface that might initially be dismissed, further delaying diagnosis.\n\nGrail's test works by detecting cancerous DNA that is shed into a person's blood. So it makes sense that it would be better at finding late-stage cancer: If someone has cancer that has just started to grow, there might be no trace of its DNA — yet — from drawing a couple of vials of blood.\n\nWhat will be important for Grail to show, in the coming years and decades, is that it can definitively improve cancer outcomes and prevent more cancer deaths by finding more early-stage cancer before it's too late.\n\nAccording to an ongoing study of 35,000 people by the company, the Galleri test is over 99% specific, meaning that if it says you have cancer, there is a very good chance you do have cancer.\n\nHowever, it may not detect every case: interim results released in October 2025 suggest the diagnostic test detects about 40% of cancers overall. Which means if you do have cancer, there's a worse than 50-50 chance that a Galleri blood draw will find it.\n\nGrail points to the fact that in the same study, its cancer screening led to a \"more than seven-fold increase\" in the number of cases of breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer found in a year, including some cancers that may not have been picked up through standard-of-care screenings like mammograms.\n\n\"How much more cancer is being detected in the population is what we need to measure to assess the public health impact,\" the company said in an email to Business Insider.\n\nA 2021 study of the test showed it picked up about 17% of early-phase stage 1 cancers, and more than 90% of stage 4 cancers, the kind that have metastasized and spread to other areas of the body. That uncertainty, especially in early stages, could lull some people into a false sense of security that they are cancer-free when they are not. \n\nHims & Hers Chief Medical Officer Patrick Carroll said Grail has been educating a few dozen doctors and nurse practitioners at the company on how to convey this to patients.\n\n\"They provide really robust information about how to message it, what the test means, what it doesn't mean,\" he said. \"It's a screening, not a diagnostic test.\"\n\nIf Grail ends up helping people find more early-stage cancers that have no other screening tools, like pancreatic cancer, maybe it will help improve death rates and outcomes. There just isn't enough data to suggest it does save lives, at least not yet.\n\nProfessor Anna Schuh, an expert in molecular diagnostics at the University of Oxford in the UK, said Galleri's \"low pick up rate\" for early cancer, and the cost, give her pause, at least for now.\n\n\"That in my view makes this approach currently unsuitable for population screening,\" she said when the latest Galleri trial results were released last October.\n\nGrail founder Jeff Huber, the company's former CEO, recently told Business Insider that he knows this isn't a one-and-done product. He couples his own annual Grail test with a full-body MRI scan, plus the normal age-appropriate cancer screening measures, like colonoscopies, to get a multimodal picture of what's going on in his body.\n\n\"It's a compliment\" to other cancer testing, he said. \"I do feel deeply offended by the current state of things, where Grail is a rich people product.\"\n\nCarroll, the CMO at Hims & Hers, said the company's patients have been asking for Grail by name for a while.\n\n\"Through a lot of internal research with our customers, they're very interested in Grail, and they're very interested in lab biomarker testing,\" he said.\n\nHims & Hers was part of a $325 million private placement investment into Grail last October. \"It's expensive, but we are also trying to make it more affordable,\" Carroll added.\n\nCompetitors are also starting to emerge. Last September, Exact Sciences, the makers of Cologuard, a noninvasive colon cancer screening test, unveiled Cancerguard, a blood test that also screens for more than 50 different cancers. It's $689.\n\nAs a former CMO at Walgreens, Carroll said he's seen many patients (and their employers) pivoting to \"high-deductible\" health plans where they may end up paying upward of $2,000 out of pocket for lab work.\n\n\"We feel if we can keep it below that $2,000 mark or even $1,500 mark, folks are going to make an informed decision about what I'm willing to pay out of pocket for this,\" he said. \"Because quite honestly, they're paying out of pocket for a lot of the healthcare today.\"\n\nHuber, the former Grail executive, hopes the Galleri test can eventually be available as a \"$100 test that's reimbursed\" and part of a regular annual checkup. What Hims & Hers is offering is different: a quick telehealth screening with a provider, and then a trip to Quest labs to draw blood, \"no connections required,\" as their 2026 Super Bowl ad says.",

    "fullText": "Darron Lee, a former Chiefs linebacker, has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, according to Tennessee authorities.\n\nThe Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said deputies arrived Thursday at a residence in Ooltewah, Tennessee and found a female victim. After attempting CPR, it was determined she was deceased.\n\n“Due to the condition of the victim and the residence, HCSO Criminal Investigative Services Detectives responded. Preliminary findings indicate the victim’s death was the result of a homicide,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n\n“The victim’s boyfriend, Darron Lee, was identified as the suspect and taken into custody at the scene.”\n\nLee, who played for the Chiefs in 2019, has been charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. Lee was in 16 games that season, but he didn’t appear in the playoffs as the Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV.\n\nAccording to WRCB-TV in Chattanooga, “Lee told (first responders) that he had found her unconscious on the couch, and thought that she had perhaps fallen in the shower, but his statements didn’t line up with the ‘concerning conditions’ within the home, the arrest report says.\n\n“Deputies with the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office say they found blood spatter on the walls and flooring in multiple locations, as well as broken glass scattered across the kitchen area. They also observed cleaning materials in ‘abnormal places.’”\n\nThe WRCB story said a medical examiner found the victim had a stab wound to the abdomen as well as a bruise on her head and other injuries.\n\nThe New York Post reported Lee is being held without bond and has a court date set for Wednesday.",

    "description": "As Drake Maye prepares for the biggest game of his life, one of the most unexpected storylines of his Super Bowl run has nothing to do with football. It has everything to do with his wife, Ann Michael Maye.",
    "fullText": "As Drake Maye prepares for the biggest game of his life, one of the most unexpected storylines of his Super Bowl run has nothing to do with football. It has everything to do with his wife, Ann Michael Maye.\n\nOver the past year, Ann Michael has quietly become a fan favorite, known for her warm personality, baking content, and behind-the-scenes support of her husband. What started as casual social media posts and lighthearted moments has now grown into something much bigger, a spotlight she never asked for, but has embraced with grace.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Super Bowl LX, Maye admitted he’s been amazed by how quickly fans have connected with her.\n\n“I’m more surprised at how much people have embraced my wife,” Maye said. “It’s been so cool to see her story and what it’s been like for her.” These days, the quarterback finds himself playing second fiddle in public.\n\n“She’s the one out at restaurants having to take pictures,” Maye joked. “And I’m the one laughing in the back.”\n\nAnn Michael’s rise in popularity has been gradual but genuine. Long before Maye became a Super Bowl quarterback, she was already earning fans through her baking videos, family moments, and down-to-earth presence online. Supporters were drawn to her authenticity, a refreshing contrast to the polished image often associated with pro athletes’ partners. Now, that connection has reached another level.\n\n“At games, walking around the stadium, it’s awesome for her,” Maye said. “She’s getting bombarded.” Rather than feeling overwhelmed, he sees it as something meaningful. “That’s really special for the fan base,” he added, “and for us to share the same journey and be in the spotlight together.”\n\nFor Maye, having his wife alongside him through this rapid rise has made the experience more grounding than stressful. While Ann Michael has been winning over fans, Maye remains focused on the task at hand: facing a fast, disciplined Seattle defense in the Super Bowl.\n\n“They’re fast. They play as a team,” he said. “You can tell they’re well coached. They do things the right way.” He made it clear that Seattle has earned its reputation. “They’ve earned the respect of the league,” Maye said. “It’s a tough challenge, but I know our locker room has responded all year.”\n\nThat confidence reflects the maturity Maye has shown throughout the postseason. Despite the pressure, he has rarely looked rattled, relying on preparation and trust in his teammates. When asked about his approach to such a massive game, Maye emphasized simplicity over spectacle.\n\n“Keep it simple,” he said. “Sometimes it’s just about not turning the ball over.” He credited head coach Josh McDaniels for helping him stay grounded. “Coach is so good about understanding how the game’s going,” Maye explained. “The weather, the flow, everything.”\n\nSome nights call for explosive numbers. Others demand patience.\n\n“Sometimes you throw for 350,” Maye said. “Sometimes you just protect the ball. And you end up going to the Super Bowl.” Stats, he insists, are secondary. “We’re not worried about that,” he concluded. “We’re worried about winning.”\n\nThe post “She’s Getting Bombarded”: Drake Maye Raves About Ann Michael Maye Factor Before Super Bowl appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US president Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has helped turn the Seahawks into narrow favourites, thanks also to a fearsome defence led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years.

    "description": "The Super Bowl team's logo originates with a First Nations tribe in Canada.",
    "fullText": "Wallace Nagedzi Watts had been going to Seahawks games for almost three decades when a historical discovery helped supercharge his fandom - and deepened his connection to his indigenous roots.\n\n\"It kind of changed my whole life,\" says Watts, a prominent fan of the American football team who goes by the name Captain Seahawk.\n\n\"Because of the Seattle Seahawks I started getting back into my culture.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC while driving down to attend the Super Bowl game in Santa Clara, California, where the Seahawks are due to take on the New England Patriots, Watts says \"it's been my life's mission for the last 12 years to notify everyone that the Seahawks logo was copied from the Kwakwaka'wakw tribe on Vancouver Island\".\n\nThe discovery was made during the Seahawks last Super Bowl sting - coincidentally also against the Patriots - in 2014.\n\nAmid city-wide excitement, the Burke Museum in Seattle decided to investigate the origins of the Seahawks logo, which was chosen by the team's manager in the mid-1970s. A black-and-white photo of a ceremonial mask in an old art book revealed the inspiration behind the design, which was then traced to a collection at the Hudson Museum in Maine.\n\nThe museum sent the mask to Seattle on loan, where a ceremony was held featuring both tribal members and team representatives.\n\nThe mask, which was created in the late 1800s and was carved from cedar, had been in private collections since leaving Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it was created by members of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nation, says Katie Bunn-Marcuse, the curator of Northwest Native Art at the Burke Museum.\n\nThe carving, which is known as a \"transformational mask\" and depicts the ancestral origins of one's family, was created around the time that Canada introduced a ban on many indigenous practices, in a move which decimated many tribes in western Canada.\n\nUsing the mask for its intended purpose, at large gatherings called potlaches, became a crime. Many people went to jail for their cultural practices, however, the Kwakwaka'wakw people continued to hold underground potlaches.\n\n\"The Indian Act banned people gathering and performing their songs,\" says Bunn-Marcuse, adding, that \"the potlatch was the economic and legal system of the coast\". The ban was lifted in 1951, and in 2015 Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that it was part of a \"cultural genocide\", which also included the notorious residential school programme, which separated families and erased local languages.\n\nWatts grew up on a reservation in Port Alberni on the west side of Vancouver Island, in his father's tribal community. But after the discovery of the logo's Kwakwaka'wakw origins, he decided to look into his mother's family history on the other side of the island.\n\nTravelling back to Vancouver Island, he set out on a series of tribal canoe journeys, where he reconnected with Kwakwaka'wakw family members and learned more about their cultural practices.\n\nDuring one trip, he was invited to take place in a ritual in which he was declared a \"warrior\", or guardian of the tribe's culture.\n\n\"I had to dance half-naked in front of a thousand people, and then I came back in warriors clothing. To me it's like being baptised as a Christian. It really changed my life.\"\n\nBruce Alfred, an artist living in Alert Bay, British Columbia, recalls when his cousin started showing up, inspired by his commitment to the Seahawks and his cultural heritage. He says that Watts is not the only person who has been inspired by the NFL team to look into their family history.\n\nAlfred was part of the Burke team that surveyed the mask, and confirmed that it was indeed Kwakwaka'wakw, and had been used in spiritual ceremonies before going into a private collection.\n\n\"After the potlatch ban they took everything away from our people,\" he says, adding that the goal of the government and missionaries was to \"annihilate and assimilate us - either one\".\n\nThe Seahawks are popular throughout Canada's western coast, where no other NFL team exists. Alfred says that many people in his village are Seahawks supporters, and that more people have been inspired to look into their heritage after discovering the team's connection. It comes amid a larger tribal movement to reconnect with the past.\n\n\"There is a resurgence of our people that are stepping up and they're learning the language, the culture, their own identity,\" he says.\n\nAlfred, and other indigenous people who spoke to the BBC, say that unlike other major league sports teams, the Seahawks logo has not sparked backlash because it respectfully borrows from indigenous culture, rather than plays in to racist stereotypes.\n\nThe display of indigenous cultural materials as artworks has been criticised by some tribal people, who see these as sacred tools for worship.\n\nAt the Kwakwaka'wakw exhibit at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, one mask is kept under a sheet to symbolically show how some believe these objects should not be displayed, and only taken out for important occasions.\n\nThe debate is always ongoing for museums that display indigenous relics, says Bunn-Marcuse.\n\n\"In community, many of these masks are not brought out until the moment that they are needed,\" she says.\n\n\"Whenever we do our exhibits we do them collaboratively with input and advising by community members. So there are some masks that we no longer show because community has said those are not appropriate to be shown ever outside of their ceremonial context.\"\n\nOthers have critiqued the artwork for originating from a tribe that is hundreds of miles from Seattle, halfway to Alaska. The artwork of local peoples such as the Coast Salish could be used instead, they argue.\n\nQwalsius-Shaun Peterson, a Coast Salish artist from the Puyallup Tribe near Tacoma, Washington, is among many indigenous artists who have redesigned unofficial Seahawks logos in the style of their own local culture.\n\n\"People within the tribal communities are just really excited about native iconography of any kind,\" he says.\n\n\"Nobody takes offense\" to the official logo, he adds, adding that it is not a \"misrepresentation\" and instead \"borrows from\" indigenous art.\n\nWatts, who proudly boasts that he's the first person to arrive at games and the last to leave, is using his celebrity status as a superfan to fund raise for multiple charities.\n\nHe also cooks at a food bank, and mentors Native American youths in prison.\n\n\"I really had a different outlook on my entire life\" after connecting with the roots of the logo, Watts says.\n\n\"We're supposed to be the guardians of our tribe. We protect and provide.\"\n\nTotem pole to return to dockland home\n\nAn underwater mystery on Canada's coast\n\nA surprising way of showing gratitude",

Snell made a name for himself in the Pacific Northwest before he was selected in the first round of the 2011 MLB Draft.\n\nThe All-Star pitcher grew up a Seattle Mariners fan and said that he will always have love for his hometown. In addition, Snell added that he will attend the Super Bowl, which is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 7 at 3:30 PM PT. The game will be held in Santa Clara, California, at Levi’s Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe southpaw will now enter his second season in Los Angeles after he signed a five-year, $182 million contract. His deal includes a $52 million signing bonus and a conditional $10 million option for 2030.\n\nSnell touched on a handful of different topics at Fan Fest, including his availability at the start of the 2026 season. He shared with the media that the “plan” is to be ready for Opening Day.\n\n“I’ve been playing catch, been throwing. It feels good,” Snell said. “But I’m just going to take my time. Last year, I was rushing. I wanted to pitch so bad. But I’m going to take my time. The goal is to be ready Opening Day, but I’m going to take my time. I’ll know more once I’m [at Spring Training], throwing bullpens, pitching in games.”\n\nThe two-time Cy Young winner pitched an incredible 2.35 ERA in 2025, but was limited to only 11 starts due to left shoulder inflammation that kept him out for most of the season. Still, Snell played a pivotal role for the Dodgers in their quest for back-to-back titles.\n\nHe will do the same for L.A. in the 2026 season as they seek to become the first National League team to complete a three-peat.",

    "description": "Shaheed uses his speed to make big plays for the Seahawks. The former Weber State star could use it to bring home a Super Bowl ring.",
    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Rashid Shaheed is a perfect example of someone who takes advantage of their opportunities.\n\nWhen he was a little-recruited return specialist with track speed from the San Diego area coming out of high school, Shaheed ended up at Weber State under head coach Jay Hill and became a four-time All-American as a return specialist and receiving weapon.\n\nWhen he entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent — and was coming off an ACL injury that prevented him from working out in the pre-draft process — the New Orleans Saints saw Shaheed’s potential and signed him to a deal.\n\nHe turned that into a productive three-and-a-half years with the franchise.\n\nWhen the Saints traded him midseason during the 2025 campaign to the Seattle Seahawks, Shaheed adjusted again — and while he’s not as prominent in the Seahawks’ passing game as he was in New Orleans, Shaheed has made big plays in Seattle on special teams.\n\nSeveral of those plays have been important to the Seahawks’ postseason run.\n\nAnd now, he’s headed to Super Bowl LX with Seattle, where the Seahawks will face the New England Patriots on Sunday (4:30 p.m. MST, NBC) at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nWhat will Shaheed do with that opportunity?\n\n“I feel like the journey has shaped me to be not only the player, but the person that I am today,” Shaheed told the Deseret News in an exclusive interview ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\n“Obviously, coming in from an FCS school, Weber State, coming into the league with an injury, not knowing if I’m going to get the opportunity eventually, I just made the most of my opportunities, and that’s all I’ve done up to this point.”\n\nShaheed’s NFL career started modestly enough, as an under-the-radar addition during the 2022 offseason.\n\nIt didn’t take long for New Orleans to fall in love with the 6-foot, speedy Shaheed, though.\n\nDespite coming off an ACL injury, he ended up with 34 receptions for 488 yards and two touchdowns as a rookie.\n\nHis best receiving season thus far came in 2023, when he caught 75 passes for 719 yards and five touchdowns. He also earned Pro Bowl honors for the first time that season as a return specialist.\n\nA meniscus injury suffered in Week 6 of the 2024 season sidelined him the rest of that year, one where he was on pace to break his career numbers from that 2023 season.\n\nThen this year, there was a midseason trade from New Orleans to Seattle.\n\n“That’s an organization that gave me the opportunity to live out my dreams,” Shaheed said of the Saints franchise. “They treated me with so much respect, not only me, but my family — made us feel at home, made us feel welcome, and that just allowed me to go out there and just have fun and play the game that I love.\n\n“Obviously, I loved my time in New Orleans and I can’t thank the organization enough.”\n\nThe trade brought up a flood of emotions for Shaheed, who had 2,055 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns with the Saints, though he went in confident he would make an impact with his new team.\n\n“It was a lot, obviously, my first time being traded, being a new team, new city, organization,” Shaheed said.\n\n“... I knew that I’d be able to get a grasp of the offensive game quickly. The transition has been smooth, and I appreciate my coaches and my teammates.”\n\nThere was a familiar face for Shaheed when he landed in Seattle: Klink Kubiak, the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, who held the same role in New Orleans during the 2023 season.\n\nKubiak is the reported choice to take over as the Las Vegas Raiders’ next head coach.\n\nHaving Kubiak in Seattle, though, helped the transition for Shaheed. He’s impressed with how tough the Seahawks play, week in and week out.\n\n“Every man plays for the guy next to him, and that’s the recipe for winning, not only on offense, but defense and special teams. We all take pride in what we do and have fun doing it.”\n\n“Every man plays for the guy next to him, and that’s the recipe for winning, not only on offense, but defense and special teams. We all take pride in what we do and have fun doing it,” Shaheed said.\n\nWhile Shaheed’s biggest impacts in Seattle have come on special teams, he still had 15 receptions for 188 yards during the regular season.\n\nHe’s joined a wide receiver group that includes veteran Cooper Kupp, another FCS product who played at Eastern Washington, and shifty Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who was named The Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year earlier this week.\n\n“With those guys, man, I just kind of sit back and watch them work,” Shaheed said.\n\nHaving the ninth-year pro Kupp, who earned a Super Bowl ring with the Los Angeles Rams, is “like having another coach” for Shaheed on the field and in the film room.\n\n“He knows what’s going to happen. He teaches us, me and Jax, what to look for in film, guys’ tendencies, all that,” Shaheed said. “I’m learning a lot from him.”\n\nShaheed has been impressed with the work ethic and approach that Smith-Njigba, the third-year pro, brings to the field every day.\n\n“Jaxon man, just the way he works, the way he shows up every day with a smile on his face and just the teammate that he is,” Shaheed said, of what stands out about the receiver who led the NFL in receiving yards (1,793) this season.\n\n“He’s gonna go out there and compete. It’s been a real pleasure working with these guys.”\n\nIt’s little surprise that Shaheed was one of the more popular interviews during Super Bowl media opportunities at the San Jose Convention Center this week — his big-play ability gets him noticed.\n\nSince arriving in Seattle, he’s produced multiple momentum-changing moments, and that popularity extends over to the Seahawks fanbase.\n\nHe’s scored three touchdowns on special teams, giving him five for his career. That earned Shaheed his second Pro Bowl citation.\n\nIt started with a 100-yard kick return for a touchdown in Week 14, when he took the second-half kick back for six points against Atlanta to break a 6-6 tie in an eventual 37-9 Seahawks win.\n\nShaheed kept upping the ante with his ensuing big returns.\n\nDuring a Week 16 matchup against the Rams, a critical game in terms of NFC seeding, the Seahawks trailed 30-14 midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nIn front of the electric Lumen Field home crowd, Shaheed changed the complexion of the game with a 58-yard punt return for a touchdown with 8:03 to play.\n\nSeattle forced overtime, then won 38-37 in the extra session in a game that helped the Seahawks earn the NFC’s top seed and home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\nThen, in the divisional round with NFC West rival San Francisco coming to town, Shaheed started off the playoff contest with another electric play. His 95-yard touchdown on the game’s opening kickoff sparked a 41-6 win over the 49ers.\n\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED?! @RashidShaheed on the opening play 🤯\n\n📺: @NFLonFox pic.twitter.com/ZzMrFLI9l9\n\n— xz* - Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) January 18, 2026\n\n“I know the opportunities are going to come. My coaches believe in me to make those types of plays, and that just allows me to go out there and play free, play fast and just do what I’ve been coached to do,” Shaheed said.\n\n“(It’s a) big testament to the coaches for just allowing me to go out there and allow my ability to (make plays).”\n\nDuring Seattle’s postseason run, Shaheed has three kickoff returns for 147 yards (a 49-yard average), a 51-yard catch and three carries for 27 yards.\n\nThat 51-yard reception set up Seattle’s opening touchdown in the Seahawks’ 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC championship game.\n\nHe’ll have opportunities to again make big plays in Sunday’s Super Bowl. In 59 previous Super Bowls, there have been 10 kickoff returns for touchdowns, but no one has ever returned a punt for a touchdown.\n\nFor Shaheed, the key Sunday against the Patriots is sticking together as a team.\n\n“Obviously, the magnitude is much, much bigger, but as long as we continue to do what we have all season, that’s just stick together, play all four quarters, we know that a team has to play us all four quarters, and we don’t believe that they can play with our style,” Shaheed said.\n\n“That’s with a lot of passion, aggression on a lot of big plays. We enjoy what we do, and it’s gonna be a fun game.”\n\nNo matter how Super Bowl LX ends up, Shaheed will represent Weber State in a positive way.\n\nHe credits his time with the Wildcats for helping him develop as a wide receiver and becoming a well-respected (and feared) return specialist.\n\n“That’s where I developed my game. Like I said, I had great coaches to learn from, great schemes. Obviously, I was able to make a lot of plays in the return game, but I grew so much as a wide receiver, and that was just taking a lot of time, spending time on my craft,” Shaheed said.\n\n“Being at a small school, it allowed me to work on that even more with limited distractions, small city. All it was was just work and continue to get better. And that’s how I’ve been able to progress.”\n\nShaheed is joining an elite group of Weber State alums who’ve reached the Super Bowl.\n\nThere are six former Wildcats who’ve won a Super Bowl ring, a list that includes Lee White, Darryl Pollard, Jamie Martin, Marcus Mailei, Paul McQuistan and Jonah Williams.\n\nShaheed will be only the fourth former Weber State player, though, to actually play in the Super Bowl. That more exclusive list includes Pollard, who started for the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV, Al Pupunu and McQuistan.\n\nIt means a lot for Shaheed to represent his alma mater, and a victory Sunday would just make it sweeter.\n\n“I think that moment would just be bigger than just me,” he said about the possibility of earning a Super Bowl ring. “That would be an opportunity to let kids know that you can make it from anywhere. You don’t have to go to a Power Five school. You can go to an FCS school and make it happen.\n\n“And as long as you play the game the right way, teams will find you. Don’t be afraid to take that risk and just go anywhere you get an opportunity to play football and do what you love. Pursue it.”",

Coming from a military family myself, it’s important for me to honor those who served because we wouldn’t have the chance to do what we love on Sundays without the sacrifices made by heroes like Gary,” Dart said.\n\nAs part of Schacher’s trip, he gets to meet Dart and other NFL players in the Salute to Service Lounge at the Super Bowl.\n\nThat meeting is what Schacher’s looking forward to the most. Even though he’s a New York Jets fan, Schacher considers himself “a New York fan” and roots for the Giants — as long as they’re not playing the Jets.\n\n“He’s the up-and-coming star of the NFL,” Schacher said of Dart.\n\nThe topic Schacher really wants to talk to Dart about? His Corner Canyon High School connection with former Jets quarterback Zach Wilson.\n\nIn 1980, Schacher enlisted in the Navy at 19 years old in what he described as “a spur of the moment thing.”\n\nOne day, his friend, whose father served in the Army, asked Schacher if he wanted to come to the recruiter’s office with him.\n\nThere, they spoke to a Navy recruiter. A month later, Schacher and his friend had shipped out.\n\nThat “spur of the moment” led to 26 years of service. Schacher began his Navy career assigned to a ship in Mayport, Florida.\n\nAs a Navy reservist, he served with a Weapons Station Unit and a Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Unit. In 1990, he transferred to the Navy Seabees.\n\nHis service took him to several bases in the U.S. and overseas, including New Jersey, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Spain and Iraq, where he served his last tour.\n\nSchacher returned to active duty for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and 2004. He retired in 2006 at the rank of E7 Chief Petty Officer.\n\nSchacher’s two-plus decades of service earned him four Navy Commendation Medals and three Navy Achievement Medals, the Navy Expert Pistol Medal and the Navy Expert Rifle Medal.\n\nHe also received the New York Conspicuous Service Star and the New York Medal for Merit and was inducted into the New York State Senate Veterans Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nSchacher’s service to his fellow military men and women continued into his retirement as a founding member of the Leatherstocking Honor Flight, which transports World War II veterans to Washington, D.C., to visit the World War II memorial.\n\nHe also helped establish the Patriot Highlander Challenge obstacle course, a fundraiser for wounded veterans and support networks in New York.\n\nHe has also been heavily involved in The American Legion. In 2018, Schacher was the first Iraq War veteran to serve as commander of The American Legion Department of New York.\n\nThrough it all, Schacher has always loved playing and watching football, whether it’s high school, college or professional.\n\n“(It’s) just a great sport,” he said.\n\nSchacher sees parallels between the camaraderie found in the military and on football teams.\n\n“Because you’re so involved with your team, whether it’s military or athletics, the camaraderie is just unbelievable, and it’s part of why I joined The American Legion after I got out of the military was to keep that camaraderie,” he said.\n\nTwenty-one years ago, the Patriots beat the Eagles in the Super Bowl. At the time, Schacher was stationed in Iraq. The chief petty officer didn’t have access to a television feed to watch, but he remembers a concrete barrier on the base being painted in honor of the big game.\n\nSchacher doesn’t need to worry about having a television feed this year. He’ll be able to watch the game just fine from his seat at Levi’s Stadium.\n\n“I’m so extremely humbled to be chosen for this opportunity to both USAA and The American Legion and Jaxson Dart for making that press release inviting my wife and I. It’ll be a memory that will never be forgotten,” he said.\n\nWho will Schacher be cheering for Sunday? Definitely not his division rivals.\n\n“New England always destroys the Jets, so it’s hard for me to root for New England. So, I’m going to have to go with the Seattle Seahawks.”",

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s relationship has moved fast, and now it may be heading toward its biggest moment yet.\n\nWith Super Bowl 60 approaching and Diggs hinting at a possible proposal, the couple’s journey from early rumours to family life has come sharply back into focus.\n\nSpeculation around Diggs and Cardi B began in early 2025, well before either acknowledged the relationship publicly. Reports placed them at the same New York nightclub in February, followed by their first confirmed sighting together at a Miami hotel on Valentine’s Day.\n\nTheir relationship stepped into the spotlight in May 2025. Diggs and Cardi were spotted arriving separately but minutes apart at the same Met Gala after-party in New York.\n\nSoon after, they made their first unmistakable public outing by sitting courtside together at a New York Knicks versus Boston Celtics game at Madison Square Garden. The appearance came before any social media confirmation, but the message was clear.\n\nJune 2025 marked the point where Diggs and Cardi went Instagram official. While the original post is no longer visible, both shared photos together from Miami, removing any remaining doubt.\n\nThree months later, Cardi confirmed during a CBS Mornings interview that she and Diggs were expecting their first child together. She described feeling supported, focused, and aligned with Diggs both personally and professionally.\n\nAt the time, Cardi was also promoting her album Am I the Drama?, balancing music, motherhood, and a high-profile relationship.\n\nIn November 2025, Cardi announced the birth of their baby boy. The message framed the moment as a new chapter, blending personal growth with creative ambition.\n\nNow, all eyes are on February 8. Ahead of Super Bowl 60, Diggs teased that a proposal could be part of the plan. Asked directly, he suggested it was “on the agenda,” while also joking that he needed to secure his own ring first.\n\nIf the Patriots win, the moment could extend far beyond football. For Diggs and Cardi, Super Bowl 60 may represent not just another milestone, but the start of something permanent.\n\nNew England Patriots stars predict who Bad Bunny will bring out for Super Bowl halftime show\n\nNew England Patriots star Stefon Diggs sued for defamation just days before Super Bowl LX\n\nBad Bunny and Stefon Diggs give cryptic answer about Cardi B joining Super Bowl halftime show",

    "fullText": "To make Tini's mac and cheese at home, you'll need:\n\nIn her TikTok video, Younger said she opts for cavatappi noodles because their shape holds the cheese sauce better than elbow pasta.\n\n\"All that cream gets all in the hole, so you bite into the cream and the cheesiness,\" she said.\n\nOnce my pasta was al dente, I drained the pot and set it aside while I started the sauce.\n\nI preheated the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and greased my baking dish (Younger recommends using a 9-inch by 13-inch pan) before I started grating all the cheese.\n\nThe recipe includes 2 ½ pounds of cheese, and Younger is adamant that you shred it yourself.\n\n\"Do not use pre-shredded cheese at all,\" she says in the TikTok.\n\nAfter giving everything a good mix, I divided half of the cheese to use for the sauce.\n\nI threw my garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper into a small bowl so it'd be ready for the roux.\n\nFirst, I melted my butter in a large pan over medium heat.\n\nYounger said you should start whisking right after adding the milk to avoid clumps in your roux. This is also when your sauce should begin to thicken.\n\nYounger said you should let each handful of cheese melt before adding more.\n\nI added half of my cheesy cavatappi to the pan, spreading the noodles into an even layer.\n\nI baked my mac and cheese for 25 minutes, until the cheese had melted and began to bubble. Then I threw the pan on broil for two minutes to help give the top a beautiful golden crust.\n\nI made two pans of Younger's mac and cheese (one with breadcrumbs and one without) for my friend's NFL playoffs potluck, and it was one of the most popular dishes of the day.\n\nThe cavatappi noodles were the perfect vehicle for the thick and creamy cheese sauce, giving each bite an explosion of flavor. I far preferred them to the traditional elbow noodles, and I think Younger's mac and cheese convinced everyone that cavatappi is the superior shape.\n\nThe cheese sauce was rich, indulgent, and delicious, and the Dijon mustard added a nice subtle tang. Our group was split 50/50 on whether the mac and cheese tasted better with breadcrumbs, so just stick to your personal preference.\n\nIf you're looking for a Super Bowl side to steal the spotlight, Younger's mac and cheese is the ultimate touchdown.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl Sunday is as much an American tradition as it is an NFL one. There’s pomp. There’s circumstance. And there’s a whole lotta capitalism. If you squint, you may even catch some football in there somewhere.\n\nI needle because I truly love Super Bowl Sunday. I like big events. I like live, pop culture moments. I like experiencing something together with the rest of the world. And, boy, do I love football. The Super Bowl has become an event for the masses, well beyond those who are just fans of football. Whether it’s celebrity watching, highly-produced music acts, or, yes, the commercials, the NFL has managed to make the Super Bowl the biggest night in television every single year.\n\nSo today’s Question of the Day is:\n\nMy answer: Football still reigns supreme when it comes to the Super Bowl for me. I’ll be watching for what should be a fascinating matchup between the Patriots and the Seahawks. I’m fascinated by how both quarterbacks will respond to the biggest of stages, and whether New England can handle a Seahawks team that looks deeper and more well-rounded on paper. And more than anything else, I just want to watch one more NFL game before the pit of despair that is the NFL offseason.\n\nBeyond that, I do enjoy watching the halftime show, because it’s often an artist I’m not that aware of, and I like to broaden my taste in music. That will certainly be the case with Bad Bunny this year, and given that he’s quite literally one of the most popular modern artists right now, I look forward to seeing what other people see in him. I also enjoy sitting back and watching the world argue over whether that was the best or worst Super Bowl halftime show of all time, because there can be no in-between.\n\nFinally, any excuse to eat shrimp and pigs in a blanket is a good event to me.\n\nWhat are your favorite parts of Super Bowl Sunday?

    "fullText": "Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway shouted these words from the victor's podium after the Denver Broncos won Super Bowl 50 by a score of 24-10 over the Carolina Panthers in Santa Barbara, California, on Feb. 7, 2016. It echoed the cry from owner Pat Bowlen 18 Super Bowls earlier, also in the state of California, when Elway helped lead Denver to their first title in franchise history.\n\nToday marks the 10-year anniversary of that victory, which marked the franchise's third championship title.\n\nIn part, Super Bowl 50 was billed as a matchup between the top two picks in the 2011 NFL draft, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (first overall) and Broncos pass rusher Von Miller (second overall). Miller won the battle.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 was dominated by the Broncos' defense, specifically Miller. Miller terrorized Newton throughout the game, sacking the quarterback 2.5 times, forcing two fumbles, making six total tackles (five solo, one assisted) and one pass deflection. Miller was awarded the Super Bowl 50 MVP for his efforts.\n\nOne of the fumbles forced by Miller was returned for a touchdown, recovered by defensive lineman Malik Jackson to put the Broncos up 10-0 early. Newton and the Panthers fought back, but the game never got closer than six points.\n\nDenver quarterback Peyton Manning did not have his best game, finishing 13-of-23 for 141 yards and one interception, taking five sacks along the way. Manning's lone scoring play was a two-point conversion to wide receiver Bennie Fowler. That throw would be his last in the NFL.\n\nManning would ride off into the sunset after Super Bowl 50, which marked the end of his Hall of Fame career. Manning had come to Denver with the goal of winning a Super Bowl. He accomplished that and so much more during his time in orange and blue.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Denver Broncos won Super Bowl 50 on Feb. 7, 2026",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl. That sentence makes my stomach drop. How many times have we heard that line over the last two decades? Nine. That’s how many. After Tom Brady moved on and Bill Belichick traded the NFL out for college, I thought we were done. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and as a fan of the Indianapolis Colts, I’m just not sure I can tune in this year.\n\nThe 2015 Super Bowl appeared to be rock bottom as we witnessed Russell Wilson get picked off at the goal line to secure a fourth Patriot championship. 2017 said, “hold my beer” as the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history occurred when the Falcons lost a 28-3 advantage. After that, I didn’t watch the Super Bowl when the Patriots played. Yes, I missed out on the thrilling Philly Special, but I also didn’t have to watch the horrendous snooze fest that was the Rams losing 13-3.\n\nSports is all about emotion, and I have nothing left to give the Patriots. For the early part of the 2000s, they terrorized the Peyton Manning led Colts, serving as the slamming door to Super Bowl aspirations. Those teams had issues with the Chargers and Steelers as well, but it was the Patriots that served as the ever present thorn. The pendulum swung back and the Colts got some revenge, but once Manning left, it was back to the old ways of losing.\n\nDeflategate was the last nail in the coffin for the true rivalry between these two franchises, but the feelings still remain fresh. The players and coaches are totally different. I have no issue with Mike Vrabel and actually appreciate him as a coach. Drake Maye hardly ever enters my thoughts, but as sports fans, we root for and against laundry. That is how rivalries are built and sustained. The people on the field may change but the fan bases don’t, and this fan, from this base, can’t move on.\n\nIt’s a personal problem and may be mine alone, but it’s the reason I won’t be tuning in this year. My heart, soul, body, and mind can’t take another 28-3 comeback. It can’t take another, “that’s three” from Teddy Bruschi. I can’t stand to witness another Malcom Butler interception or Tom Brady hoisting the Lombardi. Call it ridiculous. Call it PTSD. I have enough memories of the Patriots winning Super Bowls to last a lifetime. I’m not sure I want to add another to the collection.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will fight it out in Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, but who will walk away with the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nSam Darnold can complete the ultimate redemption story if he guides the Seahawks to glory, and against the team he was famously \"seeing ghosts\" against during his struggles at the New York Jets.\n\nDrake Maye can become the youngest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl if he leads the Patriots to a record seventh ring - defeat though will leave them with the most losses ever in the NFL's big game.\n\nSo who will win? We've drafted in a panel of experts from our BBC show The Whole 10 Yards - presenter Hugh Ferris and analysts Phoebe Schecter and Phil McGeoghan to have their say.\n\nWe've also got Radio 5 Live presenters Mike White and Rob Staton along with BBC Sport journalists Paul Higham and Ben Collins.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-24 Patriots\n\nPredicting who is going to win the Super Bowl should be an exercise of head over heart, and yet the build-up tends to be dominated by narratives, not number-crunching. Well, I'm falling for it. The redemption story of Sam Darnold, plus the opportunity for the Seahawks to punch it in a little more successfully than they did against the same opponents at the end of Super Bowl XLIX is too good to ignore.\n\nDespite Seattle's number one defence, it's been their offence that has carried them through the close games in recent weeks, and Darnold's steady performance against the Rams' pass rush in the NFC title game (having struggled against the same team and players in the play-offs a year ago with the Vikings) makes me think he'll handle the Patriots, and the occasion. He might be seeing glory instead of ghosts this time.\n\nIf Seattle win with any offence whatsoever tell me a voter who won't lean into the idea of Darnold completing one of the great comebacks the NFL has ever seen, from draft bust to Super Bowl MVP.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-7 Patriots\n\nThis Seahawks defence has a lot to it and it feels like we haven't seen the best of Drake Maye in a lot of ways during the past two games. But you can see the attitude of this Seattle defence, they are ears back, aggressive, with great fundamentals and they take such pride in the little details.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 30-23 Patriots\n\nYou just don't understand the physicality that you're about to see from the Seahawks on Sunday. You know, I'm just telling you right now, it might not be close, right? This team is going to come out. We're going to be downhill running duo schemes inside zones. They're going to be going to take a deep shots down to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. But I love the tight-ends, what they're doing. I love the scheme. I love the continuity. But really the way Kenneth Walker's running with the football, he can catch fire in a heartbeat.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-20 New England\n\nThe Seahawks have been the most complete team this season and when one unit struggles, such as the defence in the NFC Championship, the offence tends to pick it up (and vice versa). They've proven they can outlast the better teams, including the Rams (twice), 49ers (twice), Jaguars, Texans and others.\n\nThe Patriots are brilliantly led by Mike Vrabel, their defence grew as the season went along and in Drake Maye they have an X-factor at quarterback. If the Seahawks don't get in their own way and avoid turnovers, they might just be too strong.\n\nI've gone for Darnold as MVP. Vrabel will likely dip into the Bill Belichick playbook to try and take away the main offensive threat, which is Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Darnold could look to use running back Kenneth Walker in the passing game, Rashid Shaheed downfield and expect Cooper Kupp to make a few plays. Darnold also had his best game of the season against the Rams to get his team to the Super Bowl. If he doesn't turn the ball over the Seahawks have a great chance to complete a glorious season with a championship.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 27-14 Patriots\n\nWe all love a good revenge game but this isn't Bill Belichick v Pete Carroll, Tom Brady v Russell Wilson or 'Beast Mode' v baffling goal-line playcalling and it's not the 2014 season anymore. What it is though is a redemption story for Sam Darnold.\n\nPerhaps his autobiography will be 'From Ghosts to Glory' after his infamous \"I'm seeing ghosts\" sideline comment in 2019 meeting (against the Patriots of all teams).\n\nHaving made it this far, it will haunt him forever if they don't finish the job. That said, I think Darnold exorcises a few demons by taking home the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nI was tempted to go for Jaxon Smith-Njigba and I think he could still get it but for JSN to have a big night, law of averages suggests Darnold will have played a significant role in that happening so I'll plump for the much more standard QB pick.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nSuper Bowl all-time record book\n\nPrediction Seahawks 17-20 Patriots\n\nSeattle have lost three games this season by a combined nine points, but somebody's got to back the Patriots haven't they? And underdogs have won four of the last five Super Bowls.\n\nI don't think they can win a shootout but I'm not expecting one with these two defences - I'd like them to strike first though as Seattle are 11-0 this season when the score first.\n\nListen, a dominant Seahawks win wouldn't surprise me, but I've just got a feeling Vrabel and Josh McDaniels with all their experience can pull something out of the bag.\n\nThe Pats are 12-0 and allowing just 14.5 points a game when defensive wrecking ball Milton Williams and shutdown corner Christian Gonzalez are on the field together, and they'll both play on Sunday.\n\nAnd if it's close going down the stretch then it only takes one play. Give me the Pats in a nailbiter.\n\nLet's face it, it's a quarterback award isn't it, but since I'm backing a low-scoring upset win I'll go for just the 10th defender to win the MVP. Von Miller was the last, in this very same stadium, wearing all white as well! Aside from the omens, Williams did have a couple of sacks and a forced fumble and recovery on Patrick Mahomes for the Eagles last year and something similar in a tight contest could be a difference maker.\n\nPrediction Seahawks 24-13 Patriots\n\nSeattle's awesome defence, known as the Dark Side, has been the main topic of discussion during Super Bowl week. Drake Maye has shown the ability to scramble and escape the pressure but I think the Seahawks will bring too much heat and stifle the Patriots quarterback.\n\nHe has already taken the second-most sacks in a single post-season (15) and I reckon Seattle will force him past Joe Burrow's record tally of 19.\n\nNew England's defence isn't too shabby either so I expect it to be a tight, low-scoring affair before Seattle go clear late in the third quarter or early in the fourth to clinch it.\n\nSome 17 Seattle players registered at least half a sack this season, with their interior defence particularly aggressive. Tackle Leonard Williams has registered eight sacks and 33 quarterback pressures so I'm backing the 13-year veteran to emerge from the Dark Side and become a rare defensive MVP.\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026?

While Patriots coach Mike Vrabel won three Super Bowls as a player and Seahawks QB Sam Darnold was on hand for one as a backup, the experience level of these two teams isn't close to what it was for the participants of the last Super Bowl between these two teams.\n\nPatriots QB Drake Maye in particular is a new face on the Super Bowl stage, as he will become the second-youngest quarterback in NFL history to start a Super Bowl at just 23 and was still in high school when Tom Brady left New England six years ago.\n\nWhile the quarterbacks will receive the bulk of the attention, the Patriots and Seahawks bring two vaunted defenses shaped in the image of their defensive-minded head coach. Points could be at a premium, but nothing is guaranteed as a wild NFL season comes to a close.\n\nHere's what you need to know to watch the Super Bowl, including start time and TV info.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will kickoff at about 6:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. local time) from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nFor Seahawks fans and anyone else tuning in on the west coast, where the game is being played, Super Bowl 60 will start at 3:30 p.m. PT.\n\nFans in the Central Time Zone don't have the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl this year, but they can expect to see Super Bowl 60 kick off at 5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nFor fans in the mountain time zone, the Super Bowl kicks off at 4:30 p.m. MT.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will be broadcast nationally on NBC, with Mike Tirico (play-by-play) and Cris Collinsworth (color analyst) on the call.

    "fullText": "Ohio State coaches to win a Super Bowl: Mike Vrabel has chance to join exclusive group originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMike Vrabel's coaching career started at his alma mater Ohio State.\n\nVrabel, however, admitted that it was not the best start at a Super Bowl 60 press conference on Tuesday. The New England Patriots coach detailed a story he tells coaches who ask about the interview process.\n\n\"Nobody is going to have a worse first interview than I did,\" Vrabel said at his press conference. \"I wasn't prepared. I sat down with Urban Meyer in front of a staff, interviewed for a position and completely bombed it and had no idea.\"\n\n\"That's probably my first adversity.\"\n\nIt's safe to say Vrabel has figured it out. The former Ohio State All-American got his first coaching job with the Buckeyes, and he has worked his way into a chance to become the second former Ohio State player to win a Super Bowl as a head coach when the Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday.\n\nWho was the other coach? That's an interesting trivia question.\n\nMORE: Revisting Mike Vrabel's time as a Patriots linebacker\n\nVrabel played defensive line at Ohio State from 1993-96. He was a two-time All-American who still holds the school's career record with 36 sacks. He set a school record with 13 sacks in 1995, which stood until 2007.\n\nThe Buckeyes were 22-3 in Vrabel's final two seasons, including a 12-1 record in his senior season. That Ohio State team featured Hall of Fame tackle Orlando Pace and a defensive line led by Matt Finkes and Luke Fickell, now the coach at Wisconsin.\n\nOhio State lost the regular-season finale to No. 21 Michigan 13-9  but beat No. 2 Arizona State 20-17 in the 1997 Rose Bowl. Vrabel did not win a national championship as a player at Ohio State.\n\nHe coached for the Buckeyes as a defensive line and linebackers coach from 2011-13 before taking a job as a linebackers coach with the Houston Texans in 2013. Ohio State won the national championship the following season under Meyer.\n\nMORE: Inside Mike Vrabel's playoff record as a coach\n\nOhio State has five coaches who won national championships in college in Paul Brown, Woody Hayes, Jim Tressel, Urban Meyer and Ryan Day.\n\nBrown led the Buckeyes to a national championship in 1942 as a head coach before winning three NFL championships with the Cleveland Browns in 1950, 1954 and 1955. Brown also was the owner of the Cincinnati Bengals from 1967-91 – and the franchise made two Super Bowl appearances in 1981 and 1988. Brown, however, never won the Super Bowl as a head coach.\n\nOne of Brown's former players did. Don McCafferty played offensive line for Paul Brown on that 1942 national championship team. McCafferty was the head coach for the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 5 on Jan 17, 1971. Baltimore beat Dallas 16-13 on a field goal by Jim O'Brien with five seconds remaining.\n\nSo, Vrabel would be the first coach from Ohio State to win a Super Bowl since McCafferty, which is a nice piece of Super Bowl trivia ahead of Sunday's game.\n\nMORE: Complete coaching timeline for Mike Vrabel, from Ohio State to Patriots\n\nHere is a look at every Super Bowl coach and the college they attended. Miami, Ohio, has the most Super Bowl coaches with three, a group that includes Weeb Ewbank, John Harbaugh and Sean McVay. Coaches are in alphabetical order by college:\n\nOregon, San Mateo, Grays Harbor, Cal Poly\n\nWake Forest, Butler (Kan.), Nebraska\n\n36, 38, 39, 42, 46, 49, 51, 52, 53",

    "description": "It’s Super Bowl week, and even though the Minnesota Vikings will not partake in the event — they haven’t for […]",
    "fullText": "It’s Super Bowl week, and even though the Minnesota Vikings will not partake in the event — they haven’t for about 50 years — the rumor mill remains active. These are some of the top theories in the purple team’s orbit.\n\nAll three threads point to an offseason defined by QB changes, front office power, and cap maintenance.\n\nThe offseason will turn white hot in one month when free agency kicks off.\n\nThe Purple Rumor Mill for Saturday, February 7th, 2026.\n\nRumor: Fansided claims Mac Jones could be a Viking in 2026.\n\nChristopher Kline mapped out the league’s 10 splashiest trade candidates last week, pairing each with a projected landing spot. On a potential Jones-to-Minnesota scenario, he wrote, “Mac Jones and Kyle Shanahan finally lived their shared dream when the former first-round pick filled in for an injured Brock Purdy this season. Shanahan reportedly preferred Jones over Trey Lance back in the 2021 draft.”\n\nThat belief showed up on the field. “It seems like he was onto something, as Jones delivered impressive results in eight starts for the San Francisco 49ers. He completed 69.4 percent of his passes and threw 13 touchdowns to six interceptions. Purdy is still the 49ers’ franchise QB, however, so it would make sense to cash in while Jones’ stock is high.”\n\nJones didn’t merely stabilize the 49ers’ offense in 2025; he ran it with command. The performance even created a tiny bit of friction among the fan base. Some 49ers fans were impressed enough during those eight starts to argue that Jones should remain in the lineup while Purdy took a seat.\n\nKline also pointed to uncertainty on Minnesota’s side: “It’s unclear how much the Minnesota Vikings trust J.J. McCarthy at this point. The decision to move on from Sam Darnold has aged like milk; even if Minnesota still believes in McCarthy long term, finding a competent bridge quarterback should be an offseason priority.”\n\n“The Vikings’ offense borrows liberally from Shanahan’s scheme. Darnold went from backup duty in San Francisco to starter in Minnesota and blossomed. Perhaps Jones can follow a similar arc.”\n\nFrom a schematic standpoint, Jones would thrive in Minnesota. It’s just unclear if the 49ers are willing to get rid of the top insurance policy in the NFL.\n\nRumor: George Paton may be the frontrunner to replace Kwesi Adofo-Mensah.\n\nIt could be Paton as the Vikings’ next top boss.\n\nThe Athletic’s Dianna Russini wrote late last week, “On Friday, Wilf did not rule out Brzezinski emerging as a candidate for the full-time general manager role. Multiple league sources believe he would be deserving of consideration.” She added, “Another name circulating in conversations with league sources is former Vikings executive and current Broncos general manager George Paton, who still has strong internal relationships.”\n\nPaton circling back to Minnesota carries obvious logic, given his 14 seasons with the organization before landing the top job in Denver. His contract with the Broncos runs through the 2026 season, creating a defined window. One year left.\n\nBased on Russini’s reporting, the timing remains open-ended. The Vikings could explore Paton as early as 2026, or they could take a longer view and wait until the following offseason if circumstances align.\n\nIn the meantime, interim general manager Rob Brzezinski controls a critical stretch. The next three months will matter — a lot. He’s been part of the Vikings’ operation since 1999, and few executives in the league have his institutional staying power. If Brzezinski, alongside Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores, navigates free agency and the draft cleanly, the pressure to install a new general manager will diminish.\n\nRumor: T.J. Hockenson continues to be mentioned as a roster cut possibility.\n\nHockenson’s cap number sits just north of $21 million in 2026. Brzezinski has restructuring options available, but CBS Sports‘ Joel Corry, a former NFL agent, recently projected a release as the realistic outcome.\n\nCorry pointed to a clear production drop-off following Hockenson’s major knee injury. “Hockenson production has significantly declined since having 95 catches for 960 yards with five touchdowns before tearing the ACL and MCL in his right knee 15 games into the 2023 season,” he explained.\n\n“In the two seasons after the knee injury, Hockenson has 92 catches for 893 yards and three touchdowns in 19 games. Hockenson averaged a career-low 29.2 receiving yards per game this season.”\n\nFrom a roster-management standpoint, the financial incentive is obvious. A post–June 1 designation would free up as much as $16 million in cap space, giving Minnesota flexibility at a position where cost and output are totally out of alignment.\n\nHockenson as a cut candidate is a familiar theory so far this offseason. Fans will get a verdict on it in the next few weeks.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX is right around the corner, and the Ohio State Buckeyes are going to be decently represented inside the white lines on Sunday.\n\nOn one side, it will be future star running back TreVeyon Henderson, and on the other side will be the Offensive Player of the Year in Jaxon Smith-Njigba.\n\nSmith-Njigba has been all over the news lately, and it had me thinking about his best games as a Buckeye. His career ended in such a way, with his last season being lost due to a nagging hamstring injury, that many forget how electric JSN actually was. We look back at his Top-5 Games as a Buckeye.\n\nThe Buckeyes were rolling through their schedule after a week two loss to the Oregon Ducks earlier in the season. They went through the middle part of their Big Ten schedule with some weird wins, and they found themselves in a trap game before The Game. It was hardly a trap game as the Buckeyes came out and demolished the Spartans from snap one till 0:00s.\n\nJSN got off for 10 catches for 105 yards and a score against Spartans. Ohio State took a 49-0 lead into halftime and showed the country its dominance, if only for a week.\n\nOhio State Has HUGE Week: React to the Arthur Smith Hire and Examine the Buckeyes' Crazy Schedule The Ohio State Buckeyes made big waves to start the week with the signing of Arthur Smith as their offensive coordinator in a move that surprised a ton of pe...\n\nOh man, JSN was on a hot streak to end the 2021 season. He had eight straight games of 5-plus catches and 97-plus yards. This game against Purdue was one of his best as he again proved that he was unguardable.\n\nSmith-Njigba was having these numbers and this type of production with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson on the roster alongside him. This might have been Ohio State's best offensive team in recent history, and he was at the center of it. Nine for 139 and one en route to a 59-31 victory.\n\nOhio State welcomed the Oregon Ducks to Columbus and was met with a bit of a rude awakening. Oregon came in and matched Ohio State punch for punch and outdueled JSN on one of those types of days.\n\nSmith-Njigba was unguardable against one of the best teams in America, but this was the first time this year that Ohio State's defense proved to be an absolute liability and ultimately the downfall of their team.\n\nTricked you! You definitely thought this was going to be his No. 1 game, and it probably should be, but there is a performance out there that was better and was more important. This game was off the charts.\n\nBoth Olave and Wilson decided to sit out to prepare for the NFL Draft, so it was just CJ Stroud and JSN making plays, and plays were made.\n\nTikTok · Wheels-Ohio State Buckeyes 216 likes, 2 comments. “Ohio State WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba LEGENDARY Highlights vs Utah | 2021 College Football”\n\nUnguardable, unstoppable, uncontainable, special. However you want to slice it, you were right. This, unfortunately, meaningless game, was Smith-Njigba's best statistical performance.\n\nThe Buckeyes squared off with the 3-6 Nebraska Cornhuskers in an admittedly tough place to play - Lincoln, Nebraska. Ohio State was a huge favorite and unfortunately, sleptwalked their way into this matchup.\n\nThey were up 17-10 at halftime and just 23-17 heading into the fourth quarter. Had it not been for Smith-Njigba's ridiculous performance, this could have been a very very bad loss.\n\nFor that reason, this is my No. 1 JSN performance as a Buckeye.\n\nBuckeye Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots returned to Stanford Stadium on Friday afternoon to wrap up their on-field preparation for Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks. They will hold a final walkthrough on Saturday, but they hay is very much in the barn now.\n\nPatriots pool reporter Linsday Jones was once again at hand to provide updates, just like she did following practice updates on Wednesday and on Thursday.\n\nThe Patriots largely opted against “switching the macaroni” in their final practice of the season, including having assistant coaches go against each other in a lighthearted series of drills. Those coaching drills came after a stretching period early in practice and have become a fixture for the team on Fridays.\n\n“It’s Friday, we’re 48 hours before the game, and that’s just how we normally operate,” head coach Mike Vrabel explained after the session.\n\nSeattle went for a similar approach. Per Seahawks pool reporter Kalyn Kahler, they went with a typical Friday program they refer to as ACT: alignment, communication, technique.\n\nFollowing a special teams segment, Vrabel sent the entire team to the locker room where it spent 14 minutes to simulate the halftime on Sunday. While normal NFL games have 13 minutes between whistles, the Super Bowl’s intermission is longer and thus a change from the established rhythm.\n\nWhen the Patriots returned from the Stanford Stadium locker room, they held team drills featuring the starting offense and defense both going up against the scout team. Afterwards, Vrabel gathered his team for a final huddle before smaller groups of players continued working individually.\n\nThe final players to leave the field were quarterback Drake Maye, tight end Hunter Henry and rookie wide receiver Efton Chism. In all, practice lasted just under 90 minutes compared to the Seahawks clocking in at 96.\n\nFor the first time all week — and in fact since before the divisional playoff round — the Patriots had full attendance at practice. This meant that both off-ball linebacker Robert Spillane and edge defender Harold Landry were available, albeit in limited capacity and later receiving the questionable designation.\n\n“They’re doing everything they can to be ready for the football game and we’ll see how they respond from practice today,” said Vrabel.\n\nSeattle, meanwhile, listed one player — fullback Robbie Ouzts — on its injury report. Safety Nick Emmanwori, who sprained his ankle on Wednesday and was subsequently held out of Thursday’s session, took a normal workload on Friday and was removed from the list.",

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs played an instrumental role in the New England Patriots making it to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowler not only led New England in targets (102), receptions (85) and receiving yards (1,013) during the regular season but gave the offense a veteran presence in the locker room.\n\nDiggs revealed this week that he nearly joined the Patriots’ AFC Championship Game opponent — the Denver Broncos — over the offseason due in part to their head coach, Sean Payton.\n\n“I played against Sean Payton a lot. I’ve seen what his offense can do. So, that was the one thing,” the pass-catcher said, according to the Boston Herald’s Andrew Callahan. “And then a couple of people on the staff that I knew. (Quarterbacks coach) Davis Webb, I was familiar with. He helped me out a lot in Buffalo as far as learning the plays. … That’s kind of how it ended up happening.”\n\nDiggs added that in the end, New England’s decision to hire head coach Mike Vrabel last January, plus the presence of quarterback Drake Maye, influenced his final decision.\n\n“And in weighing my options on what’s going to be the best, I also like coach (Vrabel.) I had a little bit of interaction with him at the Pro Bowl and stuff like that,” the 32-year-old said, per Callahan. “And they had a young quarterback. They both had young quarterbacks. When you weigh all the pros and cons, I felt the Patriots were probably going to be the best fit.”\n\nEx-Patriots QB Joe Milton Dishes On Rumored Feud With Drake Maye",

    "description": "I make the same Buffalo chicken dip recipe for every party, game day, and the Super Bowl. It takes only six ingredients.",
    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is just around the corner, and this easy slow-cooker Buffalo chicken dip is guaranteed to be the MVP at any party.\n\nPractically every time I entertain friends — be it for game day, the Super Bowl, or any party — I'm always asked if I'll be making my famous Buffalo chicken dip.\n\nOver the years, I've tweaked recipes I've seen online to come up with the easiest, most crowd-pleasing dip. It requires only six main ingredients, plus seasonings you'll probably already have in your pantry.\n\nHere's how to make my easy slow-cooker Buffalo chicken dip.\n\nTo make the dip, which feeds about 10 people, you'll need:\n\nI like to use rotisserie chicken for this recipe because it's often easier and cheaper than buying chicken breasts and boiling them myself. I find that the rotisserie chicken also packs much more flavor, and saves me from having to do any actual cooking.\n\nWhen it comes to game-day recipes, easiest is usually best.\n\nI usually do this step by hand, but you can also use two forks to shred your chicken. By the end, you should have about 3 cups of shredded rotisserie chicken.\n\nThis helps ensure the cream cheese melts evenly and is well-distributed throughout the dip.\n\nYou can use full-fat or low-fat cream cheese for this dip, depending on your preference — I've had success using both.\n\nI usually eyeball how much seasoning I use, but typically go for about a tablespoon of garlic powder, a tablespoon of salt, and a few dashes of pepper.\n\nI use 1 cup of shredded, low-moisture mozzarella cheese and 1 cup of shredded sharp-cheddar cheese.\n\nI use a whole 12-ounce bottle of Frank's RedHot Buffalo sauce, but you can use whichever brand of Buffalo sauce you prefer. I then add ½ cup of ranch dressing on top.\n\nYou don't need to overmix it — as the dip cooks, the ingredients will melt and combine.\n\nScoop along the sides to make sure nothing is sticking to the walls, put the lid on the slow cooker, and walk away. It's that easy.\n\nI stir the dip with a wooden spoon a couple of times while it's cooking to prevent any spots from burning on the side and to help it cook evenly.\n\nThe dip should be smooth and slightly bubbling when it's done, with all the cream cheese and cheeses fully melted and combined.\n\nWhether you're making it for the Super Bowl, a last-minute party, or an easy weeknight snack for the whole family, this six-ingredient slow-cooker Buffalo chicken dip is proof that crowd-pleasing food doesn't have to be complicated.\n\nSimply toss everything in, let it cook, and you'll end up with a creamy, spicy dip that disappears almost as fast as it comes together.",

    "description": "I tried Rachael Ray's seven-layer dip, a party appetizer made with beans, homemade guacamole, and salsa. It was perfect for the Super Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Ray's recipe called for 19 ingredients, including tomatoes, cilantro, avocados, hot sauce, olives, two kinds of salsa, beans, and citrus. Her recipe also required sour cream, which I substituted with Greek yogurt.\n\nLooking at the long list of ingredients at the grocery store, I was skeptical that Ray's recipe would be as easy as some of her others. This recipe required a lot of chopping, as well as homemade guacamole.\n\nI also noticed Ray's recipe didn't include any cheese or meat, which made me wonder how flavorful it would be.\n\nI started by prepping the vegetables and herbs. I cut the green onions into one-inch pieces and picked all the cilantro leaves off the stems.\n\nI minced the garlic and jalapeño, diced the plum tomatoes, and sliced the avocados in half. This was the most tedious part of Ray's recipe.\n\nAfter prepping the veggies and herbs, I heated the refried beans in a pan and seasoned them with 2 tablespoons of hot sauce.\n\nI cooked them for two minutes, scooped them out with a spatula, and layered them in a glass casserole dish.\n\nNext, I added extra-virgin olive oil to the same pan, seared the green onions for a few minutes, and mixed in the tomatillo salsa verde. This step took only a few minutes before it was ready to add to the casserole dish.\n\nFinally, I seasoned the black beans with 2 teaspoons of cumin and added them to the same pan. Once this layer was heated through, I added it to the casserole dish and dumped a 16-ounce jar of chipotle salsa on top.\n\nWhile some of the mixtures were cooking, I combined Greek yogurt with the lime juice and zest.\n\nOnce I was finished with the layers that needed to be heated, I spread the Greek-yogurt mixture over the chipotle salsa. This is when the dip started to look messy — as hard as I tried, it was almost impossible to keep the chipotle salsa and yogurt separate.\n\nI made guacamole by using a fork to mash two ripe avocados with minced garlic, jalapeño, lemon juice, and salt. I layered it on top of the Greek yogurt.\n\nAs a final step, I sprinkled the diced tomatoes and sliced Spanish olives on top.\n\nConsidering how messy some layers got, I was surprised by how aesthetically pleasing the finished dip looked. The freshly chopped tomatoes, sliced olives, and chunky guacamole added appealing colors and textures.\n\nFrom the side, though, I was disappointed that there weren't more distinct layers. After all, this is meant to be a layered dip.\n\nI enjoyed the flavor combinations, like the smoky chipotle salsa and tangy Greek yogurt. Thanks to the creaminess of the yogurt and the savory beans, I didn't miss having meat or cheese.\n\nThe sour citrus, smoky salsas, flavorful tomatoes, and chunky guacamole made Ray's dip taste fresher and lighter than I'd expect from a layered appetizer.\n\nHowever, the texture of the dip was runnier than I would've liked. I made sure to drain the beans and any extra liquid from the salsas, so I'm not sure what happened.\n\nThe layers also blended together as I ate, making it look more like a sauce. I think adding something crunchy, like diced red onions, would prevent this. As it was, the size of the 1-inch green-onion slices made it hard to get any of that flavor or texture in a bite.\n\nThough the dip wasn't perfect, it was still a really tasty appetizer.\n\nMy boyfriend and I inhaled a quarter of the dip in about 15 minutes, so it got full points in the flavor department. Despite the long ingredient list, it was deceptively easy to make.\n\nNext time, I might make a few modifications, like adding diced onions to mix. However, I'll definitely be remaking Ray's dip for future dinner parties.\n\nThis story was originally published in February 2024, and most recently updated on February 6, 2026.",

    "description": "There are free and paid ways to get NBC's full coverage of Super Bowl LX.",
    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 8 at 6:30 p.m. ET. This year's broadcast, hosted on NBC, includes pregame coverage starting at 1 p.m. ET and a pregame show featuring Green Day at 6 p.m. ET. Even if you don't have cable, there are a few ways, both paid and free, that you can watch all the action live from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA.\n\nThe game will be shown on NBC-owned streaming service Peacock, which is available on the web as well as iOS, Android, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. Peacock doesn't have a free trial, and you have to Or you can pay $17 per month for ad-free Premium Plus (live sports still have ads).\n\nThere are a few ways to get around subscribing at full price. Peacock Premium is a perk of both a Walmart+ subscription ($98 per year after a 30-day free trial) and an Instacart+ subscription ($99 per year after a 14-day free trial), so if you have or would benefit from either of these services, now may be the time to sign up. Students qualify for a discounted rate of $6 per month for Peacock Premium. Note that Peacock will also have streaming and on-demand coverage of the Winter Olympics, which begin this weekend, so subscribing for a month may be well worth $11.\n\nThere are a handful of streaming services with live TV that include NBC. Before signing up, check the channel listings for your zip code to confirm NBC is available in your local market.\n\nDirectTV Stream: $50 per month for the first month with current promotions, 5-day free trial\n\nHulu + Live TV: $90 per month, 3-day free trial (includes ads on Hulu)\n\nYouTube TV: Currently $70 per month with promo, 21-day free trial for new users\n\nSling TV (in limited markets): $46 per month\n\nWhen signing up for a free trial, make sure you know when you'll be billed for a paid subscription and cancel before your trial expires. The game will be available in 4K for YouTube TV subscribers (included in the free trial but at an additional fee or at a higher tier with paid plans). The Spanish-language broadcast will be on Telemundo, which is also available on most live TV streaming services.\n\nAnother free (ish) way to get the game is with over-the-air (OTA) TV. Of course, this requires you to invest in a digital TV antenna and have a place to put it that gets good reception. You should check the FCC's reception map to see what signals are available in your area and try your antenna out before game day. Your mileage may vary, so if you want a stress-free watch experience, this probably isn't the best option.\n\nYou can also watch the game through the NFL+ mobile app—a subscription costs $7 per month. Fubo previously carried NBC channels but has been in a contract dispute with NBCUniversal since last 2025.",

    "description": "Waymo has control over where its robotaxi fleet is stationed, allowing the company to respond to temporary high-demand events like the Super Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Here's one way robotaxi companies might have leverage over traditional ride-hailing services: absolute fleet control.\n\nSuper Bowl weekend has arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is projected to attract around 90,000 visitors. The big game will be hosted in Santa Clara at Levi's Stadium.\n\nMassive events like this are major stress tests for ride-hailing services. The demand can easily exceed the supply — that is, the number of available human drivers — leading to higher costs and longer wait times.\n\nAlphabet's Waymo told Business Insider that it can prepare for the showdown because it can fine-tune how many robotaxis approach the stadium — and when.\n\n\"Because we control all aspects of the fleet — the location of all of the vehicles at any point in time, the matching and the routing that happens — we can do interesting things, like when we know there's going to be a big demand surge, we can position more of our fleet down there and we can do that dynamically,\" Chris Ludwick, Waymo's senior director for ride-hailing commercialization, told Business Insider.\n\nUber and Lyft, which rely only on human drivers in the Bay Area for the time being, have some mechanisms in place to prepare for high-surge events.\n\nThe companies can prepare in advance with organizers and local municipalities to coordinate pickup locations. They can also respond to demand by offering incentives or bonuses to human drivers to serve the area on a specific day and time.\n\nOn Lyft, drivers can see bonus areas in advance.\n\nHowever, those responses are not a perfect science, as long wait times and high prices during large events have essentially become commonplace expectations for customers.\n\nRide-hailing companies can try to incentivize workers, but there's no guarantee that enough drivers will be in the area at the exact moment a surge occurs.\n\nFlooding the zone with a lot of drivers isn't necessarily the solution either. Too many drivers can exacerbate traffic congestion and create a supply shortage in other areas outside the hot spot.\n\nLudwick told Business Insider that Waymo had prepared a plan in advance to deploy more of its fleet in the South Bay Area, where the Super Bowl will be hosted, and that the robotaxis would be positioned near the stadium but not too close as to create congestion.\n\n\"And then we're ready to do more or do less depending on how the dynamic conditions are,\" he said.\n\nSpokespeople for Lyft and Uber declined to provide a comment.\n\nTotal control may be one of the advantages of having a fleet of autonomous vehicles in a future where robotaxi operators successfully scale up.\n\nFor now, Waymo operates a fleet of around 1,000 cars in the San Francisco Bay Area — likely far below the number of human ride-hail drivers in the region. Uber and Lyft don't disclose driver presence by city, but in 2017, the San Francisco Treasurer's Office pegged the number at around 45,000 drivers in SF alone.\n\nWaymo also implements surge pricing, like traditional ride-hailing services, when demand is high.\n\nUber and Lyft have said that the limited robotaxi fleet is part of the reason they envision a hybrid ecosystem of robot and human drivers for years to come.\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has previously said that AV-only fleets face the challenge of running a \"highly underutilized network (if supply is built for peak demand) or a highly unreliable network at peak periods (if supply is built for anything less than peak).\"\n\n\"It is important to note that even in San Francisco, 1P AV services are already leaving a lot of demand on the table during peak hours, with average ETAs that are at least 25% higher than Uber as of Q4,\" Khosrowshahi said in prepared remarks for the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nDuring crowded events, robotaxis will also have to navigate temporary road closures, heavy traffic, and the unpredictable behavior of pedestrians. Videos on social media have shown how Waymo's robotaxis can get stuck near first-responder scenes or unexpected power outages.\n\nLudwick said Waymo has experience operating in complex environments, citing the company's operations at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\n\"We're doing over a thousand trips a day to Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, and that's at the terminals where there's other vehicle traffic doing pick-ups and drop-offs at the same place,\" he said. \"We're very capable of interacting in complex environments, and that's just necessary.\"",

    "description": "Both Patriots coach Mike Vrabel and Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold are headed to the big game despite previously getting cast aside by other teams.",
    "fullText": "For anyone who's been handed a pink slip, this year's Super Bowl offers more than just sports and music.\n\nIt is also a rare display of workplace vindication.\n\nOn Sunday, the New England Patriots face off against the Seattle Seahawks for the finale of the 2025-26 NFL season. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel and Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold were both previously with teams that cast them aside — most of which failed to even make it to the playoffs this year.\n\nOf course, getting dumped comes with the territory in pro sports. Vrabel was fired as the head coach of the Tennessee Titans in early 2024 after a power struggle with ownership, while Darnold was passed over by four previous teams: the Minnesota Vikings, San Francisco 49ers, the Carolina Panthers, and the New York Jets.\n\nNow, both Vrabel and Darnold are at the top of their game, their old bosses are sidelined, and one is guaranteed to walk away with a trophy. (If you're a Simpsons fan, cue Nelson Muntz's \"Ha ha!\")\n\n\"It's proof that a different environment makes a huge difference in terms of your potential,\" said Roy Cohen, a career coach in New York.\n\nThe same logic applies to the business world. Some people lose jobs because they aren't a good fit, only to later thrive at other companies.\n\n\"A bad marriage doesn't mean you're destined to always have a bad marriage,\" said Cohen.\n\nGetting fired can be a powerful motivator for people to level up their career, said Dana Sumpter, associate professor of organization theory and management at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School.\n\n\"That means I'm going to double down on my efforts at the next place, not only to ensure that this doesn't happen again, but also to show my former employer, 'Look what you lost,' \" she said.\n\nA client of Nashville-based career coach Bryan Creely initially took a hit to his self-confidence after being sacked from a healthcare startup a few years ago. The client then changed his attitude, launched a job search, and is now in a better-paying, more senior role at a company where he feels valued.\n\nCreely said that kind of end result is common. \"In almost every case, people tend to come out stronger,\" he said.\n\nFeeling hurt, angry, or both is natural after losing a job, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n\"Of course, we have revenge fantasies,\" said Laura Greve, a clinical psychologist in Boston for C-suite executives, politicians, and other high achievers — and a Patriots fan.\n\nIt's not wise, though, to lash out against your former employer or the individual who let you go.\n\n\"Trying to convince somebody that they've mistreated you is something I often have to counsel people against,\" she said. \"That's not productive.\"\n\nInstead, Greve recommends pouring your energy into landing a better role elsewhere — just like Sunday's matchup shows. Getting further ahead in your career at another company can be highly satisfying, especially if your old boss is likely to hear about it. The leaders of the teams that Vrabel and Darnold used to work for are undoubtedly aware that both men have moved on to new gigs where they're excelling.\n\n\"You're looking for restorative justice,\" said Greve.\n\nLikewise, don't gloat to former colleagues or in social-media posts after achieving a career upgrade, or you might hurt your future career prospects, warned Cohen. When verifying your work history, prospective employers may learn about your bravado and not appreciate it.\n\n\"It's not unusual for hiring managers to just pick up the phone and call their buddies at other companies for the down low,\" he said. \"You don't want to burn any bridges, even with employers who treated you badly.\"",

    "description": "We look at the key players and key battles that will decide whether the Seattle Seahawks or New England Patriots will win Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara.",
    "fullText": "In terms of the pre-season betting odds this is the most unlikely Super Bowl match-up for years, but there's no denying the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots deserve to be here.\n\nThe pair have shown different strengths and weaknesses but throughout an unpredictable season they have had long winning streaks and shown enviable consistency.\n\nThe Seahawks are the 4.5-point favourites in Santa Clara but in terms of the numbers there is not much between them at all, so expect this one to be a close call.\n\nIt could come down to a play here, a play call there and perhaps the finest of margins making the biggest of differences - Super Bowl's can by won and lost in the blink of an eye.\n\nSo let's see how the two sides match-up, what the key battles will be and exactly where Super Bowl 60 will be decided.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nBoth sides finished 14-3, won eight games on the road and developed a serious winning habit.\n\nThe Patriots lost their three games by a combined 19 points and the Seahawks lost theirs by just nine in total, so they are both tough to beat.\n\nThis is the first Super Bowl meeting between two teams that finished with both top four scoring offences and scoring defences, showing how well rounded they are.\n\nNew England scored just seven points more than Seattle as they finished second and third on offence, while the Seahawks had the best scoring defence in the league.\n\nThe Pats locked it down in the post-season though. Despite scoring the fewest points ever in three play-off games (54) the defence allowed just 26 points, the second-fewest ever, to fight into the Super Bowl.\n\nSeattle blew away the 49ers then won a shootout with the Rams, and with the better skill position players and quick-strike offence they should have the firepower to win another.\n\nThe Pats will be looking for a tense, tight defensive scuffle in a bid to win a record seventh Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe term 'game manager' has become an insult to modern quarterbacks but that's exactly what you need to win a Super Bowl - especially this Super Bowl with two defences who have conceded an average of just over 17 points per game this season.\n\nDrake Maye is bidding to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and has had a surgical sophomore season setting records for accuracy even Tom Brady could not match.\n\nSam Darnold's ultimate redemption story could take him from worst to first but even after a super showing to get Seattle here, there are still some doubters around.\n\nSo both will have to handle the pressure of the huge occasion and also of two opposing defences that will be hunting them down. How they deal with that will be key.\n\nMaye's antidote will be his running ability. Excluding kneeldowns he has gained 6.13 yards per carry this season and with 12 of his 16 play-off runs going for a touchdown or first down he's being used in those vital moments.\n\nSeattle need to find a way to bottle him up.\n\nDarnold's not a runner but has the league's top receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to throw to in times of stress and his arm talent is now undeniable. So is his temperament after nine game-winning drives in the past two seasons.\n\nNeither will have felt anything like this pressure though and with solid defences behind them there is no immediate need to play the hero. Whoever manages the game better will hoist the Lombardi.\n\nTeams that have won the turnover battle in the Super Bowl have a 40-7 record. Enough said?\n\nIn a post-season littered with close games turnovers proved crucial - both teams had vital takeaways to win their Championship games and they were first and second in turnover differential in the play-offs.\n\nDarnold struggled all season in this area, leading the league with 20 turnovers, and despite Seattle having zero in the play-offs that will be an area the Patriots hope to exploit.\n\nCoaches will be preaching ball security to everyone all week.\n\nSpeaking of coaches, they can make or break a game from the sideline. Just ask Pete Carroll from this very fixture 11 years ago with that infamous decision to throw on the one-yard line costing Seattle the Super Bowl against the Patriots.\n\nBoth head coaches have been incredible this season - Mike Macdonald is a defensive genius having now built a top defence at previous side Baltimore and in Seattle.\n\nHe's young and one worry is that with him still calling the defensive plays it all may be a bit much in his first Super Bowl.\n\nMike Vrabel can become the first man to win a Super Bowl as head coach and player with the same team, and he could have an ace up his sleeve with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.\n\nA huge success with Tom Brady, this will be a 10th Super Bowl as a coach for McDaniels. In the hardest game to keep your head could that experience be the difference?\n\nThe defensive front seven are the wrecking crews of the NFL, tasked with, among other things, making life as uncomfortable as possible for opposing quarterbacks.\n\nBoth sides excel here with terrific units and we've seen before how dominance here can decide the outcome of a Super Bowl.\n\nHarold Landry and K'Lavon Chaisson combined for 16 regular season sacks for New England, thanks to defensive tackles Christian Barmore and Milton Williams bringing constant interior pressure, collapsing pockets at will.\n\nThe Patriots made Williams the highest paid player in team history with a $104m deal in free agency last year, following a dominant Super Bowl display for the Eagles against Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs.\n\nIf he replicates that here then Darnold is in trouble.\n\nIt's Seattle, though, who could hold the advantage here as they are bringing a four-headed monster of Leonard Williams, Uchenna Nwosu, Byron Murphy and DeMarcus Lawrence who have combined for 30 sacks this season.\n\nLawrence, who left Dallas to win a Super Bowl, has had a sack and forced fumble in both play-off games so far and has been particularly impressive, but it's the danger right across the Seahawks defensive front that gives them the edge.\n\nAs the Patriots will make history by starting two rookies on their offensive line in Will Campbell and Jared Wilson - with left tackle Campbell, the man charged with protecting Maye's blindside, having some rookie struggles.\n\nMaye has been sacked 15 times in the play-offs, the record is 19, and if the two rookies fail to protect him again then it could get ugly - think Patrick Mahomes' two Super Bowl defeats by the Eagles and Buccaneers.\n\nSkill players scoring touchdowns make the headlines, but Super Bowls are won and lost in the trenches - and that battle on Maye's blindside could just decide the whole argument.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'",

The Patriots have a chance to pass them this weekend, however, if they’re able to upset the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAccordingly, it figures that either Pittsburgh or New England would have had the best play in Super Bowl history, which legendary broadcaster Al Michaels revealed this week during his appearance on the “Fitz And Whit” podcast.\n\nAl Michaels on James Harrison’s Super Bowl Pick six:\n\n\"You've got James Harrison what, for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history.”#steelers\n\nFitz and Whit pic.twitter.com/MIW81OEahF\n\n— Matthew Luciow (@matthewluciow92) February 5, 2026\n\nMichaels discussed the Steelers’ exciting 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, which featured a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown by Pittsburgh linebacker James Harrison off Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. The play set a Super Bowl record and gave the Steelers a 10-point lead heading into halftime.\n\n“You’ve got James Harrison with, what for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history. A hundred-yard interception return at the end of the half. Crazy, down the sideline, he’s almost getting tackled 15 times,” recalled Michaels, who called the game for NBC.\n\nEven though the play happened 17 years ago, Michaels still remembers it like it was yesterday.

    "fullText": "Days before Super Bowl LX, the Seattle Seahawks suddenly have an injury concern on the defensive side of the football\n\nStandout rookie safety Nick Emmanwori, a critical component of the Seahawks secondary and a contender for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, injured his ankle on Wednesday during practice ahead of Super Bowl LX. According to the pool practice report, Emmanwori was “limited in practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury that he suffered during practice.”\n\nAs the report notes, Emmanwori “walked off the field on his own shortly before 4 p.m. Several players and coaches went over to comfort him before he left.”\n\nAsked about the situation after practice, Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald stated that the safety “had an ankle today, we brought him in to look at it, and we’ll kind of go from here and figure out what are the next steps?”\n\nThe rookie safety is a key contributor to Seattle’s defense, the top scoring unit in the NFL. He has lined up all over the field for the Seahawks, spending most of his time down in the box but he has also seen time in the slot, on the outside, and even as a deep safety. His ability to be a stout defender against the run while holding up in coverage allows Seattle to rely on their sub defensive packages, while still being able to slow down opposing rushing attacks.\n\nHe was spotted walking under his own power into the team hotel following practice, but with a noticeable limp:\n\nPlease be alright Nick pic.twitter.com/8TUnAuiqy1\n\n— ᴅᴏxx ⚡️ (@new_era72) February 5, 2026\n\nHis health will be a huge story to follow ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nUpdate (Thursday evening): Emmanwori did not practice on Thursday due to the ankle injury:\n\nS Nick Emmanwori did not practice because of his ankle injury. https://t.co/J7upYXE0Ne\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 6, 2026",

Landry, who did not play in the conference championship game, said he was confident in his ability to play earlier this week, though missing practice after previously returning isn’t a great sign.\n\nDrake Maye, who suffered a shoulder injury during that same game, was previously listed as a limited participant on the injury report but remained a full participant for the second consecutive day.

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "As the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare for a high-stakes Super Bowl rematch at Levi’s Stadium, anytime touchdown props remain the most electric way to get skin in the game.\n\nWhether you’re banking on Kenneth Walker III to exploit a gap in the New England front or expecting Drake Maye to call his own number on a red-zone scramble, the anytime TD market allows you to turn every trip inside the 20 into a potential celebration.\n\nJoin us as we delve into this popular Super Bowl props market with odds, Super Bowl picks, and insightful TD trends.\n\nBettors have been banking big on Kenneth Walker III, who leads all players with four postseason touchdowns. That includes a sizzling three TD performance against the 49ers in which he ran for 116 yards on 19 carries.\n\nThe bruising back should continue to carry the load for the Seahawks, who will be without Zach Charbonnet, who sustained a season-ending ACL injury against San Francisco.\n\nLooking for extra value? Drake Maye's anytime TD odds have been boosted to +350 by our friends at BET99. You won't find a better price on this market in Canada.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson hasn't scored in the postseason yet, but he finished the regular season with at least one TD in three straight games, crossing the goal line a collective six times in those outings. Expect the Pats' RB1 to scamper into the end zone again on Sunday.\n\nRashid Shaheed is a home run threat and faces a man-heavy scheme from the Patriots, which also him to utilize his speed and seperation. Seattle is also using the WR in the running game with tricky handoffs. He has options on how to get inside the end zone.\n\nRead more of Jason's Super Bowl LX predictions and picks before game time.\n\nMack Hollins has been in and out of the lineup with injuries, but he logged more snaps during the AFC Conference Championship than any other New England Patriots wide receiver, signaling clear trust when he’s healthy. It’s a steep price, but one that makes sense for a receiver who should be competing for the team lead in targets.\n\nNot only is Drake Maye the only Patriot to score a rushing touchdown this postseason, but he's already logged 141 rushing yards on 24 carries against three elite defenses, including two games with double-digit attempts. Don't be surprised to see him call his own number when it matters most.\n\nElijah Arroyo is Josh's longshot Super Bowl TD pick. Although not a primary option, the Seahawks tight end is expected to see around 40% of the snaps and run roughly 30% of the routes.\n\nRead Josh's Super Bowl touchdown prop picks for even more analysis.\n\nJosh expects Stevenson to get all the work to the red zone, but Maye will take the ball over the threshold as the Seahawks have allowed just five RB rushing TDs this year. Shaheed, meanwhile, has breakaway speed and can contribute on both special teams and on offense, while Hollins' price is too long to not add for a +8500 monster moonshot.\n\nRead more of Josh's insights in his Seahawks vs. Patriots Predictions, Picks & Best Bets.\n\nAn anytime touchdown bet involves wagering on whether a specific player will score a touchdown at any point during the game, not just the first TD.\n\nFor example, if you bet on Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson to score an anytime touchdown and he finds the end zone at any time during the Super Bowl, you win the bet.\n\nThis type of bet is popular because it allows for more scoring opportunities, and you can often choose players based on advantageous matchups. The odds can vary based on the player’s scoring potential and the strength of the team’s offensive scheme.\n\nHere are some of the key factors oddsmakers consider when setting touchdown prop odds:\n\nPlayer performance: Historical data on a player's scoring ability, including past touchdowns, carries, and target share, is crucial.\n\nMatchup analysis: The opposing defense's strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, including how well they defend against specific positions.\n\nInjury reports: Injuries to key players can impact a player's likelihood of scoring. Check out our NFL Injuries page to stay up to date before making your wager.\n\nGame script: Oddsmakers consider potential game scenarios, such as whether a team is expected to be ahead or behind and how that may impact their strategy.\n\nPublic sentiment: Betting patterns and public perception can also sway odds. If a player is very popular or a big favorite, sportsbooks may adjust their odds to mitigate risk. You can check out our Covers NFL picks consensus to see how the public is leaning.\n\nThe Super Bowl has evolved into a pass-heavy spectacle, as seen in Super Bowl 59, where five of the seven total touchdowns were caught by wide receivers.\n\nThe table below tracks every anytime touchdown over the last decade of Super Bowls from Super Bowl 50 to Super Bowl 59.\n\nWRs have scored 50% of all TDs in the last 3 Super Bowls.\n\nOften all or nothing. Saquon Barkley had 25 carries but 0 TDs in SB 59.\n\nTravis Kelce has been the standard, but SB 59 saw a TE shutout.\n\nJalen Hurts holds the record with 4 career SB rushing TDs.\n\nCooper DeJean’s pick-6 in 2025 was the first since Super Bowl 50.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

This handy-dandy easy-read guide will make you an instant expert on some of the Super Bowl history at stake well before the Patriots and Seahawks take the field the following Sunday, Feb. 8 (6:30 p.m. ET, NBC/Peacock) at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.:\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60 between Patriots and Seahawks?\n\nSeahawks open as favorites over Patriots for Super Bowl 60\n\nMandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots are the latest of 10 Super Bowl team rematches. The Seahawks and Patriots played a 27-24 thriller in Super Bowl 49 in Arizona, with the Patriots denying the Seahawks a repeat ring. The Steelers-Cowboys have met in a record three Super Bowls. The other previous repeats are Dolphins-Washington, 49ers-Bengals, Cowboys-Bills, Patriots-Giants, Patriots-Eagles, Patriots-Rams, Chiefs-49ers and Chiefs-Eagles.\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots are still a very fresh Super Bowl matchup. Neither team has players left on rosters from Super Bowl 49 11 seasons ago. This is also the first time that neither coach-starting quarterback combination for both teams — Patriots' Mike Vrabel and Drake Maye nor the Seahawks' Mike Macdonald and Sam Darnold — since Super Bowl 47, with it was the Ravens (John Harbaugh-Joe Flacco) beating the 49ers (Jim Harbaugh-Colin Kaepernick) in Super Bowl 47.\n\nThe Patriots are better at winning odd-numbered Super Bowls than even ones. The Patriots can't love playing in Super Bowl 60, given they lost 20, 42, 46, 52. They are 2-4 when the Super Bowl is even coming off an odd regular season. They are 4-1 in previous odd Super Bowls, only losing 31 to the Packers but winning 39, 49, 51, 53. The Seahawks are hoping things will \"even\" out and they can improve to 1-1 against the Patriots in Super Bowls.\n\nThis is the third Super Bowl the 49ers have hosted. Their current home of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., also hosted the Broncos' win over the Panthers in Super Bowl 50, Peyton Manning's last NFL game. But the Bay Area also hosted Super Bowl 19, when Joe Montana led the 49ers over the Dolphins to victory at Stanford Stadium.\n\nCalifornia will be hosting its 14th Super Bowl. Other than the Bay Area's trio, Los Angeles, San Diego, Pasadena and Inglewood have hosted a combined 11 Super Bowls out of 60. Super Bowl 61 will make that number 15, with the Rams and Chargers hosting only five years after the Rams won Super Bowl 56 at SoFi Stadium.\n\nWhere is Super Bowl 60 located?\n\nWhat to know about Super Bowl 60 halftime show performance\n\nThis is Sam Darnold's second Super Bowl. If you're keeping score, it would be Darnold 2, and the rest of the vaunted 2018 quarterback draft class — Baker Mayfield, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson 0. Darnold was the backup to Brock Purdy during the 49ers' overtime loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl 58.\n\nThis is Drake Maye's second Super Bowl, too. If you count going as a fan at 13 years old to see his Charlotte hometown Carolina Panthers play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50, then the answer would be yes. That game was also played in Levi's Stadium.\n\nDarnold is 0-4 against the Patriots. That includes three times seeing ghosts as a Jets No. 3 overall draft pick in his three seasons with New York. He also went 0-1 facing the Patriots as the Panthers' starting QB in 2021. He lost to Tom Brady twice and then Cam Newton and Mac Jones once each, so this is his first time dueling Maye.\n\nDarnold's passing numbers are terrible combined when facing New England's defense: a TD to 9 interceptions, 52.0 completion percentage, 9 sacks, 5.4 yards per attempt, and a 41.2 rating. He is a much different QB, however, in the last two seasons with Minnesota and Seattle.\n\nDrake Maye is the second-youngest QB to start a Super Bowl. Dan Marino, who led the Dolphins to Super Bowl 19 vs. the 49ers as NFL MVP in 1984, was 23 years and 127 days old. Maye is next now, set for 23 years and 162 days old. Now Maye is trying to beat out Ben Roethlisberger, 23 years and 340 days old in Super Bowl 40, as the youngest starting QB to win the Super Bowl. Brady and Patrick Mahomes didn't win their first Super Bowls until they were 24.\n\nInside Super Bowl 60 broadcast team on NBC\n\nMaye (2024) and Darnold ('19) were both No. 3 overall picks in their drafts. They are the first QBs drafted in that spot to play in a Super Bowl since Falcons league MVP Matt Ryan, who lost in Super Bowl 51 when Brady and the Patriots made their epic comeback from 28-3 down.\n\nMaye is trying to become the fifth second-year starting QB to win a Super Bowl. In order since 1999, the four who did it before were Kurt Warner, Brady, Roethlisberger and Russell Wilson. Wilson did it most recently for the Seahawks in Super Bowl 48.\n\nDarnold is trying to become the second eighth-year starting QB to win a Super Bowl. The other was the Giants' Eli Manning, who won his second ring with the Giants after the 2011 season.\n\nMaye and Darnold can both thank Josh McCown for helping them develop into Super Bowl quarterbacks. Maye, in his 2019 junior year at Myers Park High School in Charlotte, had McCown as his quarterbacks coach. Darnold was backed up by McCown during his 2018 rookie season with the Jets. McCown became the quarterbacks coach of the Vikings in 2024 and was.a big reason Darnold landed in Minnesota to have his delayed breakout season.\n\nMaye (North Carolina) and Darnold (Southern California) are the first QBs to start a Super Bowl from their respective colleges. Maye is the first from UNC, the alma mater of Giants Super Bowl legend Lawrence Taylor. Darnold is the first from USC, who have four Super Bowl rings each from Ronnie Lott and Lynn Swann.\n\nSporting News expert predictions for Super Bowl 60\n\nSuper Bowl 60 picks against the spread\n\nMike Macdonald worked longest for John Harbaugh but also had one season with Jim Harbaugh. From coaching intern in 2014 to defensive coordinator in 2022-'23, McDonald spent nine spread-out seasons with the Ravens under John before becoming the Seahawkss' head coach in 2024. Macdonald was Jim's defensive coordinator at Michigan in 2021, three seasons before they won with Jesse Minnter at DC in '24. Minter replaced John as the Ravens' head coach in '26.\n\nKlint Kubiak is trying to win a Super Bowl as an offensive coordinator where his dad won as a head coach. Gary Kubiak led the Broncos to Super Bowl 50 victory over the Panthers 10 years ago at Levi's Stadium. His brother Klay Kubiak is looking for his first ring as 49ers' offensive coordinator, while his other brother Klein works as a Cowboys' personnel scout.\n\nJosh McDaniels is going for his seventh Super Bowl ring. McDaniels was an offensive assistant for Bill Belichick from 2001-2005 for his first three Patriots Super Bowl victories. He was Brady's offensive coordinator for the second trio of Patriots' rings, including the most recent win, over the Rams in Super Bowl 53. Now he can be the most decorated Patriot, other than owner Robert Kraft.\n\nMike Vrabel is trying to win his fourth Super Bowl ring. Vrabel won his three Super Bowls in the first half of the Patriots' dynasty with Brady and Belichick, serving as star linebacker and occasional red zone tight end.\n\nMike Vrabel would be the first person to win a Super Bowl as a player and coach for the same team. Mike Ditka, Tom Flores, Tony Dungy, and Doug Pederson all have won Super Bowls as players and coaches, but did it for two teams. Vrabel can make history by leading his former team to victory. John Elway is the only person to win a Super Bowl with his team as a player and general manager.\n\nWhy Seahawks' bold move to sign Sam Darnold paid off with return to Super Bowl\n\n3 reasons Patriots defense can dominate in Super Bowl 60\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba and Sam Darnold are trying for the rare Rose Bowl and Super Bowl MVP double. Only the Raiders and Stanford legend Jim Plunkett has pulled that off in both Pasadena and the Super Bowl. Christian McCaffrey fell just short of winning a Super Bowl with the 49ers, while Drew Brees would have done it had Purdue not to lost to Washington in his Rose Bowl.\n\nSmith-Njigba is trying to become the NFL's fifth reigning regular-season receiving yards leader to win the Super Bowl. The last to do this was JSN's teammate with the Rams, Cooper Kupp, after the 2021 season in Super Bowl 56. Before then, it was 49ers GOAT Jerry Rice twice and Cowboys Hall of Famer Drew Pearson once.\n\nKupp is trying to join the club of players to win Super Bowls with multiple teams. There have been 34 offensive players to win the Super Bowl with at least two teams and 64 overall, the latest being former Patriots and Chiefs guard Joe Thuney. The other wide receivers to do it are Billy Davis, Ed McCaffrey, Marcus Nash, Ricky Proehl and Torrey Smith. Linebacker Matt Millen is the only player to win Super Bowls with three teams.\n\nKupp is only one of four Seahawks with previous Super Bowl experience. Darnold and linebacker Ernest Jones, Kupp's fellow former Rams teammate, are two of the others. New running back Cam Akers rounds out the list, who was injured during the Rams' winning Super Bowl 56 run.\n\nMilton Williams is trying to win the Super Bowl with two teams in two years. He won a ring as an Eagles defensive tackle in Super Bowl 59 and is trying to do it as a Patriot in Super Bowl 60.  Only eight previous players have done this: Ken Norton Jr., Deion Sanders, Brandon Browner, Derrick Martin, Chris Long, LeGarrette Blount, LeSean McCoy and Kendall Blanton. Long and Blount went from winning Super Bowl 51 with the Patriots to winning Super Bowl 52 with the Eagles. Williams is going for the flip-flop of that accomplishment.\n\nThe Patriots have five players with previous Super Bowl experience. Williams won Super Bowl 59 with the Eagles, while Hollins joined Long and Blount on the Super Bowl 52 champions. Cornerback Carlton Davis won Super Bowl 55 with the Buccaneers. Linebacker Christian Ellis was on the Eagles team that lost Super Bowl 56. Hooper was a tight end for Ryan when the Falcons lost to the Patriots in Super 51.\n\nStefon Diggs is making his first Super Bowl after 80 career playoff receptions. He is No. 12 all-time in that category. Everyone ahead of him has played in a Super Bowl, with the exception of the Rams' Davante Adams (83 catches, No. 11), whose team lost to the Seahawks in the NFC championship game. Eight of the top 10 players ahead of both receivers have won Super Bowls, with Wes Welker (7th) and Andre Reed (10th) being the two exceptions.",

    "title": "Bosch is betting the Mayor of Flavortown can help it make an emotional connection with Super Bowl viewers",
    "description": "Bosch's North America president told Business Insider the Super Bowl ad is part of a strategy to grow awareness and sales in the US.",
    "fullText": "Bosch has been in the US for more than a century, yet it remains a surprisingly fuzzy brand for many American consumers. The German industrial heavyweight is betting that the \"Mayor of Flavortown,\" Guy Fieri, can help change that as it pours billions of dollars into the region.\n\nOn Thursday, Bosch released the ad it intends to air during the Super Bowl this weekend. It stars a remarkably different clean-shaven, conservatively dressed Fieri, who returns to his normal spiky-haired, brightly colored look when he uses Bosch products — from a circular saw to a cooktop. His French Bulldog, Cash, also has a cameo in the ad, which carries the tagline, \"Like a Bosch.\"\n\nBosch joins a crop of Super Bowl LX advertisers leaning on comedy and recognizable faces this year, as they look to grab attention and avoid controversy during a politically charged year. Major brands are spending more than ever on A-list celebrity talent in their marketing, with CMOs under pressure to produce ads that cut through and deliver meaningful results.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, Paul Thomas, president of Bosch North America, said the company hopes the big game ad will help improve its brand recognition. Through Fieri and the lighthearted, comedic tone of this year's spot, Bosch also wants to foster a stronger emotional connection between customers and the brand, he added. It marks a shift from Bosch's more traditional marketing, which typically focused on technical features.\n\n\"There are a lot of things we're trying to accomplish with the campaign, but primarily to show that the Bosch brand is something you can rely on and helps you improve your life,\" Thomas said.\n\nFieri was a \"no-brainer\" to help achieve these goals because he cooks and does his own construction, often using Bosch products.\n\n\"He represents the confidence, too,\" Thomas said.\n\nSuch was Fieri's transformation for this campaign that some social media users lambasted the celebrity chef's early teaser posts as \"AI slop.\" Bosch said it didn't use AI and instead relied on a makeup artist and some visual effects editing.\n\nA post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri)\n\nBosch is working toward a goal of North America contributing 20% of the company's global sales by 2030, up from around 18% in 2024. It's doubling down on certain categories — such as cordless power tools and home appliances — where Bosch lags rivals in market share. The company has announced more than $6 billion in US-based acquisitions since 2023.\n\nIts big push in the US comes as the company cuts costs elsewhere. Bosch recently confirmed it is cutting 20,000 jobs in Germany after its profits nearly halved last year. The industrial giant is facing competition from Chinese companies in its automotive business, as well as pressures from US tariffs and a decline in demand for household appliances.\n\nThe average price of a 30-second spot during this year's Super Bowl reached $8 million, with some slots fetching up to $10 million, per NBCUniversal, which is broadcasting the game. Thomas said the expenditure on the Super Bowl amid cost-cutting within its home business reflected the balance many companies need to make as they focus on growth.\n\n\"If you don't have a brand campaign, do the problems get even worse in the future?\" Thomas said.\n\nBosch made its Super Bowl ad debut last year and saw \"tangible lifts\" in consumer engagement, such as people entering hardware and appliance stores to specifically ask for Bosch products, he said.\n\n\"It would really be a pity if you did it once and didn't continue on with it because then you lose all the momentum that you could gain,\" he said.",

    "title": "I made 5 Super Bowl appetizers in my slow cooker, and they all deserve a spot on game day",
    "description": "Super Bowl recipes like creamy queso, Buffalo chicken wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese can all be made in a slow cooker.",
    "fullText": "In a bid to find simple Super Bowl party foods that didn't require hours in the kitchen, I decided to test out five slow-cooker recipes.\n\nI've made classics like Buffalo chicken dip countless times in my Crock-Pot, but this time I branched out with options like spicy wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese.\n\nEvery dish impressed me, though the wings were the clear MVP.\n\nHere's how I made the game-day appetizers in a slow cooker.\n\nThese meatballs by Chef Savvy are super versatile: You can serve them on their own with tomato sauce, in a roll for a delicious meatball sub, or with pasta. The ingredients for the meatballs are pretty standard — I used a meatball mix from the grocery store that included beef and pork.\n\nIt's best to mix the ingredients by hand in the bowl to ensure the eggs, breadcrumbs, and meat are well incorporated.\n\nI could see the chopped onion and parsley peeking through the meat mixture. The recipe that I followed said you should have about 24 meatballs — I had that exact number, so I was confident that my meatballs were the right size.\n\nNext, I broiled the meatballs in the oven for about four minutes on each side, careful not to burn them.\n\nI then started gathering the ingredients for the tomato sauce: crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning.\n\nIt's OK if the meatballs are placed on top of each other if your slow cooker is slightly smaller.\n\nAfter adding my tomato sauce ingredients, I set the slow cooker on low for four hours, as per the recipe. However, when I pulled out my first meatball at the four-hour mark, I thought it looked a little underdone. It's important to check your meatballs before eating them, as there can be variations in the cooking time depending on the size of your meatballs or even your slow cooker.\n\nI let mine continue cooking for another half-hour on high to make sure everything was done for dinner time.\n\nI thought the meatballs were perfectly juicy and well-seasoned, while the tomato sauce tasted like homemade marinara that had been cooking on the stove for hours.\n\nI enjoyed the meatballs on their own as an appetizer. However, later in the week, I served some of the leftover meatballs and sauce with pasta for dinner, which really impressed me as well.\n\nI started by mixing together Buffalo sauce, minced garlic, chopped yellow onion, and brown sugar.\n\nWhile I had heard you could make Buffalo wings in a slow cooker, I was admittedly skeptical. I was nervous that the wings wouldn't turn out crispy enough, since that's usually done in a traditional oven or a fryer.\n\nHowever, Spend With Pennies' recipe called for broiling the wings after cooking them in the slow cooker, which would crisp them in just a few minutes.\n\nThe chicken wings that I bought didn't have the drumsticks and flats separated, which added a bit of time to my preparation.\n\nAfter they were fully cooked, I removed them from the slow cooker and placed them on a sheet pan with foil.\n\nI then brushed some of the Buffalo sauce still in the slow cooker over the wings. I then put them under the broiler for about three minutes on each side until they were crispy and slightly blackened.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how easy these wings were to make, and loved how the slow cooker made the wings extremely tender.\n\nThe wings were crispy on the outside, while the meat inside was tender, juicy, and moist. I also thought they were the perfect spice level — they had a kick but didn't set my mouth on fire.\n\nI thought these would fit in well at any game-day or Super Bowl party.\n\nI've tried a number of Martha Stewart's slow-cooker recipes in the past, and I've enjoyed a majority of them. I was excited to see how Stewart's queso dip recipe would turn out.\n\nLike a lot of her slow-cooker recipes, this dip only required a few ingredients, which I really appreciated when it came to braving the grocery store a week before Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI started by adding American cheese and pepper jack cheese to the slow cooker and mixed it with a small amount of cornstarch.\n\nI mixed it until it was creamy and then seasoned it with salt.\n\nYou'll know it's done when the dip is bubbling and slightly thickened.\n\nI added sliced jalapeños, red onion, and cilantro.\n\nI thought the pepper jack and American cheeses meshed well together, while the tomatoes and green chilies added a lot of flavor. I really liked the texture of the dip — it wasn't too thick or too watery.\n\nI also really liked how this dip only called for a few ingredients. It would definitely make life a lot easier when cooking for a group of people on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nThe celebrity chef shared her recipe for slow-cooker macaroni and cheese in her cookbook, \"Martha Stewart's Slow Cooker.\"\n\nThe recipe calls for three cups of white sharp cheddar cheese and one cup of Gruyere, which creates the sauce. The third and final cheese in this recipe, Parmigiano Reggiano, is added to the breadcrumb mixture later.\n\nI softened the chopped onion with a tablespoon of butter.\n\nAfter mixing the ingredients with the uncooked macaroni, simply leave the slow cooker to cook on high.\n\nTo make the breadcrumbs, the recipe instructed me to pulse two slices of bread in a food processor. I then toasted the breadcrumb pieces on the stove for a few minutes until they were golden brown.\n\nI thought that the three different kinds of cheese, especially the smoked Gruyere, made for a complex flavor profile, while the onions added a savory flavor to the dish.\n\nThe base for the Buffalo chicken dip by Taste of Home calls for crumbled blue cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, and ranch dressing.\n\nI mixed those ingredients in a medium-sized bowl before spreading the dip in a single layer in the bottom of my slow cooker.\n\nYou can use rotisserie chicken or simply boil up some chicken breasts and shred them yourself with a fork, like I did.\n\nI could already tell this dip was going to be delicious.\n\nI set the slow cooker to warm and began prepping my toppings. I added another layer of American cheese and put the lid on the slow cooker to allow the cheese to melt. Then, I chopped up one green onion and added it to the top.\n\nThe layers of the dip were perfectly proportioned. With each bite, I got a delicious mouthful of cheese, hot sauce, and chicken. This recipe really impressed me, and I would definitely make it again.",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL, playing in London's Finsbury Park in the British amateur game.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles waived cornerback Josh Jobe the offseason before they won Super Bowl 59. He went on the sign with the Seahawks practice squad and developed into a bona fide starter helping lead Seattle to Super Bowl 60.\n\nIt’s the ultimate comeback story. Jobe has become a key component in Seattle’s Nickel defensive along with rookie Nick Emmanwori.\n\nAccording to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Jobe ranks sixth in fewest yards per target allowed among defensive backs this season, including playoffs. His teammate, Riq Woolen, is ranked third.\n\nMORE: Seahawks standout safety Nick Emmanwori injured ahead of Super Bowl 60\n\nThe secondary is part of what makes Seattle the best defense in the NFL this year. Head coach Mike Macdonald is another component. The 38-year-old coach was asked Wednesday about Jobe’s journey from practice squad to Super Bowl starter and how far along he’s come.\n\n“It’s a great example of … the pride that we take and how we run our program,” Macdonald said. “If you play great football and you’re a great teammate, you’re gonna get an opportunity to play. Josh was someone we acquired at the beginning of last year.

He was in the same position as me last year, a long way from home, living by himself,\" Campbell explained. \"And him and his wife have been very welcoming to me and my family. His family's awesome.

    "description": "It’s been a staple of the wide receiver's routine before each game he’s played this season for the New England Patriots.  It was McDaniels whom Diggs credits with unlocking a work ethic he hadn’t had during his pro career.",
    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Left back pylon. One knee. Head bowed. Eyes closed.\n\nThat is how Stefon Diggs will spend some of his final moments prior to kickoff of the first Super Bowl of his career.\n\nIt’s been a staple of the wide receiver's routine before each game he’s played this season for the New England Patriots.\n\nFollowing pregame warmups, he also calls his teammates in to huddle around him as he leads one of a series of impassioned, fiery and often viral speeches.\n\n“I just say what I feel like I’m supposed to do and just go,” Diggs said. “It’s not so much the words, it’s more so the tenacity.”\n\nThen, he turns the volume down for his prayer in the corner of the end zone.\n\n“Taking a second to kind of appreciate where I am and give my thanks to God and kind of have my little moment with him. Thanking him for the trials and tribulations,” Diggs said. “Building my character up a little bit as a person and making these shoulders weight-bearing, I guess.”\n\nBoth are necessary for the player whom teammates call the emotional centerpiece of their Super Bowl run. And for Diggs, it’s been fuel during a comeback season that didn’t seem likely after his tenure in Houston last season was cut short by a knee injury.\n\nBut, after posting his seventh 1,000-yard receiving season in his 11th year in the league, he may also be the not-so-secret weapon for an offense that will need to be at its best against a Seattle defense that allowed an NFL-low 17.2 points per game during the regular season.\n\nSo many of the things that got Diggs to this point stemmed from an initial sense of trust he found early in his free agent process last summer.\n\nWhen Diggs signed with Houston in 2024, he acknowledged it was in an effort to chase a championship. But Diggs purposely didn’t have many expectations after signing in free agency with New England.\n\nWhat drew him initially to the Patriots was a sense of trust he felt after finding an almost instant connection with wide receivers coach Todd Downing, who was the tight ends coach in Minnesota in 2018 when Diggs was there.\n\nHe got the same thing from the “straight shooter” he met in coach Mike Vrabel, as well as offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. It was McDaniels whom Diggs credits with unlocking a work ethic he hadn’t had during his pro career.\n\nMcDaniels said the veteran receiver has been the perfect match for second-year quarterback Drake Maye.\n\n“I think it’s great for Drake to be around a player as accomplished at Stef,” McDaniels said. “Drake has learned how to assimilate with him, (to) work together with a player that has been around a long time and been around a lot of good quarterbacks. I think it’s been great for Drake’s growth and development.\"\n\nAfter Diggs eclipsed 1,000 yards during New England’s regular-season finale, a win over Miami, Maye’s mind went back to the preseason when he invited all the receivers to his home state of North Carolina for some throwing sessions.\n\nHe didn’t think someone as “big time” as Diggs would have time to participate. But he did.\n\n“Kind of from that point on, I felt like, man, looking forward to getting with him on the field and seeing him do his thing, and he’s done his thing time and time again,” Maye said. “Some games he’s not getting the ball as much as any receiver would want to, and he’s still trying to block hard and keeps the energy up and breaking the team down and motivating me.\"\n\nWide receiver DeMario Douglas said Diggs also has been central to their group bonding.\n\n“Before this season even started we got close,” Douglas said. “That was a big reason of us not being selfish. Of course, we’re all receivers, we all want to touch the ball. But ... like your brothers, your blood brothers, you want to see them do great no matter what. This is how it is in our room.”\n\nDiggs has also created a new Patriots fan along way, thanks to his high-profile relationship with Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B. She has not only been a force cheering for Diggs on social media, but a presence in team owner Robert Kraft’s suite during games.\n\nShe and Diggs also celebrated the birth of a son together in November. It's helped Diggs keep his mind on football after being accused in December of strangulation and other criminal charges in connection with a dispute with his former private chef. Diggs has denied the allegations.\n\n\"She wasn’t a football girl before I converted her over,” Diggs said. “But I’m just thankful to have her in my corner. She’s an amazing woman and continue to build that relationship. ... I just appreciate her. Hopefully build on that and watch that tree grow.”\n\nAs for Sunday, Diggs expects to bring the same voice for his team that he has all season.\n\n“I mean what I say and say what I mean,” Diggs said. “My teammates know that, and the biggest thing is they know I’m trying not to be a ‘rah-rah’ guy. I try to be more show rather than I tell. It’s the fact that I can back my words up with what I say. I try to go as hard as I can to give it everything I’ve got.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "title": "From Super Bowl speech to run blocking, how Cooper Kupp helped reshape Seahawks",
    "description": "Cooper Kupp’s Seahawks teammates and coaches raved about his impact as they gear up for the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots.",
    "fullText": "Frisman Jackson didn’t waste any time when the Seattle Seahawks signed Cooper Kupp in last spring. The Seahawks receivers coach knew what Kupp represented. He was formerly one of the most productive receivers in NFL history — a Super Bowl MVP after winning the statistical triple crown in 2021 — who had just been cut by the Los Angeles Rams after three straight sub-1,000 yard seasons.\n\nKupp’s perspective, Jackson thought, would be invaluable toward helping his group elevate the Seahawks to make a run to the Super Bowl. The receiving corps was at an inflection point after trading D.K. Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers and releasing Tyler Lockett days before signing Kupp. All while the team was pivoting at quarterback away from Geno Smith toward Sam Darnold.\n\nSo Jackson tapped Kupp to get up in front of the meeting room and offer his perspective to his fellow receivers.\n\n“I had him talk in the front of the group and say, ‘talk to us about your experience the year ya’ll went to the Super Bowl,’” Jackson said. “We’ve been on this mission since before we came for phase one (of the offseason program) when I had him stand in front of the room and talk about what it means to play in the Super Bowl.”\n\nKupp’s words wound up being helpful and prophetic. The Seahawks are in the Bay Area preparing for Super Bowl LX and are 4.5-point favorites over the New England Patriots to lift the organization’s second Lombardi Trophy. They got there on the back of arguably the NFL’s best defense, but there’s little chance they would have earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC and beat the 49ers and Rams in the playoffs without the play of their receivers complementing Darnold’s ascension in his first season with Seattle.\n\n“It’s about playing for each other,” Kupp said. “I think one of the things that I’ve noticed that the best teams I’ve been a part of, guys play for the guy next to them. It’s a cliché thing, but it’s the hardest thing to do when you get to the NFL because there’s so much at stake. And it’s hard for people with their own ambitions, their own families and all this different stuff that’s going on, to commit to the belief that truly the best thing for them and the best thing for our team is that the team succeeds.\n\n“The most powerful thing you can do is have a group of guys that are playing for something outside of themselves and we’ve had a lot of guys embody that this year.”\n\nThe Seahawks haven’t been to a Super Bowl since winning it after the 2013 season. Only four players on the roster have Super Bowl experience. One is Kupp, who caught eight passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns in the 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI. Two others were his teammates with the Rams: Ernest Jones IV and running back Cam Akers. Darnold served as Brock Purdy’s backup with the 49ers during the loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII.\n\nThe Seahawks have leaned on Kupp’s experience in their preparation for Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n\n“I can’t speak highly enough of Coop. What he’s meant to our offense, not only our offense but our team. The mindset that he has,” Darnold said. “The way he leads by example. If he does say things, he’s one of those guys where the entire room is dead silent. And they’re super focused on what he’s saying because we know that he doesn’t waste his breath. He’s always going to be able to say something very mindful. For us, speaking for the players, but also the coaches, he’s had a huge impact on all of us in that building. Really fun playing for Coop and what he’s brought to all of us.”\n\nKupp has been a tone setter for his fellow receivers and pushed to raise the standard for players and coaches, Jackson said.\n\n“He challenges you as a coach from a schematic standpoint. He’s going to ask questions and you better know the answers to them,” Jackson said. “You can’t bull crap him.”\n\nJackson said Kupp specifically elevated the conversation about receivers’ blocking in the running game. It stems from Kupp playing for Rams coach Sean McVay, who like Kubiak and other coaches from the Kyle Shanahan tree, emphasizes receivers blocking when they’re not catching passes.\n\nAnd while trying to take the onus off Darnold and playing to their defense, the Seahawks had the third most rushing attempts in the NFL during the season.\n\n“Before I had Coop, when I talked about the run game, it was very limited, because most wideouts say, ‘give me my rule, who I’m supposed to block, and that’s the end of it,’” Jackson said. “With Coop, I’ve really had to be locked in. He’s going to ask me, what’s the Mike point, what’s the call that the O-line is going to and how it affects his block. And so he’s really challenged me in that regard and really changed my coaching style and philosophy and how I teach the run game to the guys.”\n\nKupp’s production isn’t at the same level as his previous Super Bowl season. In 2025, he had modest totals of 47 catches for 593 yards, the second fewest of his career, with just two touchdowns. It was a far cry from the 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns when he posted one of the great seasons in NFL history in 2021, which he capped by earning Super Bowl MVP for catching a pair of touchdowns in the victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThe 32-year-old caught a touchdown against his former team in this year’s NFC championship game, with three of his four catches converting third downs in the 31-27 victory. He finished with 36 yards.\n\nBut what Kupp lacked in numbers throughout the season, he made up for in leadership and providing a good example for his teammates, which began with his speech in March.\n\nKupp has helped Jaxon Smith-Njigba grow into one of the game’s most productive receivers. Kupp said Wednesday there were similarities to their games, with Smith-Njigba initially being thought of as a slot receiver before being moved all over the field in 2025. Smith-Njigba had a Kupp-like 1,793 yards to lead the NFL this season.\n\nAsked what advice Kupp gave Smith-Njigba that has stuck with him most: “Process over results,” Smith-Njigba said.\n\nSeattle’s brass moved on from Metcalf and Lockett to allow Smith-Njigba to have a runway to more targets. And Kupp was added because he played in a similar scheme in L.A. that Seattle would run under first-year coordinator Klint Kubiak, who is expected to be named the new head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after Sunday’s Super Bowl.\n\nKupp had no problem not being Seattle’s top target.\n\n“You got guys who make be locker room lawyers — they might go in a corner somewhere and complain about things. That’s not Coop,” Jackson said. “He’s been fantastic. I could talk hours and hours about the professional that he is, how he goes about his business and how selfless he is.”",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and  if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs have always been the biggest thorn in the Buffalo Bills’ path when it comes to the Super Bowl. In fact, Josh Allen has lost four different contests against Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs over the years.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs have always been the biggest thorn in the Buffalo Bills’ path when it comes to the Super Bowl. In fact, Josh Allen has lost four different contests against Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs over the years. That’s why, when those same Chiefs missed the playoffs this year, it should have been good news for the Bills’ locker room. Except it wasn’t.\n\nAccording to Allen, the team never focused on the Chiefs’ exclusion from the playoffs. It went against what many football fans were thinking at the time when Buffalo reached the postseason with a dominant run no less. Many believed that the absence of Mahomes was another significant advantage for the team.\n\n“That’s something that we don’t talk about in the locker room, really. We don’t really care so much about who else is in the playoffs with us, how to get there, or how to get it done. The short answer is we didn’t get it done this year. And that’s on us, that’s on me,” Allen saidduring his appearance on First Things First.\n\nIt’s surprising to hear, to say the least. After all, Allen has lost to Mahomes by one score in the playoffs three times. Last season, less than one yard decided the outcome of the game.\n\nLater on, Allen shed some light on his mentality going into this postseason.\n\n“We’re going to keep working tirelessly until we find a way to get there and get it done. I understand the people’s thoughts of you don’t have no Mahomes, no Lamar, no Joe Burrow in the playoffs. But there’s some dang good teams in this playoffs. They’re not there just by chance. They’re there for a reason. And the two teams that are in the Super Bowl, they deserve to be there,” Allen stated.\n\nSome may see it as an excuse from the former MVP, but Allen is right. There were a few teams better than the Chiefs in the AFC this season. Even the Jacksonville Jaguars went on a run, giving the Bills a tough test in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe Denver Broncos ultimately ended up being the team to send Allen home this time around. They had an elite defense and were playing with home-field advantage. Allen turned the ball over four times in that game, including a pivotal overtime interception. It went down as another heartbreaking playoff loss in Bills history.\n\nMaybe one of these years, Allen and the Bills will get over the hump. At this point in his career, a Super Bowl win is a massive monkey the QB can’t seem to get off his back. It does, however, sound like he will always stay motivated to win one because of his love for the game. Still, the lack of a Lombardi Trophy in his hands must be starting to wear on him.\n\nThe post Bills News: Josh Allen Says Locker Room ‘Didn’t Really Care’ About Chiefs Missing the Playoffs appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX is set for Feb. 8, when the Lombardi Trophy winner for the 2025–26 season will be decided in a showdown between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe halftime show will take place as the teams head to the locker room, with music star Bad Bunny stepping in to deliver a performance sure to grab plenty of attention.\n\nReactions to the NFL halftime show are split. Some fans have gone so far as to say they will boycott the performance, while others are perfectly fine with the global music star taking the stage.\n\nMORE: Bad Bunny’s new Super Bowl 2026 trailer sends clear message ahead of halftime show\n\nKevin Durant, however, falls into a different category altogether. The longtime NBA veteran recently spoke candidly about Bad Bunny and his music, offering a personal perspective as the Super Bowl LX halftime show approaches.\n\nDurant appeared on Kay Adams’ Up and Adams podcast on Wednesday, where he shared that he has not listened to any of Bad Bunny’s songs. When the former NFL Network reporter asked Durant, “I want to know how you’re doing?” he replied, “Doing better. We’ll see in the morning.” Later, when Adams said, “Well enough to like to dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?” Durant simply confessed, “I haven’t listened to Bad Bunny before.”\n\nKay Adams: \"I want to know how you're doing?\"\n\nKevin Durant: \"Doing better.

His albums, including ‘YHLQMDLG’, ‘El Último Tour del Mundo’, and ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, were huge hits. His ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ especially made history because a Spanish-language album became one of the most popular in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBut some NFL fans are unhappy about Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He has been outspoken on social and political issues, especially about U.S. immigration policies and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nHe made a high-profile speech at the 2026 Grammys condemning ICE actions and calling for empathy toward immigrants, which upset many conservative viewers. These critics see him as too political and say his views don’t fit a traditionally neutral sports event.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Kevin Durant stuns NFL world with honest Bad Bunny confession ahead of Super Bowl halftime show appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will not be attending the Super Bowl after being warned he would likely be resoundingly booed by the crowd inside the stadium, according to a report.\n\nThe thin-skinned president had previously offered the unlikely excuse that he would not attend the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday in Santa Clara, California, because it was “too far away” and because he disliked the planned performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\nHowever, several of Trump’s advisers have now told Zeteo that the 79-year-old was urged not to attend the game in the deep-blue Democratic state because he would likely receive a less-than-friendly reception.\n\nClips of Trump being loudly booed in front of tens of thousands of spectators—and potentially more than 100 million viewers at home—going viral would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told Zeteo.\n\nTrump was met with a mixture of boos and cheers when he attended last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut since then his approval ratings have plummeted across the board, with the president losing support over his handling of the economy and his hardline immigration policies, particularly in the wake of the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump’s dire polling numbers, combined with the Super Bowl being held in a state that has overwhelmingly rejected him in the past three presidential elections, led one aide to conclude it was “best to stay away from this one.”\n\n“Whatever [the crowd’s makeup] ends up being, it’s not gonna be a Turning Point USA speech,” the aide said.\n\nTrump told the New York Post last month that he would skip this year’s Super Bowl because he was unhappy that Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny would be performing the halftime show. Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "title": "Anthropic's Super Bowl spot skewers ChatGPT: 'Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude'",
    "description": "While Anthropic doesn't outright name ChatGPT, it's clear who the target of its coming Super Bowl ad is.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is taking a shot at OpenAI on the biggest stage possible.\n\nOn Wednesday, Anthropic rolled out a glitzy ad campaign that will air nationally during Sunday's Super Bowl, which implicitly centers on OpenAI's plans to bring advertising to ChatGPT.\n\n\"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\" the tag line reads.\n\nThe declaration shows that Anthropic is willing to draw a line in the sand with its no-AI-ads-in-chatbots stance. But the move also means Anthropic is declining to pursue a potentially key revenue stream for Claude at a time when AI companies are spending more than ever in the AI race.\n\nWith much of Anthropic's revenue coming from its enterprise business, the company may feel it's a worthwhile tradeoff and a way to further differentiate its offerings from OpenAI's.\n\nAnthropic has booked a 30-second spot during the game and an additional 1-minute ad during the pregame for what is historically the most-watched live television event in the US.\n\nThe 30-second spot features a scrawny guy asking a buffed trainer, \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" While at first the trainer gives helpful information in the voice of an AI chatbot, the trainer quickly segues into an ad.\n\n\"Confidence isn't just built in the gym, try Step Boost Max, the insoles that add one vertical inch of height and help short kings stand tall,\" the trainer says.\n\nAnthropic's 1-minute-long spot is even more provocative. It features an adult man in therapy who is trying to connect more with his mother. After giving some general advice, the AI chatbot-like voice segues into an ad for a fictional dating service for younger men seeking older women.\n\n\"If the relationship can't be fixed, find an emotional connection with other older women on Golden Encounters, the mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars,\" the therapist responds in the voice of a chatbot.\n\nTwo additional ads in the campaign feature a woman in a restaurant asking for feedback on a new business idea and a student asking a professor for help with an essay.\n\nIt's not immediately clear how much Anthropic is spending on the Super Bowl campaign. Mike Marshall, head of global advertising for NBCUniversal, whose network has the rights to this year's game, recently said a 30-second spot costs roughly $8 million.\n\nLast month, OpenAI announced plans to begin testing ads in the US for its free and Go tiers of ChatGPT. While anticipated, the announcement illustrated just how much CEO Sam Altman has changed his views on monetizing the chatbot with ads.\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nAs part of the announcement, OpenAI said that ads would \"not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.\"\n\n\"Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you,\" the company said in the announcement. \"Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.\"\n\nIn case the ad campaign wasn't clear enough, Anthropic released its own lengthy statement pledging to keep ads off of Claude.\n\n\"Ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAnthropic, founded by seven former OpenAI employees, including CEO Dario Amodei, has also repeatedly shown it's not above taking implicit shots at its rival, though the Super Bowl ads represent an escalation of the AI wars.\n\nIn December, Amodei poked fun at companies that declare \"Code Reds,\" denounced others that are \"Yoloing\" by making risky bets on future AI demand, and extolled the virtues of Anthropic's business model, built on the enterprise market. Individually and collectively, the remarks came across as implicit shots at OpenAI, though Amodei repeatedly declined to name his target.\n\nWhen asked, \"who is Yoloing,\" Amodei responded, \"So that's not a question I'm going to answer.\"\n\nAnd while Anthropic still isn't naming names, the target of their taunts will be hard for Super Bowl fans to ignore.",

    "description": "NBC analyst Devin McCourty compares the Lions’ 2025 struggles to Patriots teams that dealt with coordinator turnover and explains why Detroit must adjust fast.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions didn’t suddenly forget how to play football in 2025, but according to NBC analyst and former Patriots captain Devin McCourty, they ran straight into one of the hardest realities in the NFL: coordinator turnover.\n\nSpeaking recently about Detroit’s season, McCourty said the Lions’ drop-off wasn’t surprising at all. In fact, it looked painfully familiar to what he lived through during his 13-year run with the New England Patriots.\n\nAnd if Lions fans are looking for a silver lining, McCourty’s message was pretty clear: this is fixable, but it’s real.\n\nMcCourty pointed to multiple moments in Patriots history when New England took a step back after losing key coordinators. Even with Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and elite talent still in place, things didn’t always click immediately once new voices took over.\n\n“One thing I’ve learned,” McCourty explained, “is when you lose coordinators, that creates so much unknown.”\n\nHe lived it firsthand. After New England won the Super Bowl in 2007, Brady’s knee injury in 2008 and the challenge of replacing offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and defensive coordinator Dean Pees stalled the Patriots for several seasons. The roster was strong, but the rhythm wasn’t the same.\n\nMcCourty says that’s not a coincidence — and it’s exactly what Detroit just experienced.\n\nDetroit entered the 2025 season with new coordinators on both sides of the ball, then changed offensive play-callers midseason. Now, the Lions are preparing for yet another offensive shift in 2026 with Drew Petzing taking over play-calling duties.\n\nFrom McCourty’s perspective, that kind of churn matters — even when the scheme looks similar on paper.\n\n“Brian Flores didn’t call the defense the same way Matt Patricia did,” McCourty said while reflecting on New England’s own transitions. “Yes, it was a lot of the same stuff, but it was different.”\n\nThose subtle differences, he explained, can impact timing, confidence, communication, and ultimately results.\n\nOne key distinction McCourty made clear: the Lions’ roster is not broken.\n\nThe core of Detroit’s team remains largely intact from the group that won 15 games in 2024. That matters. A lot.\n\nIn McCourty’s eyes, this wasn’t a collapse — it was a recalibration year while players and coaches tried to adjust to new systems, new voices, and new expectations.\n\nStill, he warned that the Lions can’t just assume things will magically snap back into place.\n\nMcCourty didn’t sugarcoat it. If the Lions want to contend for the Super Bowl in 2026, there’s work to do — especially in establishing clarity and continuity.\n\nNew coordinators don’t just need time to install schemes. Players need to trust them. Coaches need to align. And the entire organization has to move in the same direction again.\n\nThat’s the part, McCourty says, fans often underestimate.\n\nThe good news? Detroit has the foundation. The bad news? The margin for error is smaller when expectations are sky-high.\n\nThe post Detroit Lions’ 2025 Regression Didn’t Surprise Super Bowl Champ Devin McCourty appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "Jarran Reed is in his second stint with the Seahawks and does not take his path to Super Bowl LX for granted.",
    "fullText": "Jarran Reed earns a living in the pit, the trenches of NFL combat, and this pleases the Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle to no end.\n\nHe is a football lifer, a 10th year veteran of interior clashes and scrums that often decide the winners and losers in a sport rooted in crunching contact. On Tuesday afternoon in San Jose, the 6-foot-3, 315-pound 33-year-old Reed beamed at what he has accomplished, and his journey to Super Bow LX on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium. You can be sure he will have a say in how it all turns out against the New England Patriots.\n\nA native of Goldsboro High School in North Carolina, Reed’s story is a familiar one in the Pacific Northwest. He has reveled at the chance to be a run-stuffer and quarterback chaser since he first slipped on shoulder pads and a helmet. He ground his way through East Mississippi Community College, shoring up his game and his academics, and he starred with the Alabama Crimson Tide on the defensive line.\n\nA second-round draft pick by Seattle in 2016, Reed spent the 2021 season with the Kansas City Chiefs and the 2022 campaign with the Green Bay Packers. He re-signed with Seattle in 2023, signing a $12.8 million deal before having it extended in March to a 3-year package for $25 million.\n\nAll told, Reed has done his share of the heavy lifting in helping propel the Seahawks to the season’s final weekend in the franchise’s 50th year. And it isn’t just warding off blockers and plugging gaps that make Reed invaluable. He is a locker room leader who offers fiery pep talks as a veteran who has seen it all. Coach Mike Macdonald often has Reed address the team after games, anointing the veteran to mentor and inspire one of the NFL’s youngest teams.\n\nReed takes none of his path for granted, not in a sport where change is part of the business. Reed has been too good to supplant, and he said he wants to play several more seasons.\n\n“Oh, not one bit (do I take this for granted),” Reed said. “Everybody’s journey is different. I’m very grateful for this, and it’s taught me a lot. Coming from Goldsboro, North Carolina to East Mississippi, then Alabama...all the roles were there to get me to this moment.”\n\nReed said the Seahawks immediately responded to Macdonald, the defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens in 2022 and 2023 who was hired as head coach by Seattle before the 2024 season.\n\n“It started early with OTA’s, and we attack the day, attack the week,” Reed said. “Everybody needs to be tackled.”\n\nReed said he enjoys studying game film, be it the linemen he will encounter or the ball carriers the Seahawks are tasked to stop. He said that he is big on preparation, mind and body. He said that he thinks of NFL stars over the years who did not reach a Super Bowl.\n\n“Some greats never made it, never got a chance to experience this,” Reed said. “Man, I’m here, Year 10. I got a national championship in junior college, and at Alabama, and now I’m here to see if we can pull it out in the Super Bowl this week.”\n\nReed has always been country strong and became stronger through strength and conditioning. He said that as long as he can overpower the guy in front of him, he will continue to play.\n\n“I made a joke the other day in the weight room,” Reed said. “Now I got that grown-man strong, that dance strength.”\n\nReed said Seattle’s defense is united. That included arriving to the Super Bowl’s Opening Night media session as a unit in the same ride.\n\n“One thing I said (Monday) is that Bus 3 is the defensive bus, like, nobody gets on Bus 3 but the defense. We’re just like brothers out there. We trust each other on the field. We know where each player is going to be on the field. We play off of each other, and that connection started outside the locker room.”\n\nReed added, “We hang together a lot, a real close-knit group.”\n\nHow does a man last this long in the pit? Money is a great motivator, to be certain, and so is the zest to compete.\n\n“Just the love of the game,” Reed said. “And definitely everybody’s playing to get to the Super Bowl. Man, I love the game. It’s done a lot for me. I’ve been playing since I was a kid, five years old, and 33 now, and I’ve got a lot of football left.”\n\nReed said he had a sense he could make quite a living in this sport by the time he arrived at Alabama, among the college football programs that annually churn out NFL prospects.\n\n“I figured that I could really make this thing work and make this a great life, a life goal, a life-changing experience,” Reed said.\n\nBecoming a father was also a life-changing experience, Reed said. His oldest daughter, Jacey, was born shortly before he was drafted in 2016, when he would make FaceTime video calls with his infant girl who perked up at the sound of his voice.\n\nNow 10 years old, Jacey doesn’t hesitate to climb over her father at home, even if his body aches from the rigors of a game. She has a sister who also jumps aboard Mount Papa. This isn’t trench warfare, not with the girls giggling and their father rolling on his back and side in preparation for a kid ambush.\n\n“My daughters are amazing,” Reed said with a smile. “Look, I’m their jungle gym. They love crawling all over their dad. I really don’t mind. And it doesn’t stop them (if I’m sore or not).”",
