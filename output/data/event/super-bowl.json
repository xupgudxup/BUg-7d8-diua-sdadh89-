Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos have been as healthy as any team in the NFL this season, but heading into the divisional round of the playoffs against the Buffalo Bills, it appears that one of their defensive starters won't play again this season.\n\nIn his second season with the Broncos, Jones suffered a pectoral injury in Week 15 against the Green Bay Packers. He was placed on injured reserve, but there was hope at the time that he might be able to return for the playoffs.\n\nBroncos 9News insider Mike Klis reported that Jones, who has undergone surgery for a torn pectoral muscle, could be back for the Super Bowl if the Broncos get to Santa Clara. However, Broncos head coach Sean Payton sounded much less enthusiastic about that. When asked directly if Jones could be back at some point this season, Payton simply said, \"I don't think so\".\n\nSean Payton was asked by @ParkerJGabriel if he thinks Brandon Jones will play again this year.\n\n“I don’t think so.” pic.twitter.com/4esKqOzqA1\n\n— Luca Evans (@bylucaevans) January 13, 2026\n\nThat seems like the most likely scenario, as unfortunate as that is. A torn pectoral is not something that you can return quickly from, so Jones will likely be shut down for the season at this point, cheering his team on from the sidelines. In his place, P.J. Locke has been placed back into the starting lineup.\n\nLocke has started each of the team's last three games and has 16 tackles and three pass breakups on the season. He left the team's Week 18 game against the Los Angeles Chargers with a leg injury, but has been a full participant in practice this week. Devon Key and JL Skinner are the other safeties on the 53-man roster.\n\nREAD:Broncos' Pro Bowler given more reason to be named first-ever winner of new award\n\nIt's tough to lose Jones, who has been great for the team. He and Talanoa Hufanga made up one of the better safety combinations in the league this season. In his two seasons with the Broncos, Jones has recorded 193 tackles, four interceptions, 17 pass deflections and one fumble recovery.

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma City Thunder finally picked up their first win against the San Antonio Spurs, and it took them four games to do it. The defending champions breathed a huge sigh of relief after avoiding a regular-season sweep, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, true to his confident self, declared that the game was not as important as the external noise made it seem.\n\nBefore the Thunder’s first loss to the Spurs, they looked seemingly unbeatable, barring flukes. But Victor Wembanyama and company exposed glaring flawsand showed the league that beating them was possible. Gilgeous-Alexander, after finally avoiding defeat against the Frenchman, admitted that the Thunder did not see this coming.\n\nThe Spurs made them uncomfortable, but the reigning MVP feels that it was how they grew as a team. That’s what ultimately led them to their 119-98 win earlier today.\n\n*“They got the better of us the last three times we played them [and] that doesn’t happen to this group,”* Gilgeous-Alexander said.* “I can’t remember the last time its happened. But yeah, uncomfortable feelings and adversity is where you find growth that defines who you are.”*\n\n“And we showed that tonight,” the Canadian star added, before taking a dig at the magnitude of the occasion for the Spurs.\n\n*“Tonight wasn’t our super bowl. It wasn’t anything but another game in an 82 game season. We gotta [keep] finding ways to be better.” *\n\nWas this Gilgeous-Alexander trying to be nonchalant? Perhaps. Losing to a team four times in a regular season would have clearly shown the rest of the NBA that the Spurs were a true kryptonite for the Thunder. And although it does not matter in the long run, no team would want that next to its record.\n\nThe discussion will be over for now. The Thunder showed that they can beat the Spurs. Next, they may meet in the post-season where winning actually means more. If the Thunder fail there, Gilgeous-Alexander’s “this wasn’t our superbowl” comment would surely be revisited.\n\nThunder vs Spurs may very well be the NBA’s next big rivalry.\n\nThe post “Tonight Wasn’t Our Super Bowl”: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Trolls Spurs After 21-Point Blowout Win appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "The former Super Bowl MVP shared his thoughts about the Eagles' offense and the offensive coordinator role.",
    "fullText": "Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles had also seen enough of the Eagles’ underperforming offense.\n\n“Frustrated” watching elite talent fail to produce, he believes the Eagles, whose season ended in the wild-card round of the playoffs, realized their offense was broken much earlier than they let on.\n\nOn “The SZN with Nick Foles and Evan Moore” podcast, Foles said the Eagles are ready to replace first-year offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo.\n\n“I’m telling you, they’ve already got a plan in place,” Foles said. “They’re not just caught off guard by this. They’ve had all season to prepare. I think at the halfway mark, we knew what was going to happen, but Eagles fans and football fans were thinking like, ‘Hey, maybe they’ll figure it out.’ They never did. But I guarantee you, behind closed walls in a secret little dungeon, someone was researching who the next OC of the Philadelphia Eagles will be.”\n\nFoles believes the Eagles have been studying former head coaches Mike McDaniel (Miami Dolphins) and Brian Daboll (New York Giants) to gauge whether their styles would fit the Eagles’ personnel.\n\nFoles agreed with how a previous guest, former NFL cornerback and Amazon NFL analyst Richard Sherman, described the Eagles’ offense.\n\n“I thought he explained it perfectly with his illustration,” Foles said. “It’s like you have a Ferrari and you put a Toyota Corolla engine in it and you have all the pieces. It looks like a Ferrari, but it just doesn’t run and sound like a Ferrari. I was hoping that the Eagles did that this year with the offense because they have the parts. It looks like a Ferrari. It ran like a Ferrari last year. All these parts and the engine’s a little different. It was the same old story, which is frustrating.”\n\nDespite big names such as quarterback Jalen Hurts, running back Saquon Barkley, wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert, the unit finished the regular season ranked 24th in total offense (311.2 yards per game), 23rd in passing offense (194.3 yards per game) and 18th in rushing offense (116.9 yards per game).\n\nThe Eagles know where they’ll be picking in the first round of the 2026 NFL draft\n\nEagles star Saquon Barkley after disappointing season: ‘I let my teammates down’\n\nCould Brian Daboll fix Eagles? 10 candidates for OC job if Kevin Patullo is fired\n\nWill Eagles star Lane Johnson return for 2026 season? ‘Whatever happens, happens’",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Ranking the nine teams left in 2026 playoffs, from Seahawks to Steelers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL playoff field started with 14 teams. With five of six wild-card games in the books, it's down to a fine nine ahead of the Steelers hosting the Texans in Pittsburgh for the wild weekend finale on Monday night.\n\nThere were some classic shootouts and games that came down to the wire and three was the unlucky seed number with both the Eagles and Jaguars being upset at home on Sunday.\n\nWith the two top-seeded bye teams prepping for playoff action and the NFC and AFC conference games almost set, here's an updated comparison of the teams still alive to win Super Bowl 60:\n\nThe Seahawks won a tough NFC West from which the Rams and their opponents, the 49ers, also made the divisional round. They have a dominant defense, balanced and explosive offense and are well coached by Mike Macdonald and Klint Kubiak. They should be ready for the rubber match with San Francisco after losing to the 49ers at home in Week 1. The key is Sam Darnold and the entire team avoiding lingering turnover issues.\n\nThe Patriots showed they were a complete and playoff-tough team under Mike Vrabel when their offense was contained by the Chargers. Drake Maye still overcame some tough pressure and made the plays when they counted most. The defense also sent a strong message with a dominant start in the wild-card round. They are looking like the steady playoff winner they used to be with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nMORE: How Drake Maye overcame turnovers to beat Chargers\n\nThe Broncos will get a tough draw against the Bills, but then again Buffalo's offense has hit snags when Josh Allen faces top pressure and coverage defenses on the road. Denver's defense will need to set the tone at home, where Bo Nix tends to lead the offense best. The Broncos will see the Patriots as expected in the AFC championship game as long as they don't get off to too slow of a start and play catchup to the Bills.\n\nThe Rams' defense has a lot of potential with its run stopping, pressure and coverage, but it has its share of holes. The good news, they got a rough game out of their system against the Panthers.\n\nMatthew Stafford and Puka Nacua kept sizzling and trying to pass well enough to outscore them is a real challenge. With L.A. getting over an early scare, it should be refocused to rebound stronger for the divisional round.\n\nMORE: Three problems Sean McVay, Rams must fix after beating Panthers\n\nThe Bills got over a massive playoff obstacle in Josh Allen's first road wild-card game by outlasting the tough Jaguars by making fewer mistakes in the clutch, leading to a 27-24 fourth-quarter escape. In the divisional round, Allen will look up and see no Chiefs, Ravens or Bengals still in the AFC playoff mix.\n\nAllen has proved to be the great postseason equalizer and then some when their running game and defense are off. He should be the most trusted big-play and clutch QB left in the field.\n\nMORE: Three reasons why Bills passed their toughest test vs. Jags\n\nThe Bears seem to keep living dangerously as the worst total defense in the playoffs and have been too dependent on getting key takeaways. It had to feel good that they could win a game when four fumbles by the Packers didn't go their way and had zero interceptions from Jordan Love.\n\nIt would be nice for Ben Johnson  if Caleb Williams and the offense to start faster instead of waiting to explode while exploiting the best passing game matchups in the fourth quarter. Getting the league's No. 3 rushing offense going early would help. They will be ready to be better all-around after getting valuable playoff experience to take down their archrivals at home.\n\nMORE: How Caleb Williams made Bears' history in comeback victory over Packers\n\nThe 49ers took out the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles in Philadelphia with a gritty shorthanded defensive performance for the ages. They also had to adjust to yet another big offensive injury to George Kittle, grinding away with Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey with great playoff scheming by Kyle Shanahan. They might not have enough health in their favor to get to another Super Bowl, but their experience can't be ignored in a still wide-open field.\n\nMORE: Christian Mcaffrey shines with 2 TDs in upset victory over Eagles\n\nThe Texans have won playoff games in each of the previous two trips with C.J. Stroud at quarterback under DeMeco Ryans. They draw a tough even matchup against the low-scoring, defensive-minded Steelers on Monday night. They will need to get hot offensively and score more to advance and have a shot against the Patriots on the road.\n\nThe Steelers are hoping that Aaron Rodgers can have some throwback magic left in him at 41 with DK Metcalf returning to raise the big-play potential for their QB's still strong arm. But equal keys is finding a consistent running game and much improving the defensive communication. It might be asking too much for the Steelers to win ugly more than once.",

    "description": "Here's a look at the offseason work ahead for the Philadelphia Eagles.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, and Yahoo Sports is previewing the coming months for all 32 teams, from free agency through the draft and more.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets\nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n2025 season record: 11-6 (u 11.5 wins), first in NFC East, lost to 49ers in wild-card round, 13th in DVOA\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. Last season. Philadelphia battled with some inconsistency in the offense but found a groove by the end of the season. The 2025 version never fully got it.\n\nHow the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The 2024 Eagles figured it out, while the 2025 version couldn’t adapt. Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo might take the fall for that, failing to replicate the work Kellen Moore did previously.\n\nThe talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nThe Eagles have just over $14 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap. That ranks 16th. They’re fairly locked into this roster. Because of how the Eagles have structured their contracts, there’s not a lot of restructure potential — most contracts are pre-restuctured with small base salaries and option bonuses. If the Eagles re-sign Dallas Goedert early, they could create space by shrinking the $20.5 million figure that would hit the cap when his contract voids on Feb. 16.\n\nTE Dallas Goedert \nEdge Jaelan Phillips \nLB Nakobe Dean \nS Reed Blankenship\n\nGoedert led the team and was ninth in the league with a 27.8% target share in the red zone. His 10 red zone touchdowns were second only to Davante Adams. Jaelan Phillips was a defense-changer after the trade that brought him to Philadelphia. From Weeks 1-9, the Eagles were 14th in pressure rate. After Phillips was acquired, they ranked fifth. Dean has been excellent and was immediately put back into the starting lineup when he returned from injury, but the presence of Jihaad Campbell and the high rate of nickel defense will likely make Dean expendable in free agency.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are two of the best players at their positions, but the second outside cornerback spot was a hole all season. Adoree’ Jackson was one of the most targeted cornerbacks on a per-snap basis and the Eagles ranked 24th in DVOA against WR2s.\n\nEven if Goedert is re-signed, the Eagles should add a tight end to the mix. Grant Calcaterra was a negative as a blocker and did not make up for it enough as a receiver — though the Eagles were fifth in EPA per play from 12 personnel, which they ran at the 12th-highest rate in the league.\n\nDepth on the edge will need to be addressed. That was the reason for the Phillips trade and bringing Brandon Graham out of retirement. Neither of them is under contract for 2026.\n\n1st round \n2nd round \n3rd round \n3rd round (projected compensatory) \n4th round \n4th round (projected compensatory) \n5th round (ATL) \n5th round (projected compensatory)\n6th round\n\nThe Eagles have built their dominance through the trenches, and now they find Lane Johnson’s long-term replacement. Lomu moves well for his size, and has polished technique and can add even more weight and strength. He can learn behind Jeff Stoutland and the All-Pros they have along the line before taking over himself.\n\nThe Eagles went 10-7 against the spread in the 2025-26 regular season, but were only 8-7 ATS as a favorite. They were also a surprisingly poor 4-4 ATS at home. — Ben Fawkes",

    "fullText": "The NFL play-offs continued with another nail-biting game as the Buffalo Bills claimed a 27-24 win at the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nA late interception by Buffalo safety Cole Bishop allowed the Bills to clinch victory after Josh Allen, the league's reigning Most Valuable Player, put them back in front with one minute four seconds of the game remaining.\n\nBuffalo were the pre-season Super Bowl favourites but have had to hit the road in the play-offs having failed to retain the AFC East title, while Jacksonville won the AFC South.\n\nThe Jaguars ended the regular season on an eight-game winning streak to secure the AFC's third seed, while Buffalo are the sixth, and most of Sunday's Wildcard Weekend game was a tight affair.\n\nBuffalo led 10-7 at half-time, then 13-10 heading into the fourth quarter, when the lead changed hands four times in a nerve-racking finale.\n\nQuarterbacks Trevor Lawrence and Allen then produced a shootout, with former number one draft pick Lawrence making touchdown passes to Parker Washington and Travis Etienne.\n\nBuffalo replied with Allen finding Dalton Kincaid for a score before barging over for his second rushing TD, which ultimately proved decisive.\n\nThere was enough time for Lawrence to lead a game-winning drive but he was picked off by Bishop to keep alive Allen's hopes of reaching his first Super Bowl.\n\nThis season could be his best chance yet to reach the NFL's championship game as the Kansas City Chiefs, who knocked Buffalo out in four of the past five years, have failed to reach this season's play-offs.",

    "fullText": "Jacksonville hosts Buffalo in the AFC Wild Card Round on Saturday, and despite this shaping up as Josh Allen’s prime Super Bowl opportunity, our Bills vs. Jaguars predictions see the Jaguars putting up stiff resistance right away.\n\nTake a deep dive into our best bets before kickoff comes at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday, January 11.\n\nEtienne Jr. anytime TD (-140 at FanDuel)\n\nAllen o227.5 passing yards (-114 at FanDuel)\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are small road favorites, but they really shouldn't be since the Jacksonville Jaguars enter the playoffs red-hot, going 8-0 SU and ATS in their last eight games.\n\nThe Jaguars finished the regular season with one more win than Buffalo, despite facing a tougher schedule, and are also slightly higher in the DVOA ratings.\n\nJacksonville is fifth in the league in defensive EPA and has been strong against both the run and pass. On the other side of the ball, Travis Etienne will churn out yards against a Bills run defense that is near the bottom of the league in every metric.\n\nThis total is too high when you consider that Buffalo has allowed the fewest passing yards per game in the NFL (156.9) while the Jags have allowed a league-low 85.6 ypg on the ground. Expect both teams to try to control this game on the ground, leading to the Under 51.5 cashing.\n\nThe Bills have allowed more rushing touchdowns to running backs than any team in the NFL, giving up 18 this season. Factor in catches, and running backs have scored 21 total against them.\n\nThat’s not the only reason Travis Etienne Jr. is the best bet on the board for the Jaguars, as Buffalo has also surrendered the sixth-fewest passing touchdowns, with just 19 through 17 games.\n\nExpect the Jaguars’ running back to find what many call the “ETN-zone” at least once.\n\nJosh Allen has always performed at a high level in the playoffs, and Sunday marks the start of a hopeful Super Bowl run for the Buffalo Bills. The quarterback didn’t play in the season finale against the New York Jets, but he did cash the Over in passing yards in two of his previous four games.\n\nThe last time Allen took the field, he threw for 262 yards in a 13-12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The signal-caller threw for 3,668 yards this season, and while he averaged just 187 yards per contest on the road, there’s reason to believe he’ll ball out on Sunday.\n\nThe Jags’ secondary ranks 21st in the NFL in passing yards allowed. This is not a strength for Jacksonville. After a week off, I’ll take Allen to make his presence felt downfield.\n\nEverBank Stadium, Jacksonville, FL\n\nMonitor gametime conditions with our live NFL weather info and learn how weather impacts NFL betting.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "title": "The billionaire's social calendar for 2026: The must-attend events for the world's wealthiest business icons",
    "description": "From Davos and the Super Bowl to Burning Man and St. Barts, see the predictable social calendar billionaires follow and how much it all costs.",
    "fullText": "Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed.\n\nThe world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences.\n\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider.\n\nEach year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said.\n\n2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars.\n\nHere's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them.\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs.\n\nThis year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed \"A Spirit of Dialogue.\" While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccess to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public.\n\nApartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog.\n\nNFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on.\n\nThese billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,\" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nHost committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash.\n\nThe most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year.\n\nAs Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires.\n\nOprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee \"The Nickel Boys\" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful \"Hamnet,\" and James Cameron, director of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires.\n\nEach year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters.\n\nThe tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members.\n\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave.\n\nThe general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system.\n\nEvery year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nDubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters.\n\nWhile the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers.\n\nThe event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission.\n\nWhile billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup,\" Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nThe soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market.\n\nWhile the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool.\n\nThere will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal.\n\nPrivate jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.\n\nSince 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.\n\nThe conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995.\n\nLast year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced.\n\nThe vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nBurning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades.\n\nGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019.\n\nLast year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years.\n\nStill, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way.\n\nThis year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project.\n\nThe coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys.\n\nThe 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons.\n\nLast year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million.\n\nIn the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800.\n\nOctober presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections.\n\nFirst, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there.\n\nShortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit.\n\nLast year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nA painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps.\n\nWhile the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs.\n\nFormula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures.\n\nThe various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names.\n\nLast year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll.\n\nThree-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options.\n\nWhile Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year.\n\nLast year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club.\n\nFor those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"",

    "description": "The Super Bowl is a month away, and everyone wants to know which two teams will play. Some say the Super Bowl logo predicts it. Here's what to know.",
    "fullText": "As the 2026 Super Bowl creeps closer and closer, fans have started to make their predictions as to which two teams will play in the big game.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed, while the Denver Broncos are the AFC's No.1 seed. Yet there's a lot more to winning than just rankings; it takes team chemistry, skill and just the perfect amount of luck to make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nHowever, some fans believe that none of that matters because the two teams playing in the big game can be predicted by the year's Super Bowl logo.\n\nHere's the story behind the theory and what teams might be on the way to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe theory is that the colors included in that year's Super Bowl logo are the colors of the two teams that will play in the Super Bowl that year.\n\nThe theory came to be after fans started to notice that teams that made it to the big game had their colors incorporated into the big game logo for that year. The NFL Super Bowl logo is released a year before the big game, so there's no way anyone could accurately predict which teams would be playing each year.\n\nSo this isn't just an arbitrary theory, there is some evidence to it ... or coincidences, believers say.\n\nFor Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the logo featured red, orange and yellow tones. The two teams to play that year were the Los Angeles Rams, sporting blue and yellow uniforms, and the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing orange and black.\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LVII in 2023, which was played in Glendale, shows a red-rock desert background with pink, teal and orangey-red colors. The two teams that played that year were the red Kansas City Chiefs and green Philadelphia Eagles, which are similar enough to the logo colors for the theory to continue.\n\nHowever, the Super Bowl LVIII logo in 2024 featured a purple and pinkish-red color, which did not predict the showdown between the Chiefs and the 49ers, as both teams' colors are red and do not incorporate any purple. True believers of the conspiracy theory think this happened because the purple Baltimore Ravens had to be eliminated to make way for Travis Kelce's Chiefs and his pop-star girlfriend, Taylor Swift, to draw more fans to the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LIX logo in 2025 was green and red coloring to it, and once again, the Chiefs and Eagles played in the Super Bowl, keeping the theory alive.\n\n🚨JUST IN: NBC HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL 2025 SUPER BOWL LOGO.\n\n👀👀👀 \n\nWow… pic.twitter.com/Lr9JBjGURl\n\n— MLFootball (@MLFootball) February 10, 2025\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LX was revealed in February 2025 and features a multitude of bright colors, making it difficult to narrow down which team it could represent.\n\nPink and blue are the main colors featured in this year's brightly colored logo; however, since no teams have pink in their jerseys, the main colors to look for are blue, green, and yellow.\n\nTo narrow down what this could mean for the logo theory, here are some teams that incorporate those colors into their uniforms.\n\nOut of that list, the teams that are currently still in the playoffs are: Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nWith all the differing colors and teams these colors could represent, there are many theories as to what this logo could mean.\n\nThe discord between logo theorists will continue until it's really revealed which two teams will play in the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LX is on Sunday, February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Who will play in the 2026 Super Bowl?

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO — Sports Illustrated will bring back one of Super Bowl weekend’s signature parties in 2026, announcing Wednesday that SI The Party Presented by DraftKings will take over San Francisco’s historic Cow Palace on Saturday, Feb. 7.\n\nProduced by Authentic Live and Medium Rare, the event has become a premier off-field destination where league owners, franchise executives, athletes, celebrities and fans converge for a high-energy, all-inclusive nightlife experience outside the game itself.\n\nThe 2026 edition will feature headline performances from The Chainsmokers, Ludacris, DJ Irie and rising DJ-producer Xandra, blending electronic, hip-hop and open-format DJ sets into a genre-spanning celebration. Organizers teased additional surprise guests and moments throughout the night.\n\nPremium all-inclusive tickets, VIP access and table packages will go on sale Thursday, Jan. 8 at 10 a.m. PT, with early entry available to fans who pre-register at sitheparty.com for first access.

    "description": "Answering questions about the 49ers on offense, defense, and special teams ahead of the playoffs",
    "fullText": "After a one-year hiatus, the San Francisco 49ers return to the playoffs. The regular season has been full of rollercoaster moments. The highs include thrilling victories over the Rams and Bears, while the lows feature losing two of the best players in the league at their respective positions.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about Kyle Shanahan this year. Despite all the injuries the offense endured throughout the season, his scheme proved it can transcend the absence of star players. The 49ers were once again prolific offensively, finishing second in schedule-adjusted efficiency and third in success rate.\n\nIf the 49ers are going to make a playoff run, it’ll need to be on the backs of their offense. The defense showed some fight in Week 18, but the depth is depleted, and the margin for error no longer exists. Any drive that doesn’t result in points is a win for Robert Saleh.\n\nExpectations reset in the playoffs. What you did for 17 games doesn’t matter. It’s about which team executes for 50 minutes. With that in mind, let’s discuss five unanswered questions about the 49ers as they enter the playoffs.\n\nLooking at various numbers daily, the ones that show the most correlation with winning are passing success rate and generating explosive plays through the air. For the season, the 49ers finished third in passing success rate, at 53.1 percent. Since Week 11, the offense remained consistent, sitting third once more at 52.8 percent.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense was below league average this season in explosive play rate through the air, ranking 20th. They were much better in the final three games, ranking third, which is encouraging coming out of the bye week. Still, over the final 10 games, on a larger sample, the Niners were 20th.\n\nWeek 18 was a prime example of how difficult offense can be when you don’t generate explosives. The 49ers did it on one drive, and they quickly marched down the field and into the red zone. Outside of that drive, it was tough sledding for the offense.\n\nI’d expect Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff to review the Week 13 matchup between the Eagles and the Chicago Bears and watch it closely, perhaps stealing some of the concepts involving motion.. Ben Johnson windrow dressed his way up and down the field, had Philadelphia’s second-level defenders confused, and found a way to control the game, despite only one explosive passing play. It’s possible, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThere are a couple of trains of thought when it comes to fourth-down decision-making. Before we share those, there is nothing more valuable in football than possessing the ball. The best chance you have to win in this league is when you have the ball.\n\nKnowing that, teams are either uber-aggressive on fourth down because they know their offense is potent and can pick up whatever yardage they need. Then there are the coaches with elite defenses. If you know your defense is stingy, then you can afford to go for it on fourth down because you understand there is a high probability that you get the ball back.\n\nIn Week 18, Shanahan punted the ball on 4th & 2 from San Francisco’s 43-yard line. In a game like that, where every possession is so valuable, the probability of you gaining two yards, retaining the ball, and going down to score was well worth being wrong about.\n\nThere was zero indication that your defense could get a stop up to that point. The Seahawks scored on their previous drive and reached 1st & goal at the 1-yard line on their first drive. The odds that you were going to prevent Seattle from getting to the 43 were slim. Sure enough, Shanahan punted.\n\nThe result worked out, as the Seahawks missed the field goal. However, that doesn’t feel like the right way to look at it. You still didn’t score, nor did the defense stop Seattle from getting to the yard where you punted.\n\nShanahan went for it on the next fourth down. The offense needed one yard. They didn’t convert. That doesn’t mean the decision to go was incorrect. On the ensuing drive, the defense had a free run at Sam Darnold. They should have ended the possession scoreless had Dee Winters sacked Darnold. They allowed a field goal, which works.\n\nHow aggressive will Shanahan be on fourth downs in the postseason? The strength of this team is on offense. Shanahan was correct more often than not during the regular season when it came time to go for it.\n\nAlmost every team is above 50% on correct decisions now.\n\nSharp contrast to a decade ago when only a couple teams would be > 50%.\n\nLook at Carroll/Vrabel! pic.twitter.com/9Q9grE5jdK\n\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) January 5, 2026\n\nThe 49ers are at their best when the offense is on the field. Even against a top defense like the Eagles, keeping the offense out there on fourth downs will give them the best chance to win.\n\nSaleh will put you in a position to make a play. The 49ers are short on talent defensively, but that doesn’t excuse the mental mistakes or missed tackles. The Niners had 23 missed tackles in Week 18, leading to 272 yards after contact.\n\nA.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith aren’t known for being YAC merchants, but they’re not easy to get on the ground. Neither is Dallas Goedert. Saquon Barkley had 759 yards after contact this season. The Eagles have playmakers who can make you look silly.\n\nThe 49ers’ secondary will be put in a position, time after time, in the playoffs to make a 1-on-1 tackle. Malik Mustapha has a broken+missed tackle percentage of 26 percent, which is the 18th-highest among all defensive backs in the NFL. Deommodore Lenoir sits at 22.8, and Ji’Ayir Brown is 22.2 percent.\n\nIt’s problematic when both of your safeties and the corner that you put in cloud coverage as the primary force defender are consistently missing tackles. That’s not on Saleh when his players are whiffing. He can’t tackle for them.\n\nYou can control tackling. It wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners started Eric Kendricks and Kyzir White this Sunday. Since Fred Warner went down, missed tackles at linebacker have been problematic. The Eagles’ offense has been bogged down all year. The last thing Saleh’s unit can afford to do is give them extra chances and free yards because of missed tackles.\n\nSeattle went 6-for-13 on third down, but went 0-for-3 in the red zone in Week 18. The Bears went 6-for-12 on third down, but were 1-for-3 in the red zone. The Colts were 5-for-10 on third downs and scored a touchdown on both of their red zone trips.\n\nTeams have no issues moving the ball on the 49ers’ defense. That’s been a given all season. The postseason success will come down to whether Saleh’s unit can get off the field on third downs or force field goals in the red zone.\n\nFor the season, the 49ers were 10th in opponent red zone touchdown scoring percentage at 53.7 percent and 50 percent during the final ten games. They were 21st in opponent third-down conversion rate, one spot behind the Eagles.\n\nIt comes back to possessing the ball. Your offense needs to be on the field. One way the 49ers’ defense can keep the offense in the game is by holding their opponent to three points or forcing a third-down stop before they reach field-goal range. It doesn’t have to be the majority of the time, either. A 40 percent third-down rate allowed should be plenty good.\n\nIn Week 18, Jake Moody missed a 24-yard field goal after doinking a kick off the upright. Eddy Pineiro’s one miss came at the end of the half from nearly 60 yards. Pineiro’s near-perfection will come in handy this postseason.\n\nThe 49ers’ opponent’s kicking percentage should also benefit them. Last year, teams kicking against the 49ers made 96 percent of their kicks. This season, it’s been a league-low 66.6 percent — nearly six percentage points better than the team in second place.\n\nThe 49ers finished the season ranked 13th in special teams DVOA. The Eagles were 24th. Thanks to Skyy Moore and Brian Robinson, San Francisco was fifth in kickoff returns. Flipping the field once in a playoff game would be huge for multiple reasons.\n\nSurprisingly, the Niners lead the league in hidden points on special teams. It’s something that has been dragging the team down, arguably every season under Shanahan. But this year it’s been one of the biggest strengths on a 12-win team.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoff field is set. We know where all 14 teams will start their run to Super Bowl 60. We don't know where it will end -- just that a dozen franchises will fall short of their goal of making it to Santa Clara for the biggest game of the year.\n\nSome teams will have a smoother road to follow than others. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos earned a well-deserved week off and homefield advantage through their respective sides of the bracket by taking the top seeds in each conference. The Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Chargers, on the other hand, are three road wins away from even getting to see the Lombardi Trophy in person.\n\nWho's got it the easiest? Whose playoff schedule is the hardest? That's what we're gonna find out.\n\nLet's start with the softest paths to the Super Bowl in each conference. And because the obvious answer is \"the team that got the bye,\" let's exclude the Seahawks and Broncos.\n\nThe Rams missed out on a bye by giving up one of 2025's least likely comebacks in a Week 16 loss to the Seahawks. Their punishment? A trip to face the only team in this year's playoff field with a losing record and a point differential roughly on par with the Miami Dolphins. Los Angeles gets to face the league's 22nd-ranked defense and an offense led by Bryce Young. Young, despite his improvements, failed to crack the top 25 among starters when it came to:\n\nand ranked 25th in interception rate. That is balm for a burned defense. Sure, the Rams had a six-game winning streak snapped in Charlotte as a 10-point favorite this fall, but that was on a sloppy, rainy day that provided head coach Sean McVay a blueprint of what not to do in a game that matters.\n\nNext up, if all the top seeds win in Wild Card weekend, would be a game against the Seahawks -- a team the Rams split their season series against thanks to a late implosion in that aforementioned come-from-ahead less. LA would face off against Sam Darnold, who has faded down the stretch in each of his last two otherwise remarkable seasons.\n\nThe NFC title game could feature a showdown against a Niners team the Rams beat by 16 on the road (but lost to in overtime at home) or against Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears. Williams excels against the blitz but struggles with pressure generated by a four-man front. Los Angeles has a top-five pressure rate and a bottom-four blitz rate. It should be able to contain the Bears' late-game surges.\n\nThe Patriots have the top non-bye seed in the AFC. Week 18 delivered them from an early rematch with a Buffalo Bills team that beat them in Gillette Stadium four weeks earlier, erasing a 21-0 deficit in the process.\n\nInstead, they get to face Justin Herbert, author of one of the most crushing postseason defeats in Los Angeles Chargers history (a franchise well versed in them). Los Angeles is a different team than the one that allowed Jacksonville to rally back from a 27-0 deficit in 2023, but Justin Herbert, 0-2 in the playoffs, remains.\n\nHerbert is better than his record suggests and is bolstered by a dominant defense. But he lost last year's postseason opener thanks in part to a Houston pass rush that pressured him on one-third of his dropbacks. The Patriots have generated pressure on 35 percent of passing plays this winter and have Milton Williams back in the lineup to create chaos from the middle of the line. So when LA's backup tackles collapse, Herbert -- more pressured in 2025 than ever in his career -- won't be able to step up in the pocket and create magic.\n\nNext likely comes a date in Foxborough with the Jaguars, Steelers or Bills. Any would be a tough out, but New England has handled Buffalo before. The Steelers have a one-man receiving corps that plays nicely into Christian Gonzalez's presence on the boundary. Jacksonville, as good as its been, is prone to glitching. So is the Denver offense with Bo Nix, which leaves the possibility of a throwback to the Tom Brady days and a home game with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n\nHonorable mention here belongs to those Jaguars, who are riding an eight-game win streak and get to face a Buffalo Bills team that's been uneven throughout 2025 and has few reliable targets to offer Josh Allen. But they still have Josh Allen, which makes their Wild Card matchup at least 40 percent terrifying.\n\nNow let's take a look at the teams with the hardest paths to Super Bowl 60.\n\nThe Packers came into Week 18 knowing they were set to face a team against whom they'd already lost. Thus, we were subjected to Clayton Tune and the worst up-the-middle run in modern NFL history.\n\nThe good news was they managed to avoid a date with the Philadelphia Eagles, who they have not beaten in the Jordan Love era (0-4 if you count his 2022 play in relief of Aaron Rodgers). The bad news is they have to face the Bears, an arch rival in search of their first playoff win since 2010 and eager to upend the franchise that's embarrassed them for the bulk of the last three decades.\n\nGreen Bay split the season series with Chicago but gave up a 10-point lead in the final two minutes at Soldier Field in a game that effectively decided the AFC North champion in Week 16. Jordan Love will be back at full strength after missing most of that matchup with a head injury. Micah Parsons will not, due to a torn ACL. That's a problem.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Williams' passer rating jumps from 83.0 to 104.5 when biltzed. He's also significantly worse when pressured, which suggests he's identifying blitzes, finding open spaces and making quick decisions for easy gains. Without Parsons as a phantom able to crash the pocket from anywhere, the Packer defense has struggled to consistently generate pressure; in their last three games their pressure rate has fluctuated from 40 to 24 to 44 percent.\n\nIf the Packers start sending extra pass rushers on third down, Williams is equipped to handle it. Next up would be the Seattle Seahawks. While we touched on Darnold's late-season struggles, it's also worth noting he's *also* stable against the blitz (his expected points added per dropback rise from 0.05 to 0.08). Green Bay knew it needed to generate a pass rush without blitzing to take down the NFC's best quarterbacks. That's why they traded two first round picks and Kenny Clark for Parsons.\n\nTough break. Especially for a team that cannot possibly host a playoff game this January.\n\nBuffalo is a slight favorite in Jacksonville in the Wild Card, which is a reflection on the Jaguars' past rather than their current status. The Bills depleted secondary has to take on Trevor Lawrence, winner of eight straight games and the league's third-best quarterback (behind Drake Maye and Jordan Love) in terms of EPA per dropback in that stretch (24 total touchdowns, six turnovers). In that same span, the Bills' pass defense has been solid (seventh-best) but its run defense has been awful (29th), giving Jacksonville plenty of leverage should its incredible quarterback sputter.\n\nIf the top seeds hold serve aside from the Jags, a date with the Denver Broncos swarming-but-somehow-underwhelming defense awaits. That group only ranks eighth in total defensive efficiency, but has Patrick Surtain II in the secondary to erase whomever gets the call to be Josh Allen's top target in the Divisional Round. Is Keon Coleman gonna go out there and draw interference flags on Riley Moss? Josh Palmer? Tyrell Shavers?\n\nAllen will have to take matters into his own hands against a defense that's only allowed 18.3 rushing yards per game to quarterbacks in 2025. Go further down the line in a potential AFC title game and you've got an awful run defense matched up against overperforming tailbacks like Rhamondre Stevenson, Jaylen Warren or the Chargers' young duo of Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal.\n\nThe Bills can absolutely make it to the Super Bowl because Josh Allen is a Ford F-150 some trickster god made human. But it's going to require some unheralded players to step up and flesh out his passing game while producing the run stops that force opponents into third-and-long situations. Otherwise, the rest of the AFC is built to poke holes in Buffalo's latest playoff hopes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Who has the easiest, toughest paths to Super Bowl 60?",
