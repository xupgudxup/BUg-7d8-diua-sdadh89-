    "title": "How Jaxson Dart is making a Navy veteran’s football dream come true at the Super Bowl",
    "description": "\"It’ll be a memory that will never be forgotten,\" the 26-year Navy veteran said of the surprise.",
    "fullText": "It took a while for the news to sink in for Gary Schacher.\n\nHe was on a Zoom call with The American Legion and USAA to discuss the logistics of the 2026 Army-Navy game when he learned he was going to the Super Bowl.\n\n“We began talking about the Army-Navy game, and the person from USAA said, ‘Well, you know, the Army-Navy game is like the Super Bowl in college,’ and then he said, ‘Oh, and by the way, you’re going to the Super Bowl,’ and it didn’t register,” Schacher told the Deseret News on Tuesday.\n\n“It took a few more minutes of them to say it again and again that I was selected to go on a trip to the Super Bowl.”\n\nOnce the news finally hit him, Schacher was “shocked” and felt “extremely humbled.”\n\nSchacher, who served in the U.S. Navy and Navy Reserves for 26 years, is one of seven veterans surprised with trips to this year’s Super Bowl.\n\n“I had numerous friends volunteer to go with me, carry my bags. I told them they’d have to deal with my wife (Laurie) on that. She was coming with me,” he said.\n\nThe Navy veteran from Cobbleskill, New York, has USAA, The American Legion and New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart to thank for the opportunity.\n\nThe American Legion nominates veterans and then works with USAA, which partners with NFL players who have military connections or a history of military appreciation, to send those veterans to the Super Bowl.\n\nDart, who has family members who have served, partnered with USAA and The American Legion to announce Schacher’s selection on Jan. 29.\n\n#ad SZN 1 is done but still passing on blessings, sending fellow New Yorker GMC Gary S. to #SBLX in San Fran thanks to @USAA & @AmericanLegion. Gary spent 25+ years in the Navy. Proud to help honor his service 🏈🇺🇸 #SaluteToService pic.twitter.com/y03PUPfkkj\n\n— Jaxson Dart (@JaxsonDart) January 29, 2026\n\nIn a statement given to the Deseret News, Dart said he appreciated the connections he has made with fans and the New York community “who show up for us every single day.”\n\n“To show my appreciation, I’m grateful to work with USAA and The American Legion to recognize a deserving military veteran and NFL fan, GMC Gary Schacher with a trip to the Super Bowl! Coming from a military family myself, it’s important for me to honor those who served because we wouldn’t have the chance to do what we love on Sundays without the sacrifices made by heroes like Gary,” Dart said.\n\nAs part of Schacher’s trip, he gets to meet Dart and other NFL players in the Salute to Service Lounge at the Super Bowl.\n\nThat meeting is what Schacher’s looking forward to the most. Even though he’s a New York Jets fan, Schacher considers himself “a New York fan” and roots for the Giants — as long as they’re not playing the Jets.\n\n“He’s the up-and-coming star of the NFL,” Schacher said of Dart.\n\nThe topic Schacher really wants to talk to Dart about? His Corner Canyon High School connection with former Jets quarterback Zach Wilson.\n\nIn 1980, Schacher enlisted in the Navy at 19 years old in what he described as “a spur of the moment thing.”\n\nOne day, his friend, whose father served in the Army, asked Schacher if he wanted to come to the recruiter’s office with him.\n\nThere, they spoke to a Navy recruiter. A month later, Schacher and his friend had shipped out.\n\nThat “spur of the moment” led to 26 years of service. Schacher began his Navy career assigned to a ship in Mayport, Florida.\n\nAs a Navy reservist, he served with a Weapons Station Unit and a Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Unit. In 1990, he transferred to the Navy Seabees.\n\nHis service took him to several bases in the U.S. and overseas, including New Jersey, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Spain and Iraq, where he served his last tour.\n\nSchacher returned to active duty for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and 2004. He retired in 2006 at the rank of E7 Chief Petty Officer.\n\nSchacher’s two-plus decades of service earned him four Navy Commendation Medals and three Navy Achievement Medals, the Navy Expert Pistol Medal and the Navy Expert Rifle Medal.\n\nHe also received the New York Conspicuous Service Star and the New York Medal for Merit and was inducted into the New York State Senate Veterans Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nSchacher’s service to his fellow military men and women continued into his retirement as a founding member of the Leatherstocking Honor Flight, which transports World War II veterans to Washington, D.C., to visit the World War II memorial.\n\nHe also helped establish the Patriot Highlander Challenge obstacle course, a fundraiser for wounded veterans and support networks in New York.\n\nHe has also been heavily involved in The American Legion. In 2018, Schacher was the first Iraq War veteran to serve as commander of The American Legion Department of New York.\n\nThrough it all, Schacher has always loved playing and watching football, whether it’s high school, college or professional.\n\n“(It’s) just a great sport,” he said.\n\nSchacher sees parallels between the camaraderie found in the military and on football teams.\n\n“Because you’re so involved with your team, whether it’s military or athletics, the camaraderie is just unbelievable, and it’s part of why I joined The American Legion after I got out of the military was to keep that camaraderie,” he said.\n\nTwenty-one years ago, the Patriots beat the Eagles in the Super Bowl. At the time, Schacher was stationed in Iraq. The chief petty officer didn’t have access to a television feed to watch, but he remembers a concrete barrier on the base being painted in honor of the big game.\n\nSchacher doesn’t need to worry about having a television feed this year. He’ll be able to watch the game just fine from his seat at Levi’s Stadium.\n\n“I’m so extremely humbled to be chosen for this opportunity to both USAA and The American Legion and Jaxson Dart for making that press release inviting my wife and I. It’ll be a memory that will never be forgotten,” he said.\n\nWho will Schacher be cheering for Sunday? Definitely not his division rivals.\n\n“New England always destroys the Jets, so it’s hard for me to root for New England. So, I’m going to have to go with the Seattle Seahawks.”",

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s relationship has moved fast, and now it may be heading toward its biggest moment yet.\n\nWith Super Bowl 60 approaching and Diggs hinting at a possible proposal, the couple’s journey from early rumours to family life has come sharply back into focus.\n\nSpeculation around Diggs and Cardi B began in early 2025, well before either acknowledged the relationship publicly. Reports placed them at the same New York nightclub in February, followed by their first confirmed sighting together at a Miami hotel on Valentine’s Day.\n\nTheir relationship stepped into the spotlight in May 2025. Diggs and Cardi were spotted arriving separately but minutes apart at the same Met Gala after-party in New York.\n\nSoon after, they made their first unmistakable public outing by sitting courtside together at a New York Knicks versus Boston Celtics game at Madison Square Garden. The appearance came before any social media confirmation, but the message was clear.\n\nJune 2025 marked the point where Diggs and Cardi went Instagram official. While the original post is no longer visible, both shared photos together from Miami, removing any remaining doubt.\n\nThree months later, Cardi confirmed during a CBS Mornings interview that she and Diggs were expecting their first child together. She described feeling supported, focused, and aligned with Diggs both personally and professionally.\n\nAt the time, Cardi was also promoting her album Am I the Drama?, balancing music, motherhood, and a high-profile relationship.\n\nIn November 2025, Cardi announced the birth of their baby boy. The message framed the moment as a new chapter, blending personal growth with creative ambition.\n\nNow, all eyes are on February 8. Ahead of Super Bowl 60, Diggs teased that a proposal could be part of the plan. Asked directly, he suggested it was “on the agenda,” while also joking that he needed to secure his own ring first.\n\nIf the Patriots win, the moment could extend far beyond football. For Diggs and Cardi, Super Bowl 60 may represent not just another milestone, but the start of something permanent.\n\nNew England Patriots stars predict who Bad Bunny will bring out for Super Bowl halftime show\n\nNew England Patriots star Stefon Diggs sued for defamation just days before Super Bowl LX\n\nBad Bunny and Stefon Diggs give cryptic answer about Cardi B joining Super Bowl halftime show",

    "fullText": "To make Tini's mac and cheese at home, you'll need:\n\nIn her TikTok video, Younger said she opts for cavatappi noodles because their shape holds the cheese sauce better than elbow pasta.\n\n\"All that cream gets all in the hole, so you bite into the cream and the cheesiness,\" she said.\n\nOnce my pasta was al dente, I drained the pot and set it aside while I started the sauce.\n\nI preheated the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and greased my baking dish (Younger recommends using a 9-inch by 13-inch pan) before I started grating all the cheese.\n\nThe recipe includes 2 ½ pounds of cheese, and Younger is adamant that you shred it yourself.\n\n\"Do not use pre-shredded cheese at all,\" she says in the TikTok.\n\nAfter giving everything a good mix, I divided half of the cheese to use for the sauce.\n\nI threw my garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper into a small bowl so it'd be ready for the roux.\n\nFirst, I melted my butter in a large pan over medium heat.\n\nYounger said you should start whisking right after adding the milk to avoid clumps in your roux. This is also when your sauce should begin to thicken.\n\nYounger said you should let each handful of cheese melt before adding more.\n\nI added half of my cheesy cavatappi to the pan, spreading the noodles into an even layer.\n\nI baked my mac and cheese for 25 minutes, until the cheese had melted and began to bubble. Then I threw the pan on broil for two minutes to help give the top a beautiful golden crust.\n\nI made two pans of Younger's mac and cheese (one with breadcrumbs and one without) for my friend's NFL playoffs potluck, and it was one of the most popular dishes of the day.\n\nThe cavatappi noodles were the perfect vehicle for the thick and creamy cheese sauce, giving each bite an explosion of flavor. I far preferred them to the traditional elbow noodles, and I think Younger's mac and cheese convinced everyone that cavatappi is the superior shape.\n\nThe cheese sauce was rich, indulgent, and delicious, and the Dijon mustard added a nice subtle tang. Our group was split 50/50 on whether the mac and cheese tasted better with breadcrumbs, so just stick to your personal preference.\n\nIf you're looking for a Super Bowl side to steal the spotlight, Younger's mac and cheese is the ultimate touchdown.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl Sunday is as much an American tradition as it is an NFL one. There’s pomp. There’s circumstance. And there’s a whole lotta capitalism. If you squint, you may even catch some football in there somewhere.\n\nI needle because I truly love Super Bowl Sunday. I like big events. I like live, pop culture moments. I like experiencing something together with the rest of the world. And, boy, do I love football. The Super Bowl has become an event for the masses, well beyond those who are just fans of football. Whether it’s celebrity watching, highly-produced music acts, or, yes, the commercials, the NFL has managed to make the Super Bowl the biggest night in television every single year.\n\nSo today’s Question of the Day is:\n\nMy answer: Football still reigns supreme when it comes to the Super Bowl for me. I’ll be watching for what should be a fascinating matchup between the Patriots and the Seahawks. I’m fascinated by how both quarterbacks will respond to the biggest of stages, and whether New England can handle a Seahawks team that looks deeper and more well-rounded on paper. And more than anything else, I just want to watch one more NFL game before the pit of despair that is the NFL offseason.\n\nBeyond that, I do enjoy watching the halftime show, because it’s often an artist I’m not that aware of, and I like to broaden my taste in music. That will certainly be the case with Bad Bunny this year, and given that he’s quite literally one of the most popular modern artists right now, I look forward to seeing what other people see in him. I also enjoy sitting back and watching the world argue over whether that was the best or worst Super Bowl halftime show of all time, because there can be no in-between.\n\nFinally, any excuse to eat shrimp and pigs in a blanket is a good event to me.\n\nWhat are your favorite parts of Super Bowl Sunday?

    "fullText": "Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway shouted these words from the victor's podium after the Denver Broncos won Super Bowl 50 by a score of 24-10 over the Carolina Panthers in Santa Barbara, California, on Feb. 7, 2016. It echoed the cry from owner Pat Bowlen 18 Super Bowls earlier, also in the state of California, when Elway helped lead Denver to their first title in franchise history.\n\nToday marks the 10-year anniversary of that victory, which marked the franchise's third championship title.\n\nIn part, Super Bowl 50 was billed as a matchup between the top two picks in the 2011 NFL draft, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (first overall) and Broncos pass rusher Von Miller (second overall). Miller won the battle.\n\nSuper Bowl 50 was dominated by the Broncos' defense, specifically Miller. Miller terrorized Newton throughout the game, sacking the quarterback 2.5 times, forcing two fumbles, making six total tackles (five solo, one assisted) and one pass deflection. Miller was awarded the Super Bowl 50 MVP for his efforts.\n\nOne of the fumbles forced by Miller was returned for a touchdown, recovered by defensive lineman Malik Jackson to put the Broncos up 10-0 early. Newton and the Panthers fought back, but the game never got closer than six points.\n\nDenver quarterback Peyton Manning did not have his best game, finishing 13-of-23 for 141 yards and one interception, taking five sacks along the way. Manning's lone scoring play was a two-point conversion to wide receiver Bennie Fowler. That throw would be his last in the NFL.\n\nManning would ride off into the sunset after Super Bowl 50, which marked the end of his Hall of Fame career. Manning had come to Denver with the goal of winning a Super Bowl. He accomplished that and so much more during his time in orange and blue.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Denver Broncos won Super Bowl 50 on Feb. 7, 2026",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl. That sentence makes my stomach drop. How many times have we heard that line over the last two decades? Nine. That’s how many. After Tom Brady moved on and Bill Belichick traded the NFL out for college, I thought we were done. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and as a fan of the Indianapolis Colts, I’m just not sure I can tune in this year.\n\nThe 2015 Super Bowl appeared to be rock bottom as we witnessed Russell Wilson get picked off at the goal line to secure a fourth Patriot championship. 2017 said, “hold my beer” as the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history occurred when the Falcons lost a 28-3 advantage. After that, I didn’t watch the Super Bowl when the Patriots played. Yes, I missed out on the thrilling Philly Special, but I also didn’t have to watch the horrendous snooze fest that was the Rams losing 13-3.\n\nSports is all about emotion, and I have nothing left to give the Patriots. For the early part of the 2000s, they terrorized the Peyton Manning led Colts, serving as the slamming door to Super Bowl aspirations. Those teams had issues with the Chargers and Steelers as well, but it was the Patriots that served as the ever present thorn. The pendulum swung back and the Colts got some revenge, but once Manning left, it was back to the old ways of losing.\n\nDeflategate was the last nail in the coffin for the true rivalry between these two franchises, but the feelings still remain fresh. The players and coaches are totally different. I have no issue with Mike Vrabel and actually appreciate him as a coach. Drake Maye hardly ever enters my thoughts, but as sports fans, we root for and against laundry. That is how rivalries are built and sustained. The people on the field may change but the fan bases don’t, and this fan, from this base, can’t move on.\n\nIt’s a personal problem and may be mine alone, but it’s the reason I won’t be tuning in this year. My heart, soul, body, and mind can’t take another 28-3 comeback. It can’t take another, “that’s three” from Teddy Bruschi. I can’t stand to witness another Malcom Butler interception or Tom Brady hoisting the Lombardi. Call it ridiculous. Call it PTSD. I have enough memories of the Patriots winning Super Bowls to last a lifetime. I’m not sure I want to add another to the collection.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will fight it out in Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, but who will walk away with the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nSam Darnold can complete the ultimate redemption story if he guides the Seahawks to glory, and against the team he was famously \"seeing ghosts\" against during his struggles at the New York Jets.\n\nDrake Maye can become the youngest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl if he leads the Patriots to a record seventh ring - defeat though will leave them with the most losses ever in the NFL's big game.\n\nSo who will win? We've drafted in a panel of experts from our BBC show The Whole 10 Yards - presenter Hugh Ferris and analysts Phoebe Schecter and Phil McGeoghan to have their say.\n\nWe've also got Radio 5 Live presenters Mike White and Rob Staton along with BBC Sport journalists Paul Higham and Ben Collins.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-24 Patriots\n\nPredicting who is going to win the Super Bowl should be an exercise of head over heart, and yet the build-up tends to be dominated by narratives, not number-crunching. Well, I'm falling for it. The redemption story of Sam Darnold, plus the opportunity for the Seahawks to punch it in a little more successfully than they did against the same opponents at the end of Super Bowl XLIX is too good to ignore.\n\nDespite Seattle's number one defence, it's been their offence that has carried them through the close games in recent weeks, and Darnold's steady performance against the Rams' pass rush in the NFC title game (having struggled against the same team and players in the play-offs a year ago with the Vikings) makes me think he'll handle the Patriots, and the occasion. He might be seeing glory instead of ghosts this time.\n\nIf Seattle win with any offence whatsoever tell me a voter who won't lean into the idea of Darnold completing one of the great comebacks the NFL has ever seen, from draft bust to Super Bowl MVP.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-7 Patriots\n\nThis Seahawks defence has a lot to it and it feels like we haven't seen the best of Drake Maye in a lot of ways during the past two games. But you can see the attitude of this Seattle defence, they are ears back, aggressive, with great fundamentals and they take such pride in the little details.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 30-23 Patriots\n\nYou just don't understand the physicality that you're about to see from the Seahawks on Sunday. You know, I'm just telling you right now, it might not be close, right? This team is going to come out. We're going to be downhill running duo schemes inside zones. They're going to be going to take a deep shots down to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. But I love the tight-ends, what they're doing. I love the scheme. I love the continuity. But really the way Kenneth Walker's running with the football, he can catch fire in a heartbeat.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 28-20 New England\n\nThe Seahawks have been the most complete team this season and when one unit struggles, such as the defence in the NFC Championship, the offence tends to pick it up (and vice versa). They've proven they can outlast the better teams, including the Rams (twice), 49ers (twice), Jaguars, Texans and others.\n\nThe Patriots are brilliantly led by Mike Vrabel, their defence grew as the season went along and in Drake Maye they have an X-factor at quarterback. If the Seahawks don't get in their own way and avoid turnovers, they might just be too strong.\n\nI've gone for Darnold as MVP. Vrabel will likely dip into the Bill Belichick playbook to try and take away the main offensive threat, which is Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Darnold could look to use running back Kenneth Walker in the passing game, Rashid Shaheed downfield and expect Cooper Kupp to make a few plays. Darnold also had his best game of the season against the Rams to get his team to the Super Bowl. If he doesn't turn the ball over the Seahawks have a great chance to complete a glorious season with a championship.\n\nPrediction: Seahawks 27-14 Patriots\n\nWe all love a good revenge game but this isn't Bill Belichick v Pete Carroll, Tom Brady v Russell Wilson or 'Beast Mode' v baffling goal-line playcalling and it's not the 2014 season anymore. What it is though is a redemption story for Sam Darnold.\n\nPerhaps his autobiography will be 'From Ghosts to Glory' after his infamous \"I'm seeing ghosts\" sideline comment in 2019 meeting (against the Patriots of all teams).\n\nHaving made it this far, it will haunt him forever if they don't finish the job. That said, I think Darnold exorcises a few demons by taking home the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nI was tempted to go for Jaxon Smith-Njigba and I think he could still get it but for JSN to have a big night, law of averages suggests Darnold will have played a significant role in that happening so I'll plump for the much more standard QB pick.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nSuper Bowl all-time record book\n\nPrediction Seahawks 17-20 Patriots\n\nSeattle have lost three games this season by a combined nine points, but somebody's got to back the Patriots haven't they? And underdogs have won four of the last five Super Bowls.\n\nI don't think they can win a shootout but I'm not expecting one with these two defences - I'd like them to strike first though as Seattle are 11-0 this season when the score first.\n\nListen, a dominant Seahawks win wouldn't surprise me, but I've just got a feeling Vrabel and Josh McDaniels with all their experience can pull something out of the bag.\n\nThe Pats are 12-0 and allowing just 14.5 points a game when defensive wrecking ball Milton Williams and shutdown corner Christian Gonzalez are on the field together, and they'll both play on Sunday.\n\nAnd if it's close going down the stretch then it only takes one play. Give me the Pats in a nailbiter.\n\nLet's face it, it's a quarterback award isn't it, but since I'm backing a low-scoring upset win I'll go for just the 10th defender to win the MVP. Von Miller was the last, in this very same stadium, wearing all white as well! Aside from the omens, Williams did have a couple of sacks and a forced fumble and recovery on Patrick Mahomes for the Eagles last year and something similar in a tight contest could be a difference maker.\n\nPrediction Seahawks 24-13 Patriots\n\nSeattle's awesome defence, known as the Dark Side, has been the main topic of discussion during Super Bowl week. Drake Maye has shown the ability to scramble and escape the pressure but I think the Seahawks will bring too much heat and stifle the Patriots quarterback.\n\nHe has already taken the second-most sacks in a single post-season (15) and I reckon Seattle will force him past Joe Burrow's record tally of 19.\n\nNew England's defence isn't too shabby either so I expect it to be a tight, low-scoring affair before Seattle go clear late in the third quarter or early in the fourth to clinch it.\n\nSome 17 Seattle players registered at least half a sack this season, with their interior defence particularly aggressive. Tackle Leonard Williams has registered eight sacks and 33 quarterback pressures so I'm backing the 13-year veteran to emerge from the Dark Side and become a rare defensive MVP.\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026?

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will evoke memories of the classic battle between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks on the same stage 11 years earlier, but make no mistake: these are fresh faces taking the field in Santa Clara.\n\nThis Super Bowl is the first in 13 years to feature two head coaches and two starting quarterbacks without Super Bowl experience in their roles. While Patriots coach Mike Vrabel won three Super Bowls as a player and Seahawks QB Sam Darnold was on hand for one as a backup, the experience level of these two teams isn't close to what it was for the participants of the last Super Bowl between these two teams.\n\nPatriots QB Drake Maye in particular is a new face on the Super Bowl stage, as he will become the second-youngest quarterback in NFL history to start a Super Bowl at just 23 and was still in high school when Tom Brady left New England six years ago.\n\nWhile the quarterbacks will receive the bulk of the attention, the Patriots and Seahawks bring two vaunted defenses shaped in the image of their defensive-minded head coach. Points could be at a premium, but nothing is guaranteed as a wild NFL season comes to a close.\n\nHere's what you need to know to watch the Super Bowl, including start time and TV info.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will kickoff at about 6:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. local time) from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nFor Seahawks fans and anyone else tuning in on the west coast, where the game is being played, Super Bowl 60 will start at 3:30 p.m. PT.\n\nFans in the Central Time Zone don't have the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl this year, but they can expect to see Super Bowl 60 kick off at 5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nFor fans in the mountain time zone, the Super Bowl kicks off at 4:30 p.m. MT.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will be broadcast nationally on NBC, with Mike Tirico (play-by-play) and Cris Collinsworth (color analyst) on the call. Melissa Stark and Kaylee Hartung will serve as sideline reporters for the game.\n\nThe Super Bowl will be live streamed on Peacock, NBC's streaming service.

    "description": "Mike Vrabel has Ohio State to thank for starting his playing and coaching career. Now, he can join Buckeye history with a Super Bowl 60 win.",
    "fullText": "Ohio State coaches to win a Super Bowl: Mike Vrabel has chance to join exclusive group originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMike Vrabel's coaching career started at his alma mater Ohio State.\n\nVrabel, however, admitted that it was not the best start at a Super Bowl 60 press conference on Tuesday. The New England Patriots coach detailed a story he tells coaches who ask about the interview process.\n\n\"Nobody is going to have a worse first interview than I did,\" Vrabel said at his press conference. \"I wasn't prepared. I sat down with Urban Meyer in front of a staff, interviewed for a position and completely bombed it and had no idea.\"\n\n\"That's probably my first adversity.\"\n\nIt's safe to say Vrabel has figured it out. The former Ohio State All-American got his first coaching job with the Buckeyes, and he has worked his way into a chance to become the second former Ohio State player to win a Super Bowl as a head coach when the Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday.\n\nWho was the other coach? That's an interesting trivia question.\n\nMORE: Revisting Mike Vrabel's time as a Patriots linebacker\n\nVrabel played defensive line at Ohio State from 1993-96. He was a two-time All-American who still holds the school's career record with 36 sacks. He set a school record with 13 sacks in 1995, which stood until 2007.\n\nThe Buckeyes were 22-3 in Vrabel's final two seasons, including a 12-1 record in his senior season. That Ohio State team featured Hall of Fame tackle Orlando Pace and a defensive line led by Matt Finkes and Luke Fickell, now the coach at Wisconsin.\n\nOhio State lost the regular-season finale to No. 21 Michigan 13-9  but beat No. 2 Arizona State 20-17 in the 1997 Rose Bowl. Vrabel did not win a national championship as a player at Ohio State.\n\nHe coached for the Buckeyes as a defensive line and linebackers coach from 2011-13 before taking a job as a linebackers coach with the Houston Texans in 2013. Ohio State won the national championship the following season under Meyer.\n\nMORE: Inside Mike Vrabel's playoff record as a coach\n\nOhio State has five coaches who won national championships in college in Paul Brown, Woody Hayes, Jim Tressel, Urban Meyer and Ryan Day.\n\nBrown led the Buckeyes to a national championship in 1942 as a head coach before winning three NFL championships with the Cleveland Browns in 1950, 1954 and 1955. Brown also was the owner of the Cincinnati Bengals from 1967-91 – and the franchise made two Super Bowl appearances in 1981 and 1988. Brown, however, never won the Super Bowl as a head coach.\n\nOne of Brown's former players did. Don McCafferty played offensive line for Paul Brown on that 1942 national championship team. McCafferty was the head coach for the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 5 on Jan 17, 1971. Baltimore beat Dallas 16-13 on a field goal by Jim O'Brien with five seconds remaining.\n\nSo, Vrabel would be the first coach from Ohio State to win a Super Bowl since McCafferty, which is a nice piece of Super Bowl trivia ahead of Sunday's game.\n\nMORE: Complete coaching timeline for Mike Vrabel, from Ohio State to Patriots\n\nHere is a look at every Super Bowl coach and the college they attended. Miami, Ohio, has the most Super Bowl coaches with three, a group that includes Weeb Ewbank, John Harbaugh and Sean McVay. Coaches are in alphabetical order by college:\n\nOregon, San Mateo, Grays Harbor, Cal Poly\n\nWake Forest, Butler (Kan.), Nebraska\n\n36, 38, 39, 42, 46, 49, 51, 52, 53",

    "description": "It’s Super Bowl week, and even though the Minnesota Vikings will not partake in the event — they haven’t for […]",
    "fullText": "It’s Super Bowl week, and even though the Minnesota Vikings will not partake in the event — they haven’t for about 50 years — the rumor mill remains active. These are some of the top theories in the purple team’s orbit.\n\nAll three threads point to an offseason defined by QB changes, front office power, and cap maintenance.\n\nThe offseason will turn white hot in one month when free agency kicks off.\n\nThe Purple Rumor Mill for Saturday, February 7th, 2026.\n\nRumor: Fansided claims Mac Jones could be a Viking in 2026.\n\nChristopher Kline mapped out the league’s 10 splashiest trade candidates last week, pairing each with a projected landing spot. On a potential Jones-to-Minnesota scenario, he wrote, “Mac Jones and Kyle Shanahan finally lived their shared dream when the former first-round pick filled in for an injured Brock Purdy this season. Shanahan reportedly preferred Jones over Trey Lance back in the 2021 draft.”\n\nThat belief showed up on the field. “It seems like he was onto something, as Jones delivered impressive results in eight starts for the San Francisco 49ers. He completed 69.4 percent of his passes and threw 13 touchdowns to six interceptions. Purdy is still the 49ers’ franchise QB, however, so it would make sense to cash in while Jones’ stock is high.”\n\nJones didn’t merely stabilize the 49ers’ offense in 2025; he ran it with command. The performance even created a tiny bit of friction among the fan base. Some 49ers fans were impressed enough during those eight starts to argue that Jones should remain in the lineup while Purdy took a seat.\n\nKline also pointed to uncertainty on Minnesota’s side: “It’s unclear how much the Minnesota Vikings trust J.J. McCarthy at this point. The decision to move on from Sam Darnold has aged like milk; even if Minnesota still believes in McCarthy long term, finding a competent bridge quarterback should be an offseason priority.”\n\n“The Vikings’ offense borrows liberally from Shanahan’s scheme. Darnold went from backup duty in San Francisco to starter in Minnesota and blossomed. Perhaps Jones can follow a similar arc.”\n\nFrom a schematic standpoint, Jones would thrive in Minnesota. It’s just unclear if the 49ers are willing to get rid of the top insurance policy in the NFL.\n\nRumor: George Paton may be the frontrunner to replace Kwesi Adofo-Mensah.\n\nIt could be Paton as the Vikings’ next top boss.\n\nThe Athletic’s Dianna Russini wrote late last week, “On Friday, Wilf did not rule out Brzezinski emerging as a candidate for the full-time general manager role. Multiple league sources believe he would be deserving of consideration.” She added, “Another name circulating in conversations with league sources is former Vikings executive and current Broncos general manager George Paton, who still has strong internal relationships.”\n\nPaton circling back to Minnesota carries obvious logic, given his 14 seasons with the organization before landing the top job in Denver. His contract with the Broncos runs through the 2026 season, creating a defined window. One year left.\n\nBased on Russini’s reporting, the timing remains open-ended. The Vikings could explore Paton as early as 2026, or they could take a longer view and wait until the following offseason if circumstances align.\n\nIn the meantime, interim general manager Rob Brzezinski controls a critical stretch. The next three months will matter — a lot. He’s been part of the Vikings’ operation since 1999, and few executives in the league have his institutional staying power. If Brzezinski, alongside Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores, navigates free agency and the draft cleanly, the pressure to install a new general manager will diminish.\n\nRumor: T.J. Hockenson continues to be mentioned as a roster cut possibility.\n\nHockenson’s cap number sits just north of $21 million in 2026. Brzezinski has restructuring options available, but CBS Sports‘ Joel Corry, a former NFL agent, recently projected a release as the realistic outcome.\n\nCorry pointed to a clear production drop-off following Hockenson’s major knee injury. “Hockenson production has significantly declined since having 95 catches for 960 yards with five touchdowns before tearing the ACL and MCL in his right knee 15 games into the 2023 season,” he explained.\n\n“In the two seasons after the knee injury, Hockenson has 92 catches for 893 yards and three touchdowns in 19 games. Hockenson averaged a career-low 29.2 receiving yards per game this season.”\n\nFrom a roster-management standpoint, the financial incentive is obvious. A post–June 1 designation would free up as much as $16 million in cap space, giving Minnesota flexibility at a position where cost and output are totally out of alignment.\n\nHockenson as a cut candidate is a familiar theory so far this offseason. Fans will get a verdict on it in the next few weeks.",

His career ended in such a way, with his last season being lost due to a nagging hamstring injury, that many forget how electric JSN actually was. We look back at his Top-5 Games as a Buckeye.\n\nThe Buckeyes were rolling through their schedule after a week two loss to the Oregon Ducks earlier in the season. They went through the middle part of their Big Ten schedule with some weird wins, and they found themselves in a trap game before The Game. It was hardly a trap game as the Buckeyes came out and demolished the Spartans from snap one till 0:00s.\n\nJSN got off for 10 catches for 105 yards and a score against Spartans. Ohio State took a 49-0 lead into halftime and showed the country its dominance, if only for a week.\n\nOhio State Has HUGE Week: React to the Arthur Smith Hire and Examine the Buckeyes' Crazy Schedule The Ohio State Buckeyes made big waves to start the week with the signing of Arthur Smith as their offensive coordinator in a move that surprised a ton of pe...\n\nOh man, JSN was on a hot streak to end the 2021 season. He had eight straight games of 5-plus catches and 97-plus yards. This game against Purdue was one of his best as he again proved that he was unguardable.\n\nSmith-Njigba was having these numbers and this type of production with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson on the roster alongside him. This might have been Ohio State's best offensive team in recent history, and he was at the center of it. Nine for 139 and one en route to a 59-31 victory.\n\nOhio State welcomed the Oregon Ducks to Columbus and was met with a bit of a rude awakening. Oregon came in and matched Ohio State punch for punch and outdueled JSN on one of those types of days.\n\nSmith-Njigba was unguardable against one of the best teams in America, but this was the first time this year that Ohio State's defense proved to be an absolute liability and ultimately the downfall of their team.\n\nTricked you! You definitely thought this was going to be his No. 1 game, and it probably should be, but there is a performance out there that was better and was more important. This game was off the charts.\n\nBoth Olave and Wilson decided to sit out to prepare for the NFL Draft, so it was just CJ Stroud and JSN making plays, and plays were made.\n\nTikTok · Wheels-Ohio State Buckeyes 216 likes, 2 comments. “Ohio State WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba LEGENDARY Highlights vs Utah | 2021 College Football”\n\nUnguardable, unstoppable, uncontainable, special. However you want to slice it, you were right. This, unfortunately, meaningless game, was Smith-Njigba's best statistical performance.\n\nThe Buckeyes squared off with the 3-6 Nebraska Cornhuskers in an admittedly tough place to play - Lincoln, Nebraska. Ohio State was a huge favorite and unfortunately, sleptwalked their way into this matchup.\n\nThey were up 17-10 at halftime and just 23-17 heading into the fourth quarter. Had it not been for Smith-Njigba's ridiculous performance, this could have been a very very bad loss.\n\nFor that reason, this is my No. 1 JSN performance as a Buckeye.\n\nBuckeye Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots returned to Stanford Stadium on Friday afternoon to wrap up their on-field preparation for Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks. They will hold a final walkthrough on Saturday, but they hay is very much in the barn now.\n\nPatriots pool reporter Linsday Jones was once again at hand to provide updates, just like she did following practice updates on Wednesday and on Thursday.\n\nThe Patriots largely opted against “switching the macaroni” in their final practice of the season, including having assistant coaches go against each other in a lighthearted series of drills. Those coaching drills came after a stretching period early in practice and have become a fixture for the team on Fridays.\n\n“It’s Friday, we’re 48 hours before the game, and that’s just how we normally operate,” head coach Mike Vrabel explained after the session.\n\nSeattle went for a similar approach. Per Seahawks pool reporter Kalyn Kahler, they went with a typical Friday program they refer to as ACT: alignment, communication, technique.\n\nFollowing a special teams segment, Vrabel sent the entire team to the locker room where it spent 14 minutes to simulate the halftime on Sunday. While normal NFL games have 13 minutes between whistles, the Super Bowl’s intermission is longer and thus a change from the established rhythm.\n\nWhen the Patriots returned from the Stanford Stadium locker room, they held team drills featuring the starting offense and defense both going up against the scout team. Afterwards, Vrabel gathered his team for a final huddle before smaller groups of players continued working individually.\n\nThe final players to leave the field were quarterback Drake Maye, tight end Hunter Henry and rookie wide receiver Efton Chism. In all, practice lasted just under 90 minutes compared to the Seahawks clocking in at 96.\n\nFor the first time all week — and in fact since before the divisional playoff round — the Patriots had full attendance at practice. This meant that both off-ball linebacker Robert Spillane and edge defender Harold Landry were available, albeit in limited capacity and later receiving the questionable designation.\n\n“They’re doing everything they can to be ready for the football game and we’ll see how they respond from practice today,” said Vrabel.\n\nSeattle, meanwhile, listed one player — fullback Robbie Ouzts — on its injury report. Safety Nick Emmanwori, who sprained his ankle on Wednesday and was subsequently held out of Thursday’s session, took a normal workload on Friday and was removed from the list.",

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs played an instrumental role in the New England Patriots making it to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowler not only led New England in targets (102), receptions (85) and receiving yards (1,013) during the regular season but gave the offense a veteran presence in the locker room.\n\nDiggs revealed this week that he nearly joined the Patriots’ AFC Championship Game opponent — the Denver Broncos — over the offseason due in part to their head coach, Sean Payton.\n\n“I played against Sean Payton a lot. I’ve seen what his offense can do. So, that was the one thing,” the pass-catcher said, according to the Boston Herald’s Andrew Callahan. “And then a couple of people on the staff that I knew. (Quarterbacks coach) Davis Webb, I was familiar with. He helped me out a lot in Buffalo as far as learning the plays. … That’s kind of how it ended up happening.”\n\nDiggs added that in the end, New England’s decision to hire head coach Mike Vrabel last January, plus the presence of quarterback Drake Maye, influenced his final decision.\n\n“And in weighing my options on what’s going to be the best, I also like coach (Vrabel.) I had a little bit of interaction with him at the Pro Bowl and stuff like that,” the 32-year-old said, per Callahan. “And they had a young quarterback. They both had young quarterbacks. When you weigh all the pros and cons, I felt the Patriots were probably going to be the best fit.”\n\nEx-Patriots QB Joe Milton Dishes On Rumored Feud With Drake Maye",

    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is just around the corner, and this easy slow-cooker Buffalo chicken dip is guaranteed to be the MVP at any party.\n\nPractically every time I entertain friends — be it for game day, the Super Bowl, or any party — I'm always asked if I'll be making my famous Buffalo chicken dip.\n\nOver the years, I've tweaked recipes I've seen online to come up with the easiest, most crowd-pleasing dip. It requires only six main ingredients, plus seasonings you'll probably already have in your pantry.\n\nHere's how to make my easy slow-cooker Buffalo chicken dip.\n\nTo make the dip, which feeds about 10 people, you'll need:\n\nI like to use rotisserie chicken for this recipe because it's often easier and cheaper than buying chicken breasts and boiling them myself. I find that the rotisserie chicken also packs much more flavor, and saves me from having to do any actual cooking.\n\nWhen it comes to game-day recipes, easiest is usually best.\n\nI usually do this step by hand, but you can also use two forks to shred your chicken. By the end, you should have about 3 cups of shredded rotisserie chicken.\n\nThis helps ensure the cream cheese melts evenly and is well-distributed throughout the dip.\n\nYou can use full-fat or low-fat cream cheese for this dip, depending on your preference — I've had success using both.\n\nI usually eyeball how much seasoning I use, but typically go for about a tablespoon of garlic powder, a tablespoon of salt, and a few dashes of pepper.\n\nI use 1 cup of shredded, low-moisture mozzarella cheese and 1 cup of shredded sharp-cheddar cheese.\n\nI use a whole 12-ounce bottle of Frank's RedHot Buffalo sauce, but you can use whichever brand of Buffalo sauce you prefer. I then add ½ cup of ranch dressing on top.\n\nYou don't need to overmix it — as the dip cooks, the ingredients will melt and combine.\n\nScoop along the sides to make sure nothing is sticking to the walls, put the lid on the slow cooker, and walk away. It's that easy.\n\nI stir the dip with a wooden spoon a couple of times while it's cooking to prevent any spots from burning on the side and to help it cook evenly.\n\nThe dip should be smooth and slightly bubbling when it's done, with all the cream cheese and cheeses fully melted and combined.\n\nWhether you're making it for the Super Bowl, a last-minute party, or an easy weeknight snack for the whole family, this six-ingredient slow-cooker Buffalo chicken dip is proof that crowd-pleasing food doesn't have to be complicated.\n\nSimply toss everything in, let it cook, and you'll end up with a creamy, spicy dip that disappears almost as fast as it comes together.",

    "description": "I tried Rachael Ray's seven-layer dip, a party appetizer made with beans, homemade guacamole, and salsa. It was perfect for the Super Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Ray's recipe called for 19 ingredients, including tomatoes, cilantro, avocados, hot sauce, olives, two kinds of salsa, beans, and citrus. Her recipe also required sour cream, which I substituted with Greek yogurt.\n\nLooking at the long list of ingredients at the grocery store, I was skeptical that Ray's recipe would be as easy as some of her others. This recipe required a lot of chopping, as well as homemade guacamole.\n\nI also noticed Ray's recipe didn't include any cheese or meat, which made me wonder how flavorful it would be.\n\nI started by prepping the vegetables and herbs. I cut the green onions into one-inch pieces and picked all the cilantro leaves off the stems.\n\nI minced the garlic and jalapeño, diced the plum tomatoes, and sliced the avocados in half. This was the most tedious part of Ray's recipe.\n\nAfter prepping the veggies and herbs, I heated the refried beans in a pan and seasoned them with 2 tablespoons of hot sauce.\n\nI cooked them for two minutes, scooped them out with a spatula, and layered them in a glass casserole dish.\n\nNext, I added extra-virgin olive oil to the same pan, seared the green onions for a few minutes, and mixed in the tomatillo salsa verde. This step took only a few minutes before it was ready to add to the casserole dish.\n\nFinally, I seasoned the black beans with 2 teaspoons of cumin and added them to the same pan. Once this layer was heated through, I added it to the casserole dish and dumped a 16-ounce jar of chipotle salsa on top.\n\nWhile some of the mixtures were cooking, I combined Greek yogurt with the lime juice and zest.\n\nOnce I was finished with the layers that needed to be heated, I spread the Greek-yogurt mixture over the chipotle salsa. This is when the dip started to look messy — as hard as I tried, it was almost impossible to keep the chipotle salsa and yogurt separate.\n\nI made guacamole by using a fork to mash two ripe avocados with minced garlic, jalapeño, lemon juice, and salt. I layered it on top of the Greek yogurt.\n\nAs a final step, I sprinkled the diced tomatoes and sliced Spanish olives on top.\n\nConsidering how messy some layers got, I was surprised by how aesthetically pleasing the finished dip looked. The freshly chopped tomatoes, sliced olives, and chunky guacamole added appealing colors and textures.\n\nFrom the side, though, I was disappointed that there weren't more distinct layers. After all, this is meant to be a layered dip.\n\nI enjoyed the flavor combinations, like the smoky chipotle salsa and tangy Greek yogurt. Thanks to the creaminess of the yogurt and the savory beans, I didn't miss having meat or cheese.\n\nThe sour citrus, smoky salsas, flavorful tomatoes, and chunky guacamole made Ray's dip taste fresher and lighter than I'd expect from a layered appetizer.\n\nHowever, the texture of the dip was runnier than I would've liked. I made sure to drain the beans and any extra liquid from the salsas, so I'm not sure what happened.\n\nThe layers also blended together as I ate, making it look more like a sauce. I think adding something crunchy, like diced red onions, would prevent this. As it was, the size of the 1-inch green-onion slices made it hard to get any of that flavor or texture in a bite.\n\nThough the dip wasn't perfect, it was still a really tasty appetizer.\n\nMy boyfriend and I inhaled a quarter of the dip in about 15 minutes, so it got full points in the flavor department. Despite the long ingredient list, it was deceptively easy to make.\n\nNext time, I might make a few modifications, like adding diced onions to mix. However, I'll definitely be remaking Ray's dip for future dinner parties.\n\nThis story was originally published in February 2024, and most recently updated on February 6, 2026.",

    "description": "There are free and paid ways to get NBC's full coverage of Super Bowl LX.",
    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 8 at 6:30 p.m. ET. This year's broadcast, hosted on NBC, includes pregame coverage starting at 1 p.m. ET and a pregame show featuring Green Day at 6 p.m. ET. Even if you don't have cable, there are a few ways, both paid and free, that you can watch all the action live from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA.\n\nThe game will be shown on NBC-owned streaming service Peacock, which is available on the web as well as iOS, Android, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. Peacock doesn't have a free trial, and you have to Or you can pay $17 per month for ad-free Premium Plus (live sports still have ads).\n\nThere are a few ways to get around subscribing at full price. Peacock Premium is a perk of both a Walmart+ subscription ($98 per year after a 30-day free trial) and an Instacart+ subscription ($99 per year after a 14-day free trial), so if you have or would benefit from either of these services, now may be the time to sign up. Students qualify for a discounted rate of $6 per month for Peacock Premium. Note that Peacock will also have streaming and on-demand coverage of the Winter Olympics, which begin this weekend, so subscribing for a month may be well worth $11.\n\nThere are a handful of streaming services with live TV that include NBC. Before signing up, check the channel listings for your zip code to confirm NBC is available in your local market.\n\nDirectTV Stream: $50 per month for the first month with current promotions, 5-day free trial\n\nHulu + Live TV: $90 per month, 3-day free trial (includes ads on Hulu)\n\nYouTube TV: Currently $70 per month with promo, 21-day free trial for new users\n\nSling TV (in limited markets): $46 per month\n\nWhen signing up for a free trial, make sure you know when you'll be billed for a paid subscription and cancel before your trial expires. The game will be available in 4K for YouTube TV subscribers (included in the free trial but at an additional fee or at a higher tier with paid plans). The Spanish-language broadcast will be on Telemundo, which is also available on most live TV streaming services.\n\nAnother free (ish) way to get the game is with over-the-air (OTA) TV. Of course, this requires you to invest in a digital TV antenna and have a place to put it that gets good reception. You should check the FCC's reception map to see what signals are available in your area and try your antenna out before game day. Your mileage may vary, so if you want a stress-free watch experience, this probably isn't the best option.\n\nYou can also watch the game through the NFL+ mobile app—a subscription costs $7 per month. Fubo previously carried NBC channels but has been in a contract dispute with NBCUniversal since last 2025.",

    "description": "Waymo has control over where its robotaxi fleet is stationed, allowing the company to respond to temporary high-demand events like the Super Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Here's one way robotaxi companies might have leverage over traditional ride-hailing services: absolute fleet control.\n\nSuper Bowl weekend has arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is projected to attract around 90,000 visitors. The big game will be hosted in Santa Clara at Levi's Stadium.\n\nMassive events like this are major stress tests for ride-hailing services. The demand can easily exceed the supply — that is, the number of available human drivers — leading to higher costs and longer wait times.\n\nAlphabet's Waymo told Business Insider that it can prepare for the showdown because it can fine-tune how many robotaxis approach the stadium — and when.\n\n\"Because we control all aspects of the fleet — the location of all of the vehicles at any point in time, the matching and the routing that happens — we can do interesting things, like when we know there's going to be a big demand surge, we can position more of our fleet down there and we can do that dynamically,\" Chris Ludwick, Waymo's senior director for ride-hailing commercialization, told Business Insider.\n\nUber and Lyft, which rely only on human drivers in the Bay Area for the time being, have some mechanisms in place to prepare for high-surge events.\n\nThe companies can prepare in advance with organizers and local municipalities to coordinate pickup locations. They can also respond to demand by offering incentives or bonuses to human drivers to serve the area on a specific day and time.\n\nOn Lyft, drivers can see bonus areas in advance.\n\nHowever, those responses are not a perfect science, as long wait times and high prices during large events have essentially become commonplace expectations for customers.\n\nRide-hailing companies can try to incentivize workers, but there's no guarantee that enough drivers will be in the area at the exact moment a surge occurs.\n\nFlooding the zone with a lot of drivers isn't necessarily the solution either. Too many drivers can exacerbate traffic congestion and create a supply shortage in other areas outside the hot spot.\n\nLudwick told Business Insider that Waymo had prepared a plan in advance to deploy more of its fleet in the South Bay Area, where the Super Bowl will be hosted, and that the robotaxis would be positioned near the stadium but not too close as to create congestion.\n\n\"And then we're ready to do more or do less depending on how the dynamic conditions are,\" he said.\n\nSpokespeople for Lyft and Uber declined to provide a comment.\n\nTotal control may be one of the advantages of having a fleet of autonomous vehicles in a future where robotaxi operators successfully scale up.\n\nFor now, Waymo operates a fleet of around 1,000 cars in the San Francisco Bay Area — likely far below the number of human ride-hail drivers in the region. Uber and Lyft don't disclose driver presence by city, but in 2017, the San Francisco Treasurer's Office pegged the number at around 45,000 drivers in SF alone.\n\nWaymo also implements surge pricing, like traditional ride-hailing services, when demand is high.\n\nUber and Lyft have said that the limited robotaxi fleet is part of the reason they envision a hybrid ecosystem of robot and human drivers for years to come.\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has previously said that AV-only fleets face the challenge of running a \"highly underutilized network (if supply is built for peak demand) or a highly unreliable network at peak periods (if supply is built for anything less than peak).\"\n\n\"It is important to note that even in San Francisco, 1P AV services are already leaving a lot of demand on the table during peak hours, with average ETAs that are at least 25% higher than Uber as of Q4,\" Khosrowshahi said in prepared remarks for the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nDuring crowded events, robotaxis will also have to navigate temporary road closures, heavy traffic, and the unpredictable behavior of pedestrians. Videos on social media have shown how Waymo's robotaxis can get stuck near first-responder scenes or unexpected power outages.\n\nLudwick said Waymo has experience operating in complex environments, citing the company's operations at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\n\"We're doing over a thousand trips a day to Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, and that's at the terminals where there's other vehicle traffic doing pick-ups and drop-offs at the same place,\" he said. \"We're very capable of interacting in complex environments, and that's just necessary.\"",

    "description": "Both Patriots coach Mike Vrabel and Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold are headed to the big game despite previously getting cast aside by other teams.",
    "fullText": "For anyone who's been handed a pink slip, this year's Super Bowl offers more than just sports and music.\n\nIt is also a rare display of workplace vindication.\n\nOn Sunday, the New England Patriots face off against the Seattle Seahawks for the finale of the 2025-26 NFL season. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel and Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold were both previously with teams that cast them aside — most of which failed to even make it to the playoffs this year.\n\nOf course, getting dumped comes with the territory in pro sports. Vrabel was fired as the head coach of the Tennessee Titans in early 2024 after a power struggle with ownership, while Darnold was passed over by four previous teams: the Minnesota Vikings, San Francisco 49ers, the Carolina Panthers, and the New York Jets.\n\nNow, both Vrabel and Darnold are at the top of their game, their old bosses are sidelined, and one is guaranteed to walk away with a trophy. (If you're a Simpsons fan, cue Nelson Muntz's \"Ha ha!\")\n\n\"It's proof that a different environment makes a huge difference in terms of your potential,\" said Roy Cohen, a career coach in New York.\n\nThe same logic applies to the business world. Some people lose jobs because they aren't a good fit, only to later thrive at other companies.\n\n\"A bad marriage doesn't mean you're destined to always have a bad marriage,\" said Cohen.\n\nGetting fired can be a powerful motivator for people to level up their career, said Dana Sumpter, associate professor of organization theory and management at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School.\n\n\"That means I'm going to double down on my efforts at the next place, not only to ensure that this doesn't happen again, but also to show my former employer, 'Look what you lost,' \" she said.\n\nA client of Nashville-based career coach Bryan Creely initially took a hit to his self-confidence after being sacked from a healthcare startup a few years ago. The client then changed his attitude, launched a job search, and is now in a better-paying, more senior role at a company where he feels valued.\n\nCreely said that kind of end result is common. \"In almost every case, people tend to come out stronger,\" he said.\n\nFeeling hurt, angry, or both is natural after losing a job, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n\"Of course, we have revenge fantasies,\" said Laura Greve, a clinical psychologist in Boston for C-suite executives, politicians, and other high achievers — and a Patriots fan.\n\nIt's not wise, though, to lash out against your former employer or the individual who let you go.\n\n\"Trying to convince somebody that they've mistreated you is something I often have to counsel people against,\" she said. \"That's not productive.\"\n\nInstead, Greve recommends pouring your energy into landing a better role elsewhere — just like Sunday's matchup shows. Getting further ahead in your career at another company can be highly satisfying, especially if your old boss is likely to hear about it. The leaders of the teams that Vrabel and Darnold used to work for are undoubtedly aware that both men have moved on to new gigs where they're excelling.\n\n\"You're looking for restorative justice,\" said Greve.\n\nLikewise, don't gloat to former colleagues or in social-media posts after achieving a career upgrade, or you might hurt your future career prospects, warned Cohen. When verifying your work history, prospective employers may learn about your bravado and not appreciate it.\n\n\"It's not unusual for hiring managers to just pick up the phone and call their buddies at other companies for the down low,\" he said. \"You don't want to burn any bridges, even with employers who treated you badly.\"",

    "description": "We look at the key players and key battles that will decide whether the Seattle Seahawks or New England Patriots will win Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara.",
    "fullText": "In terms of the pre-season betting odds this is the most unlikely Super Bowl match-up for years, but there's no denying the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots deserve to be here.\n\nThe pair have shown different strengths and weaknesses but throughout an unpredictable season they have had long winning streaks and shown enviable consistency.\n\nThe Seahawks are the 4.5-point favourites in Santa Clara but in terms of the numbers there is not much between them at all, so expect this one to be a close call.\n\nIt could come down to a play here, a play call there and perhaps the finest of margins making the biggest of differences - Super Bowl's can by won and lost in the blink of an eye.\n\nSo let's see how the two sides match-up, what the key battles will be and exactly where Super Bowl 60 will be decided.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nBoth sides finished 14-3, won eight games on the road and developed a serious winning habit.\n\nThe Patriots lost their three games by a combined 19 points and the Seahawks lost theirs by just nine in total, so they are both tough to beat.\n\nThis is the first Super Bowl meeting between two teams that finished with both top four scoring offences and scoring defences, showing how well rounded they are.\n\nNew England scored just seven points more than Seattle as they finished second and third on offence, while the Seahawks had the best scoring defence in the league.\n\nThe Pats locked it down in the post-season though. Despite scoring the fewest points ever in three play-off games (54) the defence allowed just 26 points, the second-fewest ever, to fight into the Super Bowl.\n\nSeattle blew away the 49ers then won a shootout with the Rams, and with the better skill position players and quick-strike offence they should have the firepower to win another.\n\nThe Pats will be looking for a tense, tight defensive scuffle in a bid to win a record seventh Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe term 'game manager' has become an insult to modern quarterbacks but that's exactly what you need to win a Super Bowl - especially this Super Bowl with two defences who have conceded an average of just over 17 points per game this season.\n\nDrake Maye is bidding to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, and has had a surgical sophomore season setting records for accuracy even Tom Brady could not match.\n\nSam Darnold's ultimate redemption story could take him from worst to first but even after a super showing to get Seattle here, there are still some doubters around.\n\nSo both will have to handle the pressure of the huge occasion and also of two opposing defences that will be hunting them down. How they deal with that will be key.\n\nMaye's antidote will be his running ability. Excluding kneeldowns he has gained 6.13 yards per carry this season and with 12 of his 16 play-off runs going for a touchdown or first down he's being used in those vital moments.\n\nSeattle need to find a way to bottle him up.\n\nDarnold's not a runner but has the league's top receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to throw to in times of stress and his arm talent is now undeniable. So is his temperament after nine game-winning drives in the past two seasons.\n\nNeither will have felt anything like this pressure though and with solid defences behind them there is no immediate need to play the hero. Whoever manages the game better will hoist the Lombardi.\n\nTeams that have won the turnover battle in the Super Bowl have a 40-7 record. Enough said?\n\nIn a post-season littered with close games turnovers proved crucial - both teams had vital takeaways to win their Championship games and they were first and second in turnover differential in the play-offs.\n\nDarnold struggled all season in this area, leading the league with 20 turnovers, and despite Seattle having zero in the play-offs that will be an area the Patriots hope to exploit.\n\nCoaches will be preaching ball security to everyone all week.\n\nSpeaking of coaches, they can make or break a game from the sideline. Just ask Pete Carroll from this very fixture 11 years ago with that infamous decision to throw on the one-yard line costing Seattle the Super Bowl against the Patriots.\n\nBoth head coaches have been incredible this season - Mike Macdonald is a defensive genius having now built a top defence at previous side Baltimore and in Seattle.\n\nHe's young and one worry is that with him still calling the defensive plays it all may be a bit much in his first Super Bowl.\n\nMike Vrabel can become the first man to win a Super Bowl as head coach and player with the same team, and he could have an ace up his sleeve with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.\n\nA huge success with Tom Brady, this will be a 10th Super Bowl as a coach for McDaniels. In the hardest game to keep your head could that experience be the difference?\n\nThe defensive front seven are the wrecking crews of the NFL, tasked with, among other things, making life as uncomfortable as possible for opposing quarterbacks.\n\nBoth sides excel here with terrific units and we've seen before how dominance here can decide the outcome of a Super Bowl.\n\nHarold Landry and K'Lavon Chaisson combined for 16 regular season sacks for New England, thanks to defensive tackles Christian Barmore and Milton Williams bringing constant interior pressure, collapsing pockets at will.\n\nThe Patriots made Williams the highest paid player in team history with a $104m deal in free agency last year, following a dominant Super Bowl display for the Eagles against Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs.\n\nIf he replicates that here then Darnold is in trouble.\n\nIt's Seattle, though, who could hold the advantage here as they are bringing a four-headed monster of Leonard Williams, Uchenna Nwosu, Byron Murphy and DeMarcus Lawrence who have combined for 30 sacks this season.\n\nLawrence, who left Dallas to win a Super Bowl, has had a sack and forced fumble in both play-off games so far and has been particularly impressive, but it's the danger right across the Seahawks defensive front that gives them the edge.\n\nAs the Patriots will make history by starting two rookies on their offensive line in Will Campbell and Jared Wilson - with left tackle Campbell, the man charged with protecting Maye's blindside, having some rookie struggles.\n\nMaye has been sacked 15 times in the play-offs, the record is 19, and if the two rookies fail to protect him again then it could get ugly - think Patrick Mahomes' two Super Bowl defeats by the Eagles and Buccaneers.\n\nSkill players scoring touchdowns make the headlines, but Super Bowls are won and lost in the trenches - and that battle on Maye's blindside could just decide the whole argument.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'",

The Patriots have a chance to pass them this weekend, however, if they’re able to upset the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAccordingly, it figures that either Pittsburgh or New England would have had the best play in Super Bowl history, which legendary broadcaster Al Michaels revealed this week during his appearance on the “Fitz And Whit” podcast.\n\nAl Michaels on James Harrison’s Super Bowl Pick six:\n\n\"You've got James Harrison what, for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history.”#steelers\n\nFitz and Whit pic.twitter.com/MIW81OEahF\n\n— Matthew Luciow (@matthewluciow92) February 5, 2026\n\nMichaels discussed the Steelers’ exciting 27-23 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, which featured a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown by Pittsburgh linebacker James Harrison off Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner. The play set a Super Bowl record and gave the Steelers a 10-point lead heading into halftime.\n\n“You’ve got James Harrison with, what for me, was the greatest play in Super Bowl history. A hundred-yard interception return at the end of the half. Crazy, down the sideline, he’s almost getting tackled 15 times,” recalled Michaels, who called the game for NBC.\n\nEven though the play happened 17 years ago, Michaels still remembers it like it was yesterday.

    "fullText": "Days before Super Bowl LX, the Seattle Seahawks suddenly have an injury concern on the defensive side of the football\n\nStandout rookie safety Nick Emmanwori, a critical component of the Seahawks secondary and a contender for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, injured his ankle on Wednesday during practice ahead of Super Bowl LX. According to the pool practice report, Emmanwori was “limited in practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury that he suffered during practice.”\n\nAs the report notes, Emmanwori “walked off the field on his own shortly before 4 p.m. Several players and coaches went over to comfort him before he left.”\n\nAsked about the situation after practice, Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald stated that the safety “had an ankle today, we brought him in to look at it, and we’ll kind of go from here and figure out what are the next steps?”\n\nThe rookie safety is a key contributor to Seattle’s defense, the top scoring unit in the NFL. He has lined up all over the field for the Seahawks, spending most of his time down in the box but he has also seen time in the slot, on the outside, and even as a deep safety. His ability to be a stout defender against the run while holding up in coverage allows Seattle to rely on their sub defensive packages, while still being able to slow down opposing rushing attacks.\n\nHe was spotted walking under his own power into the team hotel following practice, but with a noticeable limp:\n\nPlease be alright Nick pic.twitter.com/8TUnAuiqy1\n\n— ᴅᴏxx ⚡️ (@new_era72) February 5, 2026\n\nHis health will be a huge story to follow ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\nUpdate (Thursday evening): Emmanwori did not practice on Thursday due to the ankle injury:\n\nS Nick Emmanwori did not practice because of his ankle injury. https://t.co/J7upYXE0Ne\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 6, 2026",

Landry, who did not play in the conference championship game, said he was confident in his ability to play earlier this week, though missing practice after previously returning isn’t a great sign.\n\nDrake Maye, who suffered a shoulder injury during that same game, was previously listed as a limited participant on the injury report but remained a full participant for the second consecutive day.

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "As the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare for a high-stakes Super Bowl rematch at Levi’s Stadium, anytime touchdown props remain the most electric way to get skin in the game.\n\nWhether you’re banking on Kenneth Walker III to exploit a gap in the New England front or expecting Drake Maye to call his own number on a red-zone scramble, the anytime TD market allows you to turn every trip inside the 20 into a potential celebration.\n\nJoin us as we delve into this popular Super Bowl props market with odds, Super Bowl picks, and insightful TD trends.\n\nBettors have been banking big on Kenneth Walker III, who leads all players with four postseason touchdowns. That includes a sizzling three TD performance against the 49ers in which he ran for 116 yards on 19 carries.\n\nThe bruising back should continue to carry the load for the Seahawks, who will be without Zach Charbonnet, who sustained a season-ending ACL injury against San Francisco.\n\nLooking for extra value? Drake Maye's anytime TD odds have been boosted to +350 by our friends at BET99. You won't find a better price on this market in Canada.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson hasn't scored in the postseason yet, but he finished the regular season with at least one TD in three straight games, crossing the goal line a collective six times in those outings. Expect the Pats' RB1 to scamper into the end zone again on Sunday.\n\nRashid Shaheed is a home run threat and faces a man-heavy scheme from the Patriots, which also him to utilize his speed and seperation. Seattle is also using the WR in the running game with tricky handoffs. He has options on how to get inside the end zone.\n\nRead more of Jason's Super Bowl LX predictions and picks before game time.\n\nMack Hollins has been in and out of the lineup with injuries, but he logged more snaps during the AFC Conference Championship than any other New England Patriots wide receiver, signaling clear trust when he’s healthy. It’s a steep price, but one that makes sense for a receiver who should be competing for the team lead in targets.\n\nNot only is Drake Maye the only Patriot to score a rushing touchdown this postseason, but he's already logged 141 rushing yards on 24 carries against three elite defenses, including two games with double-digit attempts. Don't be surprised to see him call his own number when it matters most.\n\nElijah Arroyo is Josh's longshot Super Bowl TD pick. Although not a primary option, the Seahawks tight end is expected to see around 40% of the snaps and run roughly 30% of the routes.\n\nRead Josh's Super Bowl touchdown prop picks for even more analysis.\n\nJosh expects Stevenson to get all the work to the red zone, but Maye will take the ball over the threshold as the Seahawks have allowed just five RB rushing TDs this year. Shaheed, meanwhile, has breakaway speed and can contribute on both special teams and on offense, while Hollins' price is too long to not add for a +8500 monster moonshot.\n\nRead more of Josh's insights in his Seahawks vs. Patriots Predictions, Picks & Best Bets.\n\nAn anytime touchdown bet involves wagering on whether a specific player will score a touchdown at any point during the game, not just the first TD.\n\nFor example, if you bet on Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson to score an anytime touchdown and he finds the end zone at any time during the Super Bowl, you win the bet.\n\nThis type of bet is popular because it allows for more scoring opportunities, and you can often choose players based on advantageous matchups. The odds can vary based on the player’s scoring potential and the strength of the team’s offensive scheme.\n\nHere are some of the key factors oddsmakers consider when setting touchdown prop odds:\n\nPlayer performance: Historical data on a player's scoring ability, including past touchdowns, carries, and target share, is crucial.\n\nMatchup analysis: The opposing defense's strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, including how well they defend against specific positions.\n\nInjury reports: Injuries to key players can impact a player's likelihood of scoring. Check out our NFL Injuries page to stay up to date before making your wager.\n\nGame script: Oddsmakers consider potential game scenarios, such as whether a team is expected to be ahead or behind and how that may impact their strategy.\n\nPublic sentiment: Betting patterns and public perception can also sway odds. If a player is very popular or a big favorite, sportsbooks may adjust their odds to mitigate risk. You can check out our Covers NFL picks consensus to see how the public is leaning.\n\nThe Super Bowl has evolved into a pass-heavy spectacle, as seen in Super Bowl 59, where five of the seven total touchdowns were caught by wide receivers.\n\nThe table below tracks every anytime touchdown over the last decade of Super Bowls from Super Bowl 50 to Super Bowl 59.\n\nWRs have scored 50% of all TDs in the last 3 Super Bowls.\n\nOften all or nothing. Saquon Barkley had 25 carries but 0 TDs in SB 59.\n\nTravis Kelce has been the standard, but SB 59 saw a TE shutout.\n\nJalen Hurts holds the record with 4 career SB rushing TDs.\n\nCooper DeJean’s pick-6 in 2025 was the first since Super Bowl 50.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

This handy-dandy easy-read guide will make you an instant expert on some of the Super Bowl history at stake well before the Patriots and Seahawks take the field the following Sunday, Feb. 8 (6:30 p.m. ET, NBC/Peacock) at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.:\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60 between Patriots and Seahawks?\n\nSeahawks open as favorites over Patriots for Super Bowl 60\n\nMandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots are the latest of 10 Super Bowl team rematches. The Seahawks and Patriots played a 27-24 thriller in Super Bowl 49 in Arizona, with the Patriots denying the Seahawks a repeat ring. The Steelers-Cowboys have met in a record three Super Bowls. The other previous repeats are Dolphins-Washington, 49ers-Bengals, Cowboys-Bills, Patriots-Giants, Patriots-Eagles, Patriots-Rams, Chiefs-49ers and Chiefs-Eagles.\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots are still a very fresh Super Bowl matchup. Neither team has players left on rosters from Super Bowl 49 11 seasons ago. This is also the first time that neither coach-starting quarterback combination for both teams — Patriots' Mike Vrabel and Drake Maye nor the Seahawks' Mike Macdonald and Sam Darnold — since Super Bowl 47, with it was the Ravens (John Harbaugh-Joe Flacco) beating the 49ers (Jim Harbaugh-Colin Kaepernick) in Super Bowl 47.\n\nThe Patriots are better at winning odd-numbered Super Bowls than even ones. The Patriots can't love playing in Super Bowl 60, given they lost 20, 42, 46, 52. They are 2-4 when the Super Bowl is even coming off an odd regular season. They are 4-1 in previous odd Super Bowls, only losing 31 to the Packers but winning 39, 49, 51, 53. The Seahawks are hoping things will \"even\" out and they can improve to 1-1 against the Patriots in Super Bowls.\n\nThis is the third Super Bowl the 49ers have hosted. Their current home of Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., also hosted the Broncos' win over the Panthers in Super Bowl 50, Peyton Manning's last NFL game. But the Bay Area also hosted Super Bowl 19, when Joe Montana led the 49ers over the Dolphins to victory at Stanford Stadium.\n\nCalifornia will be hosting its 14th Super Bowl. Other than the Bay Area's trio, Los Angeles, San Diego, Pasadena and Inglewood have hosted a combined 11 Super Bowls out of 60. Super Bowl 61 will make that number 15, with the Rams and Chargers hosting only five years after the Rams won Super Bowl 56 at SoFi Stadium.\n\nWhere is Super Bowl 60 located?\n\nWhat to know about Super Bowl 60 halftime show performance\n\nThis is Sam Darnold's second Super Bowl. If you're keeping score, it would be Darnold 2, and the rest of the vaunted 2018 quarterback draft class — Baker Mayfield, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson 0. Darnold was the backup to Brock Purdy during the 49ers' overtime loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl 58.\n\nThis is Drake Maye's second Super Bowl, too. If you count going as a fan at 13 years old to see his Charlotte hometown Carolina Panthers play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50, then the answer would be yes. That game was also played in Levi's Stadium.\n\nDarnold is 0-4 against the Patriots. That includes three times seeing ghosts as a Jets No. 3 overall draft pick in his three seasons with New York. He also went 0-1 facing the Patriots as the Panthers' starting QB in 2021. He lost to Tom Brady twice and then Cam Newton and Mac Jones once each, so this is his first time dueling Maye.\n\nDarnold's passing numbers are terrible combined when facing New England's defense: a TD to 9 interceptions, 52.0 completion percentage, 9 sacks, 5.4 yards per attempt, and a 41.2 rating. He is a much different QB, however, in the last two seasons with Minnesota and Seattle.\n\nDrake Maye is the second-youngest QB to start a Super Bowl. Dan Marino, who led the Dolphins to Super Bowl 19 vs. the 49ers as NFL MVP in 1984, was 23 years and 127 days old. Maye is next now, set for 23 years and 162 days old. Now Maye is trying to beat out Ben Roethlisberger, 23 years and 340 days old in Super Bowl 40, as the youngest starting QB to win the Super Bowl. Brady and Patrick Mahomes didn't win their first Super Bowls until they were 24.\n\nInside Super Bowl 60 broadcast team on NBC\n\nMaye (2024) and Darnold ('19) were both No. 3 overall picks in their drafts. They are the first QBs drafted in that spot to play in a Super Bowl since Falcons league MVP Matt Ryan, who lost in Super Bowl 51 when Brady and the Patriots made their epic comeback from 28-3 down.\n\nMaye is trying to become the fifth second-year starting QB to win a Super Bowl. In order since 1999, the four who did it before were Kurt Warner, Brady, Roethlisberger and Russell Wilson. Wilson did it most recently for the Seahawks in Super Bowl 48.\n\nDarnold is trying to become the second eighth-year starting QB to win a Super Bowl. The other was the Giants' Eli Manning, who won his second ring with the Giants after the 2011 season.\n\nMaye and Darnold can both thank Josh McCown for helping them develop into Super Bowl quarterbacks. Maye, in his 2019 junior year at Myers Park High School in Charlotte, had McCown as his quarterbacks coach. Darnold was backed up by McCown during his 2018 rookie season with the Jets. McCown became the quarterbacks coach of the Vikings in 2024 and was.a big reason Darnold landed in Minnesota to have his delayed breakout season.\n\nMaye (North Carolina) and Darnold (Southern California) are the first QBs to start a Super Bowl from their respective colleges. Maye is the first from UNC, the alma mater of Giants Super Bowl legend Lawrence Taylor. Darnold is the first from USC, who have four Super Bowl rings each from Ronnie Lott and Lynn Swann.\n\nSporting News expert predictions for Super Bowl 60\n\nSuper Bowl 60 picks against the spread\n\nMike Macdonald worked longest for John Harbaugh but also had one season with Jim Harbaugh. From coaching intern in 2014 to defensive coordinator in 2022-'23, McDonald spent nine spread-out seasons with the Ravens under John before becoming the Seahawkss' head coach in 2024. Macdonald was Jim's defensive coordinator at Michigan in 2021, three seasons before they won with Jesse Minnter at DC in '24. Minter replaced John as the Ravens' head coach in '26.\n\nKlint Kubiak is trying to win a Super Bowl as an offensive coordinator where his dad won as a head coach. Gary Kubiak led the Broncos to Super Bowl 50 victory over the Panthers 10 years ago at Levi's Stadium. His brother Klay Kubiak is looking for his first ring as 49ers' offensive coordinator, while his other brother Klein works as a Cowboys' personnel scout.\n\nJosh McDaniels is going for his seventh Super Bowl ring. McDaniels was an offensive assistant for Bill Belichick from 2001-2005 for his first three Patriots Super Bowl victories. He was Brady's offensive coordinator for the second trio of Patriots' rings, including the most recent win, over the Rams in Super Bowl 53. Now he can be the most decorated Patriot, other than owner Robert Kraft.\n\nMike Vrabel is trying to win his fourth Super Bowl ring. Vrabel won his three Super Bowls in the first half of the Patriots' dynasty with Brady and Belichick, serving as star linebacker and occasional red zone tight end.\n\nMike Vrabel would be the first person to win a Super Bowl as a player and coach for the same team. Mike Ditka, Tom Flores, Tony Dungy, and Doug Pederson all have won Super Bowls as players and coaches, but did it for two teams. Vrabel can make history by leading his former team to victory. John Elway is the only person to win a Super Bowl with his team as a player and general manager.\n\nWhy Seahawks' bold move to sign Sam Darnold paid off with return to Super Bowl\n\n3 reasons Patriots defense can dominate in Super Bowl 60\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba and Sam Darnold are trying for the rare Rose Bowl and Super Bowl MVP double. Only the Raiders and Stanford legend Jim Plunkett has pulled that off in both Pasadena and the Super Bowl. Christian McCaffrey fell just short of winning a Super Bowl with the 49ers, while Drew Brees would have done it had Purdue not to lost to Washington in his Rose Bowl.\n\nSmith-Njigba is trying to become the NFL's fifth reigning regular-season receiving yards leader to win the Super Bowl. The last to do this was JSN's teammate with the Rams, Cooper Kupp, after the 2021 season in Super Bowl 56. Before then, it was 49ers GOAT Jerry Rice twice and Cowboys Hall of Famer Drew Pearson once.\n\nKupp is trying to join the club of players to win Super Bowls with multiple teams. There have been 34 offensive players to win the Super Bowl with at least two teams and 64 overall, the latest being former Patriots and Chiefs guard Joe Thuney. The other wide receivers to do it are Billy Davis, Ed McCaffrey, Marcus Nash, Ricky Proehl and Torrey Smith. Linebacker Matt Millen is the only player to win Super Bowls with three teams.\n\nKupp is only one of four Seahawks with previous Super Bowl experience. Darnold and linebacker Ernest Jones, Kupp's fellow former Rams teammate, are two of the others. New running back Cam Akers rounds out the list, who was injured during the Rams' winning Super Bowl 56 run.\n\nMilton Williams is trying to win the Super Bowl with two teams in two years. He won a ring as an Eagles defensive tackle in Super Bowl 59 and is trying to do it as a Patriot in Super Bowl 60.  Only eight previous players have done this: Ken Norton Jr., Deion Sanders, Brandon Browner, Derrick Martin, Chris Long, LeGarrette Blount, LeSean McCoy and Kendall Blanton. Long and Blount went from winning Super Bowl 51 with the Patriots to winning Super Bowl 52 with the Eagles. Williams is going for the flip-flop of that accomplishment.\n\nThe Patriots have five players with previous Super Bowl experience. Williams won Super Bowl 59 with the Eagles, while Hollins joined Long and Blount on the Super Bowl 52 champions. Cornerback Carlton Davis won Super Bowl 55 with the Buccaneers. Linebacker Christian Ellis was on the Eagles team that lost Super Bowl 56. Hooper was a tight end for Ryan when the Falcons lost to the Patriots in Super 51.\n\nStefon Diggs is making his first Super Bowl after 80 career playoff receptions. He is No. 12 all-time in that category. Everyone ahead of him has played in a Super Bowl, with the exception of the Rams' Davante Adams (83 catches, No. 11), whose team lost to the Seahawks in the NFC championship game. Eight of the top 10 players ahead of both receivers have won Super Bowls, with Wes Welker (7th) and Andre Reed (10th) being the two exceptions.",

    "title": "Bosch is betting the Mayor of Flavortown can help it make an emotional connection with Super Bowl viewers",
    "description": "Bosch's North America president told Business Insider the Super Bowl ad is part of a strategy to grow awareness and sales in the US.",
    "fullText": "Bosch has been in the US for more than a century, yet it remains a surprisingly fuzzy brand for many American consumers. The German industrial heavyweight is betting that the \"Mayor of Flavortown,\" Guy Fieri, can help change that as it pours billions of dollars into the region.\n\nOn Thursday, Bosch released the ad it intends to air during the Super Bowl this weekend. It stars a remarkably different clean-shaven, conservatively dressed Fieri, who returns to his normal spiky-haired, brightly colored look when he uses Bosch products — from a circular saw to a cooktop. His French Bulldog, Cash, also has a cameo in the ad, which carries the tagline, \"Like a Bosch.\"\n\nBosch joins a crop of Super Bowl LX advertisers leaning on comedy and recognizable faces this year, as they look to grab attention and avoid controversy during a politically charged year. Major brands are spending more than ever on A-list celebrity talent in their marketing, with CMOs under pressure to produce ads that cut through and deliver meaningful results.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, Paul Thomas, president of Bosch North America, said the company hopes the big game ad will help improve its brand recognition. Through Fieri and the lighthearted, comedic tone of this year's spot, Bosch also wants to foster a stronger emotional connection between customers and the brand, he added. It marks a shift from Bosch's more traditional marketing, which typically focused on technical features.\n\n\"There are a lot of things we're trying to accomplish with the campaign, but primarily to show that the Bosch brand is something you can rely on and helps you improve your life,\" Thomas said.\n\nFieri was a \"no-brainer\" to help achieve these goals because he cooks and does his own construction, often using Bosch products.\n\n\"He represents the confidence, too,\" Thomas said.\n\nSuch was Fieri's transformation for this campaign that some social media users lambasted the celebrity chef's early teaser posts as \"AI slop.\" Bosch said it didn't use AI and instead relied on a makeup artist and some visual effects editing.\n\nA post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri)\n\nBosch is working toward a goal of North America contributing 20% of the company's global sales by 2030, up from around 18% in 2024. It's doubling down on certain categories — such as cordless power tools and home appliances — where Bosch lags rivals in market share. The company has announced more than $6 billion in US-based acquisitions since 2023.\n\nIts big push in the US comes as the company cuts costs elsewhere. Bosch recently confirmed it is cutting 20,000 jobs in Germany after its profits nearly halved last year. The industrial giant is facing competition from Chinese companies in its automotive business, as well as pressures from US tariffs and a decline in demand for household appliances.\n\nThe average price of a 30-second spot during this year's Super Bowl reached $8 million, with some slots fetching up to $10 million, per NBCUniversal, which is broadcasting the game. Thomas said the expenditure on the Super Bowl amid cost-cutting within its home business reflected the balance many companies need to make as they focus on growth.\n\n\"If you don't have a brand campaign, do the problems get even worse in the future?\" Thomas said.\n\nBosch made its Super Bowl ad debut last year and saw \"tangible lifts\" in consumer engagement, such as people entering hardware and appliance stores to specifically ask for Bosch products, he said.\n\n\"It would really be a pity if you did it once and didn't continue on with it because then you lose all the momentum that you could gain,\" he said.",

    "title": "I made 5 Super Bowl appetizers in my slow cooker, and they all deserve a spot on game day",
    "description": "Super Bowl recipes like creamy queso, Buffalo chicken wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese can all be made in a slow cooker.",
    "fullText": "In a bid to find simple Super Bowl party foods that didn't require hours in the kitchen, I decided to test out five slow-cooker recipes.\n\nI've made classics like Buffalo chicken dip countless times in my Crock-Pot, but this time I branched out with options like spicy wings, meatballs, and mac and cheese.\n\nEvery dish impressed me, though the wings were the clear MVP.\n\nHere's how I made the game-day appetizers in a slow cooker.\n\nThese meatballs by Chef Savvy are super versatile: You can serve them on their own with tomato sauce, in a roll for a delicious meatball sub, or with pasta. The ingredients for the meatballs are pretty standard — I used a meatball mix from the grocery store that included beef and pork.\n\nIt's best to mix the ingredients by hand in the bowl to ensure the eggs, breadcrumbs, and meat are well incorporated.\n\nI could see the chopped onion and parsley peeking through the meat mixture. The recipe that I followed said you should have about 24 meatballs — I had that exact number, so I was confident that my meatballs were the right size.\n\nNext, I broiled the meatballs in the oven for about four minutes on each side, careful not to burn them.\n\nI then started gathering the ingredients for the tomato sauce: crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning.\n\nIt's OK if the meatballs are placed on top of each other if your slow cooker is slightly smaller.\n\nAfter adding my tomato sauce ingredients, I set the slow cooker on low for four hours, as per the recipe. However, when I pulled out my first meatball at the four-hour mark, I thought it looked a little underdone. It's important to check your meatballs before eating them, as there can be variations in the cooking time depending on the size of your meatballs or even your slow cooker.\n\nI let mine continue cooking for another half-hour on high to make sure everything was done for dinner time.\n\nI thought the meatballs were perfectly juicy and well-seasoned, while the tomato sauce tasted like homemade marinara that had been cooking on the stove for hours.\n\nI enjoyed the meatballs on their own as an appetizer. However, later in the week, I served some of the leftover meatballs and sauce with pasta for dinner, which really impressed me as well.\n\nI started by mixing together Buffalo sauce, minced garlic, chopped yellow onion, and brown sugar.\n\nWhile I had heard you could make Buffalo wings in a slow cooker, I was admittedly skeptical. I was nervous that the wings wouldn't turn out crispy enough, since that's usually done in a traditional oven or a fryer.\n\nHowever, Spend With Pennies' recipe called for broiling the wings after cooking them in the slow cooker, which would crisp them in just a few minutes.\n\nThe chicken wings that I bought didn't have the drumsticks and flats separated, which added a bit of time to my preparation.\n\nAfter they were fully cooked, I removed them from the slow cooker and placed them on a sheet pan with foil.\n\nI then brushed some of the Buffalo sauce still in the slow cooker over the wings. I then put them under the broiler for about three minutes on each side until they were crispy and slightly blackened.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how easy these wings were to make, and loved how the slow cooker made the wings extremely tender.\n\nThe wings were crispy on the outside, while the meat inside was tender, juicy, and moist. I also thought they were the perfect spice level — they had a kick but didn't set my mouth on fire.\n\nI thought these would fit in well at any game-day or Super Bowl party.\n\nI've tried a number of Martha Stewart's slow-cooker recipes in the past, and I've enjoyed a majority of them. I was excited to see how Stewart's queso dip recipe would turn out.\n\nLike a lot of her slow-cooker recipes, this dip only required a few ingredients, which I really appreciated when it came to braving the grocery store a week before Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI started by adding American cheese and pepper jack cheese to the slow cooker and mixed it with a small amount of cornstarch.\n\nI mixed it until it was creamy and then seasoned it with salt.\n\nYou'll know it's done when the dip is bubbling and slightly thickened.\n\nI added sliced jalapeños, red onion, and cilantro.\n\nI thought the pepper jack and American cheeses meshed well together, while the tomatoes and green chilies added a lot of flavor. I really liked the texture of the dip — it wasn't too thick or too watery.\n\nI also really liked how this dip only called for a few ingredients. It would definitely make life a lot easier when cooking for a group of people on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nThe celebrity chef shared her recipe for slow-cooker macaroni and cheese in her cookbook, \"Martha Stewart's Slow Cooker.\"\n\nThe recipe calls for three cups of white sharp cheddar cheese and one cup of Gruyere, which creates the sauce. The third and final cheese in this recipe, Parmigiano Reggiano, is added to the breadcrumb mixture later.\n\nI softened the chopped onion with a tablespoon of butter.\n\nAfter mixing the ingredients with the uncooked macaroni, simply leave the slow cooker to cook on high.\n\nTo make the breadcrumbs, the recipe instructed me to pulse two slices of bread in a food processor. I then toasted the breadcrumb pieces on the stove for a few minutes until they were golden brown.\n\nI thought that the three different kinds of cheese, especially the smoked Gruyere, made for a complex flavor profile, while the onions added a savory flavor to the dish.\n\nThe base for the Buffalo chicken dip by Taste of Home calls for crumbled blue cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, and ranch dressing.\n\nI mixed those ingredients in a medium-sized bowl before spreading the dip in a single layer in the bottom of my slow cooker.\n\nYou can use rotisserie chicken or simply boil up some chicken breasts and shred them yourself with a fork, like I did.\n\nI could already tell this dip was going to be delicious.\n\nI set the slow cooker to warm and began prepping my toppings. I added another layer of American cheese and put the lid on the slow cooker to allow the cheese to melt. Then, I chopped up one green onion and added it to the top.\n\nThe layers of the dip were perfectly proportioned. With each bite, I got a delicious mouthful of cheese, hot sauce, and chicken. This recipe really impressed me, and I would definitely make it again.",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL, playing in London's Finsbury Park in the British amateur game.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles waived cornerback Josh Jobe the offseason before they won Super Bowl 59. He went on the sign with the Seahawks practice squad and developed into a bona fide starter helping lead Seattle to Super Bowl 60.\n\nIt’s the ultimate comeback story. Jobe has become a key component in Seattle’s Nickel defensive along with rookie Nick Emmanwori.\n\nAccording to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Jobe ranks sixth in fewest yards per target allowed among defensive backs this season, including playoffs. His teammate, Riq Woolen, is ranked third.\n\nMORE: Seahawks standout safety Nick Emmanwori injured ahead of Super Bowl 60\n\nThe secondary is part of what makes Seattle the best defense in the NFL this year. Head coach Mike Macdonald is another component. The 38-year-old coach was asked Wednesday about Jobe’s journey from practice squad to Super Bowl starter and how far along he’s come.\n\n“It’s a great example of … the pride that we take and how we run our program,” Macdonald said. “If you play great football and you’re a great teammate, you’re gonna get an opportunity to play. Josh was someone we acquired at the beginning of last year.

He just kept hitting those daily inputs. It’s powerful when you stack those things.

    "description": "It’s been a staple of the wide receiver's routine before each game he’s played this season for the New England Patriots.  It was McDaniels whom Diggs credits with unlocking a work ethic he hadn’t had during his pro career.",
    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Left back pylon. One knee. Head bowed. Eyes closed.\n\nThat is how Stefon Diggs will spend some of his final moments prior to kickoff of the first Super Bowl of his career.\n\nIt’s been a staple of the wide receiver's routine before each game he’s played this season for the New England Patriots.\n\nFollowing pregame warmups, he also calls his teammates in to huddle around him as he leads one of a series of impassioned, fiery and often viral speeches.\n\n“I just say what I feel like I’m supposed to do and just go,” Diggs said. “It’s not so much the words, it’s more so the tenacity.”\n\nThen, he turns the volume down for his prayer in the corner of the end zone.\n\n“Taking a second to kind of appreciate where I am and give my thanks to God and kind of have my little moment with him. Thanking him for the trials and tribulations,” Diggs said. “Building my character up a little bit as a person and making these shoulders weight-bearing, I guess.”\n\nBoth are necessary for the player whom teammates call the emotional centerpiece of their Super Bowl run. And for Diggs, it’s been fuel during a comeback season that didn’t seem likely after his tenure in Houston last season was cut short by a knee injury.\n\nBut, after posting his seventh 1,000-yard receiving season in his 11th year in the league, he may also be the not-so-secret weapon for an offense that will need to be at its best against a Seattle defense that allowed an NFL-low 17.2 points per game during the regular season.\n\nSo many of the things that got Diggs to this point stemmed from an initial sense of trust he found early in his free agent process last summer.\n\nWhen Diggs signed with Houston in 2024, he acknowledged it was in an effort to chase a championship. But Diggs purposely didn’t have many expectations after signing in free agency with New England.\n\nWhat drew him initially to the Patriots was a sense of trust he felt after finding an almost instant connection with wide receivers coach Todd Downing, who was the tight ends coach in Minnesota in 2018 when Diggs was there.\n\nHe got the same thing from the “straight shooter” he met in coach Mike Vrabel, as well as offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. It was McDaniels whom Diggs credits with unlocking a work ethic he hadn’t had during his pro career.\n\nMcDaniels said the veteran receiver has been the perfect match for second-year quarterback Drake Maye.\n\n“I think it’s great for Drake to be around a player as accomplished at Stef,” McDaniels said. “Drake has learned how to assimilate with him, (to) work together with a player that has been around a long time and been around a lot of good quarterbacks. I think it’s been great for Drake’s growth and development.\"\n\nAfter Diggs eclipsed 1,000 yards during New England’s regular-season finale, a win over Miami, Maye’s mind went back to the preseason when he invited all the receivers to his home state of North Carolina for some throwing sessions.\n\nHe didn’t think someone as “big time” as Diggs would have time to participate. But he did.\n\n“Kind of from that point on, I felt like, man, looking forward to getting with him on the field and seeing him do his thing, and he’s done his thing time and time again,” Maye said. “Some games he’s not getting the ball as much as any receiver would want to, and he’s still trying to block hard and keeps the energy up and breaking the team down and motivating me.\"\n\nWide receiver DeMario Douglas said Diggs also has been central to their group bonding.\n\n“Before this season even started we got close,” Douglas said. “That was a big reason of us not being selfish. Of course, we’re all receivers, we all want to touch the ball. But ... like your brothers, your blood brothers, you want to see them do great no matter what. This is how it is in our room.”\n\nDiggs has also created a new Patriots fan along way, thanks to his high-profile relationship with Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B. She has not only been a force cheering for Diggs on social media, but a presence in team owner Robert Kraft’s suite during games.\n\nShe and Diggs also celebrated the birth of a son together in November. It's helped Diggs keep his mind on football after being accused in December of strangulation and other criminal charges in connection with a dispute with his former private chef. Diggs has denied the allegations.\n\n\"She wasn’t a football girl before I converted her over,” Diggs said. “But I’m just thankful to have her in my corner. She’s an amazing woman and continue to build that relationship. ... I just appreciate her. Hopefully build on that and watch that tree grow.”\n\nAs for Sunday, Diggs expects to bring the same voice for his team that he has all season.\n\n“I mean what I say and say what I mean,” Diggs said. “My teammates know that, and the biggest thing is they know I’m trying not to be a ‘rah-rah’ guy. I try to be more show rather than I tell. It’s the fact that I can back my words up with what I say. I try to go as hard as I can to give it everything I’ve got.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "title": "From Super Bowl speech to run blocking, how Cooper Kupp helped reshape Seahawks",
    "description": "Cooper Kupp’s Seahawks teammates and coaches raved about his impact as they gear up for the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots.",
    "fullText": "Frisman Jackson didn’t waste any time when the Seattle Seahawks signed Cooper Kupp in last spring. The Seahawks receivers coach knew what Kupp represented. He was formerly one of the most productive receivers in NFL history — a Super Bowl MVP after winning the statistical triple crown in 2021 — who had just been cut by the Los Angeles Rams after three straight sub-1,000 yard seasons.\n\nKupp’s perspective, Jackson thought, would be invaluable toward helping his group elevate the Seahawks to make a run to the Super Bowl. The receiving corps was at an inflection point after trading D.K. Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers and releasing Tyler Lockett days before signing Kupp. All while the team was pivoting at quarterback away from Geno Smith toward Sam Darnold.\n\nSo Jackson tapped Kupp to get up in front of the meeting room and offer his perspective to his fellow receivers.\n\n“I had him talk in the front of the group and say, ‘talk to us about your experience the year ya’ll went to the Super Bowl,’” Jackson said. “We’ve been on this mission since before we came for phase one (of the offseason program) when I had him stand in front of the room and talk about what it means to play in the Super Bowl.”\n\nKupp’s words wound up being helpful and prophetic. The Seahawks are in the Bay Area preparing for Super Bowl LX and are 4.5-point favorites over the New England Patriots to lift the organization’s second Lombardi Trophy. They got there on the back of arguably the NFL’s best defense, but there’s little chance they would have earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC and beat the 49ers and Rams in the playoffs without the play of their receivers complementing Darnold’s ascension in his first season with Seattle.\n\n“It’s about playing for each other,” Kupp said. “I think one of the things that I’ve noticed that the best teams I’ve been a part of, guys play for the guy next to them. It’s a cliché thing, but it’s the hardest thing to do when you get to the NFL because there’s so much at stake. And it’s hard for people with their own ambitions, their own families and all this different stuff that’s going on, to commit to the belief that truly the best thing for them and the best thing for our team is that the team succeeds.\n\n“The most powerful thing you can do is have a group of guys that are playing for something outside of themselves and we’ve had a lot of guys embody that this year.”\n\nThe Seahawks haven’t been to a Super Bowl since winning it after the 2013 season. Only four players on the roster have Super Bowl experience. One is Kupp, who caught eight passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns in the 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI. Two others were his teammates with the Rams: Ernest Jones IV and running back Cam Akers. Darnold served as Brock Purdy’s backup with the 49ers during the loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII.\n\nThe Seahawks have leaned on Kupp’s experience in their preparation for Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n\n“I can’t speak highly enough of Coop. What he’s meant to our offense, not only our offense but our team. The mindset that he has,” Darnold said. “The way he leads by example. If he does say things, he’s one of those guys where the entire room is dead silent. And they’re super focused on what he’s saying because we know that he doesn’t waste his breath. He’s always going to be able to say something very mindful. For us, speaking for the players, but also the coaches, he’s had a huge impact on all of us in that building. Really fun playing for Coop and what he’s brought to all of us.”\n\nKupp has been a tone setter for his fellow receivers and pushed to raise the standard for players and coaches, Jackson said.\n\n“He challenges you as a coach from a schematic standpoint. He’s going to ask questions and you better know the answers to them,” Jackson said. “You can’t bull crap him.”\n\nJackson said Kupp specifically elevated the conversation about receivers’ blocking in the running game. It stems from Kupp playing for Rams coach Sean McVay, who like Kubiak and other coaches from the Kyle Shanahan tree, emphasizes receivers blocking when they’re not catching passes.\n\nAnd while trying to take the onus off Darnold and playing to their defense, the Seahawks had the third most rushing attempts in the NFL during the season.\n\n“Before I had Coop, when I talked about the run game, it was very limited, because most wideouts say, ‘give me my rule, who I’m supposed to block, and that’s the end of it,’” Jackson said. “With Coop, I’ve really had to be locked in. He’s going to ask me, what’s the Mike point, what’s the call that the O-line is going to and how it affects his block. And so he’s really challenged me in that regard and really changed my coaching style and philosophy and how I teach the run game to the guys.”\n\nKupp’s production isn’t at the same level as his previous Super Bowl season. In 2025, he had modest totals of 47 catches for 593 yards, the second fewest of his career, with just two touchdowns. It was a far cry from the 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns when he posted one of the great seasons in NFL history in 2021, which he capped by earning Super Bowl MVP for catching a pair of touchdowns in the victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThe 32-year-old caught a touchdown against his former team in this year’s NFC championship game, with three of his four catches converting third downs in the 31-27 victory. He finished with 36 yards.\n\nBut what Kupp lacked in numbers throughout the season, he made up for in leadership and providing a good example for his teammates, which began with his speech in March.\n\nKupp has helped Jaxon Smith-Njigba grow into one of the game’s most productive receivers. Kupp said Wednesday there were similarities to their games, with Smith-Njigba initially being thought of as a slot receiver before being moved all over the field in 2025. Smith-Njigba had a Kupp-like 1,793 yards to lead the NFL this season.\n\nAsked what advice Kupp gave Smith-Njigba that has stuck with him most: “Process over results,” Smith-Njigba said.\n\nSeattle’s brass moved on from Metcalf and Lockett to allow Smith-Njigba to have a runway to more targets. And Kupp was added because he played in a similar scheme in L.A. that Seattle would run under first-year coordinator Klint Kubiak, who is expected to be named the new head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after Sunday’s Super Bowl.\n\nKupp had no problem not being Seattle’s top target.\n\n“You got guys who make be locker room lawyers — they might go in a corner somewhere and complain about things. That’s not Coop,” Jackson said. “He’s been fantastic. I could talk hours and hours about the professional that he is, how he goes about his business and how selfless he is.”",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and  if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs have always been the biggest thorn in the Buffalo Bills’ path when it comes to the Super Bowl. In fact, Josh Allen has lost four different contests against Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs over the years.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs have always been the biggest thorn in the Buffalo Bills’ path when it comes to the Super Bowl. In fact, Josh Allen has lost four different contests against Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs over the years. That’s why, when those same Chiefs missed the playoffs this year, it should have been good news for the Bills’ locker room. Except it wasn’t.\n\nAccording to Allen, the team never focused on the Chiefs’ exclusion from the playoffs. It went against what many football fans were thinking at the time when Buffalo reached the postseason with a dominant run no less. Many believed that the absence of Mahomes was another significant advantage for the team.\n\n“That’s something that we don’t talk about in the locker room, really. We don’t really care so much about who else is in the playoffs with us, how to get there, or how to get it done. The short answer is we didn’t get it done this year. And that’s on us, that’s on me,” Allen saidduring his appearance on First Things First.\n\nIt’s surprising to hear, to say the least. After all, Allen has lost to Mahomes by one score in the playoffs three times. Last season, less than one yard decided the outcome of the game.\n\nLater on, Allen shed some light on his mentality going into this postseason.\n\n“We’re going to keep working tirelessly until we find a way to get there and get it done. I understand the people’s thoughts of you don’t have no Mahomes, no Lamar, no Joe Burrow in the playoffs. But there’s some dang good teams in this playoffs. They’re not there just by chance. They’re there for a reason. And the two teams that are in the Super Bowl, they deserve to be there,” Allen stated.\n\nSome may see it as an excuse from the former MVP, but Allen is right. There were a few teams better than the Chiefs in the AFC this season. Even the Jacksonville Jaguars went on a run, giving the Bills a tough test in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe Denver Broncos ultimately ended up being the team to send Allen home this time around. They had an elite defense and were playing with home-field advantage. Allen turned the ball over four times in that game, including a pivotal overtime interception. It went down as another heartbreaking playoff loss in Bills history.\n\nMaybe one of these years, Allen and the Bills will get over the hump. At this point in his career, a Super Bowl win is a massive monkey the QB can’t seem to get off his back. It does, however, sound like he will always stay motivated to win one because of his love for the game. Still, the lack of a Lombardi Trophy in his hands must be starting to wear on him.\n\nThe post Bills News: Josh Allen Says Locker Room ‘Didn’t Really Care’ About Chiefs Missing the Playoffs appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX is set for Feb. 8, when the Lombardi Trophy winner for the 2025–26 season will be decided in a showdown between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe halftime show will take place as the teams head to the locker room, with music star Bad Bunny stepping in to deliver a performance sure to grab plenty of attention.\n\nReactions to the NFL halftime show are split. Some fans have gone so far as to say they will boycott the performance, while others are perfectly fine with the global music star taking the stage.\n\nMORE: Bad Bunny’s new Super Bowl 2026 trailer sends clear message ahead of halftime show\n\nKevin Durant, however, falls into a different category altogether. The longtime NBA veteran recently spoke candidly about Bad Bunny and his music, offering a personal perspective as the Super Bowl LX halftime show approaches.\n\nDurant appeared on Kay Adams’ Up and Adams podcast on Wednesday, where he shared that he has not listened to any of Bad Bunny’s songs. When the former NFL Network reporter asked Durant, “I want to know how you’re doing?” he replied, “Doing better. We’ll see in the morning.” Later, when Adams said, “Well enough to like to dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?” Durant simply confessed, “I haven’t listened to Bad Bunny before.”\n\nKay Adams: \"I want to know how you're doing?\"\n\nKevin Durant: \"Doing better. We'll see in the morning.\"\n\nKay: \"Well enough to like dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?\"\n\nKD: \"I haven't listened to Bad Bunny before.\"\n\n(via @UpAndAdamsShow)pic.twitter.com/d6mXJcmwqv\n\n— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) February 4, 2026\n\nThe Puerto Rican star became famous with songs like ‘Soy Peor’ (1.1 billion views on YouTube), ‘Mía’, and ‘Dákiti’. His albums, including ‘YHLQMDLG’, ‘El Último Tour del Mundo’, and ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, were huge hits. His ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ especially made history because a Spanish-language album became one of the most popular in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBut some NFL fans are unhappy about Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He has been outspoken on social and political issues, especially about U.S. immigration policies and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nHe made a high-profile speech at the 2026 Grammys condemning ICE actions and calling for empathy toward immigrants, which upset many conservative viewers. These critics see him as too political and say his views don’t fit a traditionally neutral sports event.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Kevin Durant stuns NFL world with honest Bad Bunny confession ahead of Super Bowl halftime show appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will not be attending the Super Bowl after being warned he would likely be resoundingly booed by the crowd inside the stadium, according to a report.\n\nThe thin-skinned president had previously offered the unlikely excuse that he would not attend the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday in Santa Clara, California, because it was “too far away” and because he disliked the planned performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\nHowever, several of Trump’s advisers have now told Zeteo that the 79-year-old was urged not to attend the game in the deep-blue Democratic state because he would likely receive a less-than-friendly reception.\n\nClips of Trump being loudly booed in front of tens of thousands of spectators—and potentially more than 100 million viewers at home—going viral would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told Zeteo.\n\nTrump was met with a mixture of boos and cheers when he attended last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut since then his approval ratings have plummeted across the board, with the president losing support over his handling of the economy and his hardline immigration policies, particularly in the wake of the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump’s dire polling numbers, combined with the Super Bowl being held in a state that has overwhelmingly rejected him in the past three presidential elections, led one aide to conclude it was “best to stay away from this one.”\n\n“Whatever [the crowd’s makeup] ends up being, it’s not gonna be a Turning Point USA speech,” the aide said.\n\nTrump told the New York Post last month that he would skip this year’s Super Bowl because he was unhappy that Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny would be performing the halftime show. Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "title": "Anthropic's Super Bowl spot skewers ChatGPT: 'Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude'",
    "description": "While Anthropic doesn't outright name ChatGPT, it's clear who the target of its coming Super Bowl ad is.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is taking a shot at OpenAI on the biggest stage possible.\n\nOn Wednesday, Anthropic rolled out a glitzy ad campaign that will air nationally during Sunday's Super Bowl, which implicitly centers on OpenAI's plans to bring advertising to ChatGPT.\n\n\"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\" the tag line reads.\n\nThe declaration shows that Anthropic is willing to draw a line in the sand with its no-AI-ads-in-chatbots stance. But the move also means Anthropic is declining to pursue a potentially key revenue stream for Claude at a time when AI companies are spending more than ever in the AI race.\n\nWith much of Anthropic's revenue coming from its enterprise business, the company may feel it's a worthwhile tradeoff and a way to further differentiate its offerings from OpenAI's.\n\nAnthropic has booked a 30-second spot during the game and an additional 1-minute ad during the pregame for what is historically the most-watched live television event in the US.\n\nThe 30-second spot features a scrawny guy asking a buffed trainer, \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" While at first the trainer gives helpful information in the voice of an AI chatbot, the trainer quickly segues into an ad.\n\n\"Confidence isn't just built in the gym, try Step Boost Max, the insoles that add one vertical inch of height and help short kings stand tall,\" the trainer says.\n\nAnthropic's 1-minute-long spot is even more provocative. It features an adult man in therapy who is trying to connect more with his mother. After giving some general advice, the AI chatbot-like voice segues into an ad for a fictional dating service for younger men seeking older women.\n\n\"If the relationship can't be fixed, find an emotional connection with other older women on Golden Encounters, the mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars,\" the therapist responds in the voice of a chatbot.\n\nTwo additional ads in the campaign feature a woman in a restaurant asking for feedback on a new business idea and a student asking a professor for help with an essay.\n\nIt's not immediately clear how much Anthropic is spending on the Super Bowl campaign. Mike Marshall, head of global advertising for NBCUniversal, whose network has the rights to this year's game, recently said a 30-second spot costs roughly $8 million.\n\nLast month, OpenAI announced plans to begin testing ads in the US for its free and Go tiers of ChatGPT. While anticipated, the announcement illustrated just how much CEO Sam Altman has changed his views on monetizing the chatbot with ads.\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nAs part of the announcement, OpenAI said that ads would \"not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.\"\n\n\"Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you,\" the company said in the announcement. \"Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.\"\n\nIn case the ad campaign wasn't clear enough, Anthropic released its own lengthy statement pledging to keep ads off of Claude.\n\n\"Ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAnthropic, founded by seven former OpenAI employees, including CEO Dario Amodei, has also repeatedly shown it's not above taking implicit shots at its rival, though the Super Bowl ads represent an escalation of the AI wars.\n\nIn December, Amodei poked fun at companies that declare \"Code Reds,\" denounced others that are \"Yoloing\" by making risky bets on future AI demand, and extolled the virtues of Anthropic's business model, built on the enterprise market. Individually and collectively, the remarks came across as implicit shots at OpenAI, though Amodei repeatedly declined to name his target.\n\nWhen asked, \"who is Yoloing,\" Amodei responded, \"So that's not a question I'm going to answer.\"\n\nAnd while Anthropic still isn't naming names, the target of their taunts will be hard for Super Bowl fans to ignore.",

    "description": "NBC analyst Devin McCourty compares the Lions’ 2025 struggles to Patriots teams that dealt with coordinator turnover and explains why Detroit must adjust fast.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions didn’t suddenly forget how to play football in 2025, but according to NBC analyst and former Patriots captain Devin McCourty, they ran straight into one of the hardest realities in the NFL: coordinator turnover.\n\nSpeaking recently about Detroit’s season, McCourty said the Lions’ drop-off wasn’t surprising at all. In fact, it looked painfully familiar to what he lived through during his 13-year run with the New England Patriots.\n\nAnd if Lions fans are looking for a silver lining, McCourty’s message was pretty clear: this is fixable, but it’s real.\n\nMcCourty pointed to multiple moments in Patriots history when New England took a step back after losing key coordinators. Even with Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and elite talent still in place, things didn’t always click immediately once new voices took over.\n\n“One thing I’ve learned,” McCourty explained, “is when you lose coordinators, that creates so much unknown.”\n\nHe lived it firsthand. After New England won the Super Bowl in 2007, Brady’s knee injury in 2008 and the challenge of replacing offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and defensive coordinator Dean Pees stalled the Patriots for several seasons. The roster was strong, but the rhythm wasn’t the same.\n\nMcCourty says that’s not a coincidence — and it’s exactly what Detroit just experienced.\n\nDetroit entered the 2025 season with new coordinators on both sides of the ball, then changed offensive play-callers midseason. Now, the Lions are preparing for yet another offensive shift in 2026 with Drew Petzing taking over play-calling duties.\n\nFrom McCourty’s perspective, that kind of churn matters — even when the scheme looks similar on paper.\n\n“Brian Flores didn’t call the defense the same way Matt Patricia did,” McCourty said while reflecting on New England’s own transitions. “Yes, it was a lot of the same stuff, but it was different.”\n\nThose subtle differences, he explained, can impact timing, confidence, communication, and ultimately results.\n\nOne key distinction McCourty made clear: the Lions’ roster is not broken.\n\nThe core of Detroit’s team remains largely intact from the group that won 15 games in 2024. That matters. A lot.\n\nIn McCourty’s eyes, this wasn’t a collapse — it was a recalibration year while players and coaches tried to adjust to new systems, new voices, and new expectations.\n\nStill, he warned that the Lions can’t just assume things will magically snap back into place.\n\nMcCourty didn’t sugarcoat it. If the Lions want to contend for the Super Bowl in 2026, there’s work to do — especially in establishing clarity and continuity.\n\nNew coordinators don’t just need time to install schemes. Players need to trust them. Coaches need to align. And the entire organization has to move in the same direction again.\n\nThat’s the part, McCourty says, fans often underestimate.\n\nThe good news? Detroit has the foundation. The bad news? The margin for error is smaller when expectations are sky-high.\n\nThe post Detroit Lions’ 2025 Regression Didn’t Surprise Super Bowl Champ Devin McCourty appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "Jarran Reed is in his second stint with the Seahawks and does not take his path to Super Bowl LX for granted.",
    "fullText": "Jarran Reed earns a living in the pit, the trenches of NFL combat, and this pleases the Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle to no end.\n\nHe is a football lifer, a 10th year veteran of interior clashes and scrums that often decide the winners and losers in a sport rooted in crunching contact. On Tuesday afternoon in San Jose, the 6-foot-3, 315-pound 33-year-old Reed beamed at what he has accomplished, and his journey to Super Bow LX on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium. You can be sure he will have a say in how it all turns out against the New England Patriots.\n\nA native of Goldsboro High School in North Carolina, Reed’s story is a familiar one in the Pacific Northwest. He has reveled at the chance to be a run-stuffer and quarterback chaser since he first slipped on shoulder pads and a helmet. He ground his way through East Mississippi Community College, shoring up his game and his academics, and he starred with the Alabama Crimson Tide on the defensive line.\n\nA second-round draft pick by Seattle in 2016, Reed spent the 2021 season with the Kansas City Chiefs and the 2022 campaign with the Green Bay Packers. He re-signed with Seattle in 2023, signing a $12.8 million deal before having it extended in March to a 3-year package for $25 million.\n\nAll told, Reed has done his share of the heavy lifting in helping propel the Seahawks to the season’s final weekend in the franchise’s 50th year. And it isn’t just warding off blockers and plugging gaps that make Reed invaluable. He is a locker room leader who offers fiery pep talks as a veteran who has seen it all. Coach Mike Macdonald often has Reed address the team after games, anointing the veteran to mentor and inspire one of the NFL’s youngest teams.\n\nReed takes none of his path for granted, not in a sport where change is part of the business. Reed has been too good to supplant, and he said he wants to play several more seasons.\n\n“Oh, not one bit (do I take this for granted),” Reed said. “Everybody’s journey is different. I’m very grateful for this, and it’s taught me a lot. Coming from Goldsboro, North Carolina to East Mississippi, then Alabama...all the roles were there to get me to this moment.”\n\nReed said the Seahawks immediately responded to Macdonald, the defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens in 2022 and 2023 who was hired as head coach by Seattle before the 2024 season.\n\n“It started early with OTA’s, and we attack the day, attack the week,” Reed said. “Everybody needs to be tackled.”\n\nReed said he enjoys studying game film, be it the linemen he will encounter or the ball carriers the Seahawks are tasked to stop. He said that he is big on preparation, mind and body. He said that he thinks of NFL stars over the years who did not reach a Super Bowl.\n\n“Some greats never made it, never got a chance to experience this,” Reed said. “Man, I’m here, Year 10. I got a national championship in junior college, and at Alabama, and now I’m here to see if we can pull it out in the Super Bowl this week.”\n\nReed has always been country strong and became stronger through strength and conditioning. He said that as long as he can overpower the guy in front of him, he will continue to play.\n\n“I made a joke the other day in the weight room,” Reed said. “Now I got that grown-man strong, that dance strength.”\n\nReed said Seattle’s defense is united. That included arriving to the Super Bowl’s Opening Night media session as a unit in the same ride.\n\n“One thing I said (Monday) is that Bus 3 is the defensive bus, like, nobody gets on Bus 3 but the defense. We’re just like brothers out there. We trust each other on the field. We know where each player is going to be on the field. We play off of each other, and that connection started outside the locker room.”\n\nReed added, “We hang together a lot, a real close-knit group.”\n\nHow does a man last this long in the pit? Money is a great motivator, to be certain, and so is the zest to compete.\n\n“Just the love of the game,” Reed said. “And definitely everybody’s playing to get to the Super Bowl. Man, I love the game. It’s done a lot for me. I’ve been playing since I was a kid, five years old, and 33 now, and I’ve got a lot of football left.”\n\nReed said he had a sense he could make quite a living in this sport by the time he arrived at Alabama, among the college football programs that annually churn out NFL prospects.\n\n“I figured that I could really make this thing work and make this a great life, a life goal, a life-changing experience,” Reed said.\n\nBecoming a father was also a life-changing experience, Reed said. His oldest daughter, Jacey, was born shortly before he was drafted in 2016, when he would make FaceTime video calls with his infant girl who perked up at the sound of his voice.\n\nNow 10 years old, Jacey doesn’t hesitate to climb over her father at home, even if his body aches from the rigors of a game. She has a sister who also jumps aboard Mount Papa. This isn’t trench warfare, not with the girls giggling and their father rolling on his back and side in preparation for a kid ambush.\n\n“My daughters are amazing,” Reed said with a smile. “Look, I’m their jungle gym. They love crawling all over their dad. I really don’t mind. And it doesn’t stop them (if I’m sore or not).”",

    "fullText": "Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi trophy as confetti rains down has always been considered the stuff of dreams. It’s one of the most coveted championships in all of sports. It’s what children emulate when they organize backyard football games, and Tom Brady is doing his best to remind both Sam Darnold and Drake Maye of that ahead of their respective debuts at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGiven the fact that he’s both won and lost more Super Bowls than most players will ever sniff throughout their careers, it’s safe to say that there’s no better person to humor before venturing into the gridiron’s grandest game than the former New England Patriot. Although it’s just as important to remember that, while confidence and encouragement are key, the hardcold truth is that not everybody can be Brady.\n\n“The reality is that the best team, in a one-game series, doesn’t always win,”he noted to Colin Cowherd during his most recent interview. “In football, you really only have one chance to get it right. That’s the challenge. You could have an off day,” he added.\n\nIn highlighting the Los Angeles Rams’ botched punt against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Brady suggested that it doesn’t take much to give your opponent “all of the momentum,” and that those moments happen incredibly fast. “That’s how finicky the game is,” he suggested.\n\nWhile it may be a bit funny to hear the most successful signal caller in NFL history refer to his former profession as being “finicky,” it’s also a testament to just how much the Super Bowl means to players. In other words, those being the ones of Brady’s former Super Bowl rival, the star tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, “Losing a Super Bowl will never make you want to go back and win one.”\n\nIf anything, knowing that you only get one shot at cementing your name in the analogs of American sporting culture makes things that much harder. “That’s why I always think basketball, baseball, a seven-game series, does identify the best team, because you get seven chances to get it right,” Brady suggests.\n\nEven if this eventually proves to be neither Darnold nor Maye’s last Super Bowl appearance, both men are well aware that they won’t get a second opportunity at winning their championship debut. Throw in the fact that both teams feature a top-five defense from a points allowed perspective, and it’s safe to say that both of these quarterbacks know that their margin for error on Sunday will be painfully slim.\n\nThen again, that’s yet another one of the many things that make the Super Bowl the biggest game of the year, and we simply wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe post “You Could Have an Off Day”: Tom Brady Warns Sam Darnold and Drake Maye Ahead of Super Bowl 2015 Rematch appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Literally, there's a 12-foot bronze statue of the seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback standing outside of Gillette Stadium that serves as a permanent reminder of what came before.\n\nPatriots quarterback Drake Maye is less than a week from competing in his first Super Bowl, and he has soaked up every tidbit of knowledge he has ever received in his few interactions with Brady, who is widely recognized as the greatest quarterback of all time.\n\nAt opening night for Super Bowl LX, the second-year signal-caller was asked to share the best advice he has ever received from Brady.\n\n\"I met Tom a few times, and one of the best things he said is no shortcuts to it,\" said Maye. \"There's no shortcuts to putting in the work. The proof's in the pudding, and knowing that the shortcuts that people take and try to take is not worth it. You get the most out of what you put into it, and he's been great at that, and he obviously showed that throughout his career.\"\n\n\"There's no shortcuts to putting in the work.\"\n\nValuable advice from Tom Brady to Drake Maye 🙌\n\nSBLX Opening Night on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/d8wHcBtzpY\n\nThose sound like words of a former sixth-round draft pick that few thought would even make it to the NFL, much less win seven Super Bowls.\n\nMaye isn't trying to be Brady.

In response, the New England Patriots wide receiver responded, “It’s on the agenda, maybe, right? Right?”\n\nHe jokingly added, “I gotta get mine first.\"\n\nHe and the musician have been dating for several months and share a son — whose name has not yet been released, and who was born in November — together. The \"Am I the Drama?\" rapper announced the baby news in September.\n\nThe two first sparked romance rumors after they were spotted together in New York City and Miami in February 2025, per TMZ. They took their relationship public in May 2025 with an appearance together at a New York Knicks playoff game.\n\nThe next month, Cardi confirmed her relationship with Diggs on Instagram. Though the musician appeared to hint at a breakup a month later when she removed every photo with the wide receiver from her feed, the couple is still going strong.\n\nCardi has supported Diggs at a number of his games over the course of the season. In January, she celebrated the Patriots' AFC Championship 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos, sealing their spot in the 2026 Super Bowl.",

    "fullText": "Thomas Brown could be another branch on the McVay tree\n\nSean McVay’s coaching tree with the Rams has a wide reach, but one name that never comes up in those conversations is Thomas Brown. Although Brown actually has head coaching experience already (he was Bears interim head coach in 2024), his rise through the ranks since being an offensive assistant for McVay from 2020-2022 has slipped through the cracks.\n\nBut Brown’s secret could be out of the bag if he’s instrumental in helping the Patriots beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl on Sunday.\n\nBrown is the Patriots pass game coordinator.\n\nOnce a running back for the Falcons and Browns, Brown started as a strength and conditioning coach at the University of Georgia in 2011. By 2020, Brown was hired by McVay as a running backs coach on the Rams and was added the title of assistant head coach in 2021. He was moved to tight ends coach in 2022.\n\nFinally, Brown moved on and took a job with the Carolina Panthers on Frank Reich’s staff as offensive coordinator in 2023 after he was passed over for the same job in L.A., as McVay opted to go outside the organization to hire Mike LaFleur to replace Kevin O’Connell instead. LaFleur is leaving this week to become the head coach of the Cardinals, leaving an opening for Rams OC.\n\nProbably not. It is widely expected that McVay will try to retain Nate Scheelhaase as offensive coordinator. But Brown’s name is back on the market as one that many teams would like to have. He also interviewed for the same Cardinals head coaching position that went to LaFleur. As passing game coordinator in the Super Bowl, Brown could be in line for a full-time OC position somewhere rather than working under Josh McDaniels again.\n\nBrown’s short tenure with the Panthers went as poorly as Reich’s. He was let go with the rest of the staff after one season. He was then hired by the Bears as pass game coordinator in 2024, then promoted to OC when Shane Waldron was fired, then promoted to interim head coach when Matt Eberflus was fired.\n\nHe is now pass game coordinator for MVP candidate Drake Maye and he continues to work with tight ends.\n\nBrown won a Super Bowl with the Rams in 2021. After so much turmoil in 2023 and 2024, he could win his second this weekend and do so against the Seahawks.",

    "description": "With Super Bowl Sunday around the corner, it's time to build a roster of easy air-fryer recipes to help feed your guests in time for kickoff.",
    "fullText": "For any Super Bowl party, the air fryer is the real MVP.\n\nWith the Super Bowl just around the corner on February 8, it's time to build a roster of easy air-fryer recipes to feed your guests in time for kickoff.\n\nAir fryers have become a popular kitchen gadget, found in around two-thirds of US homes, according to market-research firm Circana.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to cookbook authors Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the writers behind Air Fryer World, about their go-to game-day appetizers for the air fryer, and also dug into popular recipes that can be made in the appliance.\n\nHere are 10 easy game-day foods you can make in an air fryer.\n\n\"You can definitely use the air fryer if you like crispy foods, appetizers, and chicken wings,\" said Todd Porter and Diane Cu-Porter, the bloggers behind Air Fryer World.\n\nOne suggestion they had for air-fried game-day foods is air-fried chicken wings.\n\n\"Wings are awesome in the air fryer! The hot circulating air makes them naturally crispy, but for extra crunch, use cornstarch for an awesome crust,\" they said.\n\nTo follow Air Fryer World's recipe for ultra-crispy wings, toss your slightly dried chicken wings with your desired spices and olive oil. Make sure your air fryer is pre-heated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit before adding them. When they're done, usually in under 10 minutes, toss your wings in your favorite sauce and put them on the table, ready to eat.\n\nAnother game-day appetizer is Air Fryer World's recipe for jalapeño poppers with bacon. To make them, start by stuffing hollowed-out jalapeño peppers with cream cheese and cheddar, wrap them in bacon, and cook for 10 to 12 minutes at 380 degrees Fahrenheit until the bacon is crispy.\n\nYou can also buy premade frozen poppers and use the air fryer to crisp them up, by following this recipe.\n\nTo make them, roll mini sausages or hot dogs in crescent dough and set your air fryer to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, according to this Pillsbury recipe. For an even cook, you want to ensure the pigs in a blanket aren't overcrowded, so you might want to make them in rounds if you're making a lot.\n\nHowever, they should only take a few minutes to get nice and crispy, so they'll still be on the table by kickoff.\n\nFrozen tater tots can easily be made in the air fryer by spraying an even layer with a little cooking spray and tossing them halfway through the cooking cycle.\n\nThen, get to work choosing your toppings. You can create a loaded tater-tot bar, with additions like sour cream, chopped green onions, shredded cheese, queso, store-bought salsa, or guacamole.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, sauté some bacon or chorizo in a saucepan and top your loaded tots to your heart's content.\n\nThese \"fries,\" which The Recipe Critic calls \"a low-carb, keto-friendly snack,\" pair well with multiple sauces, including ketchup, ranch, or even a spicy mayo. For a little added flavor, mix garlic powder or cayenne into your breading before tossing it with olive oil-topped zucchini slices.\n\nTo make, pre-cook your hollowed-out potato skins and place them inside the air fryer, skin-side down, according to one recipe by Air Fryer Eats.\n\nWhen they're almost crispy, fill them with your choice of cheese and stick them back in the air fryer for a few minutes. Then, top with bacon, green onion, or sour cream.\n\nWhether you choose to go classic Italian with your flavors or dip your cooked meatballs in barbecue sauce, making meatballs in an air fryer is much faster than a typical oven and will be just as delicious.\n\nAir Fryer World recommends placing an even layer of meatballs into the air fryer and baking them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for between 7 and 12 minutes until they're golden brown.\n\nYou can either bread your own shrimp, like this recipe from All Recipes, or follow the instructions on the back of most frozen coconut-shrimp packages for cooking them in the air fryer.\n\nServe with a tartar sauce or spicy mayo.\n\nAir Fryer World says that for perfectly crispy dumplings, you'll want to spray them with a little cooking spray before frying them. To get both sides evenly cooked, flip them over at the eight-minute mark and continue cooking for a few more minutes until they're done.\n\nServe with a little soy sauce and green onion.\n\nYou can make your favorite stuffed mushroom recipe as usual before air-frying, or go with Air Fryer World's recipe for cheesy stuffed mushrooms. Either way, moisten your air fryer basket or foil with cooking spray or olive oil and arrange your stuffed mushrooms evenly in the air fryer.\n\nPork sausage also works well as a filling, but you can also use spinach and cream cheese for a vegetarian twist.\n\nCook them at 360 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 to 8 minutes, then add the cheese and cook for another 2 minutes.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny opened Gekko, a Japanese steakhouse in Miami, in 2022. Ahead of his Super Bowl appearance, I wanted to see if it was worth the hype.",
    "fullText": "I was surprised by the restaurant's location, which is far from the exclusive, low-profile celebrity enclave I'd expected.\n\nInstead, it's located across from Brickell City Centre, a buzzy, crowded mall with a wide range of retailers, from mass consumer brands like Bath & Body Works, H&M, and Apple to more high-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue, Richard Mille, and Porsche Design.\n\nIt is also next to a gas station, and traffic makes the intersection loud and chaotic.\n\nMaking the reservation online was easier than I expected, especially for a Friday night during Miami's peak tourist season.\n\nWhen I booked it — only a couple of days before I went — nearly all dining times were available for inside, outside, and bar seating, suggesting that either the restaurant wasn't a highly popular choice or that reservations weren't always needed.\n\nWhen booking my reservation online, I had to agree to a dress code that forbade athletic wear, shorts, tank tops, cutoff sleeves, and flip flops, as well as \"athletic- or beverage-branded baseball hats.\"\n\nI didn't find the dress code restrictive at all; I saw it as the restaurant's effort to keep out overly casual patrons and to make dining there feel like an event.\n\nSitting inside the restaurant, I could see how high-profile guests might feel at home in its intimate space.\n\nThe tables set around the perimeter of the restaurant were dimly lit. Booths in the back and private dining areas indicated that the place was designed with privacy in mind.\n\nAfro-house and reggaeton music played throughout the restaurant — it was loud enough to conceal nearby conversations but not so loud that we needed to shout.\n\nA three-sided chef's counter at the center of the dining space felt like a stage for them and their work.\n\nHowever, the sushi chefs weren't eccentric performers. Instead, it felt like watching masters of their craft artfully handle their exclusive ingredients.\n\nThe menu, which has five steak offerings, also includes a section devoted to five different wagyu options, ranging from the $120 4-ounce A5 Hot Stone entrée to the $598 4-ounce olive-fed \"Wagyu Experience.\"\n\nAside from the steaks on the menu, wagyu is also featured in other dishes, from appetizers like wagyu crispy rice, dumplings, and steak tacos, to surf-and-turf nigiri with lobster.\n\nI got the wagyu crispy rice, one of the restaurant's most popular appetizers. At $34, it's also one of the most affordable wagyu items on the menu, and it's meant to be shared.\n\nThe dish came with four pieces of fried rice squares topped with raw wagyu tartare and crispy capers.\n\nThe raw meat was the star of the show, with each rice square featuring a generous portion of the tartare. It had a strong, spicy, slightly acidic flavor that complemented the velvety, rich beef. The crispy capers were the cherry on top, and I found myself craving those more than the wagyu itself.\n\nFrom looking at Gekko's menu, you know what kind of crowd would most usually dine here, and what their tax brackets might be.\n\nItems on the menu feature ingredients like caviar and lobster, and don't shy away from using 24-karat gold leaf. I tried to pick as many of the glitzier dishes as I could while staying within a reasonable budget.\n\nFor my main bites — all two of them — I got the gold-topped otoro nigiri, which was $19 a piece, and the surf-and-turf nigiri, which featured torched wagyu and lobster, and cost $17 for one piece.\n\nWhile other nigiri pieces were half the price for a comparable portion, I went into the meal hoping to test whether the upcharge and hype were worth it.\n\nThe gold-topped otoro nigiri was silky and melted in my mouth. Even as someone who isn't the most well-versed in the difference between cuts of tuna, I could tell that the quality of the fish was unlike any I had tried at more affordable price points.\n\nI felt similarly about the surf-and-turf nigiri bite. The thin-sliced torched wagyu had a delicious smoky flavor, and the bite was velvety, with the wagyu's marbling making for a really pleasant texture.\n\nIf each bite wasn't the price of a full budget meal, I could've devoured a few more.\n\nIn trying out some of the most expensive items, I found that some high-end elements, like the gold leaf or the lobster, didn't play as much of a role as I expected for the price point, and that I would've enjoyed the dishes just as much without them.\n\nFor a total of $164 after tax and tip, I only got six bites of food: four in the crispy rice appetizer, which was labeled as an item to share, and one bite in each of the nigiri.\n\nThe total also included two drinks and dessert.\n\nWhile the bites were excellent and well-balanced, I felt some components of the dishes were just fancy for the sake of looking expensive and didn't add much to the dish for me, like the 24-karat gold leaf on the tuna nigiri.\n\nAt \"only\" $24, which felt reserved compared to some of the other menu items, the miso dulcey lava cake was the most worth-it item from my visit, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back just for it.\n\nThe decadent, made-on-demand dessert, which came with a 15-minute wait as staff prepared it, featured silky vanilla ice cream, shortbread crumbles, and icing printed with the restaurant's logo.\n\nThe cake itself had a crispy, toasted exterior and a rich, miso-and-dulce-de-leche filling that spilled out. Paired with the ice cream and crumbs, this dessert was the standout for me.",

    "description": "The Patriots’ defensive coordinator made his first public appearance since his cancer diagnosis at Super Bowl Opening Night.",
    "fullText": "Drake Maye commanded the biggest crowd during the New England Patriots’ appearance at Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday. Mike Vrabel and Stefon Diggs also drew plenty of attention at their respective spots on the risers, as did other big-name players.\n\nTerrell Williams, meanwhile, was not as prominently featured. He did not have a riser, nor any fixed cameras watching his every action over the 60-minute period. And yet, interest in him was still substantial.\n\nFor good reason, too: the 51-year-old made his first public appearance since leaving the team with a cancer diagnosis in late September. Having recently been found cancer-free, he joined the Patriots on their trip to Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nWilliams will not resume his full duties as defensive coordinator yet. However, he will continue keeping a close eye on a unit that has delivered some uplifting moments for him amid personal challenge.\n\n“It’s been joyous for me just to watch them, and watch them develop and watch them buy into the message that [Mike Vrabel] is preaching,” Williams said. “Trust me, I’ve been in this game a long time and it’s not easy to get people these days to buy in. Vrabes has that unique ability to get them to do that. That’s the fun thing to watch. I know exactly what he’s telling them.”\n\nHead coach Mike Vrabel has been vital in guiding the Patriots in 2025, but assistant Zak Kuhr also filled a critical role with Williams sidelined. The inside linebackers coach took over as defensive play-caller and de facto coordinator.\n\nTheir ability to adapt on the fly has allowed the Patriots to not skip a beat defensively. For Williams, it all comes back to the staff chasing a common goal — and to Kuhr being up to the task as well.\n\n“We all believe in the same things. The message has been the same throughout, from the time we got there to the time we met today,” Williams said.\n\n“So, whether it’s Zak, or whether it’s Scott Booker, or whoever it is, we’re all preaching the same message. Sometimes, when you coach in this league, you’ve got coaches who are pulling in different directions. Everybody has a motive. The only motive for us was to improve. Not to win, but to improve. We figured that the improvement would come, but Zak has done an unbelievable job.”\n\nFor Kuhr, moving into an elevated role early in the regular season was not entirely unfamiliar. He had also filled in for Williams during the offseason, when the nominal DC spent three months away from the team due to an unrelated medical condition.\n\nNonetheless, the Patriots defense and its coaches kept chugging along. In the postseason, the group has played its best football to date.\n\nLeading the way is Zak Kuhr, and the Patriots offensive coordinator is happy to see it.\n\n“I’m proud of him,” said Williams. “I’m looking forward to him calling this game on Sunday.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is a “full circle” moment for Leslie Frazier.\n\nIt’s been 40 years since his Chicago Bears won Super Bowl 20 against the New England Patriots. Frazier was a defensive back on the iconic ‘85 Bears.\n\nIn fact, his six interceptions led the team that year, but he suffered a career-ending knee injury in the second quarter of the Super Bowl.\n\nFrazier now eyes his third Super Bowl ring as assistant head coach for the Seattle Seahawks.

    "description": "Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.",
    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.\n\nA minor earthquake hit San Ramon, Calif., on Monday morning, but additional soil shifted hours later south in the Bay Area when Patriots and Seahawks players kicked off Super Bowl week at opening night in San Jose.\n\nPlayers from both teams fielded questions, which flew at them with the unpredictability of bouncing footballs. Fans flocked to the San Jose Convention Center just to catch glimpses of the NFL stars. Hundreds of reporters shouted questions, with content spanning from the mundane to bizarre.\n\nBut one thing was clear: the explicitly expressed identities of Vrabel's Patriots and coach Mike Macdonald's Seahawks. And neither coach is willing to budge ahead of their quest for a Lombardi Trophy.\n\n\"This will be a great identity matchup for us,\" Vrabel said. \"This will be an identity war on the biggest stage. They play hard. Their defense runs to the football. They cause a lot of turnovers.\n\n\"They are committed to running the football. It's a physical football team. ... This will be a huge challenge.\"\n\nVrabel's Patriots share similar characteristics. The Patriots and Seahawks each rank inside the Top 4 in points scored and points allowed. They also ranked inside the Top 8 in yards gained and yards allowed in 2025.\n\nMVP candidate Drake Maye propelled the Patriots, who totaled the fourth-most passing yards in the NFL. The Patriots also ranked 6th in rushing.\n\nVeteran quarterback Sam Darnold and the Seahawks ranked No. 8 in passing yards and No. 10 in rushing.\n\nThe Seahawks defense ranked No. 3 against the run and No. 10 against the pass. The Patriots ranked No. 6 against the run and No. 9 against the pass.\n\nA key difference between the teams this season was the Seahawks' strength in special teams, specifically returns. They ranked third in both kick and punt return average. That element, which aids field position, could be crucial in a game played between two tough defenses.\n\nThe team to establish dominance in their valued areas is likely to win Super Bowl LX.\n\n\"We are going to do everything we can to go out there and play a good football game,\" Darnold said. \"Execute the way we know how to execute.\"\n\nNeither coach would disclose specifics within their game plans, but Macdonald also plans to implement the Seahawks' previously successful strategies.\n\n\"We are going to stick to our process,\" Macdonald said. \"The way we wanna play is we always want to be within our wheelhouse, but every game we are going to tailor things to our opponents.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we have to do the things we are really good at. Right now, that's our plan.\"\n\nVrabel's mere presence could be an advantage for the Patriots. The coach, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker, took plenty of lessons from those runs. He expects that knowledge to pay off this week in the Bay Area, when players will be confronted with potential distractions.\n\n\"I think that all builds up to the end of the week, on things we can focus on that may be a little different with this football game; the warm-up time before the game, the length of halftime,\" Vrabel said. \"All of these things that are going to be a little bit different. We can try to draw on everybody's experiences.\"\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots will practice this week at respective facilities at San Jose State and Stanford, which sit about 22 miles apart.\n\n\"It's just another challenge,\" Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said. \"We are playing the other best team in the NFL. We're excited for it. Just ready to go out there and have one more with the guys on Sunday.\"\n\nThe Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. The least expensive price for a ticket for Super Bowl LX, as of Monday night, was listed for about $5,000 on the secondary market.",

    "description": "The News Tribune asks Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde after NFL commissioner’s press conference about reports the team will be sold soon.",
    "fullText": "The sale of the Seahawks — the issue the team would rather not have the week of their first Super Bowl appearance in more than decade — isn’t going away.\n\n“We put out our statement. So I can’t say anything beyond that,” Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde said Monday, after he and his wife sat in the front row representing the NFC champions at commissioner Roger Goodell’s annual state-of-the-NFL press conference at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe statement Kolde referred to Monday at the San Jose Convention Center was the Paul G. Allen Estate’s assertion Friday “the team is not for sale” — with “is” doing a ton of lifting there. The estate’s statement also reiterated the estate that owns the Seahawks dictates the team must be sold. Most of the proceeds will go to Allen’s many philanthropic interests before his death in 2018. The Paul G. Allen Estate issued that statement through a spokesman Friday. That was soon after ESPN and The Wall Street Journal reported the Seahawks would be sold soon after this season ended with Seattle’s Super Bowl.\n\nMoments before Kolde spoke Monday, Goodell said in his press conference a report this past weekend by The Wall Street Journal that the league fined the Seahawks $5 million for continuing to violate NFL rules by having an estate and not an individual person or group of people own a club is not true.\n\nThis much we know: The Seahawks’ sale is going to happen. It’s not a matter of if, not when.\n\nAnd signs are pointing to the when being in the months following the Super Bowl.\n\nKolde said he, chair Jody Allen, other leaders from Vulcan, LLC, the company Paul Allen formed to manage the Seahawks have studied the recent sales of North American sports franchises. That includes the NBA’s Boston Celtics (for $6 billion), the Los Angeles Lakers (a record $10 billion) and the most recent sale of an NFL team. That was the Washington Commanders, for $6.05 billion in 2023.\n\n“We study all teams, all the sales. That’s something we keep abreast of,” the Seahawks’ vice chair said.\n\nThe Allen Estate put the Portland Trail Blazers up on sale in September. Kolde said Monday he expects that sale to be final this spring. It’s about to go to a group led by the owner of the National Hockey League’s Carolina Hurricanes for a reported $4.25 billion.\n\n“Still tracking to close in a couple months,” Kolde said.\n\nWith the Blazers sale closing, it makes sense (and billions of dollars) that the Seahawks are next.\n\nThe Seahawks are most likely going to set an NFL record for a franchise sale, perhaps in excess of $8 billion.\n\nThe News Tribune asked Kolde off the stage following Goodell’s 45-minute press conference Monday if the Seahawks already have local buyers on the horizon to sell to.\n\n“Nothing to add,” Kolde said to that.\n\nIs there is anything in the estate’s instructions for the sale of the Seahawks that assures the franchise remains in Seattle? A stipulation it must be sold to local owners? A contract from whoever buys the team that binds them to keep the Seahawks in the city?\n\nTo that, Kolde referenced the team’s 30-year lease with Lumen Field runs through 2031. He did not comment on the 20-year option the team has with the stadium and the local government district that runs it beyond 2031.\n\n“l’m not going to get into all of that, all of that detail,” Kolde said.\n\n“But the Allen family put a lot into saving the Seahawks, keeping them in Seattle (by Paul Allen buying the team in 1997 from Ken Behring, who tried to move the team to Southern California). We campaigned around the state (for the new stadium that opened in 2002 and replaced the Kingdome). The voters agreed with us. And we put together Lumen Field.\n\n“And we delivered on everything we promised in that campaign. The team. The stadium. Soccer balls were on our posters. The Sounders launched as the most successful MLS team. The World Cup is coming; we talked about World Cup back in that campaign.\n\n“So we’ve been all about sports in the community for decades. So the lease has six years or so...”\n\nLeague owners want the Seahawks to sell sooner than later, so they can learn the latest relative valuations of their teams in this post-COVID world with the league’s new media rights deals that provides $11 billion in annual revenue to the NFL. The league signed that a couple years ago.\n\nAsked if the NFL was pressuring the team to sell soon, Kolde said: “No comment on that.”\n\nKolde said Jody Allen will be at Super Bowl 60 Sunday against the New England Patriots at Levi’s Stadium in nearby Santa Clara.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny will perform during the halftime show at Super Bowl LX on Sunday afternoon in Santa Clara.",
    "fullText": "NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, despite significant criticism from plenty in Washington, is all for Bad Bunny’s halftime show this week at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGoodell was asked directly about Bad Bunny on Monday when he met with reporters ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium, and said plainly that he believes the Puerto Rican superstar will be able to “unite people” in the way that Super Bowl halftime performers of the past have.\n\n“Listen, Bad Bunny is, and I think that was demonstrated last night [at the Grammys], one of the great artists in the world. That’s one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said.\n\n“But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talent, and to be able to use this moment to do that. I think artists in the past have done that, I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.”\n\nRoger Goodell is asked whether or not there will be any ICE enforcement operations at the Super Bowl and also addresses Bad Bunny's remarks about ICE at last night's Grammy Awards. pic.twitter.com/FxGcbiIbZP\n\n— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny was the top global artist on Spotify for the fourth time in his career last year, and he won two Grammy awards on Sunday night, including Album of the Year, for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.”\n\nQuickly after Bad Bunny was announced as the Super Bowl halftime show, plenty in President Donald Trump’s administration criticized the decision. Trump said he had “never heard of him,” and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson (R-La.) called it a “terrible decision” in October. Johnson, however, then suggested that 83-year-old Lee Greenwood, famous for “God Bless the USA” do the show instead.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would be “all over” the Super Bowl.\n\n“They suck, and we’ll win,” Noem told right-wing podcast host Benny Johnson about her message to the NFL, via ESPN. “They won’t be able to sleep at night because they don’t know what they believe. And they’re so weak, we’ll fix it.”\n\nBad Bunny has been extremely outspoken about Trump and ICE. He mocked Trump in his “NEVAYoL” music video, where he had a Trump-like voice apologizing to immigrants, and he even declined to hold any concerts on his current world tour in the United States because “f***ing ICE could be outside [the concert].” He called out ICE after winning a Grammy award during an acceptance speech on Sunday night, too.\n\n“Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out,” he said. “We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans ... The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that’s more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.”\n\nBad Bunny says \"ICE OUT\" at the #Grammys and receives a massive standing ovation:\n\n\"We are not savage, we are not animals, we are not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans. The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.… pic.twitter.com/IFzvguqdCR\n\n— Variety (@Variety) February 2, 2026\n\nBad Bunny is Puerto Rican, which makes him an American citizen.\n\nThe Bay Area Host Committee told local officials on Monday that there are no planned ICE operations for Super Bowl LX, according to The Athletic. Goodell was asked about that directly on Monday, but he sidestepped the ICE of it all. Security preparations, he said, are moving forward as normal.\n\n“Security is obviously one of the things we focus on the most,” Goodell said. “It’s a tier one level event that involves unique assets at the federal level, the state level and the local level all working together. I see no change in that in the preparations for the Super Bowl … The federal government is a big part of that, including this administration and every other administration before that.”",

    "title": "The Safer Bowl: With tensions running high, Super Bowl advertisers avoid politics and play for laughs",
    "description": "This year's Super Bowl advertising formula is comedy plus celebrity for many brands taking part in the big game's commercial breaks.",
    "fullText": "In a charged political climate where even small missteps can spark a brand backlash, many of this year's Super Bowl advertisers are sticking with the safest bet in the playbook: comedy and celebrities.\n\nMuch like last year's Super Bowl, the vast majority of the big game ads released so far are playing it safe. Advertisers hope that A-list stars will be a shortcut to attention in the crowded field of commercials, and that humor will leave audiences feeling uplifted and warm toward their brand.\n\n\"In general, advertisers want to play it safe,\" said Peter Daboll, head of North America at the creative testing platform DAIVID. \"There's a high anxiety level here in the US, and people are probably very afraid of triggering anything.\"\n\nViewers aren't in the mood to be preached to, he added, and even heartwarming ads that might have performed well in Super Bowls past could come across as too \"syrupy\" and fall flat.\n\nThere's one week to go until the Patriots-Seahawks showdown, but plenty of brands have already released their ads, or teasers, ahead of game day.\n\nOf the 15 Super Bowl LX ad previews the TV measurement platform iSpot tested with a consumer panel so far, 12 triggered \"funny\" reactions from viewers. The highest \"funny\" score went to Instacart, whose vintage-style ad features actor Ben Stiller and singer Benson Boone in a high-energy— and ultimately calamitous — musical performance about choosing the perfect banana.\n\nOther ads hoping to raise a chuckle:\n\nThe cast of celebrities in the commercial breaks will range from Sabrina Carpenter for Pringles to Emma Stone for Squarespace and Guy Fieri for Bosch.\n\nMark Gross, cofounder of the ad agency Highdive, which has produced several Super Bowl campaigns over the years, said the Hollywood landscape had changed and that celebrities are now more open to appearing in commercials than in previous years.\n\n\"It's the job of us at ad agencies and marketers to tell great, original stories that stand out without just hiring the celebrity first and expecting that to do the work for you,\" he added.\n\nHighdive worked on a Super Bowl commercial for Lay's this year.\n\nThe Super Bowl remains one of the last mass-reach media advertising destinations. Last year's Super Bowl averaged a record-high US audience of 127.7 million viewers, per Nielsen, the TV ratings company.\n\nThe average price for 30 seconds of airtime during Super Bowl LX was $8 million, with some spots selling for more than $10 million, according to this year's big game broadcaster, NBCUniversal. Then there are the millions of dollars spent on talent fees, production, and media buys to amplify the ad after the game ends.\n\n\"CMOs are under so much pressure,\" said Kerry Benson, SVP of creative strategy at the data and analytics company Kantar.\n\n\"They have to prove ROI in these ads,\" she said, referring to return on investment.\n\nThe rewards can be handsome if brands play their Super Bowl strategies right.\n\nIn 2024, Kantar found that Super Bowl ads delivered an average return on investment of $8.60 for every $1 spent, making them 20 times more effective than regular TV ads. Benson said this reflects the size of the audience during the game and all the supporting activity and discussion around a Super Bowl campaign.\n\nNot every brand is adopting the comedy-and-celebrity playbook.\n\nToyota's \"Superhero Belt\" ad attempts to tug at the heartstrings, telling the story of a grandfather taking his grandson for a drive and showing their roles reversed decades later. Elsewhere, Hims & Hers' \"Rich People Live Longer\" spot strikes a provocative tone about US healthcare inequality, featuring a couple of characters that resemble Jeff Bezos and the biohacker Bryan Johnson.\n\n\"When you are challenging a system that has been broken for generations, the work cannot feel familiar or safe,\" said Hims & Hers chief design officer, Dan Kenger. \"The creative has to feel disruptive because that's what is needed to change the status quo of healthcare.\"\n\nAnselmo Ramos, creative chairman at the advertising agency GUT, is nostalgic for ads that didn't lean on celebrity as a shortcut to success — Apple's \"1984,\" Budweiser's frogs, the Geico caveman, and the E-Trade baby. He's also hoping to see more bold, anthemic spots in the sea of comedic commercials.\n\n\"I'm missing executions with a brand purpose, with a clear point of view,\" Ramos said. \"We need them more than ever.\"",

Allen estate issued a public response after speculation emerged suggesting the Seattle Seahawks were preparing for a change in ownership.\n\nThe clarification comes as the franchise prepares to compete on the NFL’s biggest stage for the first time in 11 years.\n\nThe Paul G. Allen estate, the ownership group behind the Seattle Seahawks, addressed speculation surrounding the future of the franchise following reports of a potential sale.\n\nA spokesperson for the estate gave a response to NFL insider Ian Rappaport, which said that there is no truth to the rumors of the team being up for sale.\n\n“We don’t comment on rumors or speculation, and the team is not for sale. We’ve already said that will change at some point per Paul’s wishes, but I have no news to share.”\n\nThe statement made clear that no immediate ownership changes are planned, especially ahead of such a monumental weekend.\n\nThe estate also emphasized that its attention is currently centered on football matters, along with the sale of their NBA franchise, the Portland Trail Blazers, rather than ownership discussions.\n\nThe spokesperson added, “Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.”\n\nAs noted, the Seattle Seahawks will face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday, February 9th.\n\nAny talk of a sale ahead of such a monumental game can serve as a distraction for players and the top brass, which is perhaps why the ownership group put out a statement that shut down this talk.\n\nSam Darnold’s former college teammate reveals his secret strength ahead of Super Bowl LX\n\nAqib Talib gives Sam Darnold verdict that Seattle Seahawks fans will hate\n\nPatriots and Seahawks will wear unique patches at Super Bowl LX to celebrate America 250",

It might also be the last one they play for under current ownership.\n\nLongtime Seahawks beat reporter Brady Henderson reported on Friday that the Seahawks, “will go up for sale after Super Bowl LX, league and ownership sources familiar with the arrangement told ESPN, ending years of questions about when the team would seek new ownership following the 2018 death of former owner Paul G. Allen.\n\n“Sale discussions have taken place at ownership and league levels for at least the past week.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Paul G. Allen estate released a statement following Henderson’s report.\n\n“We don’t comment on rumors and speculation, and the team is not for sale. We’ve already said that will change at some point per Paul’s wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.”\n\nThe NBA’s Trail Blazers are in the process of being sold for over $4 billion to a group led by billionaire Tom Dundon, who also owns the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThe Seahawks were officially sold to Paul Allen for $200 million in 1997, effectively rescuing the franchise from relocation to Anaheim, California. Over the span of nearly three decades, the Seahawks have been one of the more successful teams in the NFL in terms of wins, playoff appearances, and Super Bowl appearances.\n\nAs of May 2024, the Seahawks’ agreement to give 10 percent of their sale price to the state of Washington has expired. This was done following a referendum that paved the way for the construction of Lumen Field. It was expected that any Seahawks sale would occur after the expiration of the agreement, but there was no strict timeline to adhere to Paul Allen’s directive to sell off his assets (and donate proceeds to charitable causes).\n\nThe last NFL team to be sold was the Washington Commanders, who were acquired for $6.05 billion in 2023 by a group led by Josh Harris, who also co-owns the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils. ESPN was told by an anonymous team executive that the Seahawks could be worth in the neighborhood of $8 billion.\n\nIt’s not like this is some brand new story—it’s “when” and not “if” the Seahawks are sold—but this is extraordinary timing after the best season in over a decade. Perhaps the time to put the Seahawks on the market is on a high note… and with a second Lombardi Trophy.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are clearly still working through some injuries ahead of their Super Bowl LX matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. On Friday, the team released its early projected game statuses for nine injured players, including quarterback Drake Maye, and they are all questionable to play in the game.\n\nAlong with Maye, who is dealing with a shoulder injury, the other notable names on the list include Harold Landry, Robert Spillane, Hunter Henry, Mack Hollins and Morgan Moses. These are all injuries for fans to keep an eye on in the lead-up to February 8.\n\nWith that said, the Patriots are still more than a week out from the Super Bowl, and there is plenty of time for players to get healthy before returning to the football field.\n\nOne important note is that Maye is also dealing with an illness, according to Patriots coach Mike Vrabel. If not for that illness, Vrabel told media members that the second-year quarterback would have participated in Friday's practice.\n\nHere's the full list of early game status projections for the Patriots:\n\nRB Terrell Jennings - QUESTIONABLE\n\nLB Harold Landry - QUESTIONABLE\n\nOT Thayer Munford Jr. - QUESTIONABLE\n\nDT Joshua Farmer - QUESTIONABLE\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Patriots injury report and early projected Super Bowl LX game statuses",

    "title": "A home theater expert shares 8 upgrades to make for the ultimate Super Bowl watch party",
    "description": "The Super Bowl is the perfect excuse to upgrade your home theater. These extra-large TVs and powerful soundbars are ideal for watching the big game.",
    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is just around the corner, making it the perfect time to upgrade your home theater. But piecing together a new system can be daunting, which is why I'm here to help. I've been reviewing video and audio gear for over a decade, so I know exactly what you need to put together a killer setup for the big game.\n\nFrom extra-large TVs and Dolby Atmos soundbars to spacious media consoles and affordable digital antennas, I've rounded up all the home theater essentials needed for an immersive Super Bowl watch party. Many top Super Bowl TVs and soundbars are also on sale, so you can score solid discounts ahead of kick-off.\n\nAnd though most of my picks are available with speedy Amazon Prime delivery, be sure to check the shipment estimates to ensure they arrive in time for the game on February 8.\n\nThe central piece of any killer Super Bowl setup is a big-screen TV. There are several great displays available, but two models stand out for their overall value and performance when watching sports: the TCL QM7K QLED and the Samsung S95F OLED.\n\nThe QM7K is a fantastic midrange TV with excellent brightness for the money. It's also available in massive screen sizes, including a surprisingly affordable 98-inch model. Meanwhile, the S95F is a premium TV with higher contrast, wider viewing angles, and the most effective anti-glare screen I've seen. Those features make it ideal for watch parties, as all your guests get a high-quality view no matter where they sit.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guide to the best sports TVs. And for more display recommendations, check out our guide to all the best TVs you can buy.\n\nThe TCL QM7K is an excellent midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED backlight delivers high brightness, and it has better contrast control and wider viewing angles than older models.\n\nThe S95F is Samsung's latest flagship 4K TV. It's one of the top high-end displays available, utilizing an advanced QD-OLED panel with a matte anti-glare screen.\n\nGreat picture quality is only one part of an immersive gameday upgrade. Nothing makes it feel like you're actually in the stadium quite like the sound of cheering fans coming from all directions. And that's where a good soundbar comes in.\n\nIf you have the room for a multi-piece system, I recommend the high-end Samsung Q990F. This package includes a soundbar, dedicated rear speakers, and a wireless subwoofer. The Super Bowl is being streamed in Dolby Atmos this year, and the Q990F supports that format. Atmos enables a 3D surround-sound effect with audio spread around and above your ears. If you want a more affordable and compact option, the stand-alone Bose Smart Soundbar is also a good buy. It's not as powerful as the Q990F, but it still supports Dolby Atmos and creates a wide sense of immersion for its space-saving size.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guides to the best soundbars and best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\n\nThe Q990F is Samsung's latest flagship soundbar system. It includes everything you need for a complete 11.1.4-channel Dolby Atmos surround sound experience with powerful audio and plenty of wireless music streaming options.\n\nThe new Bose Smart Soundbar is a refreshed version of the brand's Smart Soundbar 600. It carries over the same design and excellent Dolby Atmos audio performance while adding an AI enhanced dialogue mode and the ability to use Bose Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers.\n\nIf you're buying a new home theater setup for the Super Bowl and need a place to put your TV or other entertainment devices, a reliable media console is a worthwhile investment. Our guide to the best TV stands features several recommendations for different spaces and budgets, including two options that I use myself: The Walker Edison Wren and Ikea Brimnes.\n\nI have the Walker Edison Wren in my living room, and I love its simple style and large, open cubbies, which are perfect for storing components like an AV receiver or game console, while still allowing for good airflow. Meanwhile, I keep the Brimnes in my office and like its sleek design and handy storage drawers. Both stands are also wide enough to accommodate most TV models in sizes up to 85 inches.\n\nThis TV console from Walker Edison is wide enough for TVs as big as 80 inches. It’s available in different wood tones and has six open-storage compartments.\n\nIkea’s Brimnes stand has a wide design that can accommodate larger TVs, and it has three drawers for ample storage space.\n\nFor a cleaner look, you could opt to wall-mount your TV instead of placing it on a stand. Our guide to the best TV wall mounts includes options for every budget. In particular, I recommend the Sanus Vlf728 and Mounting Dream MD2268 for most needs.\n\nThe Sanus is the pricier option, but it offers full motion so you can extend the TV from the wall, tilt, and swivel it. This is super-handy if you need to reposition the screen for watch parties so guests get a better view. It also supports screens up to 90 inches and up to 125 pounds. Meanwhile, the Mounting Dream is a good budget option, but it's more limited. It can only tilt and is rated for TVs up to 75 inches.\n\nThis full-motion mount is pricey but can extend a whopping 28 inches, tilt 15 degrees, and swivel 57 degrees from left to right.\n\nThis affordable TV mount is built for screens up to 75 inches and allows you to tilt the screen down as much as eight degrees.\n\nThe Super Bowl is being broadcast on NBC this year, which means you can tune in with a simple digital TV antenna — no paid subscription required. NBC is offered as a free local channel via over-the-air broadcast towers in most areas. All you need to do is ensure you get a good signal at your location and hook up an antenna to the coaxial port on your TV. You can check channels available in your area through sites like Atennaweb.org.\n\nI recommend the Channel Master Flat Antenna for most needs. It's affordable and features a slim design that sticks right on your wall. If you prefer an option that you can rest on a media console, the Mohu Gateway Plus includes a tabletop base. It also has an amplifier, which could improve reception in locations farther from broadcast towers. You can find more recommendations in our guide to the best indoor TV antennas.\n\nChannel Master's FLATenna 35 Duo is one of the most affordable antennas on the market, and it delivers great reception for local channels.\n\nRather than wall-mounting it, this sleek, amplified antenna is designed to rest on any surface near your TV.\n\nIf you prefer to stream the game, you can watch the Super Bowl via Peacock or any live TV service that includes NBC. Peacock plans start at $8 a month, but you need Premium ($11 a month) or Premium Plus ($17 a month) to stream live sports. In addition to the Super Bowl, Peacock is home to tons of NBCUniversal shows and movies, as well as originals produced exclusively for the service. Meanwhile, for those who want a full cord-cutting alternative to cable, I recommend DirecTV. This live TV streaming service offers NBC across various packages, along with tons of other channels. Plans with NBC start at $40 a month.\n\nYou can learn more about Peacock in our Peacock TV guide, and you can learn more about DirecTV in our guide to the best live TV streaming services.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nAll modern smart TVs have a built-in streaming platform, but the interface that comes with your TV may not be your preferred one. That's where a stand-alone streaming player could come in handy as an upgrade. For instance, if you're eying Samsung's S95F but aren't a fan of the brand's Tizen interface, you can simply buy a Roku, Google streamer, or Fire TV to handle all your Super Bowl streaming needs instead.\n\nMy favorite of the bunch is the Roku Ultra, since it supports every major video and audio format, offers a simple, snappy layout, and comes with a great remote that features backlit keys, hands-free voice search, a location chime, and a rechargeable battery. But if you're plugged into Amazon's ecosystem and want a more compact dongle-style streamer, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a more affordable option that plugs directly into your TV's HDMI port.\n\nYou can learn more about both models in our guide to the best streaming players.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the Roku Ultra has a new processor for speedier performance. It also comes with an updated remote with backlit keys and USB-C charging. Like previous models, this flagship streaming device supports 4K playback with HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision.\n\nThis is Amazon's top streaming stick. With its powerful processor and GPU, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the fastest streaming device in its price range and now supports console-free Xbox gaming via Game Pass.\n\nIf you're building a home theater, there's no such thing as having too many HDMI cables. These cords are what you'll use to connect soundbars, media players, gaming consoles, and other A/V devices to your TV. Luckily, reliable cables are relatively cheap, with most six-foot cords costing about $7 to $10.\n\nI recommend opting for ultra-high-speed HDMI cables, like the Amazon Basics 48Gbps cable. This type of cable has the bandwidth to support HDMI 2.1 features like 4K/120Hz and variable refresh rate (VRR). Though those functions are only needed for gaming devices, ultra-high-speed cables cost about the same as other HDMI options, and it's best to future-proof now in case you ever need the extra speed. I also like these braided HDMI cables from Highwings, since they're built to withstand bends and wear.\n\nYou can find more specialized options in our guide to the best HDMI cables.\n\nThe AmazonBasics HDMI cable is inexpensive, available in different lengths, and supports the vast majority of modern devices.\n\nThis ultra-high-speed HDMI cable has a rugged design with anti-break SR ports and a durable, nylon-braided, tangle-free construction.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX is set for Sunday, February 8, as the Seattle Seahawks take on the New England Patriots at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. This matchup marks a repeat of Super Bowl XLIX, where the Patriots defeated the Seahawks.\n\nJersey sales are always big business for the NFL, but especially so during Super Bowl season. We took a look at which players have driven the most sales this year, according to the NFL Shop's recent post, and cross-referenced Fanatics' top-seller list. As fans gear up for the biggest game of the year, it's no surprise that two of the best-selling jerseys of the season come from the Seahawks and the Patriots.\n\nWith 117 receptions and 1,793 receiving yards in the regular season, Jaxon Smith-Njigba broke the Seahawks' franchise single-season records for both stats. Wearing the jersey number 11, he's quickly emerged as one of the league's standout receivers.\n\nWearing the jersey number 10, Drake Maye led the Patriots to a 14—3 regular-season record and an AFC East title, and in just his second season in the NFL, he's a top contender for Super Bowl MVP.\n\nWhether you're lucky enough to get tickets for Super Bowl LX or you're streaming the big game along with millions of people across the world, the biggest fans will want to shop these popular, soon-to-be iconic jerseys before they sell out.\n\nIn addition to jerseys, you can shop at Fanatics for all other NFL gear and memorabilia ahead of Super Bowl LX.",

    "fullText": "Sunday, February 8, will be a legendary day for sports fans because of Super Bowl LX, and the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games will be happening on the same day. But also for NBC and their streaming platform, Peacock, as they will be presenting both events live all day in 4K HDR. Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "description": "NBC is the broadcast home of Super Bowl LX, the Winter Olympics, and much more in 2026. We'll show you how to watch NBC without cable.",
    "fullText": "NBC has long been a popular channel to have in your TV line-up, but the network's upcoming broadcasts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LX make it all but necessary. Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to live stream the network, even if you don't have cable or an antenna. Keep reading to learn how to watch NBC online.\n\nNBC is the home of beloved sitcoms such as \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\" and flagship procedurals like the \"Law & Order\" and \"Chicago\" universes. In addition to a massive selection of currently airing scripted programming (in addition to series like \"Saturday Night Live\"), the network has become a key player in the news and sports scene. The \"Today\" show and NBC News have long been among the network's main draws, but NBC has increasingly invested in sports over the years, becoming a must-have destination for fans of the NFL, NBA, and the Olympics. NBC is also the broadcast home of flagship events, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl LX, and the 2026 Emmy Awards.\n\nWhether you're hoping to stream NBC live or get caught up with past network programming on-demand, we've got you covered. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about tuning in to the network without cable, including a breakdown of NBCUniversal's direct streaming service, Peacock.\n\n*NBC is only available in select regions on Sling.\n\nNBC's direct streaming counterpart is Peacock, a one-stop shop for all things NBCUniversal. There are three tiers of service, ranging from Peacock Select ($8 a month) to Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month). Select is fairly pared-down and doesn't offer live events, so we recommend Premium or Premium Plus to unlock the full suite of on-demand offerings from the streaming service.\n\nPeacock has a massive collection of-demand seasons of NBC and Bravo shows, among other programming. New episodes typically land on the streaming service the day after their linear broadcast, so if you don't mind waiting a day (and watching with ads), the $11 a month Premium option should do the trick. However, if you'd like to stream NBC live and watch on-demand programming without ads, you'll need Peacock Premium for $17 a month. Both Premium and Premium Plus will carry the Super Bowl and the Olympics.\n\nPeacock Premium Plus subscription is $17 a month. The extra cost gets rid of most ads, allows you to download select titles, and also comes with your local NBC channel.\n\nDirecTV is another solid way to live stream NBC, along with other popular channels. In our guide to the best live TV streaming services, DirecTV ranks as the best cable alternative. NBC is available in several packages, including all signature plans and a couple of cheaper genre packs. Signature plans start at $90 a month for the Entertainment plan, which carries NBC and 90+ other channels (including pretty much anything you'd find in a standard cable plan).\n\nNBC is also available in MyNews and MySports genre packs. MyNews costs $40 a month and comes with 10+ popular news channels, while MySports costs $70 a month and offers around 20 sports networks and access to ESPN Unlimited. All DirecTV plans come with a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nIf you're looking for more of a budget-friendly pick, Sling TV will also allow you to live stream NBC and a handful of other channels. It's a great budget live TV service, but it's important to note that local channel coverage (like NBC) varies from region to region, so you should see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. NBC-friendly plans (where available) include Sling Select and Sling Blue.\n\nSling Select offers around 10 channels and costs $25 a month when local networks are involved. Sling Blue carries 40+ channels and costs $50 a month for those with local channel access. If you're looking for a more comprehensive cable alternative, you can get Sling Orange + Blue for $65 a month.\n\nFor just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.",

    "title": "10 big plays that defined the Seahawks season-long run to the Super Bowl",
    "description": "They were game-turning, result-changing and decisive: the 10 biggest plays of the Seahawks season",
    "fullText": "The Seahawks have run 1,132 plays on offense this season.\n\nThey have defended 1,183 snaps.\n\nThrow in 139 punts, 141 kick-off returns and 84 field-goal attempts, and you’ve got a total of more than 2,500 football plays spread across 19 total games.\n\nOnly an obsessed lunatic or abject moron would choose to sift through all of those in the belief that they could determine which were most important to Seattle reaching its fourth Super Bowl.\n\nWell, I am something of a lunatic and I’m also enough of a moron to believe that I can rank those using three exceedingly specific criteria:\n\nExpected points added (EPA). This is the stat preferred by nerds. It looks at how much a single play changes the likelihood of scoring, taking into account down, distance, field position and time remaining.\n\nWithout further ado, here’s my totally definitive, not-at-all debatable countdown of the 10 plays most responsible for getting Seattle to its fourth Super Bowl:\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba needed just 8 seconds in the second quarter to run past the cornerback and catch Sam Darnold’s pass in stride for a 61-yard touchdown that turned a three-point deficit into a four-point lead.\n\nIt was one of Smith-Njigba’s two touchdown catches of more than 60 yards this season, evidence that he is as dangerous lined up on the outside as he was in the slot last season.\n\nSmith-Njigba led the league with eight catches of 40 or more yards this season. No one else in the NFL had more than five.\n\nDemarcus Lawrence’s fumble return for a touchdown in the first half against the Cardinals was a huge moment as the Seahawks began to hit their stride as a team.\n\nOh wait. That doesn’t really narrow things down.\n\nLawrence scored twice in the first half of this game on strikingly similar plays as a Seahawk pass-rusher hit Cardinals quarterback Jacoby Brissett in mid-delivery, knocking the ball free to Lawrence, who doubled his career touchdown total in a single half.\n\nA fumble gifted Minnesota the ball at the Seattle 13 with 5:09 left in the first half, and the Seahawks leading 3-0. When Jordan Addison was tackled on third down, 1 yard short of what the Vikings needed for the first, they decided to go for it.\n\nDemarcus Lawrence wasn’t fooled on the play action, and as he grabbed hold of Max Brosmer, the Vikings rookie decided he might as well fling it downfield because anything would be better than a sack.\n\nErnest Jones caught the fluttering butterfly of a pass in stride and ran 85 yards for the touchdown.\n\nThe Seahawks led 17-6 entering the fourth quarter and had held the Cardinals to 147 yards of total offense. The Cardinals mounted their two longest drives of the game in the final period, scoring two touchdowns and tying the game with 28 seconds left.\n\nThe Seahawks got the ball at their own 40 thanks to a botched kickoff. They had one timeout left and after an incompletion on first down, Jaxon Smith-Njigba made a sideline catch so acrobatic that the officials needed replay to see that he got both feet down in-bounds for a 22-yard gain.\n\nTwo plays later, Jason Myers kicked a 52-yard field goal to win the game 23-20 on the final play.\n\nThree minutes into the fourth quarter against the Steelers, Jason Myers kicked a 54-yard field goal that put Seattle up 17-14. His ensuing kickoff landed at the Pittsburgh 3, bouncing up and over the head of Caleb Johnson, who assumed the ball was dead once it crossed into the end zone. That’s because Johnson’s a rookie, and that’s the way it works in college.\n\nIn the NFL? That’s a live ball, and George Holani recovered it for a Seattle touchdown.\n\nWhen the Seahawks traded two draft picks to acquire Rashid Shaheed, one of the fastest receivers in the league, the expectation was he’d serve as a downfield receiving threat.\n\nAnd he has, as his 51-yard reception in the NFC Championship Game showed.\n\nBut his biggest impact has come on special teams, and this was the third time he’s ran a kick (or punt) back for a touchdown.\n\nIt was still a one-score game against the 49ers at this point. A botched snap on first down put Seattle at a disadvantage and when Seattle pitched the ball to Walker on a third-down play in which the Seahawks needed 17 yards, it sure looked like the Seahawks were content to punt.\n\nReceiver Jake Bobo stood up a 49ers linebacker with a block and center Jalen Sundell cleared out room for Walker to get the first down and drop 49ers president John Lynch into agony as he watched from a suite.\n\nIt was one of five times this season that the Seahawks handed the ball off on third down, needing 15 yards or more, and wound up gaining the first down. Walker is responsible for three of those, including a touchdown at Pittsburgh back in Week 2.\n\nThe Seahawks had nine defenders at the line of scrimmage as the Rams prepared to snap the ball, and Rams coach Sean McVay was running toward the official as if he was going to call a timeout, but he held off.\n\nMatthew Stafford scanned through his options before coming late to Terrance Ferguson, the rookie tight end, who was boxed out of position by Seattle cornerback Devon Witherspoon. Witherspoon protested to the official that Ferguson should have been flagged for pass interference, which was hilarious, because even if he had been, Seattle would have declined the penalty to take over on downs.\n\nAfter the game, McVay said that one of Seattle’s defenders must have blown his assignment because there were two players covering running back Kyren Williams.\n\n“They kind of lucked into having two guys peel on Kyren right there,” McVay said. “I know that can’t be part of their design. It’s a fortuitous bust by them.”\n\nIt’s possible McVay has a point. Safety Julian Love was preparing to run past Williams when he turned around to follow the running back as defensive end Demarcus Lawrence was also dropping into that area. However, that is the first time I’ve ever heard a coach point to an opponent’s flawed coverage to explain why his super-smart play didn’t work.\n\nStatistically, the most important play of this remarkable game against the Rams was either Smith-Njigba’s 4-yard touchdown catch in overtime or Dallas Saubert’s catch on the two-point conversion to win the game.\n\nIt is my opinion that Rashid Shaheed’s punt return is the single most important regular-season play I have seen in the 20 years that I’ve been paid to write and/or talk about Seahawks football.\n\nBefore that play, Seahawks fans were almost entirely convinced that Seattle needed a new quarterback given the previous possession ending with Darnold’s sixth (!!!) interception in seven quarters against the Rams.\n\nShaheed’s return gave Seattle the jolt it needed, not only to come back.\n\nIf he doesn’t score on that punt return, I don’t believe Seattle wins that game.\n\nIf Seattle doesn’t win that game, the Seahawks don’t win the division.\n\nDanny O’Neil was born in Oregon, the son of a logger, but had the good sense to attend college in Washington. He’s covered Seattle sports for 20 years, writing for two newspapers, one glossy magazine and hosting a daily radio show for eight years on KIRO 710 AM. You can com.",

    "fullText": "Most Super Bowl advertisers stick to a familiar formula: inoffensive humor and A-list celebrities. Hims & Hers is breaking from the playbook.\n\nTitled \"Rich People Live Longer,\" the digital health company's 2026 big game spot takes aim at a divide in access to quality healthcare between wealthy Americans and everyone else.\n\nOne scene features a space-suited cowboy over the TV news-style chyron \"World's richest man in orbit again.\" The scene is reminiscent of tech billionaire Jeff Bezos emerging from a capsule after completing Blue Origin's first passenger spaceflight in 2021.\n\nAnother shows a shirtless, muscular man strapped to an oxygen mask while sprinting on an exercise bike, alongside text reading \"spends millions\" and \"cheats death\" — perhaps a reference to biohacker Bryan Johnson, who has been known to test oxygen therapy as part of his expensive, public quest against aging.\n\nDan Kenger, the chief design officer at Hims & Hers, told Business Insider that the figures in the ad \"aren't specific individuals,\" and instead \"symbols of an intimidating, members-only healthcare culture.\" Kenger said Hims & Hers is aiming for the ad to be a provocative conversation starter about health inequity.\n\n\"We don't shy away from uncomfortable truths, and we fully expect this will ruffle some feathers,\" Kenger said. \"But if our message makes the industry uncomfortable, it's because we're exposing an outdated system that benefits the very few at the expense of everyone else.\"\n\nHims & Hers is no stranger to advertising controversy. Its \"Sick of the System\" Super Bowl ad last year drew backlash from senators and lobbyists for promoting non-FDA-approved compounded weight-loss drugs in a spot that lacked the sort of safety information typically disclosed by pharmaceutical companies. At the time, Hims & Hers said it adhered to advertising regulations and aimed to raise awareness of the obesity health crisis by showcasing the difficulties of accessing affordable weight-loss treatments.\n\nFor this year's campaign, Hims & Hers also plans to partner with podcast hosts and influencers to produce content across Meta, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms. It also has commercials planned throughout the Olympics, which begin next month.\n\nThis year's Super Bowl takes place on Sunday, Feb. 8.",

    "fullText": "After the Pittsburgh Steelers and head coach Mike Tomlin parted ways after 19 seasons, the Steelers have hired new head coach Mike McCarthy.\n\nThe former head coach of the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys has a Super Bowl win on his resume, but that doesn’t mean he was the right hire for the Steelers.\n\nThe Steelers didn’t have a losing season in Tomlin’s 19-year run, but are also in the midst of a streak during which they haven’t won a playoff game in seven consecutive years (which ties the NFL record).\n\nWhile a fresh face may help change the Steelers’ playoff fortunes, McCarthy hasn’t had the best playoff record as of late as his lone Super Bowl win was 15 years ago.\n\nMORE: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nMcCarthy’s .608 regular-season winning percentage (185-113-2) will play well in Pittsburgh as they haven’t had a losing season for an NFL record 22 years, but they need someone to get them over the playoff hump, and the Pittsburgh native’s playoff record is just 11-11 (including 1-3 in his most recent stint with the Cowboys).\n\nMcCarthy is also 62 years old, so there’s very little chance he’ll be around as long as his three predecessors, who had stints averaging 19 years. That doesn’t mean he won’t win in Pittsburgh, but McCarthy likely won’t represent a changing of the guard as he’s already lobbied for quarterback Aaron Rodgers to return next season.\n\nThe Steelers had a chance to reset an aging roster, but the hiring of McCarthy represents a bit of a status quo-type move. They have a few stars on their roster with DK Metcalf and T.J. Watt, but the Steelers missed an opportunity to rebuild their roster into a more modern one. With an AFC that is loaded with star quarterbacks, it’s hard to see how McCarthy will be able to get Pittsburgh over the hump in 2026 (and beyond).\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nVIRAL: Shaun White pulls off epic Central Park snowboarding stunt over Shane Gillis\n\nThe post Mike McCarthy was wrong coaching hire for Pittsburgh Steelers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

No other team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 has ever done that.\n\nWhat’s more, New England had to win three outdoor games in winter conditions, which got progressively worse throughout January. By the second half of the AFC title game against the Denver Broncos, the Patriots were basically playing in a blizzard.\n\nThe elements, tough defenses and pressure seemed to get to Drake Maye a bit, whose performance suffered in the postseason compared to his MVP-caliber regular season.

He’s been part of countless playoff games in tough conditions and is going to his ninth Super Bowl.\n\nFortunately for New England, he was able to help calm Maye down and give him some wise advice.\n\n“I know,” McDaniels said, laughing. “Listen to me. Look at me. It’s gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding six and a half minutes of our lives if we can get it done.”\n\nMaye took those words to heart, buckling down and finishing the job himself.

Drake Maye ranked outside of the top 10 in passing yards after the catch, meaning there is room to improve.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Nate Tice predicted the Patriots would draft University of Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq with the 31st pick of the NFL Draft.\n\n“While Sadiq is a tight end, the Patriots need pass catchers, especially ones who can create explosives with the ball in their hands,” Tice wrote on Tuesday. “Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels loves to use tight ends, and Maye has loved throwing the ball to Hunter Henry in his first two seasons. Sadiq would give them a weapon who can turn those screens and underneath routes into big plays. He has the speed and receiving ability to stretch the defense, and also some real grit as a blocker that Mike Vrabel would love.”\n\nSadiq had 560 yards on 51 receptions last season. He scored eight touchdowns as well. In three seasons at Oregon, he had 892 yards and 11 receiving touchdowns. He averaged 11.2 yards per reception in college.\n\nHe led Oregon in receiving touchdowns and was third on the team in receiving yards per game.

    "description": "He is one of the most winningest coaches in NFL history, but his snub from the Pro Footbal Hall of Fame adds to a growing list of defeats.",
    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots prepare for their 12th Super Bowl appearance, their former head coach Bill Belichick - widely considered to be the greatest professional football coach of all time - finds himself in an unlikely position: defending his legacy.\n\nAlthough Belichick has the most Super Bowl victories in NFL history, he received a phone call on Friday notifying him he would not be inducted into this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick asked with disappointment, according to ESPN which broke the news, referring to his six wins with the Patriots.\n\nThe latest setback adds to a series of misfortunes for Belichick, who ended his nearly 50-year NFL coaching career on a losing streak, and, in a rather unexpected decision, left the pinnacle of American football to coach college students.\n\nJust a few months ago, Belichick made his college football debut to a sell-out crowd of over 50,000 people packed into University of North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nWhen he walked onto the field for the first time, the roar of tens of thousands of screaming fans erupted into the night sky.\n\nThe Tar Heels suffered a stinging defeat to the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs that night, and never quite recovered. By the end of the 12-game season, the team finished with just four wins – its worst record since 2018.\n\nThe paradox between Belichick's legendary NFL career and his spectacularly poor first year in college football is complicating his legacy. After nearly 50 years coaching professional football, why Belichick accepted an offer to step down to the amateur leagues remains a big question. When he will quit is becoming an even bigger one.\n\n\"He's going to have one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career trying to get year two to be better than year one in North Carolina,\" said Dan Roche, an award-winning sports anchor with the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\n\n\"If they struggle again, I think that will basically be the end of the coaching career of Bill Belichick,\" he continued.\n\nFor years, the trend in college football has been that coaches typically leave the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for greater prestige and bigger salaries in the NFL.\n\nBut the college league – which generates over $1.3bn (£940.5m) in revenue – is starting to catch up.\n\n\"North Carolina decided to roll the dice and invest a lot of money in its football program,\" said Greg Barnes, senior reporter at Inside Carolina, a website dedicated to North Carolina University sports.\n\nAnd with that came Belichick, who signed a five-year $50m (£36m) deal to join the Tar Heels.\n\n\"That kind of money is unheard of for North Carolina football,\" Barnes said, notwithstanding that the contract went to 73-year-old Belichick who previously had never coached a single game of college football.\n\nMost sports experts who've followed his career suspect he's not in it for the money.\n\nFor Belichick, they say, it's part love of the game, part love for coaching, and part an affliction that has ailed many great sports figures: an inability to know when to say goodbye.\n\n\"I can't recall many head coaches who have said, 'Okay, I've done it all, and now I'm going to walk away',\" Roche said. \"I just think they don't have it in them.\"\n\nBelichick was born into a football family.\n\nHis father, Steve Belichick, had a long college coaching career, including 30 years at the US Naval Academy and two years at North Carolina.\n\nThe younger Belichick's understanding of football was also nurtured by his mother, Jeannette, with whom he spent many weekends watching games on TV.\n\nBelichick played football and lacrosse at Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1975 with an economics degree. Having never played in the professional league, he began his NFL career that same year as a staff assistant.\n\n\"He doesn't look like a football coach. He's not an overwhelming physical presence. He's not a screamer,\" said ESPN senior writer Seth Wickersham. \"He's kind of a quirky, introverted thinker.\"\n\n\"And he revolutionised professional football,\" Wickersham said.\n\nHowever, he truly forged his legacy during his decades-long career as the New England Patriots head coach.\n\nHe joined the team in 2000. One year later, with the help of quarterback Tom Brady, they won their first Super Bowl. Then five more after that. Altogether, the Brady-and-Belichick-led Patriots appeared in the Super Bowl nine times, the most under any single head coach in NFL history .\n\nMike Reiss, an ESPN staff writer who covers the Patriots, attributed Belichick's success to being \"a master strategist\".\n\n\"When he was at his peak powers, he almost knew the opposition more than the opposition knew themselves,\" Reiss said.\n\nBelichick's critics point to a series of scandals that rocked the Patriots during his tenure, including in 2007 when he was fined $500,000 (£362,000) for ordering his staff to spy on other teams, and in 2016, when Brady was suspended for four games for deflating footballs to his advantage.\n\nIn 2020, Brady left the Patriots, reportedly in part due to Belichick's unwillingness to give Brady, then-aged 43, the longer contract Brady wanted.\n\nBrady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the same year and won his seventh Super Bowl. In Belichick's final two seasons with the Patriots, he led the team to one of its worst records since the 1990s.\n\nBelichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways in January 2024. He was unable to find another NFL team to take him after that.\n\n\"It was a stunning rebuke by the NFL,\" said Wickersham, author of New York Times bestseller It's Better to be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness.\n\n\"For the first time since 1975\", Wickersham said, \"Belichick was out of football\".\n\nIt was during one of the lowest points of Belichick's professional career that he received the call from North Carolina.\n\nOutside of a few sceptics, college football fans were engulfed in enthusiasm.\n\n\"Congrats coach,\" Tom Brady posted on social media. \"The Tar Heel way is about to become a thing 100.\"\n\nWith his name emblazoned on merchandise, home-game tickets for the entire season sold out weeks before it started.\n\nBut Belichick was unable to reverse the bad fortune that appeared to follow him from his final years in the NFL.\n\nAfter their defeat in game one, the Tar Heels would go on to lose most games, including every match against their three in-state rivals, something the team hadn't done since 1989.\n\nAs the season losses piled up, so did the number of empty seats inside North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nFor some, like North Carolina Alumni Association member Deborah Melvin, it was painful to witness even from home.\n\n\"It was just disheartening,\" she said. \"He was supposed to be Mr Super Coach.\"\n\nAdding to fans' frustrations was the incessant press coverage of Belichick's romantic relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old beauty pageant contestant and amateur cheerleader.\n\nWickersham called it \"the most scrutinized relationship ever for an American sports coach\".\n\nHudson made headlines. Lots of headlines. Like when she was rumoured to have been banned from North Carolina's athletic facilities and the university had to put out a statement saying she wasn't. Or the time when she appeared next to Belichick on the sidelines on game day wearing a reptile mini-skirt and knee-high boots. Or the time when she filed a trademark application for the term \"gold digger\".\n\nBelichick couldn't avoid the gossip columns either, making his own headlines amid multiple appearances at Hudson's cheerleading competitions and beauty pageants.\n\nWickersham said he found the Belichick-Hudson saga to be \"surprising\", adding that it contributed to the noise surrounding Belichick who previously \"was a master at limiting distractions\".\n\n\"It's definitely different than the Belichick who was with New England all those years,\" Wickersham said.\n\nThe university declined a request from the BBC to interview Belichick.\n\nThe Tar Heels' bad season has not been blamed on Hudson, though. It was a variety of other factors.\n\nThis was Belichick's first time coaching a college football team, a group composed of a bunch of teenagers with often much steeper learning curves compared to the pros of the NFL.\n\nThe other major challenge was recruiting. Belichick joined the Tar Heels after the deadline for high school athletes to accept their college offers. That meant he missed the chance to persuade some of America's best high school football talent to join his team this year.\n\n\"To get the system in place is more than just turning a light switch on,\" North Carolina football manager Mike Lombardi said after the season.\n\n\"I'm not making any excuses, but when we first got here, we didn't have time to turn the light switch on,\" he said. \"We had to just get into the dark room.\"\n\nLombardi's remarks came during a signing ceremony on 3 December, as the team celebrated the new class of recruits joining the Tar Heels' next season.\n\n\"They will be a foundation of our program,\" Belichick said.\n\nFor now, quitting does not appear to be an option for the all-time great coach.\n\n\"'Why are you still doing this? You could be doing anything,'\" Weiss said he once asked Belichick toward the end of his career with the Patriots. \"And he replied, 'It beats working.'\n\n\"I'll never forget that, because I feel like this is what he feels like he was born to do.\"",

    "fullText": "Mike Macdonald’s Seahawks face their defining defensive test in Super Bowl LX originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are headed to Super Bowl LX after outlasting the Los Angeles Rams 31-27 in the NFC Championship Game, setting up a title matchup with the New England Patriots.\n\nFor head coach Mike Macdonald, the moment carries historical weight. At 38, he has a chance to become the third-youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl, joining Sean McVay in 2021 and Mike Tomlin in 2008, who both lifted the Lombardi Trophy at age 36.\n\nThe game also pits Macdonald against Patriots coach Mike Vrabel, both seeking their first Super Bowl victory as head coaches. Vrabel brings a championship pedigree from his playing days, having earned three rings as a linebacker in New England.\n\nMacdonald, meanwhile, is only in his second season leading Seattle, making the Seahawks’ run all the more striking.\n\nGeneral manager John Schneider is chasing a milestone of his own. A victory would give him a second Super Bowl title with the franchise, this time achieved after reshaping the roster and installing a new coaching staff.\n\nTogether, Schneider and Macdonald have already overseen the most successful regular season in team history, finishing 14-3 and securing the NFC's top seed. That résumé now frames Super Bowl LX as both a reward and a proving ground, particularly for a defense that must rediscover its edge.\n\nSeattle’s path to the Super Bowl was not without warning signs. Against the Rams, the Seahawks defense surrendered 8.3 yards per play, its worst showing of the season, and allowed 26 first downs, tying a 2025 high.\n\nLos Angeles gained more total offense than Seattle had given up to San Francisco across the previous two games combined, testing a unit that had been among the league’s most reliable.\n\nMatthew Stafford capitalized, throwing for 374 yards and three touchdowns without an interception. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum each averaged five yards per carry, further exposing breakdowns up front.\n\nSeattle managed just one sack and three quarterback hits, while the Rams produced three sacks and seven hits of their own, tilting the line-of-scrimmage battle.\n\nThose numbers stood in contrast to a regular season defined by control. Under Macdonald, the Seahawks allowed only 17.2 points per game, limited opponents to a league-low 3.7 yards per rush, and went 26 straight games without giving up a 100-yard rusher.\n\nThat performance earned Macdonald NFC Coach of the Year honors at the 101 Awards and put him in contention for the Associated Press Coach of the Year, to be announced during Super Bowl week.\n\nThe Rams game suggested that philosophy alone may not be enough in February. Seattle typically relies on pressure without heavy blitzing, but adjustments could be necessary against New England. Whether the Seahawks can pair their season-long discipline with timely tactical changes may ultimately decide Super Bowl LX.\n\nHow many Super Bowls have the Rams won?
