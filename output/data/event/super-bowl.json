    "fullText": "Roger Federer was among the celebrities in attendance at Super Bowl LX, where the Seattle Seahawks met the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Seahawks emerged victorious as 29-13 champions, with the iconic match having been played at Levi’s Stadium in California.\n\nTennis icon Federer took in the action in Santa Clara, where a superb defensive display helped the Seahawks get over the line.\n\nHe was one of 70,823 fans in attendance, where the world-famous half-time show was performed by Bad Bunny.\n\nFederer has now taken to social media to describe the experience, where he also made it onto the pitch.\n\nSharing images on his Instagram, the Swiss legend wrote: “Super Bowl LX. Amazing trip back out to the Bay Area.”\n\nJustin Bieber, Adam Sandler, Lewis Hamilton and Travis Kelce among many other high-profile names also attended.\n\nIt’s been a very busy year so far for 44-year-old Federer, who only just returned to Melbourne for the Australian Open.\n\nFederer played in an exhibition match at the start of the Grand Slam, before hanging around to watch some of the action.\n\nHis fellow legend Rafael Nadal was also in attendance in Australia, where Carlos Alcaraz lifted the trophy and completed the career Grand Slam.\n\nHe beat Novak Djokovic in the final, with the Serbian involved in a long-standing debate with Federer and Nadal.\n\nMany tennis fans continue to argue which of the three is the greatest player of all time, with Djokovic the only one still playing.\n\nFederer still loves his tennis, but he retired from the sport in 2022, while Nadal called time on his career in 2024.\n\nNotably, it is Djokovic who leads the way in the men’s all-time Grand Slam titles list on 24, followed by Nadal’s 22 and Federer’s 20.",

    "fullText": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye said he doesn't plan to have any surgical procedures on his throwing shoulder this offseason, after receiving a pain-relieving injection before their Super Bowl loss.\n\n“Just get some time off. Time's the best healer. Definitely just need time off,” Maye said Tuesday. “Nothing that needs anything to be done. Just some time away and time to get some rest and time away from football.”\n\nThe Patriots returned to the team facility to have meetings with the coaching staff and pack up their lockers before heading out for the offseason.\n\nDespite the long playoff run, Maye said he doesn't think he put any extra stress on this arm this season.\n\n“I think it's a case of having one hit in the AFC championship game that was just kind of unfortunate,” Maye said. “Unfortunate timing, the two weeks (before the Super Bowl) was great to have off to have a chance to be out there for my guys. You can't blame things on injuries. Things happen like this all the time in the league. ... You can't (blame) it on one little thing, the shoulder. ... I was feeling like I was able to make throws in the game and was myself.\"\n\nMaye threw two touchdown passes but was sacked six times, had two interceptions and lost a fumble that Seattle turned into another touchdown in New England’s 29-13 loss.\n\nPatriots left tackle Will Campbell revealed Tuesday that a torn ligament in his knee sent him to injured reserve for four games late in the regular season.\n\nCampbell had a disastrous performance in the the Super Bowl, giving up a pair of sacks on Maye as the Seahawks sent several blitzes to his side of the line. According to Next Gen Stats, Campbell allowed 14 pressures, the most allowed by any NFL player in a game this season.\n\n“It obviously wasn’t 100%,” Campbell told reporters. “I mean, I don’t think when you tear a ligament in your knee, it’s not going to be how it was before, but I was healthy enough to go. I’m not going to say that it held me back, but it wasn’t the same as it was before, obviously.\"\n\nCampbell was carted off the field in the second half of the Patriots’ 26-20 win at Cincinnati in Week 12. That ended the 2025 fourth overall draft pick's string of 12 straight starts as Maye’s blindside protector. But he started the season finale and all four playoff games.\n\nHe said he understands the criticism he received for his Super Bowl performance.\n\n“It comes with the job when you don’t perform,” Campbell said. “Obviously, I was picked high, paid a lot, so people expect a certain thing, and I expect more myself,” he said. \"So, whenever I don’t perform ... obviously it sucks, but it doesn’t suck for anyone more than it sucks for me.”\n\nVrabel said he's confident Campbell will grow from this season and doesn't plan to move him to another position.\n\n“He’s 22 years old. He’s our left tackle. He’ll get better. He’ll get stronger,” Vrabel said. “We aren’t moving Will to guard, center, tight end or anywhere else.”\n\nMaye, who has developed a close friendship with Campbell off the field, said he believes his future is bright.\n\n“The expectations of a first-round pick, I think he’s dealt with so much this year,\" Maye said. \"It’s going to be great for him in the future. He’s going to be a great player in this league, he already is a great player in this league. … I love Will. I look forward to playing with him for a long time.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans’ decision to hire Robert Saleh as head coach looks better after Super Bowl LX",
    "fullText": "There was much debate over whether or not the Tennessee Titans should hire an offensive minded or defensive minded head coach. After interviewing nearly 20 candidates, it was announced the Titans were going with Robert Saleh on January 22nd. Roughly two weeks later, defensive coaches took center stage in Super Bowl LX.\n\nBoth the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots feature defensive-minded head coaches in Mike Macdonald and Mike Vrabel. It was Macdonald’s Seahawks who dominated, winning Super Bowl LX 29-13. And with that, the Titans’ decision to hire Saleh indicates they are moving in the right direction.\n\nThe NFL is a copycat league. Macdonald became the first defensive play-caller to win a Super Bowl. Naturally, Saleh has already announced his intention to call defensive plays for the Titans.\n\nThe Titans have an ascending franchise quarterback in Cam Ward. The thought behind hiring an offensive-minded coach was to prioritize his development. The Titans ultimately went with the best leader in Saleh, in an attempt to course-correct the Vrabel-Brian Callahan mistake.\n\nSaleh, like Macdonald and Vrabel, will be tasked with ensuring his team has the right offensive system in place to support the quarterback. Hiring Brian Daboll as OC was a home-run for Ward’s development. All defensive coaches encounter challenges here. Macdonald is about to lose his OC Klint Kubiak, forcing him to hire his third coordinator in as many seasons. Vrabel was fortunate to be saddled with Josh McDaniels.\n\nDefenses dominated Super Bowl LX. Both head coaches were of that variety. Their offensive coordinators are current/former head coaches in Kubiak and McDaniels. Saleh should have a similar set-up with Daboll on his staff.\n\nThe Titans fired Vrabel and also interviewed Macdonald before hiring Callahan. Those are tough truths to swallow. But as Tennessee moves forward under Mike Borgonzi, appointing Saleh should come with promising returns.",

    "fullText": "Every NFL franchise dreams of reaching the Super Bowl, but for some teams the road to football’s biggest stage has been paved with more heartbreak than triumph. The list of most Super Bowl losses highlights organizations that have repeatedly come close to the ultimate prize only to fall short on the grandest stage. While losses can be tough for fans to swallow, they also reflect sustained excellence — getting to the championship game is itself a rare and remarkable achievement that only a handful of teams enjoy. From perennial contenders to decades-long underdogs, these franchises have forged identities around both drama and resilience.\n\nThe Patriots’ six Super Bowl losses are almost paradoxical when paired with their dynasty status. They reached the Super Bowl so often that disappointment became the price of sustained dominance. Several of those losses were razor-thin, last-minute heartbreaks that still sting New England fans. Ultimately, the volume of losses reflects just how frequently the Patriots lived on the NFL’s biggest stage.\n\nDenver’s Super Bowl losses include some of the most lopsided defeats in big-game history, which made them especially painful. For years, those blowouts defined the franchise more than its wins. Still, the Broncos kept returning, refusing to fade from relevance. Their later championships softened the scars, but those early losses remain unforgettable chapters.\n\nThe Bills’ four Super Bowl losses are unique — all came consecutively, an unmatched run of dominance and disappointment. That early-1990s team was powerful enough to rule the AFC but just couldn’t finish the job. Despite the heartbreak, Buffalo’s fanbase takes pride in that era’s consistency and grit. Those losses became part of the franchise’s identity rather than its undoing.\n\nMinnesota’s four Super Bowl defeats came during an era when the Vikings were perennial contenders. The “Purple People Eaters” defense struck fear across the league, yet the Lombardi Trophy always slipped away. That legacy of being close—but not close enough—has followed the franchise for decades. For Vikings fans, Super Bowl loss is both history and heartbreak.\n\nThe 49ers are better known for perfection in Super Bowls than failure, which makes their three losses stand out. Each defeat came during transitional moments between dominant eras. Rather than defining the franchise, those losses highlighted how high the standard was in San Francisco. Even in defeat, the 49ers were almost always contenders.\n\nAll three of Cincinnati’s Super Bowl losses came against the same opponent, giving the defeats an almost cruel symmetry. The Bengals were competitive in each appearance, often falling just short late. Those losses reinforced the narrative of a franchise knocking on the door but unable to break through. Recent success has reignited belief that history doesn’t have to repeat itself.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Super Bowl losses were emotional, hard-fought games that mirrored the city’s blue-collar identity. Each defeat deepened the hunger of one of the NFL’s most passionate fanbases. Those losses made eventual victory feel earned rather than inevitable. They’re reminders of how long the climb was before reaching the summit.\n\nThe Rams’ Super Bowl losses span multiple cities and eras, reflecting a franchise constantly reinventing itself. Some defeats were defensive struggles, others offensive collapses, but all were defining moments. Each loss forced organizational change and evolution. That adaptability eventually helped lead them back to championship success.\n\nMiami’s Super Bowl losses are often overshadowed by their perfect season and early dominance. Still, those defeats show how even elite teams aren’t immune to regression and disappointment. The Dolphins experienced both sides of football immortality within a short span. Their losses serve as a reminder that dynasties are fragile.\n\nDallas’ three Super Bowl losses sit quietly behind a louder legacy of championships. Each defeat came during eras of immense expectation and national spotlight. The losses didn’t diminish the brand, but they did humanize it. For “America’s Team,” even defeat became part of the mythology.\n\nThe Chiefs’ Super Bowl losses represent the bridge between old heartbreak and modern dominance. Before their recent success, Kansas City spent decades chasing relevance on the biggest stage. Those losses made the later championships feel transformational rather than routine. They’re proof that patience can eventually pay off in spectacular fashion.\n\nLooking across the history of the Super Bowl, patterns of near-misses and redemption emerge just as vividly as the glory of victory. The teams with the most losses have all carved out unique narratives — some marked by eras of dominance that ended in narrow defeat, others by periods of heartbreak that galvanized their fanbases. Yet for every loss on this list, there are lessons learned, legacies built, and the promise of future triumphs still to come. In the end, what matters as much as the losses are the stories of perseverance and passion that define these franchises and their supporters.\n\nThe post Teams with most losses in the Super Bowl appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "With Aden Durde having become the first overseas coach to win the Super Bowl, what does it mean for the NFL and the international game?",
    "fullText": "While most of the Seattle Seahawks' staff charged on to the field at the end of Super Bowl 60, Aden Durde took a moment for himself.\n\nHe was congratulated by one colleague but then threw his headset on to a sideline bench at Levi's Stadium, sat down and gazed skywards.\n\nAs fireworks and confetti filled the Santa Clara air, a smile spread across the Briton's face as it dawned on Durde what he had achieved.\n\nThe 46-year-old from north London had just become the first overseas coach to win American football's biggest prize.\n\nIt was a dream fulfilled, one that began with watching a video of the Chicago Bears team that won the Super Bowl in 1986.\n\nSome 40 years on, now he too is a Super Bowl champion and is inspiring others outside the US to follow their NFL dreams.\n\n\"It feels amazing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I'm still trying to process it.\n\n\"To come from London and be here, I don't take any of that for granted. I'm so proud.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nDuring five years as defensive co-ordinator of the London Warriors, Durde was able to earn coaching internships with the Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons, before the latter made him Britain's first full-time NFL coach in 2018.\n\nHe progressed through roles with Atlanta and Dallas before Seattle's new head coach Mike Macdonald made Durde his defensive co-ordinator in 2024.\n\n'AD', as he is known at the Seahawks, has since helped create a defence he describes as \"fast, physical, ball-hungry, and they work as a collective\".\n\n\"AD is an absolute game-changer for us,\" said Macdonald on Monday. \"It's not just an incredible story that got him to this point, it's him as a football mind, a football coach.\n\n\"He's someone that has really brought us together, and the way that our defence plays inspired football is a great tribute to how AD operates, and what he brings to our football team and our organisation. I'm really happy for AD.\n\n\"He's just an absolute beast and he's so much fun to work with. He's right there alongside, building this whole thing. It's been a special journey.\"\n\nThe Seahawks dominated the New England Patriots to win 29-13 on Sunday, but Durde has not just become a Super Bowl champion, he has helped forge a defence that will go down in NFL folklore.\n\nSeattle's defence has been dubbed 'the Dark Side' and produced a performance long-time NFL analyst Cris Collinsworth said was \"as good as I have ever seen\".\n\n\"That's pretty cool,\" said Durde. \"But we have to give credit to the players. They made a commitment, they wanted to be the best in the world, and we got the outcome we wanted.\"\n\nWas this the ultimate Super Bowl redemption story?\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nAs he finished speaking to reporters after Sunday's game, with a British flag around his waist, Durde admitted he felt emotional.\n\n\"I'm trying to hold it back, I just want to get out of here,\" he joked.\n\nNFL analyst Phoebe Schecter used to coach with Durde on the NFL's International Player Pathway programme and shared a moment with him on the field.\n\n\"As someone that's known him for quite some time, [I know] he doesn't like to be emotional, but he couldn't help himself,\" she said.\n\n\"The moment is so big, the achievement is so big, and he knows that he's made history.\"\n\nDurde has spoken about being the best he can be, to make it easier for others to follow his lead, and Schecter is excited about what Durde's story means for the international game.\n\n\"Aden's great because he's not just thinking about himself in the moment,\" Schecter said.\n\n\"For years he's been thinking about other people, building the NFL Academy and the International Player Pathway programme. He's constantly sending that elevator back down.\n\n\"I think he knows how much it means, not just to the UK but to the rest of the international space, [for people] to think 'I could be that person one day, I could coach in the NFL'.\"\n\nWhile working with NFL UK, Durde shared an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora and they founded the IPP programme.\n\n\"I remember Osi telling me about [Durde] back in the day and then followed his journey,\" said NFL executive Peter O'Reilly.\n\n\"How talented he is and how well respected he is by his players, and what a great person he is, that just makes him someone you want to root for.\"\n\nThe IPP helped Britain's Efe Obada and Australia's Jordan Mailata get into the NFL, and former rugby league player Mailata won a Super Bowl last year with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"Whether it's coaching or playing, having those role models, those local heroes, where someone in the UK can look up and say 'OK, there's a path for me', is really important - like last year for a young Australian looking at Jordan Mailata,\" O'Reilly added.\n\n\"The IPP is also a great breeding ground for international coaches. You want that mix of coaches, and we've been in engaged in how we build that pipeline, making sure programmes for coaching development are not just US-based but global.\"\n\nAnd Durde has challenged others to take a shot, saying: \"You just have to set goals and understand there's always people out there that do believe in you. You've just got to push forward and go for what you believe in. That's what life's about.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\nOnce Durde joined Seattle's on-field celebrations at Levi's Stadium, he was joined by his wife Kate and their two sons.\n\nTheir eldest son, Kane Doyle-Durde, now works as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys and their youngest Dylan is working in coaching.\n\n\"We just hugged, we were grateful for the moment,\" said Durde.\n\n\"A lot of people have sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see all the people around me that helped me get here. I'm very grateful for them.\"\n\nThey include many back in the UK, who Durde aims to catch up with now the NFL season is over.\n\n\"I've got to get back to London, get this mayhem out of the way,\" he laughed. \"I need to go home.\"\n\nIn particular, Durde is looking forward to seeing his close friend Marvin Allen, one of a few Britons to own a Super Bowl ring having been on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad when they became NFL champions in 2009.\n\nDurde had two interviews for head-coach positions during the current hiring cycle and - although he is set to remain with Seattle next season - Allen is confident he will become the NFL's first overseas head coach.\n\n\"Aden has come from obscurity to take an American sport by storm,\" he said.\n\n\"One day NFL owners will say 'this guy that's comes from nowhere to win a Super Bowl, let's give that guy a go'.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Gary Kubiak's key advice for son Klint to help win the Super Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSuper Bowl-winning coach Gary Kubiak witnessed his son, Klint, offensive coordinator for the Seahawks, win the Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday like he did 10 years ago.\n\nAfter Seattle’s dominant victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60, Klint confirmed that he is taking the head coach job with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nHe was hired by his dad in Denver a little over a week after Gary led the Broncos to a victory in Super Bowl 50. It was Gary’s advice to his son that helped Seattle navigate the frenzy of the two weeks before the Super Bowl.\n\n“He said, ‘Put the game plan in a week early — don’t wait until you get there,'” Klint told The Denver Post, standing in the locker room Sunday night. “So we took his advice.”\n\n“Because when you get to the Super Bowl — there’s just so much stuff going on that it’s hard to, like, gameplan,” Klint continued. “You still keep game-planning, but there’s so many distractions. So we took his advice, and we dialed in the next week. And then we just kinda refined it when we got here.”\n\nMORE: Seahawks' Tyler Lockett added to Mattingly list after Super Bowl win\n\nThe Seahawks did install their offensive game plan on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the pre-Super Bowl bye week, Klint told The Post. It was the same approach the San Francisco 49ers took when Klint was an assistant and Sam Darnold was a backup there in 2023.\n\n“Super Bowl throughout the week, like — the week leading up to the Super Bowl can be pretty hectic with media,” Darnold told The Post. “So you want to get as much of the game plan in the week before, so you can really focus on it and dive deep on it.”\n\nMORE: Most sacks in a Super Bowl: Where Seahawks' dominance against Drake Maye, Patriots ranks in NFL history\n\nThe Seahawks virtually dominated every aspect of the game. The defense finished as one of the all-time great squads in NFL history, while on offense, Seattle rode Kenneth Walker III to an MVP award. Darnold did enough to control time of possession and pace. He was 19-of-38 for 202 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks also didn’t turn over the ball.\n\n“I would do it 30 times over,” Klint said, on his father’s advice. “We didn’t have a great night on offense — our defense did great. But I think it was helpful for our players to kinda know what to expect going in.”\n\nSeahawks free-agent prediction sees $36 million playoff hero leave Seattle for Texans\n\nSeahawks' Kenneth Walker celebrated Super Bowl win in best way possible\n\nBroncos, Chiefs, Seahawks predicted to battle for $36 million award-winning running back\n\nHow many people watched Super Bowl 2026?

    "fullText": "So another NFL season has come and gone, ending last evening with the Super Bowl, which was won by the Seattle Seahawks. Seattle won the old school way, or the way I would prefer our very own Miami Dolphins to play. A stifling defense based on a solid pass rush and a solid secondary, and an offense with one of the better or best offensive lines and a back or two who can run it down your throat even when the opponent knows that you are going to run it down their throats.\n\nThe NFL is, if nothing else, a copycat league. There is more than one organization that saw the beatdown that the New England Patriots took last night and decided that they needed to do more of that, whichever part of the above they wanted to embrace and emulate. The run game didn’t destroy the Patriots, but it was enough to keep the offense moving, even if it ended in field goals more often than not.\n\nSam Darnold did make some plays, and some of those were very lucky not be picked, but after a while, you could tell that Seattle could feel it on defense and went into more of a play-it-safe mode overall. On the other side of the coin, Drake Maye was pestered all night, making him look more like the second-year player he is than the MVP runner-up that he also is. Maye had two touchdowns to Darnold’s one, but he also took seven sacks and threw two costly interceptions. Darnold threw no interceptions and took only one sack.\n\nAs a side note, the one highlight for the Patriots was Christian Gonzalez, who was the one player that seemed to keep the Pats somewhat in the game for more than a half. So now we have the dumb luck of facing that dude for the next several years twice a year.\n\nSo tonights Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nWhat did you, as a Miami Dolphins fan, see from last evening’s game and victory by the Seahawks that you hope the new front office and coaching staff employ in their own plan to rebuild this team to something that looks respectable? On the other side of things, what did you see Seattle do that you hope the Dolphins do not grasp onto in their own rebuild?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

Kubiak arrived in Las Vegas on Monday fresh off a 29-13 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday.  If Kubiak brings coaches with him from Seattle, he could consider quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko for offensive coordinator and Aden Durde on the defensive side.",
    "fullText": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The Las Vegas Raiders made it official Monday by announcing Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak will be their next head coach.\n\nKubiak arrived in Las Vegas on Monday fresh off a 29-13 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday.\n\nAmong the questions facing Kubiak, who will be formally introduced Tuesday, as he takes over:\n\n— Who he will hire as his coordinators on offense and defense?\n\nIf Kubiak brings coaches with him from Seattle, he could consider quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko for offensive coordinator and Aden Durde on the defensive side. It obviously would be a promotion for Janocko, though Kubiak might call the plays. Durde is the Seahawks' DC, but he would have the opportunity to have full control of the defense, unlike in Seattle where coach Mike Macdonald calls plays on that side of the ball.\n\n— What to do about defensive end Maxx Crosby?\n\nTwo NFL reporters have said that the Raiders' star pass rusher wants out. He wasn't happy about being placed on injured reserve with two games left this past season and might not have the appetite for another rebuild attempt. Crosby said on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that no such talk came from him, but he also didn't deny he wanted out.\n\nThe Raiders could get a haul by trading the 28-year-old Crosby and perhaps even accelerate the rebuild. Dallas got two first-rounders and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark by shipping Micah Parsons to Green Bay.\n\n— How will he prepare for free agency and the draft?\n\nLas Vegas has the No. 1 pick and more than $91 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com, so the Raiders have the opportunity to greatly upgrade their roster. It's almost certain they will use that top pick on Fernando Mendoza, who won the Heisman Trophy and quarterbacked Indiana to the national championship.\n\nBut the Raiders will need to surround Mendoza with a lot more talent than is currently on the roster. Their top priorities likely will be improving the offensive line and finding a No. 1 wide receiver. The defense doesn't have a glaring weakness, but can use help throughout that side of the ball.\n\nKubiak, 38, confirmed during an on-field interview with NFL Network after the Seahawks won the Super Bowl on Sunday that he was heading to Las Vegas. Not that it was a surprise.\n\nKubiak and the Raiders began working toward finalizing an agreement more than a week ago for him to take the job, a person with knowledge of the discussions said at the time. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no contract was in place and no announcement could be made until after the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHe'll be the third coach in three seasons for the Raiders and fifth full-time leader since they moved to Las Vegas in 2020. He succeeds Pete Carroll, who went 3-14 in one season in Las Vegas after a storied run with Seattle that included two Super Bowl appearances and one championship.\n\nThe Raiders have been searching for a path back to their glory days. Three Lombardi Trophies sit in the team’s facility, but the Raiders haven’t won a playoff game since their last Super Bowl appearance in the 2002 season. They have made the postseason just twice since, most recently in the 2021 season.\n\nKubiak oversaw a Seahawks offense that went from being ranked 18th the year before in scoring to third in the NFL this season and from 14th to eighth in yardage.\n\nHis work with quarterback Sam Darnold was particularly notable. Darnold completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions this season. Drafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold had been considered a bust until leading Minnesota to a 14-win season in 2024. But the Vikings moved on from Darnold, and he proved that season was no fluke, winning 14 games in the regular season with Seattle and three \n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "While the Houston Texans sat at home watching as the Seattle Seahawks bested the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, players from H-Town could at least watch former players try to win a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nLast season, the Texans traded a haul to the Buffalo Bills for Pro Bowl wideout Stefon Diggs. He only played in eight games before a torn ACL sent him to the injured reserve, but he seemed to be well respected among those in the locker room.\n\nWhile he impressed during the regular season as Drake Maye's No. 1 weapon, Diggs struggled to make an impact in the passing game during his first Super Bowl appearance, totaling three catches for 37 yards, including a 26-yard reception late in the fourth quarter to set up a Maye touchdown pass.\n\nOutside of Diggs, no other former Texans player offered much in a 29-13 finish. Here's how every former Houston player performed in the big game out west.\n\nOutside of a few starts during the regular season, Jones, who played with the Texans in the 2023, mostly served as a backup role in the playoffs and only saw action in two snaps in his first Super Bowl appearance.\n\nAkers, a surprise addition to the active roster in 2024 and even started for the Texans with Joe Mixon sidelined, was elevated from Seattle's practice squad for the NFC championship game and Super Bowl in place of the injured Zach Charbonnet. He didn’t record a carry but did get to see the field on special teams.\n\nSaubert, who briefly spent time on the Texans' roster in 2023, totaled four catches for Seattle during the regular season and didn’t see much action in the Super Bowl. He did see action on special teams, mostly kickoffs, field goals and PATs, which was key for kicker Jason Myers in the team's victory.\n\nAustin, a member of the Texans' 2023 practice squad, did see some action on both defense and special teams later in the game. He did not record a stat in his limited reps.\n\nGriffin barely spent a season with the Texans as a part-time starter in 2023, but he's bounced around the league since being drafted in 2017 by Seattle out of Central Florida. Signing back with the franchise this offseason, Griffin didn’t earn an elevation from the team's practice squad in the playoffs and watched from the sidelines as his franchise finally hoisted a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nIf this marks the end of his career, at least he can say he earned a ring.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: How did every former Texans player perform in Super Bowl LX?",

    "fullText": "Winning a Super Bowl is the highest mark of success for an NFL head coach. Only a small group of active coaches can say they have done it. Some built long careers around steady success. Others reached the top early in their coaching journey. Each of these coaches shaped their teams in a different way. Their titles show strong leadership, smart planning, and the ability to win on the biggest stage. Here is a look at the active Super Bowl-winning head coaches.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LX)\n\nMike Macdonald is the newest coach to join this list. He led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX win in 2026. Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to earn its second title in franchise history.\n\nHis defensive game plan was the key to the victory. Seattle’s defense controlled the Patriots’ offense from start to finish. Pressure came from all angles and forced mistakes.\n\nThat championship made Macdonald one of the youngest head coaches to win a Super Bowl. The win also proved his defensive style can work at the highest level. Seattle now looks to build around that success for future seasons.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore Ravens)\n\nJohn Harbaugh won his Super Bowl with the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. That victory helped define his long career in Baltimore. He became known as a coach who could win with strong defense and smart special teams play.\n\nHis teams stayed competitive through many roster changes. New players came in and old stars moved on. Success continued because Harbaugh adjusted his approach to fit his personnel.\n\nHowever, following a disappointing 2025 regular season, Harbaugh was fired from Balti\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLIV)\n\nSean Payton earned his Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. His offense stood out for its creativity and balance. Play calling became a major part of his reputation.\n\nLater, he moved to the Denver Broncos to begin a new chapter. Experience gives him an edge in building a culture of discipline and preparation.\n\nOffensive ideas from Payton influenced many coaches around the league. His teams often play with speed and confidence. Denver now relies on that knowledge to return to championship form.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LVI)\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a title in Super Bowl LVI. He became known for modern offensive design and clear communication with his players.\n\nYouth never slowed him down. Playoff runs became common under his leadership. Los Angeles stayed competitive in a tough division because of his planning and play structure.\n\nEach season shows his ability to adapt. Changes at quarterback and defense never stopped his teams from finding ways to win. Many see him as one of the smartest minds in football today.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LIX)\n\nNick Sirianni reached the top with the Eagles during a time when offense ruled the league. His coaching focused on balance and teamwork.\n\nRoster development became one of his strengths. Young players improved quickly under his system. Veterans also fit well into his plans.\n\nPhiladelphia built a strong identity with him in charge. Toughness and energy defined the team’s style. A Bowl win confirmed his place among the league’s top young coaches.\n\nAndy Reid leads this list with three Super Bowl titles. His record shows long-term excellence and steady results. Kansas City became a powerhouse under his leadership.\n\nOffensive creativity sets him apart. Play designs keep defenses guessing every season. Quarterbacks thrive in his system because it allows freedom and structure at the same time.\n\nYears of playoff success place him among the best in NFL history. Consistency defines his career more than any single season. Few active coaches match his résumé.\n\nActive Super Bowl-winning head coaches represent the highest level of achievement in the NFL. Each one reached the top through different paths. Some relied on defense. Others built great offenses. Experience and adaptability connect them all. Their championships show what strong leadership can do for a team. As seasons continue, these coaches will try to add more titles and strengthen their legacy.\n\nThe post Active Super Bowl winning head coaches in the NFL appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "title": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show was a perfect artistic statement — except for Lady Gaga's cameo",
    "description": "Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, singing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile.\"",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny brought the fiesta to the Super Bowl on Sunday, performing reggaeton hits and paying tribute to his Latino heritage — but for a halftime show rich with symbolism and lovingly curated details, one moment felt curiously out of place.\n\nAbout five minutes into Bad Bunny's performance, Lady Gaga materialized out of the blue to sing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile,\" her popular duet with Bruno Mars from her latest album, \"Mayhem.\" It was a strange choice that, while entertaining enough, felt out of step with the rest of the Puerto Rican superstar's performance.\n\nFrom the moment Bad Bunny stepped on the field, he made the celebratory themes of his performance clear. His set was about Puerto Rican pride: There were dancers dressed as jíbaros in pavas (farmers in traditional straw hats), vendors selling coco frio and piraguas (chilled coconut and shaved ice), and, of course, his signature blend of party-starting beats and culturally significant lyrics.\n\nThe second song in his set list, \"Yo Perreo Sola,\" is sung from a woman's perspective to protest sexual harassment in clubs, while \"Eoo\" pays tribute to the caseríos (public housing in Puerto Rico) where reggaeton was born and nurtured. It was as much a celebration of Puerto Rican history and culture as it was a spectacle for NFL fans, if not more.\n\nSo, as a viewer, when Gaga appeared, there was no obvious reason for her to be there. She didn't cover one of Bad Bunny's songs, as her fellow guest Ricky Martin did later in the show with \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.\" She didn't sing her own beloved song \"Born This Way,\" which would have fit the show's broader themes of unity and acceptance, or even \"Alejandro,\" which incorporates Latin pop production. Instead, she opted for her most recent hit, which had no clear thematic connection (her duet partner, Mars, who has Puerto Rican heritage through his father, was not in attendance).\n\nBecause so much of Bad Bunny's show — from his wardrobe to his props and set design — felt deliberate and carefully planned, Gaga's surprise cameo stuck out even more. It felt as if she were simply filling a gap in the production schedule left open for extra star power.\n\nThis isn't to say Gaga didn't nail her vocals (she always does), or that she had anything but good intentions for accepting Bad Bunny's invitation. The two singers have long expressed respect and admiration for each other; in fact, Bad Bunny is a certified Little Monster. He cited Gaga's music as an entry point for appreciating drag culture, and he gushed over her 2020 album \"Chromatica.\" In 2023, Gaga even introduced Bad Bunny as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nIt could very well be that Bad Bunny asked Gaga to join his Super Bowl performance because he wanted her there, and to that, I have no objection. Still, if they were saving room in the show for randomness and whimsy, she could've at least sung \"Abracadabra.\"",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's halftime show was the real star of Super Bowl Sunday. I caught his performance from the stands of Levi's Stadium.",
    "fullText": "\"Look for us on TV!\" I told my parents before my fiancé and I headed to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, for our very first Super Bowl.\n\n\"Oh, we're not going to watch the game,\" they replied. \"But can you text us before Bad Bunny comes on?\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl halftime show might have been even more anticipated than the Big Game. And after a lackluster performance from the New England Patriots against the Seattle Seahawks, it was clear that the real star of Sunday was Bad Bunny.\n\nHere's what it was like to watch his halftime show from the Super Bowl stands.\n\nWe got a sneak peek at Bad Bunny's set as we watched people wheel out carts with tall tufts of grass, a nod to the sugarcane fields of his native Puerto Rico.\n\nI assumed the extras were going to dance, but they were actually added to accommodate rules for protecting the natural grass at Levi's Stadium.\n\nBruce Rodgers, who has produced the Super Bowl halftime show for the past two decades with his company Tribe Inc., told Wired that the NFL limited how many carts could be wheeled out onto the football field. So the team decided to dress up performers to help re-create the lush greenery of Vega Baja, Bad Bunny's hometown.\n\nAndrew Athias, one of the extras, told Business Insider that the grass costume weighed 40 pounds. He flew to California from the East Coast and spent two weeks in rehearsals to be part of the field cast.\n\n\"I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free,\" he said.\n\nDraped across every seat in the stadium was a football necklace with a lanyard decorated with Bad Bunny's name.\n\nOur necklaces automatically lit up during the performance, providing the glow you could see during the halftime show telecast.\n\nLa Casita, a major stage piece from Bad Bunny's \"No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí\" residency, arrived at the end zone for the Super Bowl halftime show — just not the one we were behind!\n\nStill, the excitement was palpable as Bad Bunny kicked off his 15-minute performance with \"Tití Me Preguntó.\" One guy in front of me even started FaceTiming his friend, holding the phone so she could watch the entire show.\n\nBad Bunny walked through the tall grass, passing by various set pieces that paid homage to Puerto Rico — including stands selling Coco Frio and piraguas — at the start of his performance.\n\nFrom the stands above, all we could see were the tops of the grass. However, a jumbotron directly across from our seats showed us what fans at home were seeing on their TV screens.\n\nEveryone around me was confused when the jumbotron in front of us kept cutting away from Bad Bunny to show random images, including some leaves and a cityscape.\n\nPeople quickly realized that the screen behind us was still showing the halftime show, so we wondered if the stock images were due to a technical issue.\n\nWhen I rewatched the show at home, I noticed our jumbotron was often visible on camera. I'm not an expert in production design, but I figure the decision might have been made to make it look less distracting in the telecast.\n\nI found out that stars including Cardi B, Alix Earle, Pedro Pascal, and Jessica Alba made a quick surprise cameo during the halftime show, thanks to excited texts from my friends who were watching from home.\n\nLady Gaga was also a total surprise for the fans in the stands, and I just about lost it when she appeared to sing a salsa version of \"Die With a Smile.\"\n\nAlas, I have no pictures of this moment because I was too busy crying tears of joy.\n\nWatching the couple say \"I do\" from the stands was a quick but special part of the show, especially when it was later revealed via ESPN that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding — only for him to invite them to get married during his Super Bowl performance instead.\n\n\"The only thing more powerful than hate is love,\" the sign read, evoking Bad Bunny's statement during his Grammys acceptance speech the week prior.\n\nThe stadium erupted as Bad Bunny began singing \"DTMF,\" his message emblazoned for all to see — no matter where we were sitting.\n\nAs fireworks lit up California's slowly darkening blue sky, I knew I had just watched something historic.",

    "description": "Super Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at - this is how a thunderous evening in California panned out.",
    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Sam Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl glory could just be the greatest redemption story ever in the NFL. We take a closer look.",
    "fullText": "The Sam Darnold redemption story is quite something - from being rated as one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL to Super Bowl champion.\n\nIt's a tale of never giving up, of character, unwavering self-belief and persistence, but also a warning for teams not to write a quarterback off too soon.\n\nAs youngsters being drafted into the NFL are at the mercy of circumstance, not every team will fit every rookie and the sport's history is littered with college stars deemed not good enough.\n\nThey often bounce around from team to team, as Darnold did, but never has one plumbed the depths before managing to rise up and claim the sport's ultimate prize in the ultimate NFL redemption story.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots to win Super Bowl 60 with crushing defensive display - as it happened\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nSo how bad was Darnold? Well, the numbers were not great, as after being drafted in 2018 he spent three seasons with the New York Jets and two with the Carolina Panthers - during which time he ranked bottom or near the bottom in several areas.\n\nWins were the main one - just 21 of them in five seasons - but categories like passer rating and completion percentage were the worst of any quarterback during that time.\n\nAs a third pick in the draft he was ridiculed for his \"seeing ghosts\" comment as he struggled, and labelled a bust, but now he's getting fitted for a Super Bowl ring it's clear he was only part of the problem.\n\nFellow Jets quarterbacks Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and Zach Wilson also all finished dead last in passer rating in their first three seasons with the team. Notice a theme?\n\nThat's a quirk of the NFL Draft system, the best players go to the worst teams, and while some could just be having an off season so can build for success, some have serious issues.\n\nAfter Sunday, Darnold has now won 39 games since leaving New York, including serving two years as a back-up - the Jets have won just 26.\n\nThe Panthers have won 15 to Darnold's 31 since leaving Carolina and even the Vikings and 49ers can't match his wins since he departed.\n\nPeople forget that at just 21 he was the youngest NFL starting quarterback since the 1970 merger - perhaps the young man was just in the wrong place after all.\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\n\"Quarterbacks need tonnes of help to allow you to go show how great you can be. If you do not get that help, you are limited in how great you can be,\" said former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Steve Young.\n\n\"And there are not 32 places in the league today that can give you that help.\"\n\nYoung knows when a team is not a good fit, as he was drafted by a poor Tampa Bay squad and won three games in two seasons before leaving to join the 49ers and eventually becoming a Hall of Fame member.\n\nIronically enough it was a largely forgotten season in San Francisco that also provided the catalyst for Darnold to launch the comeback of all comebacks.\n\n\"I didn't play great football the first few years of my career,\" Darnold admitted after the Super Bowl. \"Then I come here to San Francisco and I think because of that year I was able to learn a tonne. I was able to kind of learn and go to Minnesota and play good football there. I was able to come to Seattle and do the same.\"\n\nWorking in a fully functioning franchise, learning from coach Kyle Shanahan and serving as back-up to Brock Purdy in a Super Bowl saw Darnold head to Minnesota better equipped to succeed.\n\nThe irony of returning to Levi's Stadium for his crowning glory was not lost on him.\n\nA stellar season in Minnesota came after he replaced injured rookie JJ McCarthy, but then more irony in the Vikings opting to stick with the quarterback they drafted saw Darnold move on again.\n\nHe left after massive career highs of 14 wins, over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, but still with question marks after a play-off capitulation against the Rams.\n\nOnce again, he had a point to prove.\n\nQuarterbacks grab all the headlines, for good or bad, but they simply cannot do it all by themselves in this ultimate team sport.\n\nTom Brady regularly had, and needed, a top-10 defence on his side to win Super Bowls, while Patrick Mahomes lost two of them because he was soundly beaten up by opposing defences.\n\nIn Seattle, Darnold found the perfect storm of a team on the up and a defensive head coach assembling a crack unit that would go on to dominate the NFL, needing just a solid quarterback to steer the offence.\n\nHaving the league's leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Super Bowl MVP running back Kenneth Walker also helped, and plenty will say Darnold did not have to do much.\n\nHe became the first quarterback to enjoy successive 14-win seasons with two different teams - only Brady had managed it with one - but still there were questions as he led the league in turnovers, giving the ball away 20 times.\n\nAround 80% of play-off games are won by teams with the fewest turnovers. In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nDarnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.\n\nThe response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.\n\nHe answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.\n\nWas it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.\n\nNo quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.\n\nLuck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.\n\nNone have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The Puerto Rican artist’s performance was a gleeful rebuke of Trump’s death cult and a celebration of life.\n\nThe past year in Stephen Miller’s America has been unbearably bleak. When masked thugs with “blanket immunity” kidnap 5-year-olds and murder nurses, it tends to darken the national mood. But international mega-star Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) took the stage during the Super Bowl halftime show and gave the best possible response to Miller’s dystopic dreams: a burst of unbridled joy and a dizzying celebration of love, labor, and the power of living our everyday lives despite hardships, all performed in a lyrical language that Miller, in every possible way, lacks the capacity to understand.\n\nPeople should view Bad Bunny’s singular performance as the second part of a political two-step aimed at the white-nativist heart of this racist regime. Part one was a week ago, when, after winning the Grammy for album of the year, Bad Bunny began his acceptance speech by saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say: ICE out!”—to rapturous cheers. It was an ingenious first step, teeing up the halftime show as a future instrument for broadcasting the anti-ICE fervor hitting red and blue states alike.\n\nThen came step two: bringing the technicolor beauty of Puerto Rican culture to the Super Bowl stage. In a time of monsters, Bad Bunny was posing an alternative world: a place where laborers are seen and celebrated, where hurricanes and their victims aren’t forgotten, and where community—not atomization—fuels society. In the swirl of his irrepressible music, sung only in Spanish, and an elaborate set design that conjured the Caribbean in rich and playful detail, Bad Bunny refused to step into our dismal world. Instead, he brought us into his.\n\nI saw the game in a bar, where the people watching around me initially seemed more interested in the halftime show because of the controversy around Bad Bunny’s selection as a performer—the prospect of his Spanish-only music had predictably enraged right-wingers and prompted them to launch a counter halftime show, which spectacularly failed. In 30 seconds, though, many were standing and dancing, everyone locked into every move on the stage. When Ricky Martin came out as a surprise guest, you could feel the room swoon. At the end, everyone rose in an actual ovation.\n\nThe performance was so dense with meaning that, during the fourth quarter, people around me turned to discussing what part of the show they connected with the most—and not only because that was more fun than debating whether the Patriots were going to punt again.\n\nFor me, the most powerful moment was when Bad Bunny name-checked, one after the other, every country in the Americas: a bold, delightfully unsubtle statement against white ethnocentrism and USA puffery. When Bad Bunny said during his Grammy speech, “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans,” the “we are Americans” part had rankled some in immigrant rights circles because it seemed to differentiate the foreign-born. Bad Bunny’s rapid-fire listing—which pointedly did not ignore Cuba or Venezuela—could be seen as a response to that, telling Trump’s cruel regime that “America” is more than just the United States; it’s a region that goes from the top of Canada to the southern tip of Chile. The United States is a part of a community of nations—though it hasn’t been acting like it, instead targeting fishing boats off the coasts of other members of this community and blasting them from the sky like some fascist Death Star.\n\nBad Bunny’s performance will launch a thousand term papers intent on decoding every last moment, including when he gave a Grammy to a young child who had been watching from a staged living room seemingly set in Puerto Rico. Such a scene was particularly resonant knowing that, earlier in January, a 5-year-old boy from Minnesota named Liam Ramos had been abducted from his school by ICE and sent to a Texas detention center. Immediately after the show, people began debating online whether the child on stage was Ramos himself. He wasn’t, but it speaks to how deftly Bad Bunny pulled off his two-step that masses of people thought so.\n\nIn response, of course, Trump had a racist temper tantrum. Perhaps he was offended by a billboard in the background—in English, for his benefit—that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” For this cowardly regime, it’s now a political act just to acknowledge the cultural power of Puerto Rico, to speak a beautiful language, to sing, and to dance, and to live in peace.\n\nDuring this show of shows, it was difficult to not think about a more serious moment at a recent Bad Bunny concert in Chile. There, the artist led the crowd in a song by legendary Chilean folksinger Victor Jara, who was something like the Bob Dylan of Chile, and whose songs of protest were known around the world. Shortly after the 1973 coup, Augusto Pinochet’s thugs mutilated his guitar-playing hands before the dictator had him publicly executed. Perhaps Jara’s most famous song was “El Derecho de Vivir en la Paz.” Bad Bunny had the entire crowd singing this 60-year-old song. For those who don’t know what it means, the title translates to “The Right to Live in Peace.”\n\nOne of Pinochet’s early orders was to paint over the vibrant, revolutionary murals of Chile, covering them in gray. Bad Bunny’s performance was an act of protest against such repression. It was the revenge of the muralistas. And not a moment too soon.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "PHOENIX — As the Seattle Seahawks continue to celebrate their Super Bowl LX win, Phoenix Suns All-Star Devin Booker’s comment from a few weeks prior has begun to resurface — and it’s aged well.\n\nJan 9, 2026; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) against the New York Knicks at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nAhead of the much-anticipated bout between the Seahawks and the New England Patriots, Booker had an exchange with model Kendall Jenner on Instagram that added a new twist to the big game. Jenner released a betting campaign with Fanatics Sportsbook, leaning into a long-running joke about her past relationship history with NBA players — including the Suns star.\n\nWhile promoting it on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jenner picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl.\n\nJan 7, 2026; Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) drives to the basket as Memphis Grizzlies forward Jaylen Wells (0) defends during the first quarter at FedExForum.

Known as a leader for the Suns and a franchise cornerstone, Booker’s ability to bring lightheartedness and sarcasm into the moment showcases his personality off the court.\n\nEven between those who have shared a past, being able to poke fun, look back and share a laugh is something worth noting.\n\nCardinals’ Budda Baker weighs in on Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show",

It's a matter of \"when\" not \"if.\"\n\nAs to the when, it could still happen the season after next.\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, the lingering absence of a specific date for Super Bowl LXII in Atlanta is tied directly to the possibility of the season expanding for the 2027 season. With 17 games, the game would be played most likely on Sunday, February 13. With 18 games, it would slide to Sunday, February 20.\n\nAnd if 18 games comes with a second bye, the NFL likely would have to start the 2027 season on Labor Day weekend. That hasn't happened since 2001.\n\nLast Monday, Commissioner Roger Goodell said it's \"not a given\" that the regular-season will expand. The next day, interim NFL Players Association executive director David White said the players have \"no appetite\" for adding another game.\n\nOnce the NFLPA hires a permanent executive director, the league apparently plans to make a move on moving the season to 18.

    "description": "Philadelphia Eagles news and links for 2/9/26.",
    "fullText": "What’s your biggest Eagles-related takeaway from the Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl LX win over the New England Patriots? Head over to The Feed and weigh in with your answer and explanation!\n\nLet’s get to the Philadelphia Eagles news and links …\n\nEagles QB Jalen Hurts introduced with “Super Bowl Legends” before big game between Patriots-Seahawks – CBS News\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was among the “Super Bowl Legends” introduced before Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. Hurts, Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Steve Young, Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith and Lynn Swann were all honored before kickoff at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. That’s quite the company for Hurts to be alongside. He was the only active player who was honored.\n\nEagles reportedly hire their Jeff Stoutland replacement – BGN\nThe Philadelphia Eagles reluctantly said goodbye to Jeff Stoutland last week after he spent 13 years as the team’s offensive line coach. Now they’re moving on and hiring Chris Kuper to fill the role. Kuper played offensive guard for the Broncos from 2006 to 2013 and most recently spent four years as the Minnesota Vikings’ offensive line coach. He also had a brief stint with the Broncos as an assistant OL coach under Vic Fangio from 2019-2021.\n\nFive Eagles-focused takeaways from the Seahawks’ win over the Patriots in Super Bowl LX – Inquirer\nStoutland’s sudden resignation, after coach Nick Sirianni was prepared to hire tight ends coach Ryan Mahaffey to assume run game duties, was further evidence that change is coming. The Eagles want an offense that has more variables and under-center plays that give quarterback Jalen Hurts more layup throws. Darnold’s lone touchdown pass came from under center when play-action caught Patriots linebacker Jack Gibbens. The quarterback found wide-open tight end AJ Barner for a 16-yard score early in the fourth quarter. How far will Sirianni go in altering the offense? It’s been relatively the same structure since 2021. The Eagles had great success with it, but last season’s regression was stark, and wasn’t all on first-time coordinator Kevin Patullo. How Hurts and the rest of the returning offense adapt is to be determined. But change is coming.\n\nImpressive performances from former Eagles in Super Bowl LX – NBCSP\nCB Josh Jobe: The Eagles signed Jobe as an undrafted free agent out of Alabama in the 2022 season and he was a part of their Super Bowl team that year. In 2022 and 2023, Jobe played in 28 games with the Eagles but has really made Seattle his home. Jobe, 27, was a full-time starter for the Seahawks’ dominating defense this season and he had a big game on Sunday in the Super Bowl. Jobe faced a team-high 10 targets on Sunday and gave up just 3 catches for 11 yards with a pass breakup, per NFL NextGen Stats. That’s the fewest yards allowed by any defender facing 10+ targets in a regular or postseason game since at least 2018. And his Super Bowl performance wasn’t a fluke. Jobe allowed a 46.1% completion percentage this season (regular season and playoffs), which was the fifth-lowest among qualified defenders in the NFL in 2025. On Sunday, the Patriots tried to attack Jobe and it just didn’t work. In addition to his coverage, Jobe also had 7 tackles (2nd most on Seattle behind Ernest Jones IV) and a TFL.\n\nThree free agents who make sense for the Eagles, version 1.0 – PhillyVoice\nRomeo Doubs (25), WR, Packers (6’2, 204). The Packers have a lot of noteworthy pass catchers in their offense, like Jayden Reed, Christian Watson, Tucker Kraft, Matthew Golden, and Dontayvion Wicks, and it was Doubs who led Green Bay in receiving yards in 2025. His career stats. Over his four-year career, Doubs has been a consistent producer in a crowded wide receiving corps, and he is still only 25 years old. He has also been a big-time producer in four career playoff games, making 20 receptions for 371 yards and 2 TDs. As you can see in the highlight reel below, Doubs runs good routes and knows how to create separation. Should A.J. Brown be traded, DeVonta Smith would step into the WR1 role, and Doubs would be a good WR2. If we’re to assume that new Eagles OC Sean Mannion’s scheme will look something like what Green Bay has run, then Doubs is an obvious fit in that role. As an added bonus, Doubs wears a ginormous helmet that Jalen Hurts will be able to see down the field.\n\n‘A brilliant mind:’ Why Sean Mannion’s Super Bowl peers believe the Eagles struck gold with their new offensive coordinator – PHLY\n“Every stop I’ve been, especially with Klint, listening to your feet is the No. 1 commandment of quarterback play,” Janocko said. “That’s something that Sean believes in as well because I know the guys up there in Green Bay preach a similar thing.” Lock added, “Timing footwork up with routes, specific plays, I think would be a big deal to him. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of offense he decides to run because I know he’s been around a couple different ones. I’ll be anxious to see where he’s kind of landing in this whole thing. But he’s going to be great. It’s going to be a fun offense.” Lock said he texted Mannion to congratulate him once the hire was announced, and revealed an important development for what to expect from the young coach in his first meeting with Jalen Hurts and the rest of the Eagles offense. The notes from the iPad have since been moved onto a laptop, one that is now headed to the NovaCare Complex. “He pulled all of his tape that he somehow accumulated over his career,” Lock said. “He’d pull up plays, talk about them that week, why we should run them.”\n\nSpadaro: Here’s what Eagles fans need to know as the 2026 offseason is underway – PhiladelphiaEagles.com\nWelcome to the 2026 NFL season and the understanding that the 32-team league is even-steven at 0-0 and the climb for the year ahead is well underway. Just to get your Midnight (or Kelly) Green blood flowing, here are some things to look forward to as the offseason enters racer mode and the action will be fast, furious, and extremely important. Much of what is happening inside the NovaCare Complex is for internal discussion only, and that’s the way it is around the NFL. The Eagles have coaching staff additions and subtractions, roster reviews, contracts to consider, and a whole lot of work ahead with the goal of, well, you know. So here is what’s up with the Eagles as 2026 rapidly moves forward …\n\nFamily confirms former NFL player and Super Bowl champion died in Orange Mound house fire – Action News 5\nFamily and friends are mourning the loss of former NFL player and Super Bowl champion Barry Wilburn. Family confirms he was the victim of a house fire in Orange Mound early Friday morning. [BLG Note: Sad news. Wilburn played for the Eagles from 1995-1996.]\n\nFormer Cowboys pass rusher DeMarcus Lawrence wins Super Bowl with Seahawks – Blogging The Boys\nYou may recall that Lawrence’s words were met with a lot of pushback from Cowboys fans when he first said them. He did so after initially signing with Seattle back in March. Whatever the case, he sort of called his shot and helped the Seahawks make good on it. He not only reached the NFC Championship Game in his first season away from the Cowboys, but he and his teammates went the whole way and lifted the Lombardi Trophy. Lawrence was able to add a huge achievement to his résumé. Congrats to him.\n\nSuper Bowl LXI Odds: Where do the Washington Commanders stand going into 2026? – Hogs Haven\nThe Commanders have the 19th-best odds to win next year’s Super Bowl. They have the third-best odds in the NFC East, and those odds match how the teams finished this season. Where do you see Washington finishing next season?\n\nNY Giants free agents 2026: Jermaine Eluemunor decision will be telling – Big Blue View\nRe-sign. Provided, of course, the free agent bidding doesn’t take the price to an exorbitant place. I like Marcus Mbow, but in my view he did not show enough in 2025 to remove a quality veteran and hand him a starting job. In terms of the draft, re-signing Eluemunor allows the Giants to focus on another position at No. 5. Even if the Giants did sign Eluemunor and still want to use the fifth overall pick on an offensive lineman, scouts believe Mauigoa, who I personally like more than Fano, might be a better guard. The Giants could start him at guard as a rookie, get his feet wet, then make a decision about whether or not to move him outside.\n\nThe Patriots’ transient luck was always too good to be true – SB Nation\nIf you had to take two things away from the season, notice also the importance of luck and exploiting your specific situation to its maximum output. The Patriots had a hilariously easy schedule, though that is owing mostly to the NFL’s own procedures to give terrible teams a chance at not-being-terrible the following year. But the playoffs also broke absurdly favorably; the Chargers (who weren’t good), the Texans (who were kind of good, but in a snowstorm), and the Broncos (who were good… without their quarterback, also in a snowstorm). The Seahawks were far and away the best team they faced this year; they got worked for 60 minutes, and none of it felt like a fluke.\n\n5 winners and losers from Patriots’ Super Bowl loss to Seahawks – Pats Pulpit\nQB Drake Maye: It was a rough Super Bowl debut for the Patriots young quarterback, as Maye finished 27-of-43 for 295 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions en route to posting -0.44 EPA per dropback. Much of that production came late in the fourth quarter and Maye also lost a fumble on a strip-sack.\n\nSuper Bowl blowout is perfect end to the Seattle Seahawks’ 50th season – Field Gulls\nThis one feels so damn good. The fact that the Seahawks had to go through the gauntlet of the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Rams, and the New England Patriots makes it all the sweeter. Winning in a dominant fashion puts the Super Bowl 49 loss in the grave and opens a new championship window for the Seahawks. For now, I won’t get ahead of myself. The Seattle Seahawks are once again Super Bowl Champions!!\n\nWho could Super Bowl champion Seahawks face to kick off 2026 season? – NFL.com\nHate them or love them, the Cowboys still bring the eyeballs. With Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, likely George Pickens, Quinnen Williams and whatever other defensive moves Dallas makes this offseason, Jerry Jones’ squad would bring the glitz to another Kickoff Game. Dak versus the Seahawks No. 1 defense would be must-see television. The question is whether the NFL puts Dallas in back-to-back Kickoff Games?\n\nBGN Facebook Page: \nBGN Twitter: Follow @BleedingGreen\n\nBGN BlueSky: Follow @bleedgreennation.bsky.social\n\nBGN Instagram: Follow @BleedingGreenInsta\n\nBGN Manager: Follow Brandon Lee Gowton on Twitter | BlueSky | Threads\n\nBGN Radio Twitter: Follow @BGN_Radio",

    "fullText": "A Super Bowl is the pinnacle of football. It is what every kid dreams of winning, but what very few end up accomplishing.\n\nFormer Georgia Bulldogs running back Kenny McIntosh along with former Georgia analyst and assistant coach Mike Macdonald both achieved that rare accomplishment in the Seattle Seahawks' 29-13 win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60.\n\nDespite winning a Super Bowl, this years ends up as a little bittersweet for McIntosh, who missed the entire 2025 season due to a torn ACL. McIntosh will get a Super Bowl ring, but he still has much to prove at the NFL level after having a season-ending injury.\n\nMcIntosh will enter 2026 with an opportunity to earn more playing time provided he makes a full recovery. Seattle lost running back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL in the playoffs and it is unlikely that Charbonnet will be able to return for the start of the regular season. McIntosh would've had a big opportunity to see playoff snaps after Charbonnet's injury if he were healthy, but instead those snaps went to George Holani.\n\nMcIntosh will compete with Holani to be Seattle's second-string running back behind Kenneth Walker next season. McIntosh is entering a contract year in 2026 and is set to make $1.1 million, so he'll have to prove his worth again in order to justify a roster spot for the Seahawks.\n\nThe former Georgia star won national championships in 2021 and 2022 and now is a Super Bowl champion. For those counting at home, that's three titles in five years.\n\nFollow UGA Wire on Instagram or Threads for more college football coverage!\n\nThis article originally appeared on UGA Wire: Why former star Georgia RB had a bittersweet Super Bowl win",

    "description": "The series took advantage of record-breaking Super Bowl viewership to place an ad letting everyone know how exciting and all-American the sport is.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NASCAR season is kicking off this weekend with the Daytona 500, and the series took advantage of record-breaking Super Bowl viewership to place an ad during the big game letting everyone know how exciting and all-American the sport is. This advertisement is a gauntlet slap in the face of Formula One, a return to the sport's roots, and a signal that it's going to lean in to fun and excitement this year rather than the manufactured drama of 2025's disappointing championship run.\n\nLook, if you're going to have my hometown racer Carson Hocevar ripping donuts in his Dale Earnhardt-livery pickup before blasting flamethrowers with the internet's favorite Cletus while \"Free Bird\" plays, I'm going to sit up and pay attention. Nothing is going to get me more excited as a fan than a rebuke of all things fancy and an all-American embrace of all things fun, loud, and brash. \"We don't come from royalty; we come from bootleggers and barn-builders.\" Hell yeah, brother! You can say that again.\n\nThere's a lot going on in this marketing campaign. Here's an abridged list of everything in the ad that caught my attention: Clint Eastwood's son Scott running from Jonny Law in a new Mustang; big smokey burnouts from Ford, Toyota, and Chevrolet sports cars; homages to classic American Cinema favorites \"Top Gun\" and \"Friday;\" and a cameo from NFL superstar Marshawn \"Beast Mode\" Lynch. What more could you ask for? Aboard a new Ford Mustang Dark Horse, Eastwood does a lurid tire-shredding burnout exiting an airplane hangar before running from the cops alongside one of those shine-running bootleggers that built the sport brick by brick.\n\nWell, I suppose we could ask for competitive racing, a points system that makes sense, a tight championship battle, and an exciting broadcast.\n\nPlaying the part of the protagonist of this ad spot, as well as its narrator, is actor Scott Eastwood. You might recognize him from the screen in his role as Little Nobody in the Fast & Furious franchise. He's used as visual shorthand here for action and excitement, fitting with the rest of the ad's theme.\n\n\"America's forefathers didn't throw tea in the harbor so they could sit quietly on rooftops and drink champagne,\" the ad begins. \"They did it so we could be loud. So we could be free.\" With the recent stratospheric growth of Formula One, this is pointed at NASCAR's main competition for racing fans right now.\n\nReturning to the now, Eastwood gives an iconic Tom Cruise–style fist-in-the-air salute before tearing off to inspire some of the best NASCAR drivers to let their inner hooligan come out to play. Bubba Wallace gives Marshawn a wild ride. Kyle Larson rips donuts around his wife while she shotguns a Coca Cola Classic. The aforementioned flamethrowers are lit.\n\nThe ad ends with some terrible computer generated action as the Mustang jumps off a freeway overpass to join the stock car pack on track and rip past the camera. It definitely looks dumb, but somehow the fakeness increases the hype.\n\n\"You want perfect turns and polite applause? You know where to find it. But if you want dust and dented fenders and a place to let loose, we've got a seat waiting for you. Coolers full. No dress code and no velvet ropes. With your people. Heart racing. Strapped in, screaming your damned lungs out.\"\n\nHell yeah! Here's hoping that NASCAR really turns up the heat this year.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "All season long, folks were waiting for the rug to be pulled out from underneath the New England Patriots. In Super Bowl LX, that finally happened, as the Pats were handed a devastating 29-13 defeat by the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe Pats’ struggles throughout the postseason reared their ugly head once again, and against a formidable Seahawks team, that proved to be too much to overcome. As difficult as it may be, we must look back at this game to figure out what went right and what went wrong, so let’s pick out four studs and four duds from New England’s final game of the season.\n\nWhat a way to end the year for Craig Woodson. The rookie safety led the Patriots with 10 tackles, three of which went for a loss. He also deflected a pair of pass attempts, as the defense did everything it could to hang in this game. The selection of Woodson in the 2025 NFL Draft was questionable, but he’s a surefire starter heading into 2026.\n\nAnother member of the secondary who put the clamps on Seattle’s top pass catchers was Christian Gonzalez. The superstar cornerback had four tackles and three pass deflections, and he played a primary role in holding the 2025 Offensive Player of the Year, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, to just four catches for 27 yards.\n\nThe former Philadelphia Eagles stud did all he could to replicate his performance from Super Bowl LIX. Williams had two tackles, both of which went for a loss, and the Pats’ only sack of the game. The $104 million man continually found his way into Seattle’s backfield, and he once again proved to be worth every dollar of his pricy contract.\n\nBesides Rhamondre Stevenson, nobody other than Mack Hollins really had anything going for them in this game. Hollins caught four passes for a game-high 78 yards and a touchdown, and while most of this production came when the game was out of reach, it’s fair to wonder if things would have been different had he been targeted \n\nWill Campbell had a solid rookie year, but there’s no hiding from his play in the postseason (even if he wants to keep ducking the media). Campbell allowed a whopping 14 pressures in this one, which was the highest total among all offensive linemen across the NFL in a single game this year. Simply put, you can’t win a title with this sort of performance.\n\nA desperate fourth quarter made Drake Maye’s numbers look better than they were (27/43, 295 YDS, 2 TD, 2 INT, 5 CAR, 37 YDS, 1fumble lost), but the tale of the tape tells the real story. Maye was jumpy in the pocket as he struggled to diagnose the Seahawks’ coverages, and while he faced a ton of pressure, his trademark accuracy was nowhere to be found.\n\nAdmittedly, the two guys above Josh McDaniels on this list were not 100% healthy for this game. And yet, even when given two weeks to prepare for this game, McDaniels had nothing in his bag of tricks to help either Campbell or Maye out. His conservative and wildly uncreative gameplan was appalling considering the stakes of this game.\n\nYou could put pretty much anyone else on offense here, but we’ll single out Kayshon Boutte, who turned his five targets into just one catch for 21 yards. Boutte has a crucial drop on a third-down play along the way, and given how frequently Maye was looking his way, his inability to help out his struggling quarterback earns him the final spot on this list.\n\nWill Campbell Position Change Discussion Rekindled By Super Bowl Stinker",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touted the supposed strength of America on Super Bowl Sunday—as he watched the game from the comfort of his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n“Enjoy the Super Bowl, America! Our Country is stronger, bigger, and better than ever before and, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” he wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday.\n\nTrump, who has been booed at myriad sporting events—including last year’s Super Bowl—wasn’t at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Instead, he attended a watch party at his private Mar-a-Lago golf club in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe president had previously said he wanted to attend the game but that it was “just too far away.”\n\n“I would go if, you know, it was a little bit shorter,” he added.\n\nBut Zeteo learned that Trump’s officials and advisers were privately concerned about Trump getting booed at the biggest television event of the year. Last year’s event drew an estimated 127.7 million viewers, Nielsen reported, with similar numbers expected this year.\n\nViral clips of the president being loudly booed by tens of thousands of spectators would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told the outlet.\n\nBut even from thousands of miles away, the president still managed to court controversy as the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots, 29-13.\n\nFor months, MAGA had been in full-on meltdown mode over the NFL’s choice of Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, 31, to headline the Super Bowl halftime performance.\n\nBorn Benito Martinez Ocasio, Bad Bunny was Spotify’s most-streamed artist of 2025 and made history at this year’s Grammy Awards when he won album of the year for his Spanish-language Debí Tirar Mas Fotos.\n\nHis halftime performance pulled from the Debí Tirar Mas Fotos world tour and celebrated Latin American culture beneath a billboard that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.”\n\nTrump called the performance a “slap in the face to our country.”\n\n“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” he complained in a Truth Social post. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence.”\n\nBut unlike his speech at the Grammy’s, Bad Bunny’s performance didn’t explicitly denounce the president’s immigration policy.\n\nInstead, he invited the audience to rejoice in the pan-American culture the Trump administration has demonized and even drove home his point about love and unity with an actual wedding.\n\nSome of the president’s own supporters worried about him taking such an aggressive stand against the show, considering the administration is hemorrhaging support among Latinos, Politico reported.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "Around 1,000 private jets descended on the Bay Area ahead of the Super Bowl, but scores of jets were quick to get away once the action finished.\n\nBusiness Insider tracked 95 private jets, using data from ADS-B Exchange, that departed Bay Area airports between 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. PST on Sunday.\n\nThe confetti fell at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara around 7:20 p.m., after the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots.\n\nSan Jose Mineta International, the closest airport, is about a 10-minute drive away. However, many of the private fliers may have been attending parties in the area instead.\n\nThe exodus included Kim Kardashian's Gulfstream G650, which costs $65 million to buy new. The plane is registered to an LLC that shares its address with several companies owned by Kardashian and her family.\n\nKardashian was pictured at Levi's Stadium alongside Lewis Hamilton, the F1 driver whom she is rumored to be dating.\n\nHer plane took off about two hours after the game ended and flew to Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles, according to ADS-B Exchange flight-tracking data.\n\nJay-Z and Beyoncé's Bombardier Global 7500 left just under an hour after the game, and also went to Van Nuys Airport. The jet's registered owner is a holding company that shares its address with Jay-Z's Roc Nation.\n\nIt was the most popular destination, with 15 of the 95 jets flying there. Another 14 flew from the Bay Area to Las Vegas airports.\n\nThree of the 95 airplanes were still airborne at the time of publishing this article.\n\nThat included a Gulfstream G650 owned by Nike, which was flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Another one, with an Argentine tail number, was heading toward South America.\n\nThe vast majority of the other 92 private jets flew to cities within the US, but one went to Vancouver and another to Toluca, in Mexico.\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most popular events for private fliers.\n\nAccording to data from JetSpy, which tracks US-registered airplanes, 914 business jets arrived in the Bay Area between Wednesday and Saturday.\n\nWhile many would not be traveling for the Super Bowl, JetSpy data showed that Friday, the most popular day for arrivals, saw nearly 90% more business jets than usual.",

    "fullText": "That's the question that both Kalshi and Polymarket had to confront on Sunday night, after rapper Cardi B appeared at the Super Bowl halftime show as part of Bad Bunny's set.\n\nCardi B had no singing role, though she could clearly be seen dancing and mouthing words alongside singer Karol G and actors Pedro Pascal and Jessica Alba.\n\nIn layman's terms, it was obviously more of a cameo than a full-on performance.\n\nBut with millions of dollars at stake — Polymarket bettors had wagered more than $4.4 million on whether she would perform — precision matters.\n\nUltimately, it came down to interpreting the rules.\n\npedro pascal, cardi b, karol g & jessica alba make a surprise appearance during bad bunny’s super bowl halftime show \n pic.twitter.com/OYQlkyYjaZ\n\nPolymarket has decided that it did count as a performance, though that decision has been disputed and is set for a final review later this week.\n\nAccording to Polymarket's rules, the betting market would resolve to \"Yes\" simply if Cardi B \"performs live and in person\" during the show.\n\nWith Kalshi, things were less clear.\n\nAccording to the full rules for the betting market, an appearance counts as a performance if the following three conditions are met:\n\nHowever, the rules also lay out criteria for what does not count as an appearance. One of those was: \"Dancing or appearing on stage without singing/playing instruments.\"\n\nDue to the apparent lack of clarity, Kalshi invoked a rule that gives the platform sole discretion to settle contracts when there's an ambiguity not addressed by the rules.\n\nKalshi spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana told Business Insider in an email that the platform chose to settle the market at the last traded price, because Cardi B \"was at the very least mouthing the words when dancing,\" but it's unclear \"if she was singing,\" and it's \"impossible to tell either way.\"\n\nThat means those who bet on Kalshi that Cardi B would perform were paid out 26 cents per share, while those who bet that she wouldn't were paid 74 cents per share.\n\nSome commenters online and in the comments of Kalshi's prediction market appeared to be furious with the move.\n\nThe episode underscores one potential pitfall for prediction markets, particularly as they pitch themselves as reliable sources for knowledge about future events.",

    "fullText": "First, there were collars, then there were microchips. Now, we're using doorbell cameras to track down lost dogs.\n\nRing, Amazon's smart doorbell security system, launched Search Party, an AI system that helps locate lost dogs, last fall. In its first three months, the feature has brought home 99 lost dogs in just 90 days, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\n\"Good example of real-world impact, and proud of what the Ring team has built here,\" Jassy wrote.\n\nRing ran a heartstring-tugging ad about Search Party during the Super Bowl. In it, a family finds their lost dog Milo, thanks to the company's tech.\n\nSome viewers didn't find the ad so heartwarming. Users on X and TikTok posted about how the ad made them feel overly surveilled. Others called it \"dystopian.\"\n\nSome of the online backlash also referenced Ring's recent partnership with Flock Safety. A May story from 404 Media alleged ties between Flock and ICE. Local law enforcement may access Ring videos, but they must submit requests that users can deny or ignore.\n\n\"Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them,\" the company wrote in an earlier statement to Wirecutter.\n\nSearch Party does require sign-offs from individual users to release footage. When a pet owner posts about their lost dog in the Ring app, local cameras begin searching. If your camera spots something that looks like the missing dog, you can approve (or deny) sharing the video.\n\n\"The AI is trained on tens of thousands of dog videos so it can recognize different breeds, sizes, fur patterns, body features, unique marks, shape, and color,\" Jassy wrote. \"And privacy stays in your control—you decide each time whether to help.\"\n\nJassy called it one of the \"compelling use cases of AI.\" Indeed, Amazon's Ring has gone all in on AI — both in its products and in the workplace.\n\nWhen founder Jamie Siminoff returned to lead the department in 2025, he mandated that staff show how they use AI when applying for promotions, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSiminoff later confirmed the change in an interview. \"We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job,\" Siminoff told Business Insider.\n\nHe also said that the RBKS department — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk — asked about AI in hiring interviews. The department is looking to hire AI natives, he said.\n\nSearch Party is just one initiative in Siminoff's push to refocus Ring on security. One of his first moves was to replace Ring's socially driven mission (\"Keep people close to what's important\") with one emphasizing safety.\n\nRing's new mission: \"Make neighborhoods safer.\"\n\nAs for those dogs, Jassy shouted out some pups that had made their way home. One military veteran lost his service dog, Lainey. Ring found her later that day.\n\nNyx dug a hole under the fence. Ring found him within 15 minutes.",

    "description": "A since-deleted Reddit post claimed OpenAI commissioned a second Super Bowl ad that it decided not to air. OpenAI said the video is fake.",
    "fullText": "On first glance, a recent Reddit post looks like the sort of PR nightmare that would give any tech company cold sweats: a disgruntled employee leaks a shelved Super Bowl ad revealing some highly anticipated products and a big-name celeb.\n\nBut it's all a hoax, according to OpenAI.\n\nGreg Brockman, the AI company's cofounder and president, moved to quickly denounce a now-deleted viral Reddit post that claimed to have footage of a shelved Super Bowl ad featuring actor Alexander Skarsgård with fancy earbuds and a reflective metallic orb device called \"Dime.\"\n\n\"fake news,\" Brockman wrote on X on Sunday night.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson confirmed in a statement to Business Insider that the ad was not real.\n\n\"Totally false! Not OpenAI, not connected to us at all. Fake news,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAlexander Skarsgård stars in a mysterious #SuperBowl commercial for a product called 'dime' pic.twitter.com/xlgtsjPqIB\n\nThe Reddit post claimed that OpenAI opted to air its real Super Bowl ad featuring Codex instead of the device ad.\n\nOpenAI is working on AI devices, but it hasn't revealed much when it comes to details. But it did recruit a huge name to lead its efforts.\n\nLast year, CEO Sam Altman and former Apple design chief Jony Ive jointly announced that they had been collaborating for years. OpenAI also purchased Ive's AI hardware startup for roughly $6.5 billion.\n\nIn November, Ive said a device will be available in less than two years. Altman said during the same joint appearance that he wants the device's simplicity to cause people to say, \"That's it.\"\n\n\"Like it is so simple, but then it just does, as we were talking about, AI can do just so much for you that so much can fall away,\" Altman said during a panel with Ive moderated by Laurene Powell Jobs. \"And the degree to which Jony has chipped away at every little thing that this doesn't need to do or doesn't need to be in there is remarkable.\"\n\nMany users were duped by the supposedly \"leaked\" ad, including Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who seemed to suggest the social media platform had once again gotten the scoop on major news.\n\n\"Oh, Reddit. You've done it again,\" Ohanian wrote on X. \"The ad is beautiful btw, they should've run this one.\"\n\n\"This is totally fake,\" OpenAI's Lindsay McCallum Rémy, who works in its communications department, responded.\n\nAI was front and center during what is historically the most-watched live televised event in the US, and thus the biggest day for advertising. In the days leading up to the big game, Altman criticized rival Anthropic for airing what he said was a \"deceptive\" ad that subtly poked fun at OpenAI's plans to add ads to lower tiers of ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI did air a Super Bowl ad. In its second-ever spot during the big game, the company touted Codex, its coding-focused agent, which has a new model and an accompanying Mac OS app.\n\nThe ad begins with a child's finger tracing a cobweb and intersperses images of a classroom, robot hands, someone loading a Linux disc into an old computer, and even the famous photo of Albert Einstein sticking his tongue, before culminating in the message: \"You can just build things.\"",

    "description": "Early social listening data suggests Super Bowl viewers were more buzzed about Anthropic's ad than OpenAI's.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a stink about how Anthropic's Super Bowl ad that took aim at his company was \"dishonest\" — but viewers seemed to love it.\n\nSeparate data from two social media listening companies, Meltwater and Sprout Social, suggest Super Bowl viewers were more buzzed about Anthropic's spot than OpenAI's.\n\nAnthropic's 30-second spot roasted OpenAI over its decision to bring ads to ChatGPT. The ad didn't mention its competitor by name, but featured a scrawny man asking a buffed trainer, \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" The trainer initially gives helpful information in the voice of an AI chatbot, but then quickly segues into an ad.\n\nAnthropic's Super Bowl spot signed off with the tagline: \"There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them.\" (A previous version of the ad that the company teased pre-game appeared to be a more direct swipe at OpenAI: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\")\n\nAfter Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ad teasers last week, Altman responded with a lengthy post on X.\n\n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed,\" Altman wrote. \"But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.\" He added more fuel to the fire in an interview with the tech news show TBPN, reiterating his views on Anthropic's campaign.\n\nOpenAI's Super Bowl ad was a more earnest play, which encouraged viewers to use its coding agent to build their dream projects.\n\nData from Meltwater found that OpenAI's ad drew more engagement across social media between February 8 and 9 (25,649 for OpenAI vs. 9,985 for Anthropic). The measure of engagement includes likes, reposts, replies, and comments. However, Anthropic won the battle for positive sentiment. Per Meltwater, 25.5% of the posts about its Super Bowl ad were positive, compared to 16.3% for OpenAI.\n\nPeople discussing Anthropic's ads were largely talking about how funny the ads were, whereas much of the discussion about OpenAI was critical about its plans to bring ads to ChatGPT, Anna Amarotti, Meltwater's global consumer and market insights lead, told Business Insider.\n\nMeltwater's data found that Altman was referenced in about 5.0% of the Anthropic ad mentions and 4.7% of the OpenAI mentions. Anthropic Dario Amodei was present in 0.4% of Anthropic's mentions, and none of OpenAI's ad mentions over the period Meltwater looked at.\n\nThe OpenAI ad itself faced scrutiny, with Meltwater data showing the top viral post pointed out an apparent production error: a Windows laptop displaying the macOS ChatGPT app.\n\nThe new @OpenAI ad from the Super Bowl shows a macOS app running on a Windows laptop pic.twitter.com/vELUHxCwwf\n\nOverall, both brands saw stronger visibility in the lead-up to the Super Bowl than during the live moment, suggesting their impact was driven more by pre-event discussions, Meltwater's Amarotti said.\n\nData from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company that uses a different methodology, showed that Anthropic's ad had driven 7,847 mentions on social media as of early Monday morning, compared with OpenAI's 7,040. Sprout's analysis covered January 27 to February 9.\n\nThe YouTube video of Anthropic's \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" has drawn more than 402,000 views since it was posted on February 4. ChatGPT's \"You Can Just Build Things\" ad, which was posted to YouTube less than 24 hours ago, has notched up over 81,000 views.\n\nTV measurement platform iSpot found that almost a quarter (23%) of Super Bowl ads mentioned AI, or, in one case — the Swedish vodka brand Svedka — was created using AI.\n\nGoogle had a sentimental commercial about a mother and child designing a new home using its Gemini app. Meta enlisted a Rolodex of athletes and the influencer iShowSpeed to showcase its Oakley Meta Performance AI glasses. The Amazon Alexa spot, starring Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, poked fun at dystopian fears about AI turning evil.\n\nElsewhere, AI.com — a new AI platform launched by the founder of Crypto.com — invited viewers to visit its website to create a handle and create their own agents. The rush of traffic initially caused the website to crash. EDO, a TV measurement company, said AI.com's ad was the most engaging ad of the entire Super Bowl, driving 9.1 times the median engagement this year. EDO scores ads based on whether they drove consumers to take an action online, such as searching for that brand on Google.\n\nAdvertisers on average paid $8 million for 30 seconds of airtime during this year's Super Bowl, with some 30-second slots reaching as much as $10 million. Many Super Bowl LX advertisers leaned heavily on comedy and A-list celebrities as brands sought to play it safe in a charged political environment.",

    "description": "The new Cadillac F1 team launches a split livery in an advert costing a reputed £7.3m broadcast during the Super Bowl - and are being sued over it by Hollywood director Michael Bay.",
    "fullText": "The new Cadillac team have launched a unique split livery in an advert costing a reputed £7.3m that was broadcast during the Super Bowl.\n\nCadillac Formula 1 chief executive officer Dan Towriss said the launch, which also included a model of the team's car being unveiled in New York's Times Square, was a \"tremendous event for us\" and a \"momentous day\".\n\nThe livery is white on black on one side of the car and black on white on the other, a design decision that has raised eyebrows among other teams because F1 rules dictate car colour schemes should look \"substantially similar on both sides\".\n\nA spokesperson said team principal Graeme Lowdon and team manager Pete Crolla had sought clarification from governing body the FIA and had \"indicated this design was within the rules as long as the design and branding was similar from both sides, which we are comfortable and confident it is\".\n\nThe British American Racing (BAR) team fell foul of this area of the rulebook in their debut season in 1999, when they tried to run their cars in two different cigarette liveries.\n\nAfter an intervention by then FIA president Max Mosley, a compromise was reached whereby the cars ran in identical split liveries. The current rules language dates from that dispute.\n\nNorris confidence 'even higher' as he eyes title defence\n\nCadillac's entry is the first time US car giant General Motors, their parent company, has competed in F1.\n\nTowriss said Cadillac were trying to make a statement as they took their first steps in F1.\n\n\"You can say we're competing against the other teams, but really Formula 1 is competing against other sports,\" he said.\n\n\"You're competing against the Super Bowl. You're competing against what's going on in stick and ball sports, Premier League soccer, all the things that are happening at the Olympics. There's the Fifa World Cup this year. So there's a lot going on.\n\n\"And so I think as teams we need to continue to find innovative ways to draw that interest, do storytelling and reach out to fans.\"\n\nBoth Towriss and Lowdon have emphasised that Cadillac face an uphill struggle in F1 this year.\n\nTowriss said: \"We're a brand new team. So we're going to have have triumphant days and we're going to have some carnage along the way as well. There's just a lot to learn in this first year.\"\n\nHe said the team have not set themselves a specific performance target for the season.\n\n\"For me, points would be kind of an arbitrary target,\" said Towriss. \"I think I want to look at beating teams, beating cars on track, and how many cars can we pass in year one in moving up the grid.\n\n\"And so I think that's really how we're thinking about it. And then, secondly, it's going to be the rate of development on this car as well. We obviously have a long-term outlook for the team.\"\n\nCadillac meanwhile have confirmed the accuracy of a Rolling Stone report, external that they are being sued by Hollywood film director Michael Bay, who claims the team stole his ideas for the advert having approached him for input and then ended contact with him.\n\nTowriss said Bay's actions were \"disappointing\", adding \"all of the creative [work] was done well in advance of ever speaking with him\", and he was \"confident it'll be resolved amicably\".\n\nBay directed films The Rock, Pearl Harbor and Armageddon.\n\nA Cadillac F1 spokesperson said: \"Michael Bay is a cinematic genius and we talked with him about directing our Super Bowl ad. But after two meetings it became clear he couldn't meet our timeline, and there ultimately wasn't a path forward.\n\n\"It's unclear why he's bringing this claim, since the concept and creative were already developed and we were only exploring him as a director.\n\n\"It's also unusual to raise this now, given the ad hasn't even been released. We're confident this will be resolved appropriately. Even so, we still admire Michael Bay's creative brilliance and would welcome the opportunity to work together in the future.\"",

    "fullText": "Seven-weight world champion Amanda Serrano has said Jake Paul was wrong to call Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny a \"fake American\" following his performance during the Super Bowl half-time show.\n\nPuerto Rican Serrano was the first boxer to be signed by Paul's Most Valuable Promotions in 2021 and was handed a \"lifetime\" contract by the company in 2025.\n\nBad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, performed a 14-minute set at Levi's Stadium in California as the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots.\n\nPaul said in a post on X that he turned off the half-time show because he could not support Bad Bunny and suggested that the six-time Grammy Award winner \"publicly hates America\".\n\nWBA and WBO featherweight champion Serrano responded with her own lengthy statement, saying she was \"celebrating with awe\" at how Bad Bunny represented her culture before addressing Paul directly.\n\n\"I am proud to be Puerto Rican, and I am proud to be an American citizen,\" Serrano wrote.\n\n\"Puerto Ricans are not \"fake Americans\". We are citizens who have contributed to this country in every field, from military service to sports, business, science, and the arts, and our identity and citizenship deserve respect.\n\n\"I would not have the opportunities I have without the support and belief that Most Valuable Promotions and Jake Paul showed in me, and I will always be grateful for the role they have played in helping change my life and in elevating women's boxing.\n\n\"At the same time, I want to be clear: I do not agree with statements that question the legitimacy or identity of Puerto Rican people, and I cannot support that characterisation. It is wrong.\"\n\nPuerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans cannot vote in the election to decide the president but they do have American citizenship.\n\nPaul later said his use of the word fake had been \"misinterpreted\".\n\n\"He's not a fake citizen obviously bc [because] he's Puerto Rican and I love Puerto Rico and all Americans who support the country,\" Paul posted on X.\n\n\"Moreso Bunny is fake bc of his values and criticism of our great country.\"\n\nPaul made his professional boxing debut in 2020 and has won 12 of his 14 fights but lost his most high-profile bout to Anthony Joshua in December.\n\nHis brother Logan said he did not agree with his sibling's comments and that \"Puerto Ricans are Americans\".\n\nClaressa Shields, a five-weight world champion, urged Paul to \"do better\".\n\n\"Puerto Ricans are not fake citizens,\" Shields posted on X.\n\n\"You would think that you of all people would support this as you have so many Puerto Rican women under your umbrella.\n\n\"What's happening with ICE is terrible and we shouldn't want to see harm done to anyone who is a part of America & a minority! Do better Jake. This isn't right.\"\n\nAccording to streaming service Spotify, Bad Bunny was the world's most-played artist in 2025 and made history by becoming the first musician to perform a Super Bowl half-time show entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old made two statements in English, one with a billboard message reading \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" and the other \"Together, We Are America\" written on a football that he held.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also criticised the half-time show on his Truth social media platform, saying it was an \"affront to the greatness of America\".\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

That’s up to God, and we’re just gonna we’re gonna enjoy tonight. You guys know I’m going to Las Vegas. I’m fired up about it. But tonight, for one more night,” the Seahawks OC said.\n\nThe comments immediately drew attention because they acknowledged what had already been widely expected. Kubiak is set to become the new head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, bringing his Super Bowl-winning credibility with him.\n\nRather than deflecting the question, Kubiak leaned into the reality of the situation. He made it clear that while his focus remained on celebrating with the Seahawks, his next chapter was already in motion.\n\nThe conversation turned more direct as Kubiak was pressed further on his future, with the coach offering unmistakable confirmation of his next step.\n\n“Hell yeah, I’m going, of course. I’m going. Yeah, just confirmed it right here,” Kubiak added.\n\nThe remarks removed any remaining doubt about his departure from Seattle. After helping guide the Seahawks to a Super Bowl title, Kubiak is now preparing to take over a Raiders franchise looking for stability and identity.\n\nThe Raiders are handing him the keys at a time when the team is searching for long-term direction, while Kubiak arrives with momentum built from championship success.\n\nFor Seattle, the timing is bittersweet. The Seahawks secured Super Bowl glory, but the victory also marked the end of Kubiak’s tenure with the organization.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence’s immediate ‘not in labor’ question after winning Super Bowl LX is going viral\n\nKenneth Walker III wins Super Bowl MVP despite Jason Myers setting record\n\nDrake Curse strikes New England Patriots as rapper loses $1 million in Super Bowl bet",

    "description": "Andrew Athias said his job at the halftime show was really easy: \"Don't move. Stand here and be one with the grass.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Athias, 33, a Philadelphia-based digital marketer and content creator. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was one of the 500 bunches of dancing grass at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show. I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free.\n\nI'm a big Bad Bunny fan. I've been to three of his concerts since my girlfriend introduced me to him in 2021.\n\nI found the grass gig through a company called Backlit, which handles finding extras for the halftime show. I found it last year when I saw Kendrick Lamar at the Super Bowl halftime show, but I forgot about it until Bad Bunny was announced as Super Bowl's headliner in October, and I decided to apply.\n\nI was one of the few crazy people to fly over from the East Coast to be part of the field cast. I flew out to San Francisco from Philadelphia in the middle of a snowstorm and have been out here for two weeks, rehearsing for the big day, and it has been worth it.\n\nThe requirements for the role were pretty basic. You had to be no taller than six feet, no shorter than five feet seven inches, and of an athletic build.\n\nThe listing said we had to be able to wear a 40-plus-pound costume and to be comfortable dancing in proximity with other performers for long periods. Other than that, we had to measure every part of our body from head to toe, elbow to floor, shoulder to clavicle, etc. Those were the only requirements.\n\nThey didn't tell us we'd be wearing a grass costume and kept it super vague.\n\nMy part was actually really easy. They just told me where to stand, and they said, \"Don't move. Stand here and be one with the grass.\"\n\nThe suits were heavy and uncomfortable. Every now and again, you'll have a blade of plastic grass going places where grass should not go. Fortunately, we were given some protective goggles.\n\nThere were definitely times when we were wearing the suits for about six or seven hours because they had to make alterations. There were about eight practices in total, with the last three lasting 12 hours each.\n\nBut the production crew did their best to make this suit as wearable as possible; they listened to every complaint and tried to fix it.\n\nAnd getting to see behind the scenes of the production was a treat.\n\nIt was really cool to see Bad Bunny perform just a foot away. But because he was in LA for the Grammys during some of our rehearsals, the crew had a Bad Bunny stand-in they called \"Good Rabbit.\"\n\nOne of the other things they asked for in the application was whether you had marching band experience or experience in the entertainment industry. I was in a collegiate a capella group, so I'm not scared of performing in front of big crowds.\n\nBut it's definitely different when you have a stadium full of people vibing, moving, grooving to Bad Buddy's music.\n\nI spent about $2,600 on flights, hotels, and a rental car for the two weeks. I'm a content creator without a full time job now, so I didn't have to take any paid time off for this.\n\nThe hardest part of the whole thing wasn't the long hours or the heavy costume, but rather keeping quiet about it. They made us sign an NDA to not talk about it or post anything on social media for two weeks.\n\nSo when I saw people posting about what his setlist was going to be, it was so hard to have so much knowledge and power and not be able to do anything with it.\n\nI told only a very small handful of people that I was going to San Francisco and would be involved in the half-time show.\n\nI didn't tell them what I was dressed as. I didn't tell them where to look for me on the field. All I said was, \"You're going to see me. You just didn't know that you saw me.\"",

    "description": "Bad Bunny celebrated Puerto Rico at the 2026 Super Bowl, where he became the first Spanish-speaking solo artist to headline the halftime show. Trump hated it.",
    "fullText": "When Bad Bunny took the field at the 2026 Super Bowl for a historic, joyful halftime show, he wore a jersey with his Latino heritage stitched into its very fabric.\n\nIt's an apt metaphor for his performance, which eschewed explicit anti-ICE statements (he covered that at the Grammys, anyway) in favor of celebration with a side of symbolism.\n\nNods to the Puerto Rican singer's motherland were peppered throughout the set, which was designed to evoke the US territory's signature aesthetics, from sugar cane fields to a storefront labeled \"La Marqueta\" (a slang term for market) and various vendors selling tacos and piraguas (shaved ice). While performing \"El Apagón,\" a song about the frequent blackouts and infrastructure issues affecting Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny brought this symbolism to the forefront, waving the Puerto Rican flag.\n\nHe also proclaimed in English, \"God bless America,\" and brandished a football printed with the phrase \"Together, We Are America.\" He added in Spanish, \"We're still here.\" (Puerto Rico is a US territory, and Puerto Ricans are American citizens.)\n\nIt was a stark and knowing contrast to the Latinophobia and anti-immigrant messaging hawked by the Trump administration. So much so that President Donald Trump complained online about Bad Bunny's performance and his choice to sing primarily in Spanish.\n\n\"The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social after Bad Bunny left the stage. \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.\"\n\nFor those who understand visual storytelling, however, Bad Bunny's performance made perfect sense. He didn't need to say \"ICE out\" or declare an explicit political opinion. In keeping with the recent tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows, Bad Bunny used iconography to take a stand instead.\n\nBad Bunny's performance shares DNA with Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl appearances, both of which used bold imagery to make strong statements.\n\nBeyoncé's surprise appearance at Coldplay's 2016 Super Bowl halftime show became famous — and, to some, infamous — for the iconography present in her performance of her then-new single, \"Formation.\" In the midst of Trump's first presidential campaign, Beyoncé and her backup dancers wore outfits that channeled the Black Panther Party, an organization formed amid the '60s Civil Rights Movement that fought for Black liberation.\n\nThe song itself isn't explicitly political. But as a celebration of identity and legacy that features lyrics about Beyoncé's parents, her daughter, and her features (\"I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils\"), Beyoncé performing it — with visual references to the song's themes in her and her dancers' costumes, to boot — was innately political.\n\nIt's not that Beyoncé is allergic to making explicit political statements: She famously performed in front of the word \"Feminist\" at the 2014 VMAs, and sang \"Votin' out 45, don't get out of line\" on her 2022 album \"Renaissance,\" referring to Trump as the 45th president. But when the NFL hosts musicians for the night, they've lately preferred make their statements symbolic rather than overt.\n\nLast year, Kendrick Lamar followed suit during his own Super Bowl halftime show, outfitting himself and his dancers in red, white, and blue. Although Lamar kept the music focused on his own enemies and triumphs, he used audacious visual language to pose broader, poignantly relevant questions: Who's allowed to claim patriotism? What does it mean to be an American, especially in times of oppression and conflict?\n\nBad Bunny's performance raised similar questions, but offered simpler, more optimistic solutions. For the finale, he was surrounded by backup dancers, band members, and other performers holding flags from around the world; when he proclaimed \"God bless America,\" he listed out all the countries in both North and South America.\n\nBad Bunny is not a politician, nor can he single-handedly cure the world of hatred and division. Still, for a brief moment, on a small square of American turf, he chose to use the stage to show millions of people what that could look like.",

    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show was more than a hit-filled performance — it was a carefully staged cultural statement.\n\nBeyond the headline moments, the show was packed with intentional details, from visual symbolism to casting choices, that were easy to miss in real time.\n\nWe've rounded up the moments you might not have caught, and why they mattered.\n\nBad Bunny's halftime show featured several celebrity cameos from the likes of Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin, Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G, Jessica Alba, and Young Miko.\n\nLady Gaga appeared in a blue dress and sang a salsa rendition of her chart-topping hit \"Die With a Smile,\" while fellow Puerto Rican native Ricky Martin took to the stage to perform Bad Bunny's \"Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.\"\n\nMaria Antonia Cay, known as Toñita, also made a cameo, briefly appearing onstage to hand Bad Bunny a drink. She runs Caribbean Social Club in Williamsburg, one of the last Puerto Rican social clubs in New York City.\n\nA couple featured in Bad Bunny's performance actually got married during the set, league sources confirmed to ESPN.\n\nThe outlet said that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding. Instead, the singer invited them to get married during his show.\n\nToward the end of his performance, Bad Bunny switched to English and said, \"God Bless America.\" He went on to list countries from South America up to North America as dancers walked behind him holding the respective flags — he finished with the United States and Canada.\n\nHe then closed his performance by holding up a football stamped with the words \"Together, We Are America\" and spiking it on the field.\n\nDuring his performance of \"El Apagón,\" a song whose title translates to \"the power outage,\" Bad Bunny leaned into the track's themes about the frequent blackouts in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe stage featured his dancers dressed as jíbaros, or traditional Puerto Rican farmers, who began climbing utility poles that sparked and exploded.\n\nBad Bunny brought Puerto Rico to Levi's Stadium by covering the stage in greenery inspired by Vega Baja, where he grew up.\n\nIn another stadium, that kind of lush landscape would typically be created by wheeling carts of plant props onto the field, Bruce Rodgers, whose company Tribe Inc. handled the show's production design, told Wired.\n\nBut NFL rules limited how many carts could be used to protect Levi's Stadium's natural grass, so the team dressed performers as plants to get the same effect, Rodgers said\n\nBad Bunny's halftime performance featured several cultural symbols of Puerto Rico, including sugar cane fields, a piragua stand, and a casita.\n\nAs fireworks lit up the sky to mark the end of Bad Bunny's halftime performance, a stadium screen displayed the message, \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love.\"\n\nThe quote echoed a line from the singer's Grammy acceptance speech last week.\n\nWhile accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny called out ICE.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nLater that night, Bad Bunny also made history as the first artist to win Album of the Year with an all-Spanish record.",

Clarke, set to footage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Starship rocket boosters returning to Earth.\n\nIt shows Starlink operating in a series of remote locations and touts the satellite internet service's mission of \"fast, affordable internet, available everywhere.\"\n\nThe ad marks a departure for Musk's companies, which have in the past shunned advertising in favor of using the billionaire's outspoken public persona for publicity.\n\nFast, affordable internet.

    "title": "An unexpected theme of this year's Super Bowl ads: tech glitches",
    "description": "Tech didn't just star in Super Bowl ads this year — it stumbled. While the stakes are high for advertisers, some glitches aren't always a bad thing.",
    "fullText": "A Super Bowl ad is meant to serve as a victory lap for tech companies. But on advertising's biggest night of the year, some brands were undone by the very thing they were supposed to be showcasing: technology.\n\nMr Beast and Salesforce teamed up to offer viewers a $1 million prize if they could be the first to crack clues hidden in a Super Bowl ad, and elsewhere, in an online treasure hunt. However, some hopeful contestants were immediately foiled by delays in receiving their registration emails.\n\nIn a message on the contest website, Salesforce said the glitch was caused by an \"overwhelming response\" to the competition and that it was working with major email providers to resolve the issue.\n\nMarc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, appeared to be pleased with the ad's performance, writing on X that more than 53 million people visited the campaign's landing page. \"Beyond any expectation we could have had,\" he wrote, adding that Mr Beast is \"an absolute genius.\"\n\nElsewhere, an ad that ran in the fourth quarter of the game for AI.com — a new platform launched by Crypto.com cofounder Kris Marszalek — invited viewers to visit the website to create a handle and create their own agents. But social media users said that the site was down for a period after the ad aired.\n\nMarszalek had spent $70 million to acquire the AI.com domain, which the deal's broker confirmed to the Financial Times was the highest-known price paid for a domain.\n\n\"Insane traffic levels. We prepared for scale, but not for THIS,\" Marszalek wrote on X. He later wrote that the site was \"hitting Google rate limits (which are at their absolute global maximum).\" The site was restored shortly afterward.\n\nThe stakes are high for Super Bowl advertisers. This year's broadcaster, NBCUniversal, confirmed that the average price to secure 30 seconds of airtime during the game reached $8 million, with some slots fetching $10 million. Then there's the additional investments in talent fees, production, and supporting ads and social activity beyond the TV ad.\n\nAs one of the few remaining mass-reach advertising vehicles — 127.7 million viewers tuned in last year, per the ratings company Nielsen — Super Bowl advertisers usually want to go out of their way to avoid mistakes. Sometimes brands can frame apparent tech flops as wins.\n\nLoz Horner, strategy partner at the ad agency Lucky Generals, which had previously produced Super Bowl campaigns for Amazon, said that while site crashes could cause some viewers to question the reliability of a company's tech, last night's glitches will likely play out well for Salesforce and AI.com.\n\n\"It builds the sense that this is a good thing that you should \"There probably isn't another advertising moment like the Super Bowl where if you run an ad saying, 'do something now,' you need to be ready for tens of millions of responses.\"\n\nIn 2022, Coinbase captured attention with a 60-second Super Bowl TV spot that simply featured a QR code bouncing around the screen like a DVD screensaver. Shortly after airing, Coinbase's app reportedly crashed for some users, while others showed error screens on the landing page. The company chalked it up as a win, saying the ad delivered 20 million hits to a landing page within a minute of it airing. The spot also won the 2022 Super Clio for best Super Bowl ad, an award judged by a jury of advertising experts.\n\nThis year, Coinbase went minimal again with a 60-second retro karaoke-machine-style ad that encouraged viewers to sing along to the Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" before revealing its logo at the very end.\n\nPrediction market platform Kalshi was another company hit by tech glitches during last night's Super Bowl. While the company couldn't advertise during the Super Bowl itself — prediction markets were placed on the NFL's prohibited advertising list last year — Kalshi had been heavily promoting bets related to the big game. However, the company said Sunday evening that some deposits and transfers on its app were delayed because of the high volume of traffic.",

    "fullText": "Derick Hall doesn't just feel blessed to be a Super Bowl champion. He feels blessed to be alive after being born with a 1% chance of survival.\n\nThe Seattle linebacker played a key role as the Seahawks beat the New England Patriots 29-13 in Sunday's NFL title decider, claiming two sacks in a dominant defensive display.\n\nBut it is a wonder the 24-year-old is even here at all after being born four months premature in 2001.\n\nHall weighed less than 3lb and was on life support when his mother refused to have it discontinued.\n\nNow 6ft 3in and 254lb, he hugged his mother on the field in Santa Clara, California, after Seattle's second Super Bowl win.\n\n\"Everyone knows my story, what it took for me to get here, what it took for me just to be alive and have the chance,\" said Hall.\n\n\"I'm very blessed - kudos to Mom. That was a special moment after the game. I feel like she's an unsung hero, an unsung warrior through this whole process. She always fought for me. She never gave up.\n\n\"Just being able to play football and what this game has done for me and my life and my family...\n\n\"I always love and respect playing this game, and I feel like I show that every single time I step on the field.\"\n\nAfter a difficult start to his NFL career, it seemed Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold was destined to become a journeyman back-up.\n\nBut after leading the Minnesota Vikings to last season's play-offs, the Seahawks became his fifth team in eight years - and third in three – and they have won American sport's biggest prize in his first season in Seattle.\n\n\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me since the first training camp, every single day we came to work,\" said 28-year-old Darnold.\n\n\"I shared a great moment with my parents and fiancee Katie after the game and I think that's what kind of got me a little bit.

    "fullText": "Donald Trump reacted forcefully to Super Bowl 60, calling for immediate change after what he described as a damaging moment for the NFL.\n\nFollowing the game, the former US president focused his criticism on the halftime show and quickly expanded his comments to include league policy.\n\nTrump shared his reaction in a post published by TrumpTruthOnX, responding directly to Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n\nHe wrote, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, ever! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence.\n\n“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children who are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”\n\nThe comments were uncompromising and immediate. Trump framed the halftime show not as a matter of taste, but as a failure to reflect what he believes the Super Bowl should represent.\n\nAs has often been the case, Trump’s reaction quickly spread across social media, becoming part of the wider debate surrounding the NFL’s entertainment choices.\n\nTrump’s post did not stop at the halftime show. He also used the moment to call out a specific NFL rule change.\n\nHe continued, “This ‘show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the best Stock Market and 401(k)s in history!\n\n“There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a halftime show and watch, it will get great reviews from the fake news media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the real world, and, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new kickoff rule. Make America great again!”\n\nThe mention of the kickoff rule stood out. Rather than limiting his response to entertainment, Trump shifted attention to on-field changes introduced by the league.\n\nHis criticism suggested frustration with what he sees as unnecessary adjustments to the game itself.\n\nThe NFL’s revised kickoff rule, which was introduced in 2024, has already divided fans, with some praising the improvements and others arguing it removes excitement.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 fallout continues, the former president’s comments ensured the halftime show debate expanded beyond music.\n\nIt became, once again, a flashpoint for how sport, culture, and politics intersect on the biggest stage.\n\nDonald Trump goes off on ‘worst ever’ Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show\n\nImane Khelif has a brutal reminder for Donald Trump, names only way she will ‘respect’ the US President\n\nWho Donald Trump picked as Super Bowl LX winners between Patriots and Seahawks",

    "title": "How ‘Walking Hall of Famer’ Devon Witherspoon put his stamp on Super Bowl win",
    "description": "Devon Witherspoon’s teammate called him a future Hall of Famer after his game-changing performance in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.",
    "fullText": "There was a moment after Uchenna Nwosu crossed the goal line to score a decisive touchdown late in the Super Bowl when Devon Witherspoon had a strong case for the game’s Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe box score momentarily read that Witherspoon had just notched his second sack and forced a fumble that fell into Nwosu’s arms. Nwosu ran 45 yards and scored, making it a 29-7 game, effectively ending the New England Patriots’ slim hopes at a miracle comeback.\n\nBut the box score was corrected by NFL officials moments later, giving Nwosu the interception and taking away a sack and forced fumble from Witherspoon’s stat line. Had it held, his MVP case might have been stronger than running back Kenneth Walker, who had 161 yards from scrimmage, but wasn’t part of any touchdown plays, as Witherspoon was.\n\nAfter all, the story of Sunday’s 29-13 championship triumph from the Seahawks was the defense’s domination of second-year quarterback Drake Maye. And Witherspoon’s stat line would have jumped out over Derick Hall and Byron Murphy, who each had two sacks. Maye was sacked six times, finished with a fumble and two interceptions while the Seahawks won the turnover battle 3-0.\n\nNot that anyone with the Seahawks mind that Walker won MVP. Lifting of the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in the organization’s history, the hugs, celebratory cigars and the other once-in-a-lifetime moments at Levi’s Stadium mean far more than quibbles over box score stats and MVP cases.\n\nBut there’s little doubt Witherspoon has cemented himself as one of the best defensive backs in the NFL — and has a chance to go down as an all-time Seahawks player if he continues his current trajectory.\n\n“He’s a walking Hall of Famer, right now,” Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV said. “He’s a dog. He’s my favorite player in the NFL. He can do everything.”\n\nWitherspoon had four tackles, a sack, and three quarterbacks hits, including the one on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown. His sack in the first quarter ended New England’s second drive in a string that included 10 straight possessions that ended in either a punt or kneel down to end the first half.\n\nHis performance in the Super Bowl will get added to a resume that already includes three Pro Bowls in his first three seasons, and potentially a contract atop the market. The No. 5-overall pick in the 2023 draft is eligible for an extension for the first time this offseason.\n\n“The soul of our defense, ‘Spoon is the heart of it,” safety Julian Love said. “If you know football and you watch our tape, 21 jumps off the screen every single play, every single game, every single rep. It’s just raw talent. It’s playing football the right way. He’s just a ballplayer. And he’s been that way since the first time he stepped in the building.”\n\nThe Patriots didn’t score a touchdown until early in the fourth quarter, trimming a 19-0 to 19-7. Witherspoon, and his teammates, throttled New England to the tune of 78 yards on offense through the first three quarters. They exploded for 253 in the fourth when the game was largely out of hand to finish with a respectable 331. The final number did not represent how much Seattle’s “Dark Side” controlled the game.\n\nWhen relayed being called a Hall of Famer by Jones, Witherspoon said, “It means everything. Talk about a great teammate, Ernest, he’s everything to us, man. A ‘Mike’ linebacker who sets the standard for us. ... Right now, I’m just focused on the now, living in the present.”\n\nSeahawks coach Mike Macdonald dialed up more blitzes early in the game than the Seahawks typically had throughout the season. He called nine pressures, by unofficial count, in the first half. That 36% rate is nearly double their 19.3% rate from the regular season, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\nOf course, Witherspoon’s blitzes resulted in his first-quarter sack that came on an early third down that helped set the tone of the game. And his hit on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown will be remembered as a highpoint in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.\n\n“I haven’t been blitzing a lot this year,” Witherspoon said. “But it was best for our team, and I’m going to do whatever I need to do for our team to win.”",

He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nBad Bunny piles on Puerto Rican patriotism at Super Bowl half-time show\n\nWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "The Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX. MVP Kenneth Walker III leads the record EIGHT Studs from tonight!",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks just won the Super Bowl!\n\nThey defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX to claim their second Lombardi Trophy as a franchise. There's so much to be happy about, but none more than the blessing of watching this team this season. We have an entire offseason to break it down, but for now and for the last time this season...\n\nHere are your Studs and Duds for the Super Bowl LX!\n\nKenneth Walker III rushed for 135 yards on 27 carries (averaging 5.0 YPC) and won Super Bowl MVP. He added 26 receiving yards, too, but his biggest asset to the team was being the only offensive force that consistently instilled fear in either defense the entire night. There’s no Seahawk who saw their stock increase so dramatically this postseason – or in any ever, for that matter.\n\nDevon Witherspoon had a case for Super Bowl MVP himself. He had four tackles, a sack, a tackle for loss, and forced Uchenna Nwosu’s pick-six. His blitz usage was the difference in the game on defense, and will go down in the history books as one of the most versatile adjustments a player has ever been able to make in a game of this magnitude.\n\nDerick Hall had two sacks, two tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and two tackles. He became the matchup of the night on Patriots rookie left tackle Will Campbell and won in dramatic fashion. He woke up today viewed as a rotational player, and ended a franchise legend tonight. By matching his entire regular season sack total in the Super Bowl, he literall saved it for when it counted most.\n\nUchenna Nwosu will finally go down in Seahawks lore as his consistent force of work ought to. His 45-yard pick six capped off a massively under-appreciated season with one of the biggest defensive plays in the history of the organization. He didn’t get a single tackle, sack or tackle for loss, but it does not matter– because he played his role on this incredibly deep team by coming up in the clutch in the big moment when it was needed most.\n\nBoth Jason Myers and Michael Dickson had all-time performances in the kicking game tonight. Myers set a record for kicker points in a Super Bowl with 17, going 5/5 on field goals and 2/2 on extra points. Dickson averaged 47.9 yards per punt (335 total yards on 7 punts) and gave Seattle a field-position security blanket in the defensive battle that moved the needle more than any single-game punting performance in recent memory.\n\nAt just 38 years old, Mike Macdonald became the third youngest head coach to ever win a Super Bowl, and also the first defensive play-calling one. He refused to lift the Lombardi trophy without his players doing so at the same time as well, which sums up his selflessness as well as possible. Mike Vrabel might’ve won Coach of the Year, but if one were to power rank the NFL head coaches right now, he would undoubtedly be number one.\n\nByron Murphy II was the sleeper MVP of the night. He had two sacks, two tackles for loss, and consistently reset the line of scrimmage. He was the best lineman on either team tonight. In just his second year, there’s truly no limit to what his career trajectory can look like after becoming a Super Bowl Champion in his second year- and dominating on the biggest stage, at that.\n\nThe 12s were PHENOMENAL tonight, as they were all season long. They set the tone before kickoff and during every snap by drowning the entire stadium out with chants of “SEA… HAWKS!” Throughout the whole game. Coach Macdonald’s motto of 12 as one represents the rebirth that has taken place in the Pacific Northwest's football fanbase, who hold the most revered fan tradition in the NFL.\n\nThe Seahawks defense only allowed 23 rushing yards to Rhamondre Stevenson, meaning they finished the entire season- 20 total games- without allowing a 100-yard rusher. Their streak extends to 29 straight games dating back to last season. Truly mind-boggling… while the Patriots defense honed in on Jaxon Smith-Njigba and held him quiet, Cooper Kupp led the team with 61 receiving yards… JSN soaked up all the attention and allowed his teammates to thrive so he could get his first ring… AJ Barner scored the Seahawks only offensive touchdown, routing up another safety on a corner route to do so in a huge moment, just like the Rams game in Week 16… and as Mike Macdonald says, it's not just about the 53, but the entire 70. From the entire roster to the practice squad, everyone on the Seahawks just earned a Super Bowl Ring that they'll cherish for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe game was close for the majority, so of course, there were a few duds. Cornerbacks Josh Jobe and Tariq Woolen lost it on consecutive plays, beginning with Jobe throwing an open-hand punch at Stefon Diggs, followed immediately by Mack Hollins dominating Tariq Woolen for 24- and 35-yards plus a touchdown on two consecutive plays. There were plenty of other areas for improvement- if the Seahawks thought they were perfect, they would never have got there in the first place. However, we at Seahawks Wire will be talking about that ALL offseason, every single day- for now, it’s time to celebrate, if it ever was!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks Super Bowl LX: Studs and Duds from the championship win",

    "fullText": "Is Drake Maye the next Dan Marino or Joe Burrow? How rough Super Bowl 60 changes narrative for Patriots QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDrake Maye became the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl when he faced the Seahawks in Super Bowl 60. Unfortunately, after a 29-13 setback in which he struggled against Seattle's defense, Maye, 23, is now also the second-youngest QB to lose a Super Bowl.\n\nHall of Famer Dan Marino was also 23 when he led the Dolphins to defeat in Super Bowl 19, a 38-16 loss to Joe Montana and the 49ers. Like Maye, he was in his second season. Marino was the MVP in the 1984 regular season before the playoffs, while Maye was the MVP runner-up in 2025.\n\nWith Marino emerging as an all-time great passer quickly, it was expected he would return to the Super Bowl at least once—and maybe several times—to give Montana a natural big-game rival. Instead, Marino played 15 more seasons and never won another AFC championship with Miami.\n\nBad Bunny halftime show reviews\n\nWinners and losers from Super Bowl 60\n\nKenneth Walker ends 28-year RB MVP drought\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade details\n\nBest and worst Super Bowl commercials in 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Roethlisberger was 23 on the Steelers team that won Super Bowl 40 over the Seahawks. He went on to win a second ring in Super Bowl 44.\n\nSo the question is: Does the loss to the Seahawks set up Maye for another “tough no-ring” scenario, or can the Patriots count on returning to the Super Bowl with him at quarterback?\n\nIt’s hard to say now, but let’s consider the other second-year QBs who joined Maye, Marino, and Roethlisberger in starting a Super Bowl.\n\nKurt Warner was the first to win, with the 1999 Rams in Super Bowl 34. Then came Tom Brady, whose Patriots upset Warner’s Rams two years later in Super Bowl 36. The other second-year winner was Russell Wilson, who led the 2013 Seahawks to victory in Super Bowl 48.\n\nUnfortunately, Maye now joins Marino, Colin Kaepernick, Joe Burrow, and Brock Purdy-- fellow second-year QBs who lost their first Super Bowl trips. Excluding the two 49ers, who lost close games, Maye most closely resembles Marino and Burrow.\n\nBurrow’s Bengals lost Super Bowl 56 to the Rams, 23-20, and were hammered by the defense. He faced Aaron Donald and the Rams’ pass rush, which tied a Super Bowl record with seven sacks -- Donald and Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller had two each.\n\nMaye was sacked six times by the Seahawks. He also threw a pick-six as part of two interceptions and lost a fumble under pressure. Likewise, Marino was sacked four times by the 49ers and threw two interceptions.\n\nMORE: Why Drake Maye's legacy won't be defined by Super Bowl 60 flop\n\nBurrow is still active, giving him a chance for a Super Bowl return. But repeated punishment and a combination of offensive line and defensive shortcomings have limited his championship prospects.\n\nThe Patriots, on paper, appear poised to remain long-term AFC contenders with Maye at QB and Mike Vrabel as head coach. But nothing is guaranteed in the NFL—New England should know this after going from 3-14 to 14-3 in just one year. Fortune can be fleeting.\n\nMaye will enter his third season on his rookie deal, meaning the clock is ticking before the No. 3 overall pick of 2024 earns a lucrative long-term extension—a second contract that could restrict signing and retaining free agents while staying under the salary cap. Burrow’s extension handcuffed the Bengals’ ability to surround him with talent, particularly at wide receiver.\n\nMarino signed an extension in 1986, three years after being drafted and less than two years after losing the Super Bowl. The Dolphins made him the league’s highest-paid player both times, limiting spending elsewhere.\n\nGoing into Super Bowl 60, there was talk of Maye channeling a second-year Brady and launching another Patriots dynasty with Vrabel coaching instead of Belichick. Now, Maye’s brutal loss casts doubt on that plan, given his struggles against tougher defenses leading up to the Seahawks.\n\nMORE: Was Drake Maye's effort against Seattle one of the worst QB performances in Super Bowl history?\n\nMaye also had the chance to emerge as the AFC’s consistent challenger to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, potentially winning a Super Bowl before Burrow, Josh Allen, or Lamar Jackson. This past season was unusual, with Mahomes and Jackson absent from the playoffs. Concerns remain that Maye’s strong stats came against a favorable schedule, and he may regress in Year 3.\n\nIn 2021, before Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, he led the league in completion percentage (70.4) and yards per pass attempt (8.9), but was sacked a league-high 51 times. In 2025, Maye also led the league in completion percentage (72.0) and yards per attempt (8.9) and was sacked 47 times -- foreshadowing the 21 sacks he endured in just four playoff games through Super Bowl 60.\n\nNew England likely will improve pass protection, but Maye’s tendency to extend plays with his athleticism may always lead to a high sack rate.=\n\nWarner, Brady, Wilson, and Roethlisberger were unflappable in their first Super Bowls as second-year QBs. Maye did not show that same composure, even compared with Burrow and Marino.\n\nThe Super Bowl and preceding playoffs are a different beast than the regular season. Ask Allen and Jackson -- two recent non-Mahomes MVPs—who failed to reach the Super Bowl despite Hall of Fame credentials. Four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers is running out of time to earn a second ring. Cam Newton, Matt Ryan, and Matthew Stafford had their chances once -- and that was it.\n\nMORE: Drake Maye gets emotional following Super Bowl 60 loss\n\nWinning a Super Bowl as a top passer is difficult, which makes one appreciate Brady, Mahomes, and Montana all the more for executing in clutch playoff moments.\n\nThe 23-year-old Maye has time on his side -- but so did Marino, and so did Burrow, who four years later is still chasing his first ring.\n\nThis is a great QB era. The AFC is loaded with elite passers and high-potential stars. Unfortunately, history suggests Maye is more likely to follow the path of Marino or Burrow than become the next Brady or Mahomes.",

    "fullText": "Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shared his “disappointed” reaction after a heartbreaking Super Bowl loss. The New England Patriots battled it out on the field against the Seattle Seahawks on February 8. Notably, the Seahawks defeated the Patriots 29–13. Unsurprisingly, Patriots coach Vrabel isn’t pleased with his team’s performance on the field.\n\nPatriots coach Mike Vrabel is understandably “disappointed” after the Super Bowl loss. Notably, Vrabel took over an underperforming team and led them to a remarkable 14‑3 regular-season record before winning three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nFans who watched the game would acknowledge that the Patriots did not deliver their best against the Seahawks. Vrabel, without mincing any words, stated, “Disappointed. I reminded them that we’re 307 days into what hopefully is a long, successful relationship and program” (via Patriots. com).\n\nContinuing further, he shared, “It’s OK to be disappointed. We have to be disappointed and upset together. . . . Every year, somebody’s going to lose this game. We have to remember what it feels like and make sure it’s not repeatable.”\n\nPatriots’ long-term fans believe the team wasn’t up to the mark in yesterday’s game and barely performed to their potential. However, coach Vrabel is proud of the team’s efforts and believes their performance in yesterday’s match was not an accurate “reflection of our year.” Vrabel also added that making this kind of jump in their first year together “wasn’t very valuable.”\n\nMoreover, the 50-year-old believes the heartbreaking loss is the entire team’s responsibility, and the onus isn’t on any single player.\n\nVrabel remarked, “We can sit here and try to put it all on one guy. You’ll be disappointed cause that’ll never happen. It starts with us as the coaching staff, making sure that we’re doing our part. Obviously, we have to be able to execute. We’ve gotta be able to protect, and when we do protect, we have to be able to progress through and throw to guys open and help the quarterback, and then he’s gotta be better. That’s just how it goes.”\n\nThe post Patriots’ Coach Mike Vrabel ‘Disappointed’ After Super Bowl Loss appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks produced a devastating defensive display to beat the New England Patriots and claim their second Super Bowl victory.\n\nTwo of the NFL's strongest defences battled it out in Sunday's showpiece and the Seahawks emphatically came out on top to win 29-13 at Levi's Stadium in.\n\nIt was a defensive performance for the ages and Briton Aden Durde played a pivotal role, becoming the first overseas coach to win the Unites States' biggest game.\n\nSeattle's 46-year-old defensive co-ordinator has helped create the most feared defence in the NFL, which has become known as 'the Dark Side', and they showed why on American football's biggest stage in Santa Clara, California.\n\nNew England's second-year quarterback Drake Maye narrowly missed out on this season's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award but was stifled by the Seahawks, who claimed six sacks, forced three turnovers and scored a defensive touchdown.\n\nAfter Seattle led 9-0 at half-time, Maye's first turnover resulted in the game's opening touchdown for tight end AJ Barner early in the fourth quarter.\n\nLinebacker Uchenna Nwosu then returned an interception for a 45-yard touchdown, while Jason Meyers kicked a record five field goals as Seattle denied the Patriots a record seventh Super Bowl win.\n\n\"We were the better team; we're the best team. We loved each other, we believed in each other and now we're champions,\" Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald told NBC.\n\n\"We went to the dark side tonight. We love our players - they made it happen. They made it come to life.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nMost of the 70,823 crowd seemed to favour Seattle, who came into the game as narrow favourites, and their win also means quarterback Sam Darnold completed his redemption story after being written off as a starting NFL quarterback.\n\nThe Seahawks are Darnold's fifth team in his eight-year career - and third in three years - but in his first year in Seattle the former third overall draft pick has won the game's biggest prize.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been haunted by a comment he made as he struggled in a game against the Patriots in 2019, when he said \"I'm seeing ghosts\", but Darnold has now exorcised those demons.\n\nInstead, it was Maye who suffered a nightmare when confronted with the fast, physical defence that Durde and coach Macdonald have fashioned in their two seasons together in Seattle.\n\nSuch is the breadth and depth of the threat it carries that Devon Witherspoon claimed a sack from cornerback. He, Derick Hall and Rylie Mills only registered 2.5 sacks between them all season but all three got to Maye in the first half.\n\nThe Patriots earned only four first downs before the interval and 52 yards in total. Some cruel folks on social media even joked that Bad Bunny gained more yards as he carried a ball during his half-time show.\n\nHall's second sack forced a fumble which was recovered by Byron Murphy, who also sacked Maye twice as the Dark Side wrote themselves into Seattle folklore alongside the 'Legion of Boom', the defence that led the Seahawks to their previous Super Bowl win in 2014.\n\n\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me,\" Darnold told NBC.\n\n\"Since the first training camp, every single day we came to work. Shout-out to our offensive line for everything they did in the game. But I've also got to shout out our defence.\n\n\"We did it. It's been such a special journey with these guys. So much hard work has been out into this and we did it.\"\n\nNew England were playing in their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick.\n\nThe duo led the Patriots to six Super Bowl wins, tying the NFL record with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Mike Vrabel playing in three of those wins.\n\nAfter two 4-13 seasons, the former linebacker returned to New England as head coach and has rebuilt the roster, leading the Patriots to a record-extending 12th Super Bowl appearance.\n\nVrabel was hoping to become the first man to win a Super Bowl as a player and head coach with the same franchise, while Maye aimed to be the youngest quarterback to win the big game.\n\nAs well as having the league's best pass completion rate this season, Maye has impressed with his ability to scramble and escape the pressure.\n\nThere was no getting away from the Seahawks, though, as New England were unable to get their run game going or get star receiver Stefon Diggs into the game.\n\nMaye did give the Patriots hope as he found Mack Hollins for a touchdown to cut the score to 19-7, but he was intercepted on their next two possessions, meaning Rhamondre Stevenson's late score was a consolation.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Ernest Jones IV wins a Super Bowl then defends his quarterback from hater Puka Nacua originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSeahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV is not going to let anyone disrespect what they accomplished on Sunday.\n\nThe first and most notable hater was Rams receiver Puka Nacua who posted on X “Sam Darnold” with laugh/crying emoji amid the Seahawks blowout of the Patriots in Super Bowl 60.\n\nRams are NFC West division rivals with the Seahawks. Nacua is one of the more outspoken players in the league.\n\nThe post caught the attention of Jones, who responded on X, “Ain’t you at home. Goofy ass.”\n\nMORE: Who is Jody Allen? What to know about Seahawks owner getting ready to sell the team despite Super Bowl win\n\nJones is not going to let anyone disrespect his quarterback. Darnold didn’t have a perfect game but also didn’t turn the ball over.  Jones, the signal-caller of the defense, had a team-high 11 tackles on Sunday.\n\nIn Nacua’s defense, he did post in support of former teammate Cooper Kupp for winning his second ring. The star receiver is coming off a career year – a league high 129 catches for 1,715 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nAnd Darnold will likely face some skeptics his entire career because of how terrible his time with the New York Jets was during his initial years in the league. A win like Sunday helps quiet some of the criticism, despite a mundane performance. Darnold was 19-of-38 for 202 yards and had one touchdown.\n\nMORE: How Mike Macdonald-Maria Taylor high school connection took center stage at Super Bowl 60\n\n“Offense, I feel like we didn’t play as good as we could have,” Darnold told reporters postgame, according to Yahoo. “I certainly didn’t play as good as I could have.\n\n“I didn’t have my best stuff, but our team had my back.”\n\n“Put some respect on it! He’s the best!” Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba said, interrupting a Darnold interview postgame. “We’re not here without that guy.”\n\nKenneth Walker III's dad picked the best time to watch his son for the first time in the NFL\n\nWhere Patriots QB Drake Maye’s struggles against Seattle fit among worst QB performances in Super Bowl history\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade 2026 time, route and how to watch Seattle celebration\n\nRussell Wilson, Puka Nacua, more react to Seahawks' Super Bowl win over Patriots",

(\"Auntie asked me if I have a lot of girlfriends, a lot of girlfriends / Today I have one, tomorrow I'll have another, but there's no wedding.\")\n\n\"Yo Perreo Sola,\" which loosely translates to \"I Twerk Alone,\" was released as a single from \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he wrote the song from a woman's perspective (hence the feminine adjective, \"sola,\" in the title) to address sexual harassment in clubs.\n\n\"I wanted a woman's voice to sing it — 'yo perreo sola' — because it doesn't mean the same thing when a man sings it,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"But I do feel like that woman sometimes.\"\n\nThe music video ends with a title card that reads, \"Si no quiere bailar contigo, respeta, ella perrea sola.\" (\"If she doesn't want to dance with you, respect her, she twerks alone.\")\n\n\"Safaera,\" a collaboration with Ñengo Flow and Puerto Rican duo Jowell & Randy, is the 14th track on \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\n\"Party\" is the 11th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" The studio version features Rauw Alejandro.\n\n\"Voy a Llevarte Pa PR,\" meaning \"I'm Going to Take You to Puerto Rico,\" is the second track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\n\"Eoo,\" which samples \"Perreo Baby\" by Héctor & Tito, is the 15th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" It won the 2026 Grammy Award for best global music performance.\n\n\"Monaco\" is the second track on Bad Bunny's fifth solo studio album, \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana.\"\n\nLady Gaga made an appearance during Bad Bunny's performance to sing a salsa-style version of her hit duet with Bruno Mars (sans Mars).\n\n\"Baile Inolvidable\" is the third track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features live salsa arrangements, recorded by students from San Juan's Escuela Libre de Música, according to a press release for the album.\n\n\"Nuevayol\" is the opening track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\nThe song features a sample of \"Un Verano en Nueva York,\" or \"A Summer in New York,\" originally performed by Andy Montañez and El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.\n\n\"This album is the result of the experiences that have led me to get to know myself better, even getting to know the rhythms I enjoy most—the ones I truly enjoy singing and creating,\" Bad Bunny said in a statement.\n\n\"I am Puerto Rican, I am Caribbean, and my music, my culture, my country's history run through my veins, from plena to reggaeton,\" he continued. \"At the peak of my career and popularity, I want to show the world who I am.\"\n\nBad Bunny enlisted Ricky Martin to sing \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,\" a song about American colonization.\n\nThe two Latino singers have worked together in the past; Martin contributed backing vocals to Bad Bunny's 2019 single \"Caro\" and made a cameo in the 2020 music video for \"Yo Visto Así.\"\n\n\"El Apagón,\" which translates to \"The Power Outage,\" is the 16th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" It was later released as the album's seventh single.\n\n\"Café Con Ron\" is the 12th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features the Puerto Rican ensemble Los Pleneros de la Cresta.\n\n\"DTMF\" is the 16th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" later released as the album's fourth single.\n\nIt was nominated for both record and song of the year at the 2026 Grammys, but the awards went to \"Luther\" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA and \"Wildflower\" by Billie Eilish, respectively.",

He also wished the players on both teams good luck.\n\nHong was one of the scores of celebrities, from Travis Scott to Jay-Z, who descended on San Francisco for the championship game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. He had teased fans that he would show up at the Super Bowl hours before game day kicked off in earnest, posting selfies of himself from the car on the way to the stadium.\n\nIn another video released on the NFL's official X account, the Los Angeles-born singer walked onto the field in a preppy outfit, soaking up the game day vibes and snapping some photos.\n\nJoshua from SEVENTEEN taking in the sights and sounds of @SuperBowl LX. @pledis_17 #SBLX https://t.co/TpcuCsCwpA pic.twitter.com/g9TT0Ijc3O\n\nHong had been spotted in the front row of Thom Browne's fashion show in San Francisco two days before the Super Bowl festivities.

Hong was spotted rubbing shoulders with the stars of the hit show \"Heated Rivalry\" backstage.\n\nSeventeen is one of K-pop mega-agency Hybe's biggest moneymakers. The 13-member boy band is in the middle of its world tour and heads to Southeast Asia next. Their label mates, BTS, will return after a prolonged hiatus on March 21 with the album \"Arirang.\"",

    "description": "Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history with his entirely Spanish set on the sporting world's biggest stage.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl half-time show was one big love letter to his native Puerto Rico.\n\nThe 14-minute set included guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, along with cameos from the likes of Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G and Jessica Alba, who could be seen dancing on the porch of his famous casita, a staple of his shows designed to look like a traditional Puerto Rican home.\n\nIt was expected that Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, would use his performance as an opportunity to make a political statement against the current US administration, but instead he used it to promote a message of American unity.\n\nTransporting himself through a Latin landscape, with set pieces that included everything from a nail salon to a bar, the Grammy award winner reeled off a medley of his biggest hits, including Tití Me Preguntó, MONACO and BAILE INoLVIDABLE.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who was the world's most-played artist in 2025 according to streaming service Spotify, made history by becoming the first musician to perform a Super Bowl half-time show entirely in Spanish.\n\nBut he did choose to make two statements in English, one with a billboard message reading \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" and the other \"Together, We Are America\" written on a football that he held.\n\nHis performance at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, marked the first time the singer and rapper has performed in the United States since releasing last year's Grammy-award winning album Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).\n\nPuerto Rico, which is a self-governing territory of the USA, was at the heart of everything in this performance, from his early emergence from a sugarcane field to a set that was meant to represent the sounds and sights of the place he calls home.\n\nFamily also featured heavily - from a young couple getting married in a crowd full of Latino dancers to the symbolic moment of Bad Bunny handing his Grammy award to a small child as his 2026 acceptance speech played on a small television.\n\nClimbing an electricity pylon - symbolising the infrastructure that was ruined during the devastating storm - and rapping at the same time, he appeared to pay tribute to the people who died in the 2017 Hurricane Maria.\n\nBad Bunny further spread a message with his outfit - wearing a beige sweater emblazoned with the number 64.\n\nIt could represent the official death toll, which turned out to be significantly lower than the estimated thousands who died.\n\nPresident Trump's administration was criticised at the time by Puerto Ricans who said it failed to provide the same federal support compared to hurricanes that had occurred on the mainland.\n\nThere were no direct criticisms of President Trump, which some saw as a surprise after his two acceptance speeches at last week's Grammy Awards, which he used as an opportunity to speak out against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers.\n\nTheir actions have prompted protests in multiple US cities - most recently in Minneapolis, where federal agents shot and killed two Americans, leading to scrutiny of the administration's tactics.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who did not attend this year's Super Bowl, said in January that his administration would be \"reviewing everything\" after the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nIn his Grammy acceptance speech after his win for best musicá urbana album, Bad Bunny called for \"ICE out\".\n\n\"The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love, so, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.\"\n\nPresident Trump called Bad Bunny's Super Bowl set \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!\" on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nHe added that it was \"an affront to the Greatness of America\".\n\nElements of Bad Bunny's tour set, which has travelled to Central and South America and soon heads to Australia, Japan and Europe, were woven throughout Sunday's performance.\n\nThis included his casita, a house which has gone viral on social media several times for its celebrity guests.\n\nTonight was no different, with Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba and Cardi B dancing onstage.\n\nOvercoming some early sound issues, the performer leaned heavily on hits from his most recent album, with EoO and DtMF providing some of the high points of the show.\n\nIt was not his first time on the Super Bowl stage - he made a guest appearance with Shakira in 2020 - and he brought confidence as the main star. He swaggered from one corner of the stage to the next all while delivering strong vocals.\n\nLady Gaga was on hand to bring a salsa-inspired rendition of her Bruno Mars collaboration Die With A Smile, and fellow Puerto Rican popstar Ricky Martin sang Lo Que Le Pasó A Hawaii, a song which warns Puerto Ricans to not allow their culture to be erased.\n\nBad Bunny ended his performance by shouting \"God Bless America\" in Spanish and naming multiple North and South American countries, while dancers raised flags in the background, bringing attention to the performer's refusal to bring his world tour in the US, though he did do shows in Puerto Rico.\n\nBad Bunny, who has been producing music since 2013, said in a 2025 interview with i-D that there were \"many reasons\" he would not be performing in the US this time around and \"none of them were out of hate\".\n\nSunday's show represented the best of Latin culture on the sporting world's biggest stage.",

    "description": "A look at what color Gatorade was dumped on the winning coach at Super Bowl 60. Did Mike Vrabel or Mike Macdonald get the bath?",
    "fullText": "Gatorade rose to prominence in the early 1990s due, in part, to a commercial titled “Be Like Mike,” featuring Michael Jordan. A quarter of a century later, two coaches named Mike are facing off on the Super Bowl stage, and there’s a great chance one of them winds up being drenched in Gatorade tonight.\n\nEither the Seahawks’ Mike Macdonald or the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel will likely get the traditional Gatorade shower tonight at Levi’s Stadium. We will post the results of the Super Bowl 60 Gatorade color as soon as the electrolytes hit the turf this evening.\n\nWe will soon have the Super Bowl Gatorade color results. Be sure to check back here immediately after the game to see which color cashed.\n\nThere is so much chaos in the closing minutes and immediate aftermath of the Super Bowl that TV cameras can often miss the Gatorade bath.\n\nThis occurred in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl LV. CBS cameras missed Bucs head coach Bruce Arians getting doused, and there were many minutes of speculation online regarding which color landed on his head.\n\nA video from the stadium went viral shortly after the conclusion of the game, revealing that Arians was drenched in blue Gatorade.\n\nBlue was a favorite heading into this year’s game, as it owned +260 Gatorade color odds. Only orange had shorter odds.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl matchup does not have much background when it comes to Gatorade baths. There is no prior video of Macdonald or Vrabel being hit with a Gatorade bath, as neither has reached the Super Bowl as a head coach before.\n\nNeither was hit with a Gatorade bath in their respective conference championship game this year, either.\n\nHere is a look at what Gatorade color payouts would look like on a $10 bet. Payouts are the total amount you would receive in return on a winning bet. So it’s the $10 you bet upfront plus the amount you actually won.\n\nYellow/Green/Lime (+260): $36.00\n\nNo Gatorade Bath (+5000): $510.00\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "If you were expecting a defensive affair in Super Bowl LX, the first half has lived up to the billing.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks scored a field goal on their opening drive of the game to take a 3-0 lead, but that has been half of the scoring so far as the first half of Super Bowl LX draws to a close with the Seahawks leading the New England Patriots by just 6-0 thanks to two field goals from Jason Myers late in the second quarter.\n\nSo that has us thinking: What are the three lowest scoring Super Bowls in Super Bowl history?\n\nSuper Bowl IX was played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings. Similar to Super Bowl LX, the first half of Super Bowl IX was a true defensive struggle, as the only points came for Pittsburgh on a safety when Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was taken down in his own end zone.\n\nThe opening kickoff of the second half was fumbled by Minnesota fullback Bill Brown, giving the Steelers incredible field position. Pittsburgh capped off their next possession with a touchdown run from Franco Harris to give Pittsburgh a 9-0 lead.\n\nThe Steelers would go on to win by a final score of 16-9, for a total of 22 points.\n\nSuper Bowl VII capped off a perfect 17-0 season for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nBut interestingly enough, it might be most remembered for how Washington scored their only points of the game, coming on this botched field goal attempt from Miami.\n\nGaro Yepremian’s gaffe aside, the Dolphins took the win, and to date the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\nThat is a total of just 21 points.\n\nInterestingly enough, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history featured the Patriots as well.\n\nTom Brady’s final Super Bowl win with New England came in Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams. While Jared Goff and company had chances, the Rams offense never found the end zone. New England scored the lone touchdown of the game on a short plunge from Sony Michel, and wide receiver Julian Edelman — who caught 10 passes for 141 yards — took home Super Bowl MVP.",

They also better not have left their wallets at home.\n\nLevy Restaurants made just 200 of what they’re calling the LX Hammer Burger for Super Bowl Sunday.

Most people online cannot get past the price, calling it another case of Super Bowl excess.\n\nOne fan wrote, “I’d rather bite my thumb off and eat it rather than paying 180 for that. There is no doubts that the burger might be tasty, but for 180, nah. I’m expecting wagyu beef for that sum.”\n\nAnother commented, “At that price they can keep it\n\nalways eat somewhere other than the stadium!”\n\nThe most expensive concession item at Super Bowl LX is a $180 beef shank burger that feeds 4 people\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) February 8, 2026\n\nSomeone else wrote, “Mortgage just for a burger.”\n\nAnother fan added, “The majority of the people that would buy these aren’t sitting in a regular seat. They’ll be in a luxury box.”\n\nOne other fan chimed in, “Stop trying to normalize expensive concessions. I could doordash everything you see here, with a full 3 course meal and it’d cost half the price.”\n\nOne more fan wrote, “I know they need to make some margin but the markup on this is astronomical, even for stadium food.”\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL fans can’t believe the price of this Super Bowl 60 burger appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The 45.5-point total for Seahawks vs. Patriots is the lowest Super Bowl Over/Under in 10 years.\n\nThat said, our Super Bowl predictions won't rule out some fireworks this Sunday night at Levi's Stadium based on recent Big Game history. Each of the past three Super Bowls have gone Over the total.\n\nBelow, we will deliver the Seahawks vs. Patriots final score, and the results for whether or not the Super Bowl total went Over or Under the number.\n\nWe will post the answer to the question of whether the Super Bowl total went Over or Under as soon as the final score is set in stone.\n\nUntil then, here are some nuggets of information regarding the total for Super Bowl 60, and Super Bowl odds history.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots were both Top 10 scoring teams this season. Seattle ranked second overall in team scoring, behind only the LA Rams. Mike Macdonald’s team scored an impressive 29.2 points per game this season.\n\nNew England, meanwhile, ranked eighth in the NFL in points scored — putting up 27.2 ppg. In this year’s playoffs, the Seahawks have had a relatively easy time producing points, while it’s been a slog for the Pats.\n\nThe Seahawks put up 41 points in the Divisional Round against the 49ers, and then scored 31 points against the Rams in the NFC Championship game.\n\nMike Vrabel’s squad has had the unfortunate task of dealing with three of the top-ranked defenses in the NFL in their first three games of this postseason. The Pats scored just 16 points against the Chargers in the Wild Card round, 28 points against the Texans in the Divisional Round, and then scored only 10 points against the Broncos in the AFC Championship game.\n\nBoth the Seahawks and Patriots went Over the total in more games than not this season. The Pats have an Over record of 12-8-0 this season. Seattle, meanwhile, has an Over record of 11-8-0.\n\nDrake Maye and the Patriots have gone Under the total in two of their three playoff games played this winter. Chargers versus Patriots had a total of 45.5 and the two teams combined for just 19 points in the Wild Card round.\n\nTexans versus Patriots had a total of 40.5 points and the two teams combined for 44 points. This past round against the Broncos, the total was 42 points and the two teams combined for a measly 17 points.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, they went Over the total in each of their two playoff games this winter. Against the 49ers in the Divisional Round, the total was set at 44.5. The game went Over as the two teams combined for 48 points.\n\nIn the NFC title game, the Over/Under was 44.5 and the two teams rang up 58 points together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

It's actually three times more than the lowest halftime score in the big game's history, which came in Super Bowl IX following the 1974 season.\n\nIn a struggle between two classic NFL defenses — Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain vs. Minnesota's Purple People Eaters — the only first-half points midway through the second quarter. On second and 7 from his own 10-yard line, Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton lost the ball and had to fall on it in the Vikings' end zone. He was touched by Steelers defensive end Dwight White, who was credited with the sack.\n\nIt was the first safety ever in a Super Bowl, giving Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead that stood at halftime. The Steelers went on to defeat the Vikings 16-6 for their first of four Super Bowl wins in a six-year stretch.\n\nFollowing the 2018 season, the Patriots led the Rams 3-0 at the intermission of Super Bowl LIII, the second-lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history, on a 42-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski early in the second quarter.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Despite coming off a four-win season and changing head coaches a year ago, the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nLed by Mike Vrabel and MVP-caliber quarterback Drake Maye, they finished the regular season with a 14-3 record and as the second seed in the AFC playoff picture. As such, they went on to beat the Chargers, Texans and Broncos to punch their ticket to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThere, the NFC’s top seed awaits. The Seattle Seahawks reached the Super Bowl by going 14-3 themselves, and by subsequently beating two division rivals — the 49ers and Rams — in the playoffs.\n\nNow, the two teams meet in Santa Clara with the Vince Lombardi Trophy at play.\n\nHere are our updates live from Levi’s Stadium.\n\nSunday, Feb. 8, 6:30 p.m. ET | Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, CA | Broadcast information | Inactives | Game day roster\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and deferred, putting the defense on the field first to start Super Bowl 60. After a first down run by Kenneth Walker to move the chains, Sam Darnold found a pair of downfield completions to move inside the red zone. New England’s defense then held strong from there to force a field goal. [Patriots 0 : 3 Seahawks]\n\nNew England’s first drive of the day started with three straight touches for Rhamondre Stevenson, including a third-down conversion through the air. After a 12-yard scramble by Maye then set up a 3rd-and-9 after a sack, a blitz off the blindside resulted in a throwaway and punt.\n\nSeattle’s next drive started back up at their own 10-yard line. Immediately facing a 3rd-and-6, Darnold escaped a blitzing Jaylinn Hawkins but missed a wide open Jaxon Smith-Njigba downfield forcing a punt.\n\nA play-action under center pass out of six their O-line group to Kayshon Boutte started the Patriots next drive with a 21-yard gain. Two straight touches to TreVeyon Henderson then set up a 3rd-and-15, where a Seattle blitz got home again for a sack. New England then punted again.\n\nBehind another good punt by Bryce Baringer and coverage by Dell Pettus, Seattle again started inside their own 20. Two run stuffs then set up a 3rd-and-7, where a check down to Barner moved the chains. A big TFL by Craig Woodson and then a pass breakup got Seattle back into a 3rd-and-15 in which Darnold’s pass was incomplete leading to a punt.\n\nNew England continued to struggle to move the football on their next drive, as an incompletion to an open Hunter Henry was followed by a third-down run stop on Stevenson. New England punted again.\n\nFollowing a big time pass breakup downfield by Christian Gonzalez, running back Kenneth Walker found the edge to break free for 30 yards. Two plays later, Walker found running room again escaping for 29 more to move inside the red zone. With Seattle then facing a 3rd-and-12, a pitch to Walker went for a loss again thanks to Woodson. New England forced another field goal. [Patriots 0 : 6 Seahawks]\n\nWith the deficit now six, a long developing second-down sack forced the Patriots into a 3rd-and-17, where a screen to Stefon Diggs went for just five and another punt.\n\nKenneth Walker picked up a pair of first downs to get the Seahawks over midfield. A third down incompletion to Walker then forced a punt by Seattle, which was downed at the 2-yard line.\n\nBacked up on their own end zone, Maye converted a big third-down to DeMario Douglas for a nine-yard gain. Back in a third-and-long after a false start by Will Campbell, Maye uncorked one downfield in a muddy pocket that fell incomplete to Mack Hollins.\n\nWorking over midfield prior to the two-minute warning, Seattle converted a 3rd-and-2 on the ground with 32 seconds remaining. Set up with another 3rd-and-short after using their final timeouts, Darnold’s pass to JSN in the end zone was broken up and nearly intercepted by Gonzalez. New England then held to another field goal.\n\nWith six seconds left in the half, Drake Maye took a knee.",

    "description": "The Patriots coach fell short of Canton in his first year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has expressed admiration for the New England Patriots dynasty in the past, so it was little surprise what he thought about Bill Belichick's Pro Football Hall of Fame snub.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News in an interview conducted Wednesday and aired on Super Bowl Sunday, the president complained about the longtime Patriots coach failing to reach Canton in his first year of eligibility:\n\n\"I thought it was terrible. I mean, he's— won so much, won so many Super Bowls. Great coach. Became a little bit controversial, I guess, after that, this little period after that. During it he was just a great coach. I thought it was very inappropriate.\n\n\"Oh yeah. It's like what have you done for me lately? Well, you know, you have a great career and he has a little bit of a controversial year and a half, two years maybe. But— what difference does that make? No, he should've— he should be in there right at the top.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first person to rail against the snub. He refers twice to \"controversial\" actions on Belichick's part, which could be a reference to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that occurred under the coach's watch. However, he alludes to those controversial years being after Belichick's NFL career so he might simply be referring to the 73-year-old's post-Patriots UNC-Jordon Hudson era.\n\nRegardless, Belichick's snubs came down to more than controversies. As one of the few Belichick \"no\" voters laid out, the matter of voting Belichick was more than \"yes\" or \"no.\" To some, it was \"Belichick\" or \"a group of senior players who might not get another Hall of Fame shot for years.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame's voting process created conditions in which the NFL's all-time leader in playoff wins among head coaches was put in competition for a limited number of votes with three senior players and a contributor, in this case Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThis year, the only one of that quintet to emerge was former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, who was recognized on the field at Super Bowl LX alongside modern-era inductees Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri.",

    "fullText": "Who cares about the 2026 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks? Most football fans are already looking to next year, and hoping their team can make the surprising leap that New England and Seattle did this season.\n\nThe Seahawks’ were No. 19 in the preseason Super Bowl odds this season. The Patriots were No. 21 in the preseason Super Bowl odds. The NFL is king in part because almost every team starts each season with the belief that they can win the championship if everything goes according to plan. Parity is going stronger than ever in the modern game, and the 2025-26 season is all the evidence you need.\n\nIt’s never too early to look ahead to next year. Here’s every team’s Super Bowl LXI odds a year out before the game is played in SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on Feb. 14, 2027. My favorite bets are included after the table.\n\nChicago Bears (+2700): The Bears are due for some regression to the mean in terms of forcing turnovers next year. Chicago’s 22 takeaways led the league, and only Houston (17) was close, with no other team having more than 13. That’s okay: the Bears’ offense is probably due for some positive regression and additional growth from QB Caleb Williams. Williams turns 25 years old in the middle of next season as he starts Year 3 in the NFL, and he already showed massive improvement in the second half of year two. The Bears should use their available cap space to beef up the defensive front, which will hopefully make them less turnover dependent. With rookies like Colston Loveland and Luther Burden II primed to take a bigger step forward, plus a possible breakout year from Rome Odunze in his third season, the Bears should be a better offense and more sustainable defense.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (+1800): The Niners had a season from hell in terms of injuries and still had a really good year. San Francisco will be healthier coming into next season, and the injuries they had this season allowed several talented young players to get their feet wet, which should benefit them next year. Expect the Niners to be an active team in free agency after the likely release of Brandon Aiyuk. Kyle Shanahan is as good as any head coach in the NFL. There’s still blue chip talent up and down this roster. If they went 12-5 in a season where they had a lot of bad luck, I’ll bank on some positive regression next season.\n\nWashington Commanders (+4500): Jayden Daniels has looked like a superstar quarterback when he’s fully healthy, and this offseason the Commanders have the opportunity to load up on talent around him. Washington enters the offseason with the No. 7 overall pick, and tons of cap space to splurge on free agents. Edge rushers, linebackers, and secondary help could all be on the menu for a defense that struggled this season. It would also be nice to get Daniels some weapons with Zach Ertz working through a torn ACL and Deebo Samuel entering free agency. Washington needs a talent infusion, but they have the means to do it, and I like the QB/coach combo of Daniels and Dan Quinn for a deep sleeper.",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US President Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has reached his first Super Bowl in his first season with Seattle, whose fearsome defence is led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.\n\nRock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.\n\nBad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.\n\nThe controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.\n\nBad Bunny says he's losing sleep over the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year, but he said this year's on the west coast is \"just too far away\".\n\nAsked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added:, external \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nThere were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\nBut, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.\n\nShe added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough Sunday's game will take place at the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium is 45 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge in Santa Clara.\n\nWhile San Francisco has been the main hub during Super Bowl week, events and parties have been spread around the Bay Area, beginning with Opening Night in San Jose on Monday.\n\nActor Jon Hamm hosted the NFL's end-of-season awards night on Thursday, which was attended by Steve Irwin's son Robert, who earlier in the day took a snake into the media centre to help promote the first NFL game in Melbourne later this year.\n\nShaquille O'Neal hosted a party on Friday while Post Malone held a free concert, with artists as diverse as Olivia Dean, Shaboozey, Sting, Calvin Harris, Zach Bryan and Teddy Swims playing at other events.\n\nCardi B also performed on Saturday before watching her partner Stefon Diggs play for the Patriots on Sunday, when Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones are also among the gameday performers.\n\nOther visitors include Roger Federer, Jay-Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\n\nWahlberg's fellow New England fan Jon Bon Jovi will introduce the Patriots players on Sunday, with actor Chris Pratt, a Seattle supporter, doing the honours for the Seahawks.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

    "description": "Likely thing for them to do!",
    "fullText": "Green Day has never been part of the MAGA agenda. The California rock band has called out Donald Trump and his administration in many of their music performances, and it doesn’t look like they’re stopping any time soon.\n\nIn recent years, the band—consisting of members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool—has replaced the lyrics of their iconic hit “American Idiot.” The song, written in 2004, initially included the lyrics “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda.” Now, when performing the song live, Armstrong sings, “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” The song itself, and the titular album it was written for, was a direct criticism of George W. Bush’s administration and the Iraq war.\n\nTrump Finally Addresses Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Abduction Years After She Called His Behavior 'Crazy' at Town Hall\n\nWhite House Officially Addresses Trump & Vance Feud Rumors After Reports the President Is Prepared to 'Strike' Against the VP's 'Betrayal'\n\nArmstrong also takes a jab at Vice President JD Vance through revised lyrics of “Jesus of Suburbia.” So what’s the beef between the president and the band?\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected into office in November 2016, the band led a chant  “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” during an appearance at the American Music Awards.\n\nDuring the first days of the first Trump administration, Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram about his immigration executive orders that targeted countries with large Muslim populations: “I feel like I’m in a state of shock. The executive orders Trump is signing feels like a vendetta.. Trump is not only taking out his revenge on the people who protested him, but also the average American that just didn’t vote for him.”\n\nHe continued, “These reckless decisions on healthcare, muslim-americans, immigration, environmental protection, freedom of speech, freedom of press, women’s right to choose what to do with their bodies, suggesting sending in the feds to Chicago .. are signs of a man that is trying to redefine what it is that keeps our common union as Americans. This is not just his ‘conservative agenda.’ It’s an all out assault on our civil liberties. His intention is to divide us as Americans. Maybe we don’t agree on all of these issues.. But can’t we see eye to eye on some?”\n\nIn an interview with NME, Armstrong said that Trump supporters were mostly “uneducated white working-class people.” Armstrong added: “That’s the problem right there. There’s this white nationalism that’s been brewing under the radar for a long time. But now [Trump’s] been able to cause people to lash out and blame minorities and it’s really confusing. I mean, blatant misogyny going on at the same time.”\n\n“I’ve got family members from Oklahoma that are big Trump supporters. And there’s no clear answer on why they’re supporting him because he doesn’t even have any policies,” he continued. “How can you have an opinion about who you want for the Leader of the Free World when the guy running doesn’t have answers to any questions?”\n\nWhen the band performed in Washington D.C., Armstrong emphasized that the sentiments didn’t feel as intense or different as other concerts. “Outside of “f—k you,” not a real lot, honestly,” the lead singer told Rolling Stone. “People know how I feel. I feel like going negative is just throwing fuel on the fire. I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue. I think we’re in a crisis mode right now. For me, it’s important to get back to fundamentally what it feels like to be an American. We all come from different backgrounds, but we come together and create this world. It’s like a microcosm for the rest of the world. I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”\n\nWhen asked about their obligations in the Trump administration, Cool said, “I think we have an obligation to put on a fun show and put on a concert that’s memorable, that’s energetic and that spreads joy and open-mindedness. If being open-minded and joyful is against your political beliefs, then you know, fuck you.”\n\nIn June 2025, Armstrong shared his feelings about the president. “Donald Trump in his administration is a fascist government,” Armstrong told the crowd at Download Festival in Donington Park in the U.K. . “And it’s up to us to fight back.”\n\nGreen Day was announced as a performer in the opening ceremonies for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif., a couple of miles away from the band’s roots. When asked about whether he’ll attend the football game, Trump told reporters that he would not and then criticized the performers, which also included halftime performer Bad Bunny. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nIn their first performance of 2026, the band made their stance loud and clear with the iconic “American Idiot” line. During the performance of “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong said, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota. … Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor,” referring to the ICE raids in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of Alex Pretto and Renee Good, while the latter line is a direct reference to homeland security advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nArmstrong also added the same sentiments when the band performed at a Super Bowl pre-show hosted by Spotify and Fanduel on Friday, Feb. 6. “This goes out to all the ICE agents out there. Wherever you are: quit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have.” He added, “come on this side of the line.”\n\n“Because when this is over — and it will be over at some point in time — Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, they’re going to drop you like a bad f—king habit.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "No one was expecting year one of the Ben Johnson era to end in a Super Bowl for the Chicago Bears, but the 2025 season went better than most fans could have expected. But even so, it felt like it ended too soon. The loss in the NFC Divisional Round against the Los Angeles Rams stung because they had worked their magic again, battling back to tie the game with just 19 seconds left.\n\nA Rams three-and-out to start the overtime period, and the Bears were in position to win.\n\nThe end was disappointing, but the season truly felt like the start of something special, and 89% of of fans feel the Super Bowl window is open.\n\nBen Johnson changed the trajectory of the franchise.\n\nHis partnership with Caleb Williams had a rough start, by design, and it got better and better as the year wore on.\n\nChicago finished ninth in points scored and sixth in total offensive yards. The Bears’ top-ten finish in those two categories has occurred only three other times since 1985.\n\nIncluding his three years as offensive coordinator in Detroit, Johnson’s offense has never been out of the top ten in either of those two categories.\n\nThe arrow is pointing up on the offense, and if the Bears attack the defense this offseason as they attacked the offense last year, that side of the ball will more than hold its own in 2026.\n\nOur partners at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Bears odds to win next year’s Super Bowl at +2700.\n\nThe window may be open, but Johnson won’t take it for granted.\n\n“There is no building off of this,” Johnson said at the end of the season press conference. “We go back to square one. We’re back at the bottom again.”\n\nThis is SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the NFL.

    "fullText": "Tom Brady once found himself puzzled by a debate that resurfaced well beyond the football field.\n\nIn July 2025, the seven-time Super Bowl champion addressed comments made by golf star Scottie Scheffler about family and professional priorities, offering a perspective shaped by his own career.\n\nBrady shared his reaction in a personal reflection published on TomBrady.com, responding to the idea that being an elite athlete and a devoted family man sit in opposition.\n\nHe said, “Scottie said he’d rather be a better father and husband than a good golfer. And my question is: why are those mutually exclusive? Sure, they’re different blocks on the pyramid, but they’re part of the same pyramid.\n\n“They’re connected! For instance, I think part of being a great father is being a great example of doing what it takes to take care of your family. I chose to do it by playing football,” Brady added.\n\nAt the time, Brady’s comments stood out because they challenged a growing narrative around elite sport and sacrifice.\n\nRather than rejecting family-first values, Brady reframed the discussion. In his view, professional excellence and personal responsibility are intertwined rather than competing priorities.\n\nThe tone of the response reflected where Brady was in life then, nearing the end of his playing career and increasingly reflective about his legacy.\n\nBrady expanded on his thinking by explaining how his relentless commitment to football fit into his definition of being present for his family.\n\n“My dedication to the sport, the hours of practice, the moments when I was laser focused, those were times when I believe I was doing the best possible thing for my family and my kids.\n\n“By prioritizing my profession and teaching, by example, what it takes to be really good at your job, what it takes to follow through on commitments, what it takes to be a great teammate; and showing them, also by example, that work is a big part of all of our lives,” Brady added.\n\nThe comments offered insight into how Brady justified the demands of a two-decade career.\n\nHe viewed discipline, preparation, and consistency not as absences from family life, but as lessons delivered through action.\n\nLooking back, the exchange captured a philosophical divide rather than a disagreement. Both perspectives valued family, but differed on how professional ambition fits into that picture.\n\nAs a throwback moment, Brady’s response now reads as a snapshot of an athlete grappling with balance while still defending the path he chose.\n\nIt remains a reminder that conversations about success and family are rarely simple, even among the most accomplished figures in sport.\n\nTom Brady reveals he once took his 11-year-old son to a Super Bowl party hosted by Snoop Dogg\n\nDrake Maye has chance to match Tom Brady record, this could be his reason not to support Patriots\n\nFuture #1 overall pick Fernando Mendoza explains why he grew up idolizing Tom Brady",

Nevertheless, Brady’s lasting impact with the team over the course of his 20-year career in New England has consistently been brought to remembrance ahead of the Super Bowl on February 8.\n\nA win for Maye at Super Bowl LX will make him the second starting quarterback aside from Brady to win a championship for New England, which would draw comparisons to the former franchise great.\n\nLet’s take a look at Brady’s history in Super Bowl appearances:\n\nTom Brady is a seven-time Super Bowl champion.\n\nBrady won the Super Bowl six times (2001, 2003-04, ‘14, ‘16, ‘18) for the New England Patriots.

    "fullText": "After spending much of the first half of their existence as a forgettable also-ran, the 2000s have been considerably kinder to the Seattle Seahawks. After making the playoffs just five of their first seven seasons, Seattle has been a consistent presence in the postseason.\n\nThat hasn't led to a deluge of Super Bowl runs. In 50 seasons as a franchise, the Seahawks only have one Super Bowl win to show for it. It's a big one, however; a total dismantling of Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 48, 43-8. That's not Seattle's most memorable big game performance however — and I'm not referring to the litany of officiating complaints that followed their 2006 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe picture above lives on in sports bars across New England and in the nightmare of Seattle fans who just wanted Pete Carroll to run the dang ball. The Seahawks' last Super Bowl appearance was a dramatic 28-24 loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl 49 in February 2015. 11 years ago, Seattle faced second-and-goal with 26 seconds left. Rather than handing the ball to Marshawn Lynch, the All-Pro tailback who'd already rushed for more than 100 yards, Russell Wilson instead threw a quick slant undrafted rookie Malcolm Butler stepped in front of to effectively end the game.\n\nThis is the Seahawks' first season advancing beyond the Divisional Round since that devastating loss.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: When was the last time the Seahawks made the Super Bowl?",

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly. Just knowing him and his HC. Knowing he’s a tough kid. He was walking into a very tough QB at USC and he stayed resilient.” – Rivals National Recruiting reporter Adam Gorney\n\nSan Clemente High School, located in the coastal town of San Clemente, California, serves around 3,000 students from the city and surrounding areas, including Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. Established in 1964, the school is part of the Capistrano Unified School District and boasts a robust athletics program with a strong community presence under the motto “One Town, One Team.” The Tritons are recognized for their competitive spirit across various sports disciplines.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard. This comprehensive resource provides real-time updates and final scores from across the Golden State, ensuring you never miss a moment of the Friday night frenzy.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL is down to two: Super Bowl 60 is sure to be cinematic as the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots go head-to-head at Santa Clara’s Levi’s Stadium on Sunday.\n\nHistory is repeating itself in the most dramatic way possible. Eleven years ago, these two teams met in Super Bowl 49, a game that ended with Malcolm Butler’s legendary goal-line interception that broke Seattle’s hearts and cemented a New England dynasty. Now, over a decade later, the Seahawks finally have their chance at revenge on the very same stage.\n\nFor the Seahawks, the road back has been defined by a total cultural shift under Mike Macdonald. While the 2015 squad relied on the original Legion of Boom, this version features a \"Dark Side\" defense that led the NFL in scoring defense this season. They aren't just playing for a ring; they are playing to erase the ghost of the one-yard line.\n\nOn the other side is a Patriots team that has pulled off one of the greatest one-year turnarounds in league history. Led by second-year sensation and MVP finalist Drake Maye and head coach Mike Vrabel, New England is looking to prove that the \"Patriot Way\" didn't leave with Tom Brady.\n\nThe narrative arc of this game is anchored by Seattle's Sam Darnold, whose career resurgence has been the story of the year. From being a castoff to leading a powerhouse, Darnold now faces the franchise that famously saw him \"seeing ghosts\" years ago. Alongside NFL receiving leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the Seahawks' offense is clicking at the perfect time to challenge New England’s gritty, bend-but-don't-break defense that's let up only 26 points this postseason.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 approaches, the league prepares for a sequel 11 years in the making. Whether Seattle finally gets its redemption or New England finds another hero like Butler, this matchup is destined to reshape the legacy of both franchises.\n\nHere is everything you need to know in order to listen to Seahawks vs. Patriots on the radio.\n\nRadio station: SiriusXM channel 225 (Patriots), 226 (Seahawks), 88 (national)\n\nSeahawks radio channel: Seattle Sports Radio 710 AM, KIRO Newsradio 97.3 FM\n\nPatriots radio channel:  98.5 The Sports Hub\n\nYou can listen to Super Bowl 60 live on SiriusXM.

For Super Bowl 60, most affiliate stations within the competing teams’ networks must broadcast Westwood One's feed, with only the flagship station of each team permitted to carry its local coverage. These local feeds, however, remain accessible through SiriusXM and NFL+ (formerly Game Pass).\n\nThe national broadcast team is headlined by Kevin Harlan delivering play-by-play commentary for his 16th Super Bowl, with Hall of Famer Kurt Warner providing expert analysis. They are joined by sideline reporter Ross Tucker, while Scott Graham anchors the studio coverage for his 17th consecutive season.\n\nFor fans tuning in via the Patriots Radio Network, the game will be called by Bob Socci (play-by-play) alongside former Patriots quarterback Scott Zolak (analyst). Coverage is available on 98.5 The Sports Hub, the Patriots' flagship station, with their SiriusXM broadcast airing on Channel 225.\n\nFor Seattle Seahawks supporters, the local radio broadcast can be found on SiriusXM Channel 226.
