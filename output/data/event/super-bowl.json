    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is in 13 days, but first, the NFL draft community has plenty of time to produce mock drafts, as seven rounds of new rookies will join the big leagues in three months. And according to NFL.com, the latest and greatest theory for the Minnesota Vikings involves Toledo safety Emmanuel McNeil-Warren.\n\nMcNeil-Warren’s name is rising as a rookie safety option, and the Smith succession question may force Minnesota’s hand.\n\nMcNeil-Warren ranks 39th on the Consensus Big Board as of January 27th, but that didn’t stop Daniel Jeremiah from mock-drafting him to the purple team.\n\nA Harrison Smith replacement is on the mind of NFL.com.\n\nAt the 18th pick, Jeremiah picked McNeil-Warren for Minnesota and noted, “I’m higher on McNeil-Warren than some other people around the league, but I love his combination of size and explosive playmaking ability. He could help replace Harrison Smith if the soon-to-be 37-year-old does indeed retire.”\n\nBefore the Vikings’ pick, Jeremiah mocked Akheem Mesidor, an EDGE rusher from Miami, to the Detroit Lions, and at No. 19, Arizona State wideout Jordan Tyson landed with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nNaturally, as you will see in every mock draft, Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza went No. 1 overall to the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nMcNeil-Warren is 6’2″ and 202 pounds with 4.5 speed. He’s got the size. The Toledo Rocket is known for forcing turnovers, which the Vikings could obviously use in 2026 and beyond. He also has the length, burst, and ability worthy of the 1st Round, though general managers often don’t consider safeties as premium assets, like cornerbacks.\n\nNFL Draft Buzz on McNeil-Warren: “His combination of length, improving instincts, and proven ability to generate game-changing plays positions him as the type of safety who could thrive in a role-specific capacity early before expanding his responsibilities.”\n\n“The modern NFL’s emphasis on versatile defensive backs who can match up with tight ends and provide run support from depth aligns perfectly with his skill set, though defensive coordinators will need patience developing his deep coverage reliability. His ceiling depends heavily on continued refinement of his anticipation and pattern recognition – the mental processing that separates good college safeties from NFL starters.”\n\nAnother Toledo defensive back took off after being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024: cornerback Quinyon Mitchell.\n\nNBD added on McNeill-Warren, “The flashes are there, particularly his pick-six against Western Kentucky that demonstrated his growth reading quarterback intentions, but consistency remains elusive. Teams running primarily split-safety coverages where he can work from depth and leverage his closing speed downhill would maximize his immediate impact while minimizing exposure to his weaknesses in isolated deep coverage situations.”\n\n“While he may never become an elite single-high free safety, McNeil-Warren possesses the tools and competitive drive to carve out a decade-long career as a valuable chess piece in creative defensive schemes that value versatility and playmaking over pure coverage ability.”\n\nThe Job Lewis Cine Should’ve Filled\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Vikings shouldn’t need safety right now. The here and now was supposed to be the time that 2022 1st-Rounder Lewis Cine entered his prime. But after Cine broke his leg as a rookie and never gained his footing in the defense thereafter, Minnesota dropped Cine a couple of offseasons ago, one of the worst busts in Vikings history.\n\nCine now plays in the UFL, along with high-round 2022 draft mate, cornerback Andrew Booth.\n\nHad general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah hit on Cine, he would not have to entertain a high-round draft pick on a safety like McNeill-Warren. That’s why draft busts are so impactful and damning.\n\nNot So Fast on Smith’s Retirement?\n\nMinnesota extended defensive coordinator Brian Flores’s contract last week, nominating him for a return in 2026. And while fans had a going-away party for Harrison Smith a few weeks ago in Week 18, a source told VikingsTerritory last weekend that Smith’s retirement is not a foregone conclusion. The 36-year-old has a “hard time walking away,” per the source, and Flores’s renewal with the Vikings could lure Smith back for Year No. 15.\n\nIf that happens, the Vikings would still need an eventual Smith replacement, but it may not be in the 1st Round of the NFL draft. The team would basically buy itself another year.\n\nFinal note: safeties are usually pretty easy to find in free agency. If Minnesota doesn’t prefer the draft for a safety, about 10 startable options will be available on the open market in March. Players like Kamren Curl (Los Angeles Rams) and Jalen Thompson (Arizona Cardinals) will be available in six weeks if their current teams don’t renew their contracts.",

    "description": "While the Seattle Seahawks will be playing their fourth Super Bowl on February 8 against the New England Patriots, the responsibility to prepare the team for the big game will be upon head coach Mike Macdonald. However, the 38-year-old is only in his second season as a head coach.",
    "fullText": "While the Seattle Seahawks will be playing their fourth Super Bowl on February 8 against the New England Patriots, the responsibility to prepare the team for the big game will be upon head coach Mike Macdonald. However, the 38-year-old is only in his second season as a head coach. So it’s fair to wonder: where will Macdonald turn for advice when preparing for a Super Bowl?\n\nNot surprisingly, Mike Macdonald recently announced that he will turn to John Harbaugh, his former Baltimore Ravens mentor, for consultation regarding the high-stakes game.\n\n“I haven’t talked to John [Harbaugh] yet, but at some point probably will [consult him],” Mike Macdonald said while addressing the media on January 26.\n\nMike Macdonald spent eight seasons working under John Harbaugh in Baltimore. It was in 2014 that Macdonald started working as an intern under Harbaugh.\n\nThen, in 2022 and 2023, he was promoted to work as the Ravens’ defensive coordinator. So, obviously, the majority of what Macdonald knows about coaching in the NFL comes from the knowledge he gained from Harbaugh.\n\nInterestingly, Mike Macdonald joined the Ravens after their only Super Bowl appearance under Harbaugh back in 2012. That year, Harbaugh led Baltimore to a dramatic 34-31 win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. Over 18 seasons, he guided the Ravens to 12 playoff appearances and six AFC North title wins.\n\nBut after another missed playoff run this past season, Baltimore decided it was time for a change with Lamar Jackson still in place as the franchise quarterback. So, earlier this month, the Ravens fired Harbaugh after wrapping up an 8-9 season. But Harbaugh didn’t stay hanging for long.\n\nJust days after leaving Baltimore, John Harbaugh landed a new head coaching job with the New York Giants. At 63, his coaching experience and his 180-113 regular-season record with Baltimore clearly played a major role in the Giants giving him a five-year deal. Harbaugh’s experience could also help Mike Macdonald significantly, since he will become the third-youngest HC in Super Bowl history, after Mike Tomlin and Sean McVay.\n\nFor now, Seattle’s HC revealed that he has barely dipped his toes into game-planning for the Super Bowl matchup. Macdonald mentioned that he’s watched only about five plays of Patriots tape so far. But he also made it clear that he doesn’t want to overcomplicate things or change what’s been working for Seattle.\n\n“I think one of the differences between how we’ve run our program this year and the last few years is we don’t have a ‘Hey, this is the Super Bowl handbook,’” Mike Macdonald said. “This is how you handle all the things.’ Our mentality is, ‘Hey, look, we’re all in this together going into this experience, and this is how we want to take it day by day and kind of get through all these hurdles, so to speak.’ Those guys will be right along there for the ride and leading the charge.”\n\nMacdonald further stressed that the process stays the same in Seattle, win or lose. But even if the mindset doesn’t change, the Seahawks’ schedule certainly does.\n\nAfter beating the Rams, the Seahawks now have two weeks to prepare before facing the Patriots in Santa Clara. When a reporter asked Mike Macdonald what the team’s schedule would look like after the NFC Championship win, his answer revealed that the Seahawks will first take a breath before ramping things up again.\n\n“The guys are going to be off,” Mike Macdonald said. “Well, they are in today for some logistic stuff. We just kind of put last night’s game to bed. Got food trucks out there, which is exciting. Off for a couple of days, and then we’ll start like a normal cadence on Thursday. I believe we are travelling on Sunday.”\n\nThat short break could be crucial, especially when you look at Seattle’s injury situation. The biggest question mark remains over Seattle’s quarterback, Sam Darnold, who dealt with an oblique injury leading up to the NFC title game. Even though there won’t be any official injury reports from the Seahawks until next week, Mike Macdonald shared an update on Darnold’s injury coming off Sunday night’s win.\n\n“I don’t know what the trajectory is, how many reps he’s [Darnold] going to need, or how much he’s going to want to take,” Macdonald said. “I don’t know that yet.”\n\nSam Darnold, of course, looked anything but limited during the NFC title clash. He threw for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns in a back-and-forth win over the Rams. But it remains uncertain whether Darnold will be able to practice fully this week or next week in Santa Clara. For now, the Seahawks are trying to balance rest, recovery, and preparation in the days leading up to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe post Mike Macdonald Announces John Harbaugh Decision After Confirming Seahawks’ Schedule appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Seahawks defense ranks 6th all-time in advanced metrics ahead of Super Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne advanced metric places the 2025–26 Seattle Seahawks defense among the greatest units in NFL history. That metric is DVOA, which stands for “Defense-adjusted Value Over Average.”\n\nDVOA measures a team’s efficiency by comparing the success of every single play to a league average, adjusted for situation and quality of opponent. In simpler terms, it evaluates how good a team truly is while accounting for context — down, distance, game situation, and who they’re playing.\n\nAaron Schatz, the chief analytics officer of FTN Fantasy and the creator of DVOA, recently shared a list of the best defenses by the metric dating back to 1978. Including playoff performances, this year’s Seahawks defense ranks sixth all-time in DVOA — a remarkable achievement considering the volume of elite units over the past four decades.\n\nHere's where the #Seahawks stand among the top teams in DVOA history, including the playoffs. Regular-season ratings are also included. pic.twitter.com/q9MEUiju83\n\n— Aaron Schatz 🏈 (@ASchatzNFL) January 26, 2026\n\nMORE: Report: Rams, Seahawks coaches nearly came to blows in elevator\n\nThe only defenses ranked ahead of Seattle are some of the most legendary teams the league has ever seen:\n\n1991–92 Washington Commanders — Super Bowl champions\n\n1985–86 Chicago Bears — Super Bowl champions and the iconic “Super Bowl Shuffle” team\n\n2007–08 New England Patriots — lost the Super Bowl to Eli Manning and the Giants after an undefeated regular season\n\n1989–90 San Francisco 49ers — Super Bowl champions following a dominant 55–10 victory\n\n1996–97 Green Bay Packers — led by Reggie White and Super Bowl winners\n\nJust behind Seattle at No. 7 are the 2023–24 Baltimore Ravens, who fell to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC championship. The defensive coordinator for that Ravens team? Current Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald, adding another layer of intrigue to Seattle’s historic ranking.\n\nMORE: Seahawks fans will love these 11 Super Bowl predictions from ESPN\n\nTo cement their place in NFL lore, the Seahawks still have one final hurdle: Super Bowl Sunday. Standing in their way are the Patriots, a franchise back on the league’s biggest stage just a few years removed from a two-decade run of dominance. New England boasts one of the NFL’s most explosive offenses and an MVP candidate at quarterback in Drake Maye.\n\nIf Seattle’s defense can slow down offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels’ attack and deliver one more elite performance, it will not just bring a Lombardi Trophy — it could elevate this unit into the top five defenses of all time.\n\nHow Seahawks could end up trading Sam Darnold this offseason despite Super Bowl appearance\n\nWill Sam Darnold get an extension this offseason?

    "description": "With the NFL Playoffs in the books and the Super Bowl on the horizon, Scott Pianowski takes a look at a quintet of players who have boosted their stock.",
    "fullText": "The fantasy football season effectively ended a month ago, but it’s important to scout the NFL playoff games as potential clues for 2026 value. Today, let’s discuss some players who have improved their stock since it got cold, be it with late-December rallies or impressive showings in the postseason.\n\nGive Mike Vrabel credit for not mothballing Stevenson after some early-season fumbling issues. The Patriots hitched up to Stevenson in the playoffs, giving him 45 touches the last two weeks, including 25 in the AFC Championship win over the Broncos. He currently has 194 rushing yards for the playoffs, tops in the NFL.\n\nMeanwhile, TreVeyon Henderson saw just three opportunities (three forgettable runs) in the victory at Denver. Henderson was the home-run hitter in this backfield most of the year, with Stevenson the steady grinder; come playoff time, the Pats have leaned into the grinder. And Stevenson was trusted much \n\nFigure on Stevenson getting a bell cow workload in the Super Bowl, and earning the higher ADP in next summer’s draft season.\n\nEveryone remembers his “hello world” moment, the 6-118-2 detonation at Cincinnati, including the game-winning touchdown. But the Bears didn’t completely hand Loveland the keys to the kingdom until after Christmas. He absorbed 48 targets over his final four games (including the playoffs), good for a 28-378-2 log.\n\nThis is going to push Loveland into pricy areas for next year’s fantasy drafts, but I’m here for it. Caleb Williams is also on the escalator and Ben Johnson is the right man with the play sheet.\n\nSean McVay usually employs a very narrow offense for fantasy purposes, relying on just a handful of skill players. But that tree expanded during the 2025 season, with Corum starting to become a proactive complement to starting RB Kyren Williams. Corum was the team’s most effective back in Sunday’s loss at Seattle (12 touches, 79 scrimmage yards), and he received double-digit touches in six of his final eight games. Corum also had six touchdowns on the year, with five of them coming after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Rams haven’t soured on Williams and he’ll be the clear starter entering 2026. But Corum probably has 8-12 touch equity in any game where he’s healthy, and he’ll shoot past that projection every now and then, if the Rams want to steer into a hot hand. Corum is on the flex radar for 2026 fantasy planning, and he’s just one injury away from being a needle mover, too.\n\nI don’t know how to quit this guy. Mims was an afterthought for most of the year but he was forced into action during the playoffs, coming through with a nifty 12-155-1 line on 14 targets. I get it, the Broncos have a crowded receiver room, and Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant are still ascending talents. But let’s not forget that Mims will only be 24 next year, too. Mims has already scored 11 regular-season touchdowns despite limited opportunities, and he’s dynamic as a kick returner. He’s screaming for a bigger role.\n\nJust making the NFL as an undrafted receiver out of Holy Cross is a big win for Coker, but he’s not content to stop there. He stepped forward in his final six starts, posting a 28-378-4 log, including that 134-yard explosion against the Rams. Coker has good size and the ability to high point the ball, which gives him the potential to score 8-10 touchdowns in a full season, even with Tetairoa McMillan already on the team. Coker will be a trendy fantasy sleeper next summer, but I’ll still try to get a seat near the front of that bandwagon.",

    "description": "The Seattle Seahawks will face off against the New England Patriots in the 2026 Super Bowl on Feb. 8",
    "fullText": "After winning their respective conference championship games on Jan. 25, the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots punched their tickets to Super Bowl LX\n\nThe NFL championship game will take place on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nGreen Day, Charlie Puth and Bad Bunny will take the Super Bowl 2026 stage\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots are set to face off in football's biggest showdown.\n\nHeld on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., the 2026 Super Bowl will not only crown this year's NFL champion but also mark 60 years since the first game was played. To commemorate the milestone, Green Day will deliver a special opening performance before the teams take center stage, ushering generations of Super Bowl MVPs onto the field.\n\n“Celebrating 60 years of Super Bowl history with Green Day as a hometown band, while honoring the NFL legends who’ve helped define this sport, is an incredibly powerful way to kick off Super Bowl LX,” Tim Tubito, the league’s senior director of event and game presentation, told the Associated Press in January 2026.\n\nThough fans are amped for the 2026 Super Bowl's musical stars — which also include Charlie Puth and Bad Bunny — the main act will be on the field.\n\nPatriots quarterback Drake Maye will lead the team back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, giving the franchise a chance at its seventh title and its first without Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. On the other side, Seattle returns to the Super Bowl with Sam Darnold at the helm, looking to secure its second Lombardi Trophy after winning its first in 2014.\n\nHere's everything to know about the 2026 Super Bowl, including the full performance lineup.\n\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026.\n\nThis year's NFL championship game will be held at Levi's Stadium, home to the San Francisco 49ers, in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nWhile the Patriots' last Super Bowl appearance was a win in 2019, the Seahawks' last championship game was in 2015 — when they lost 28-24 against the Patriots. The Seahawks have previously made three total appearances in the Super Bowl — 2006, 2014 and 2015 — and won once, in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriots have made 11 appearances in the Super Bowl — more than any other team — and won six games. If they win in February, they will have the most ever wins in Super Bowl history.\n\nWhile all six wins have previously taken place during Brady and Belichick's era, Maye emphasized the team’s fresh chapter after the Patriots beat the Denver Broncos 10-7 at the AFC Championship game on Jan. 25.\n\n“It’s a new team, it’s a new era,” he told Boston.com. “I respect and appreciate what the Patriots dynasty did, and unfortunately they didn’t come out with some wins here, but we changed that narrative and look forward to bringing our best football for [the Super Bowl].”\n\nIn September 2025, the NFL announced that Bad Bunny (born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) would perform at the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show. The \"MONACO\" rapper shared his excitement about the honor in a statement at the time.\n\n“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,\" he explained. \"It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nFans will also be treated to a lineup of killer performances before the game even starts. Green Day will kick off the events with an opening ceremony to \"welcome the MVPs who’ve shaped the game and open the night for fans all over the world,\" frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said in a statement.\n\nAfter that, Puth will sing the national anthem, followed by 11-time Grammy winner Brandi Carlile performing \"America the Beautiful.\" Coco Jones will also give a rendition of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" to close out the pregame ceremony.\n\nAccording to the NFL, the 2026 Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET / 3:30 p.m. PT. Green Day's opening ceremony performance will start airing a half-hour earlier at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT.\n\nThose who aren't catching the game live in California can watch it broadcast on NBC and Telemundo, per the NFL. Fans can also tune in on the NFL app or stream the game on Peacock.",

    "fullText": "DeMarcus Lawrence’s brutally honest assessment of his Super Bowl chances with the Dallas Cowboys has resurfaced after Seattle booked its place in Super Bowl 60.\n\nWhat once sounded like resignation has now become a defining statement, as Lawrence’s belief about Dallas and championship ceilings aligns perfectly with how his career path ultimately unfolded.\n\nSpeaking candidly, DeMarcus Lawrence did not shy away from addressing his time with the Cowboys and what he believed it meant for his championship hopes.\n\n“Change of scenery is always good, but Dallas is my home. Made my home there, my family lives there,” Lawrence said in 2025.\n\nHe added: “I’m forever gonna be there, but I know for sure I’m not going to win a Super Bowl there. So yeah, we here.”\n\nLawrence spent the core of his NFL career with the Cowboys after being selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft. He became one of the franchise’s defensive pillars, earning multiple Pro Bowl selections and consistently leading the team in sacks.\n\nDespite regular playoff appearances, Dallas failed to reach a Super Bowl during Lawrence’s tenure. Postseason exits, often in the divisional round, defined the era, reinforcing Lawrence’s view that something was missing despite the talent on the roster.\n\nThat perspective now looks prophetic following Seattle’s NFC Championship victory, which secured the Seahawks a place in Super Bowl 60.\n\nLawrence’s move brought him into a system that quickly capitalized on postseason opportunities, something that never materialized during his years in Dallas. The contrast between the two experiences has sharpened the impact of his earlier remarks.\n\nWhile Lawrence has always spoken fondly of the Cowboys and his life in Dallas, his statement was never about bitterness. It was about outcomes, and those outcomes have now validated his belief.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 approaches, Lawrence stands on the sport’s biggest stage, with his words no longer sounding controversial but instead, remarkably accurate.\n\nSeattle Seahawks’ reaching Super Bowl is surprisingly related to Popes of Vatican City\n\nSeahawks give major health update on Sam Darnold amid NFC Championship game preparations\n\nTom Brady told Seattle Seahawks star he ‘could have used’ him at University of Michigan",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl 60 is poised to deliver a compelling rematch as the New England Patriots prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe highly anticipated clash, featuring two formidable defences, a second-year head coach against a seasoned veteran, and a pair of quarterbacks with contrasting journeys, is scheduled for 8 February at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe Patriots, led by quarterback Drake Maye and coach Mike Vrabel, are making their first Super Bowl appearance since Tom Brady and Bill Belichick secured their sixth championship seven years ago.\n\nNew England, now seeking a record seventh Super Bowl victory, earned their spot by defeating the Denver Broncos 10-7 in the AFC Championship game, marking their 12th trip to the NFL’s showpiece event.\n\nMaye, a finalist for AP NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year, scored a crucial 6-yard touchdown run in Denver after a critical turnover by Jarrett Stidham.\n\nDespite playing through a snowstorm, Maye managed 86 passing yards and 65 rushing yards. \"The Pats are back, baby,\" Maye declared. \"Now, gotta win one.\"\n\nOn the opposing side, Sam Darnold, now with his fifth team, has guided the Seahawks to their fourth Super Bowl appearance, as they chase their second Lombardi Trophy.\n\nUnder coach Mike Macdonald, Seattle secured their place with a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC title game. Darnold delivered one of his finest performances, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns without a single turnover.\n\nAddressing his critics, Darnold stated: \"That doesn’t matter to me. I just come to work every single day with these guys. These guys in the locker room, that’s what it’s about to me, man. The way we’ve come to work ever since April in OTAs, training camp, one day at a time and we’re here. We did it.\"\n\nThis upcoming Super Bowl revives memories of an unforgettable climax 11 years ago, when Brady’s Patriots overcame Russell Wilson’s Seahawks 28-24.\n\nThat game, on 1 February 2015, saw Brady throw four touchdown passes, rallying New England from a 10-point deficit, before Malcolm Butler’s iconic interception at the 1-yard line sealed the victory.\n\nSeattle fans still debate the decision not to hand the ball to Marshawn Lynch in that pivotal moment.\n\nVrabel, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker in the 2000s, has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround, transforming the team from a 4-13 record last year to 14-3 this season.\n\nHe aims to become the first person to win a Super Bowl as both a player and head coach for the same franchise. \"I can’t tell you how proud I am to be associated with these guys and this organisation,\" said Vrabel, a finalist for AP NFL Coach of the Year.\n\n\"I won’t win it. It’ll be the players that’ll win the game, I promise you. It won’t be me that’ll win it and I promise you I’ll do everything that I can and our staff to have them ready for the game.\"\n\nMacdonald, meanwhile, reflected on his team’s journey: \"We did not care,\" he said about being underdogs. \"It’s about us. It’s always been about us and what we do and now we’re going to the Super Bowl.\"\n\nMaye, at 23, will become the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl, behind only Dan Marino, and the fourth second-year quarterback in the past seven years to lead his team to the final.\n\nThe Patriots, with a 6-5 record in Super Bowls, are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most victories.\n\nTheir return to the top follows a challenging period, with only one winning season after Brady's departure in 2020.\n\nNew England's playoff run has been characterised by a potent defence, allowing just 26 points across three games, an average of 8.7 points per game – a feat only surpassed by the 2000 Ravens in the lead-up to a Super Bowl.\n\nTheir offence, however, has averaged just 18 points per game, the fewest by any Super Bowl bound team since the 1979 Rams.\n\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

Coach Mike Macdonald’s suffocating defense allowed the fewest points in the NFL during the regular season and their offense, led by 28-year-old QB Sam Darnold, doesn’t lag far behind, scoring the third most points in the league.\n\nWhile Patriots fans might remember Darnold from his infamous “I’m seeing ghosts” moment on Monday Night Football in 2019, the former Jets quarterback has transformed himself into a legitimate leading man as he completed 67.7 percent of his passes for 4,048 yards, 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during the regular season. He has yet to throw a postseason interception.\n\nPatriots QB Drake Maye led the league with a 72% completion percentage in the regular season but New England’s offense has gotten bogged down in their three postseason games against three high-powered defenses as the sophomore QB has taken 15 sacks, fumbled six times (losing three) and tossed two INTs.\n\nFirst-year head coach Mike Vrabel has had the Patriots’ defense playing with fire, as the former New England LB has overhauled a group that ranked near the bottom of the league last year into a unit that has averaged less than 9 points per game allowed in the playoffs.\n\nSuper Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET on February 8.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "Why NFL fans believe 'script writers' predicted Super Bowl 60 matchup with preseason graphic originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor a few years, there existed a conspiracy theory that the colors of the Super Bowl logo predicted which two teams would play for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWell, that one is out, and a new theory is in.\n\nSome NFL fans believe a preseason graphic the league posted to its social media accounts actually predicted the seemingly unpredictable Super Bowl 60 matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, two teams that hadn't won a playoff game since 2019 before this season.\n\nHere's a look at the graphic behind the NFL's newest \"script writer\" conspiracy theory.\n\nMORE:Super Bowl 60 odds, spread as Seahawks open as favorites\n\nAfter the Patriots and Seahawks punched their ticket to the Super Bowl, fans started to notice which two quarterbacks seem to be closer to the giant Lombardi Trophy than the rest in this graphic posted by the NFL on the first day of the regular season:\n\n— RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) January 26, 2026\n\nA closer inspection reveals you can make the case Baker Mayfield was actually closer than Darnold, or that Travis Hunter seems to be the closest to the trophy.\n\nThis is no time for facts, though. NFL fans have unearthed the latest grand Super Bowl conspiracy, and it's true that Maye and Darnold were both front and center in relation to the Lombardi Trophy in the graphic just as they are in reality today.\n\n\"They really gave us the script in September,\" the lead Drake Maye fan account tweeted Sunday night.\n\nThey really gave us the script in September https://t.co/ofeVgBdbPb\n\n— Drake Maye Lover (@drakemayeloverr) January 26, 2026\n\nAnother look at the graphic reveals the NFL probably believed a Patriots-Seahawks Super Bowl was enormously unlikely. The sport's biggest names are front-and-center, from Saquon Barkley and Patrick Mahomes to Brock Purdy and Joe Burrow. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are also closer to Mahomes and Barkley than they are to Maye and Darnold in the distance.\n\nConsidering players from the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans are standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder with Maye and Darnold in the distance, it seems more like the league discounted the Patriots and Seahawks than predicted their Super Bowl 60 meeting.\n\nWhy let the finer details get in the way of a good conspiracy theory, though?\n\nSeahawks take down Rams to advance to Super Bowl 60\n\nSam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba star for Seahawks in NFC championship\n\nRams' special teams blunders continue in NFC championship\n\nSeahawks Pope trend continues with Super Bowl 60 berth",

The QB offered a blunt update while opening up about health and personal challenges.\n\n“Not really, I think, I’ve actually talked to my teammates about this, but I think we, middle of the season, week nine or ten, I think it might have been a bigger problem,” he said, via ESPN‘s Brady Henderson’s post on X. “But with all the reps that we’ve accumulated throughout the season and throughout training camp, OTAs, all that stuff, I wasn’t really concerned about timing or anything like that on certain reps.”\n\nSam Darnold also spoke about playing through injury for a second straight week. He said he felt good physically and didn’t view it as a major setback.\n\n“It’s almost poetic for Cougar Cup the way that one does,” he said.\n\nThis is developing news. Stay tuned.\n\nThe post Sam Darnold Shares Blunt Health Update as Seahawks QB Addresses Personal Struggles Before Super Bowl appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Matthew Stafford was brilliant. Sean McVay was a maestro. And yet, the Los Angeles Rams' season of labor evaporated in a cascade of margins in Seattle.",
    "fullText": "SEATTLE — What happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes it dry up like a raisin in the incessant, mocking Seattle cold?\n\nDoes it fester like a wound, salted by the sting of a single yard, a single catch, a single decision in the cruel calculus of a championship game?\n\nOr does it simply sag, a heavy weight on the shoulders of 53 men in blue and gold, as the opposing confetti falls like an alien, hateful snow?\n\nFor the Los Angeles Rams, the dream of a return to the summit, of completing a masterful two-year reconstruction, was deferred, denied, and finally extinguished in a 31-27 NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIt was a defeat scripted not by a lack of talent or heart, but by the finest of margins—the slivers of error that separate confetti from emptiness.\n\nMatthew Stafford was majestic; he was MVP-esque.\n\nHe carved the NFL's top-ranked scoring defense with the precision of a neurosurgeon, completing 22 of 35 passes for 374 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe threw darts into pinholes, launching seven completions for 226 yards on passes that traveled 20+ air yards—the most surrendered by Seattle in a decade.\n\n\"He's the MVP of the league,\" head coach Sean McVay said. \"This guy played at a level that's just different.\"\n\nMcVay himself called a luminous game, his play-action designs rendering Seattle's fierce pass rush a step slow, generating 208 yards from deception alone.\n\nFor long stretches, the Rams' offense was a symphony of synchronized beauty. Puka Nacua, who had nine receptions for 165 yards and a touchdown, was a force of nature.\n\nDavante Adams turned back the clock with four receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown.\n\nYet, the symphony ended flat, missing its final, crucial notes.\n\nFootball games, particularly championship games, are won in the margins.\n\nYou win by capitalizing on every opportunity to extend a lead, especially before halftime, not surrendering it.\n\nLeading 13-10 with 1:33 left in the second quarter, the Rams' offense went three-and-out, a puny, passive series that gifted Seattle 54 seconds.\n\nSam Darnold—the maligned, the itinerant, the USC quarterback whose marred legacy, built by ghastly, past collapses—marched the Seahawks 79 yards in six plays.\n\nA touchdown. A 17-13 deficit. A tide turned.\n\n\"We had our chances,\" McVay said. \"I thought we got a lot of what we wanted today.\"\n\nXavier Smith, reliable all year, let the slick ball slip through his grasp in the third quarter. One play later, Darnold found Jake Bobo for a 17-yard score.\n\nA potential stop became an 11-point hole.\n\n\"That was a tough one,\" McVay said. \"You feel like you're going to get some good momentum… and then they score on the very first play.\"\n\nThe margins are a fourth-down calculus.\n\nTrailing 31-27 with 4:52 left, the Rams faced 4th and 4 at the Seattle 6-yard line.\n\nA field goal makes it a one-point game; however, analytics screamed to go for it.\n\nMcVay, the modern evangelist of aggression, listened.\n\nDevon Witherspoon deflected Stafford's pass for Terrence Ferguson, and the Rams walked away with nothing.\n\nAnd so, the dream of an opportunity to hoist the Lombardi Trophy for the third time in nine years––is deferred.\n\nNow, the questions hang in the Los Angeles air, thick and urgent.\n\nWhere do the Rams go from here?\n\nHow do they bolster a secondary that proved porous over the season's latter half, a unit torched for 153 yards by Jaxon Smith-Njigba alone?\n\nHow do they reinforce a linebacking corps that, at times, was outmatched in coverage and containment?\n\nThe labor to craft this contender was Herculean. There is no assurance of a return.\n\nThe NFC landscape offers no solace.\n\nSeattle, with Mike Macdonald's defensive genius, has the makings of a sustained beast.\n\nChicago's offense buds with terrifying potential.\n\nPhiladelphia simmers, a quarterback adjustment away.\n\nSan Francisco, if it can ever stanch its injury plague, remains a monster.\n\nAnd on the other side stood Sam Darnold.\n\nEveryone must now rewrite the narrative of his career—that he folds and crumples under pressure.\n\nDarnold completed 25 of 36 for 346 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe stood resolute, becoming the first USC quarterback to start a Super Bowl.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Darnold said. \"To be able to do it with these guys… that's why it means the world to me.\"\n\nIn the Rams' silent locker room, the dream lay not exploded, but deflated.\n\nStafford's brilliance, McVay's mastery—both rendered artifacts of a path not taken.\n\nLangston Hughes' poem asks what happens to a dream deferred.\n\nOn this night, the Rams live the answer: it doesn't explode. It just slowly, painfully, drains away, leaving only the hard questions of an endless offseason and the haunting vision of what might have been, one yard, one catch, one decision away.",

Their 12 appearances are already a record.\n\nThe Steelers also have six Lombardi Trophies, with their most recent one coming during the 2008 campaign.

The Patriots have reached four Super Bowls and won two during that time.\n\nWhile New England has NFL history at stake, so does its head coach, Mike Vrabel. A three-time Super Bowl champ with the Patriots as a player, he has a chance to become the first person in NFL history to win a Super Bowl as a player and a coach with the same franchise.\n\nTo do that, they’ll have to go through the Seattle Seahawks, who are out for revenge after narrowly losing their last Super Bowl appearance to New England on Malcolm Butler’s goal-line interception 11 years ago. The Seahawks will have to overcome that painful history along with Sam Darnold’s embarrassing 0-4 career record against the Patriots.\n\nDarnold will need to step up against New England’s historically good defense, which is averaging just 8.7 points per game allowed in these playoffs. Meanwhile, the Patriots have already beaten three elite defenses this postseason, so there’s no reason they can’t defeat another.\n\nSam Darnold’s Mind‑Boggling Stat Vs.

    "fullText": "Kenneth Walker III, Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead list of Big Ten stars in Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots has a chance to be one of the best in recent memory. As such, it is a prime opportunity for some former Big Ten stars to show out on one of the biggest stages in sports.\n\nMore specifically, among the Seahawks, four former Big Ten players stand out, each with a uniquely different path to where they are today. Those would be Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, cornerback Devon Witherspoon and quarterback Sam Darnold.\n\nFor those who may have forgotten, Smith-Njigba was a one-man show at Ohio State with an electrifying offensive presence around him. In 2021, he had a breakout season for the Buckeyes with 1,606 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, Walker III was as reliable as ever on Michigan State teams that were a far cry from what fans in the mid-2010s were used to. In his one season with Michigan State before heading off to the NFL, he scored 19 total touchdowns\n\nMORE: Jaxon Smith-Njigba joins elite club with absurd record in Seahawks-Rams NFC Championship\n\nNow he's duplicating his collegiate success in the NFLas he scored a touchdown in Sunday's NFC Championship en route to a 31-27 win against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSignaling out the many accolades that make Darnold one of the NFL's best comeback stories in recent memory, the fact that he is the first-ever ex-USC Trojan set to start a Super Bowl is truly remarkable.\n\nConcerning Witherspoon, it just goes to show that Illinois coach Bret Bielema's model of \"sustained success\" and wearing the developmental program mantra with pride is what makes Witherspoon's success story as memorable as ever.\n\nIn fact, he may just be the unsung hero who put the Seahawks in a position to win to begin with.\n\nNonetheless, all four stars are just four of a select few that will have a chance to make their mark on NFL history for years to come.\n\nMORE: Why Fernando Mendoza would be 'so grateful' to be selected by 'any team' in NFL draft\n\nIn 12 days, we'll see how far they come.\n\nCurt Cignetti says what every college football fan can agree on fresh off Indiana's title\n\nBret Bielema rips AP voters after Illinois football was shelved over Big Ten team it beat\n\nCollege football analyst rips those in denial of Curt Cignetti's, Indiana's success\n\nCollege football pundit shares shocking Ohio State football ranking amid 2026 off-season",

It was tough to move the ball downfield for both offenses with the snow pouring from the sky at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium. The Patriots recorded only 206 total yards of offense, while the Broncos only mustered 181 total yards.\n\nThe rushing attack was a major factor for the Patriots on a day when throwing the ball in the elements proved difficult. They recorded 141 yards on the ground, including a six-yard rushing touchdown from Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.\n\nThe difference in the game ended up being the turnover the Patriots forced on Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham, who fumbled a backwards pass while being hit by linebacker Christian Elliss. That play put the Patriots in the red zone and set up the touchdown run by Maye.\n\nOverall, Maye went 10-of-21 passing for 86 yards, along with rushing 10 times for 65 yards and one touchdown.

Vrabel will be the second person ever to coach and play in a Super Bowl for the same team.\n\nVrabel joins Gary Kubiak as the only coach who has reached a Super Bowl with the same team as both a coach and a player. If the Patriots win the Super Bowl, Vrabel will be the first person in history to win a Super Bowl as a coach and player for the same franchise.\n\nTom Flores, Mike Ditka, Tony Dungy and Doug Pederson are the only people to win a Super Bowl as both a player and a coach, but none did so with the same team. Vrabel won three Super Bowls as a player, and in his first year as a head coach with the Patriots, he has taken them to the Super Bowl.\n\nVrabel is the eighth coach in history to lead a team to the Super Bowl in his first year with the team. He joins Kubiak, Jim Caldwell, Jon Gruden, Bill Callahan, George Seifert, Red Miller and Don McCafferty.\n\nThe Patriots were 4-13 last season, and in Vrabel’s first season, they went 14-3, won the AFC East and clinched the No. 2 seed in the AFC. It is the Patriots’ first Super Bowl appearance since the 2018 season, when they defeated the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nVrabel is a finalist for Coach of the Year. He won Coach of the Year in 2021 with the Tennessee Titans. He went to the AFC Championship in 2019 with the Titans. As a player, he was a Pro Bowler and First-Team All-Pro.\n\nAlthough Vrabel was a linebacker, he caught 12 touchdowns in his career in the regular season and playoffs combined. He also had 66 sacks, 24 forced fumbles and 851 tackles between the regular season and playoffs in his career.\n\nPatriots’ Drake Maye Joins Elite QB Company After Beating Broncos",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nA year after Milton Williams sacked Patrick Mahomes twice in the Super Bowl, he is heading back.\n\nWilliams and the New England Patriots punched their ticket to Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, and the high-priced free agent addition is someone the team can lean on as it prepares to navigate a long two weeks before the big game.\n\nAfter the Patriots won a low-scoring AFC championship game over the Denver Broncos, Williams had a parting shot for a Broncos offensive line some consider to be the best in the NFL.\n\nHere's a look at what Williams said as he left the field in Denver.\n\nPatriots punch ticket to Super Bowl for first time in six years\n\nDrake Maye's rushing attack makes up for lackluster passing game\n\nJarrett Stidham can't overcome snowy Denver conditions in AFC championship loss\n\nAfter the Patriots finished off a snowy 10-7 win over the Broncos, Williams took a shot at Denver's offensive line. \"No. 1 offensive line can kiss my a—,\" Williams said as he walked through the tunnel.\n\nMilton Williams walked through the tunnel and said, “No. 1 offensive line can kiss my ass.”\n\n— Mark Daniels (@ByMarkDaniels) January 25, 2026\n\nWilliams didn't record a sack on Sunday, but the Patriots sacked Jarrett Stidham three times, and the former Eagles defensive lineman was one of two New England defenders to record multiple quarterback hits in the win.\n\nThe Broncos' offensive line was ranked No. 1 in the NFL by Pro Football Focus at the end of the regular season. Tackle Garett Bolles and guard Quinn Meinerz both earned First-Team All-Pro selections, and the return of center Luke Wattenberg was expected to solidify the unit on Sunday.\n\nDenver allowed two fewer sacks than New England, but Williams and the Patriots had the last laugh after shutting the Broncos out in the second half to capture an AFC championship on the road.\n\nEarlier in the week, Williams rubbed some Broncos fans the wrong way when he was asked what he knew about Stidham.\n\n\"I ain't gonna lie, nothing. We're gonna watch the tape on him and figure out what he like to do. But no. They didn't like him over the Bo, so,\" Williams said.\n\nSome interpreted Williams' response as simple honesty, as the Patriots had never had a reason to prepare for Stidham before Nix's injury, but others saw the comment as an underestimation of the Broncos' backup quarterback.\n\nIf Denver interpreted Williams' remarks as bulletin board material, it didn't make much of a difference in the end.\n\nBest pictures in the snow from Patriots' win in Denver blizzard\n\n3 Sean Payton calls that came back to bite Broncos\n\nHow weather negatively impacted AFC championship game\n\nPatriots take advantage of controversial Drake Maye 'tush push' play",

And despite the challenging wintry environment and natural atmospheric challenges that accompany a trip to Empower Field at Mile High, the Patriots took care of business for their 17th victory of the season, returning to the Super Bowl for the first time since capturing Super Bowl LIII at the close of the 2018 season.\n\nThe Super Bowl appearance for the Patriots puts the cherry on top of a remarkable season that has gone better for the organization than any of their fans – or really anyone who follows the league – could have imagined. The Patriots are coming off back-to-back four-win seasons and are in their first season under the leadership of head coach Mike Vrabel, who previously captured three Super Bowls as a player with the franchise.\n\nThe Patriots will face the winner of the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, as the NFC West Divisional Rivals battle in a rubber match on Sunday night in the NFC Championship Game after splitting their first two games of the year.

    "description": "The Denver Broncos are in prime shape roster building-wise with the pre-draft circuit already kicking into gear.",
    "fullText": "Later this afternoon, the Denver Broncos will host the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game. The winner will represent the AFC in Super Bowl 60. Without question, it’s the biggest game the Broncos have played in a decade.\n\nAll of us certainly hope that Denver’s magical season continues. The shot at earning the franchise’s fourth Lombardi Trophy is the ultimate goal today. But if things go sideways, the Broncos will head to offseason mode figuring out what needs to be done in order to better prepare themselves next season.\n\nTwo avenues of pursuit will be available for Denver to accomplish that. The first will be free agency. The Broncos are slated to have around $27 million in cap space. However, simple moves and restructures could nearly double that amount if they so choose. I would expect the franchise to find a way to continue to build around Bo Nix and make some big investments, especially since there is no more dead money from Russell Wilson’s contract on the books for next season.\n\nThe next would be the draft. In fact, the pre-draft circuit is already in full swing. The East-West Shrine Bowl will take place on Tuesday with a contingent of Broncos scouts and evaluators present. Thereafter, personnel from across the league will travel to Mobile, Alabama for this year’s Senior Bowl that takes place on January 31st. Before you know it, the NFL Combine will be here in late February with the 2026 NFL Draft capping it all off at the end of April.\n\nNo matter the outcome of today’s game is, Broncos Country should be thrilled with how the team has performed this season. They have proven they are capable of being a Super Bowl contender. But guess what? They are in a great position to solidify their roster and have a chance to do the same in the coming years.\n\nChampionship Sunday. 🤩\n\nIT'S GAMEDAY IN THE MILE HIGH CITY.#ClimbHigher x #NEvsDEN pic.twitter.com/4CYecR3Bkx\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 25, 2026\n\nThe Broncos currently have five picks in the first four rounds. That puts them in an addition to address needs on their roster. If Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph is hired away to be a Head Coach elsewhere, Denver would receive an additional third-round selection in both the 2026 and 2027 NFL Draft. There are still multiple coaching positions available. For a while, Joseph was considered the front-runner for the Arizona Cardinals’ opening. Things seem to have quieted on that front, but you never know.\n\nHowever, there is also a possibility that the Broncos consider wheeling and dealing for some extra selections by the time the draft rolls around. Pending the outcome of the games today, the Broncos will be slated to pick no higher than 29th in the ‘26 NFL Draft. While they certainly may love a player who is on the board at that point in time, it would not be a surprise to see them trade out of the first round and acquire more Day 2 selections to address any glaring issues. General Manager George Paton has proven to be a wheeler-and-dealer when it comes to picks.\n\nAs of now, I’d like to see them focus on fortifying their trenches. Both the offensive and defensive lines could use some talent added to them. They have a great group of players already but given the age and contract status of several of their key starters—I believe that should be a priority. Head Coach Sean Payton has always discussed the importance of building from the inside-out. I expect that is something we will see happen again this offseason.\n\nThe Broncos are clearly one of the best franchises in the NFL. They have a storied history and have accomplished a lot of great things. Very few teams across the league can say that much. Over the past several seasons, Denver has got back to their winning ways. There is no doubt players across the league are taking notice.\n\nOn top of that, their new ownership group is proving to be magnificent. They are doing whatever it takes to improve the team’s culture and performance. They are making significant investments across the board that other franchises simply aren’t capable of doing. We have witnessed new ownership and the front office being diligent in rewarding and extending in-house players who have performed at a high level and exemplify what it means to be a Bronco.\n\nThose are just a few reasons I think Denver will be able to make some big splashes during free agency. They have certainly impressed this season. However, there are a few glaring areas [running back, inside linebacker, etc.] that need to be addressed for them to continue to be successful in the coming seasons. And those aforementioned position groups have a lot of talented players hitting the market in March.\n\nWhat do you think, Broncos Country? Do you think Denver is geared up to have an eventful offseason? What are some moves you would like to see happen? Let me know in the comments section. (P.S., expect to see some Senior Bowl related Broncos content over the next week!)",

The 23-year-old quarterback is also an MVP finalist after completing 72 percent of his passes for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns.\n\nCapturing a Lombardi Trophy could help establish Maye as one of the league’s premier signal-callers. When asked how good he could become during CBS’s pre-game coverage of the AFC Championship Game, former Pro Bowl offensive lineman Kyle Long declared that the sky is the limit.\n\n“There is no ceiling,” Long said. “From a physical standpoint, from a personality standpoint, from a toughness standpoint, he checks all the boxes.”\n\nMaye endured an uneven rookie campaign for the 4-13 Patriots, but they’ve reversed that record behind an improved roster. Long celebrated Maye’s maturation alongside a bolstered supporting cast and praised the North Carolina native’s humility.\n\n“He’s proved it all season long,” Long added. “He’s unbelievably accurate, but I think the thing that stands out the most … his personality. He’s got an ‘Aw shucks’ about him.”\n\nMaye has been far from perfect this postseason, losing three of six fumbles and throwing an interception in each game. However, he also averaged 9.2 yards per pass attempt in a 16-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three touchdowns against the Houston Texans’ No. 1-ranked defense in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nSurviving another stout Broncos defense could help Maye quickly stamp his place in Patriots lore and continue his ascension to superstardom.\n\nHow Patriots Would Make NFL History With AFC Championship Game Win Vs.

    "title": "From Rams star to sommelier: Vince Ferragamo turned football lessons into life achievements",
    "description": "Vince Ferragamo was the first quarterback to lead the Rams to the Super Bowl, a feat that continues to be a source of pride and motivation for the longtime SoCal resident.",
    "fullText": "The sixth in an occasional series of profiles on Southern California athletes who have flourished in their post-playing careers.\n\nIt’s been nearly four decades since Vince Ferragamo took his last NFL snap and most of his football exploits have been eclipsed by the passage of time.\n\nThe 509 passing yards he had in a 1982 loss to the Chicago Bears, most in an NFL game in 31 years? It’s been bettered 14 times. The club-record 30 passing touchdowns in 1980? That’s now seventh on the team’s single-season list.\n\nBut there’s one milestone no man, not even Father Time, can ever take away from Ferragamo. At the end of the 1979 season, he became the first quarterback to take the Rams to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe team has returned to the NFL championship game four times since then. A Rams’ win over the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday's conference title game will keep alive Matthew Stafford’s chance to become the first quarterback in franchise history to win the Super Bowl twice.\n\nFerragamo, however, got them there first.\n\n“There was just something so mystical about the whole thing,” says Ferragamo, who made his first NFL start that season.\n\nHe competes in a different arena now, managing a mortgage company and an eponymous real estate firm. He and his wife, Jodi, have helped raise millions for a variety of local charities and they also grow the grapes for their boutique wine label on 230 vines next to their home in central Orange County. The transition from the gridiron to the regular grind has been seamless.\n\n“Football prepares you for life beyond football,” he said. “More than anything it adds credibility to my work. They have to trust you. We’ve built our whole company around that.”\n\nFerragamo’s football career also depended on earning trust. Although he was tall and blessed with a strong right arm, Ferragamo had to win over critics everywhere he played, beginning in high school where he had to convince his brother, the coach, he should start.\n\nAfter two years at Cal, where he had to share playing time, Ferragamo transferred to Nebraska and became an All-American. Yet the Rams waited five picks and four rounds before selecting him in the 1977 draft, then handed him a clipboard and told him to find a spot on the bench.\n\n“There was a lot of trials and tribulations. A lot of ups and downs,” Ferragamo said. “But I think it teaches how to live life that way. Because every day you wake up with struggle.”\n\nYet for one glorious two-month stretch in the winter of 1979-80, the struggle was over and Ferragamo was arguably the best quarterback in the NFL, engineering one of the most improbable playoff runs in Rams history.\n\nAfter starter Pat Haden was injured and rookie backup Jeff Rutledge proved ineffective, Ferragamo took over a team with a losing record. He was supposed to just finish out the season; instead, he carried the Rams to four consecutive victories.\n\nHe led the Rams to road playoff wins over Dallas and Tampa Bay, the first time in franchise history the Rams had won two playoff games in the same season.\n\n“He began to show us that he had the arm to make the plays,” said Hall of Fame offensive tackle Jackie Slater, Ferragamo’s longtime teammate. “That’s when everybody began to rally to give the young guy as much support as we possibly could.\n\n“Everybody kicked it up a notch. And that’s what makes a good quarterback right? His leadership brings that out of you, makes you all a little bit better than you might have been without him.”\n\nIn the Super Bowl, played before nearly 104,000 people at the Rose Bowl — still the largest crowd to attend a Super Bowl — Ferragamo had the Rams leading heading into the fourth quarter before the Pittsburgh Steelers rallied to claim their fourth championship.\n\nHe won just one more playoff game, retiring seven years later following a career that took him to four cities and two countries — but just one Super Bowl.\n\n“I don’t really have any regrets when I look back on my career,” Ferragamo, 71, said earlier this month, surrounded by football memorabilia in his second-floor corner office in Anaheim Hills. “If everything was just carte blanche and just easy for you, it wouldn’t be worth living. So there’s always a challenge.\n\n“The ups and downs, maybe that’s what kept me going.”\n\nFerragamo, the youngest of four children, grew up in Wilmington, which was a gritty, working-class city in the 1960s, much as it is today. His father, Vince Sr., a World War II veteran who dropped out of the school in the eighth grade, was street smart and tough, working his way up to union president of UAW local 923 at Ford’s sprawling Pico Rivera plant.\n\n“He was a great role model for me,” Ferragamo remembered. “We were the only Italian family in the neighborhood. It was, you know, tough, tough beginnings. It makes you desire and appreciate things and help others.”\n\n“That’s what football is,” he added. “If I can help my receiver look good, we all look good.”\n\nAnd Ferragamo certainly looked good when he threw a football.\n\n“When he was about 14 years old, he’d go out in the front of the house and he’d throw the ball from one light pole to another. It’s a long way,” said Chris Ferragamo, Vince’s eldest brother and his coach and Banning High.\n\n“He loved doing that kind of stuff. That’s how he started his throwing ability.”\n\nStill, Chris, who would go on to win eight City Section titles at Banning, already had a quarterback when Vince joined the team as a sophomore, so he wasn’t about to hand him the starting job just because they were brothers.\n\n“People thought it was a cake walk. And it wasn’t,” Vince said.\n\n“He never wanted to play me. The other coaches said, ‘Hey, you’re crazy. You’ve got to play him. He’s better than the other guys.'\"\n\nSo Chris Ferragamo said he talked his returning quarterback into moving to wide receiver and Vince went on to become a high school all-American and the City Section player of the year, eventually earning induction into the California High School Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThat earned him a scholarship to Cal, where he played 22 games in two seasons, throwing nearly twice as many interceptions as touchdown passes. The Bears were placed on NCAA probation shortly after Ferragamo enrolled and when he found himself sharing time with Steve Bartkowski at quarterback, Ferragamo transferred to Nebraska and proved himself again, leading the Cornhuskers to a 10-2 record in 1975 and the No. 1 spot in the AP preseason poll a year later.\n\nThe critics weren’t convinced, so Ferragamo fell to the fourth round of the NFL draft where he was the 91st player — and fourth quarterback — selected.\n\n“Basically he had to prove himself every place he went,” Chris Ferragamo said. “He always did.”\n\nPlaying behind Haden and an aging Joe Namath, Ferragamo threw just 15 times as a rookie for a team that lost in the first round of the playoffs. A year later, as Haden's backup, he threw just a few more passes, the last in a one-sided loss to the Cowboys in the NFC championship game.\n\nFerragamo finally got his chance late in 1979. With the Rams struggling at 5-6 and Haden out because of an injured finger on his throwing hand, coach Ray Malavasi turned to Ferragamo, who lost just one of seven starts to get the Rams to their first Super Bowl.\n\n“We knew Vince had a good, strong arm. And we knew he hadn’t played a lot of NFL games,” Slater said. “So I think that everybody just kind of relaxed and said that we’ve got to help this young guy be successful. Let’s just make sure we do our jobs and then hopefully our quarterback position won’t be a liability.\n\n“And that’s kind of the way it worked out.”\n\nThe play that sealed Ferragamo’s status as the team’s new leader came with just over two minutes remaining in a first-round playoff game in Dallas. With the Rams trailing 19-14, Ferragamo threaded a pass to Billy Waddy, who was surrounded by six Cowboys. Waddy escaped the pack to score on the 50-yard play, Ferragamo’s third touchdown of the game and one he described as “a spiritual pass, one that was guided from up above.”\n\nThe almighty apparently abandoned the Rams three weeks later when they twice blew leads in a 31-19 loss to Pittsburgh in the Super Bowl. Ferragamo had played well, throwing for 212 yards, although a late interception set up the Steelers’ final touchdown.\n\nStill, the Rams had established themselves as one of the top teams in the NFL. They had made seven consecutive playoff appearances and just two of their starters were over 30. With the 26-year-old Ferragamo taking over at quarterback, the team looked primed to become a perennial Super Bowl contender.\n\n“We felt like it was going to be a good team for a long time,” Slater said.\n\nInstead, the Rams won just five playoff games over the next 19 years and didn't return to the Super Bowl until the 1999 season, their fifth year in St. Louis.\n\n“They dismantled the team after our Super Bowl run, which was unfortunate for the L.A. fans,” Ferragamo said. “They had something in place that could have really been great.”\n\nFerragamo’s honeymoon was even shorter. After a spectacular post-Super Bowl season in which he set franchise records by throwing for 3,199 yards and 30 touchdowns, Ferragamo sought a raise from the $52,000 he earned in 1980, the lowest pay for a starting quarterback in the NFL. The Rams reportedly countered with a $250,000 offer during the season, then sweetened that by another $75,000 afterward.\n\nBut Ferragamo, angry that the team hadn’t given him a new deal after the Super Bowl, turned them down and jumped to the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League, who offered a four-year deal worth about $2 million. That’s when things started to go off the rails.\n\nA classic drop-back passer, Ferragamo wasn’t suited to the Canadian game, which put a premium on quarterback mobility. As a result, he threw just seven touchdown passes and was intercepted a league-high 25 times, eventually losing the starting job as Montreal stumbled to a 3-13 season.\n\nTeam owner Nelson Skalbania, an engineer and businessman from Vancouver, had an even worse year, first dissolving his company, then declaring bankruptcy, which forced him to return the team to league after one season. Ferragamo, whose contract was not guaranteed, was suddenly unemployed.\n\n“I went from the Super Bowl back to the bottom,” he said.\n\nHe also went back to the Rams, who signed him to a series of one-year contracts valued at approximately $300,000. Over the next three seasons he lost more games than he won and threw more interceptions than touchdown passes before moving on to Buffalo, which had the worst record in the NFL in his only season there.\n\nHis final three games came in a mop-up role for a Green Bay team that went 4-12 in 1986. At 32, his football career was over. But his second act was just beginning.\n\nJodi Scarpello was a freshman journalism major at Nebraska when a high school friend introduced her to a transfer student from California. The introduction wasn’t necessary since football was a religion in Lincoln and everyone knew about the handsome quarterback who had come over from Berkeley.\n\n“I knew what he was doing there,” Scarpello said. “I knew football when I met him.”\n\nThree years later, after Ferragamo had graduated to the NFL, the couple married and a passion for football became something they shared.\n\n“I used to watch game film. We just watched at home on a reel-to-reel projector,” Jodi said. “I used to sit at games and call plays and people would think ‘how do you know that?’ I’m a good student.”\n\nBeing the wife of a Super Bowl quarterback had other perks as well.\n\n“I met, at a charity banquet in Washington D.C., and had a conversation with Coretta Scott King,” she said. “We just talked about our children. But in my head I was thinking ‘Oh my God, that is really cool!’\n\n“We got to do a lot of traveling and that kind of stuff. It’s pretty amazing, some of the things we were able to do.”\n\nThere were also drawbacks. Unlike today, when wives and children are invited on to the field and sometimes into the locker room, in Ferragamo’s day teams maintained a distance between players and their families.\n\n“When Vince was playing, he left on Friday and I didn’t talk to him until he got back on Sunday night,” Jodi said. “He got hurt one time in Buffalo and he’s rolling around on the ground. He keeps holding his arm. Maybe it’s his hand. I’m thinking, I’m not going to know.”\n\nWhen it all came to an end after that dismal season in Green Bay, the Ferragamos still had more than half their lives ahead of them — yet they were facing a life without football for the first time. Vince had never done anything but play football. Now he would have to learn to live without it.\n\nSo he called an audible and less than a year after retiring, he had a real estate license; eight years later he had his own real estate company. He would later add a mortgage fund.\n\n“When I retired, I said ‘what am I going to do’,” remembered Ferragamo. “A lot of guys, when they get out of football they fall on hard times. But I was able to transfer into another field. I also did some investing while I was playing, which was smart. I had some money that could help get me through the transition.”\n\nThe couple, married 47 years, also had three children — all daughters, Cara, Venessa and Jenna, which proved to be a blessing, their mother said, since none would feel pressured to follow their father into football.\n\n“If they were playing now they could probably go play flag football,” Jodi Ferragamo said. “I think it was probably better not to have those kind of comparisons. And they’re all successful in their own way.”\n\nBut if selling real estate paid the bills, wine would become Ferragamo’s new passion.\n\nWith his football money he had purchased an acre lot in a largely equestrian community in central Orange Park Acres converted a horse corral on the property into a vineyard and became a self-taught winemaker, producing award-winning Italian Super Tuscan-style blends. He also became a certified sommelier and lecturer who teaches a community education course on the art and science of winemaking.\n\n“I’m Italian,” he said. “I love all wines.”\n\nThe Ferragamos also created a foundation and have supported multiple causes, ranging from the Special Olympics, Boys & Girls Club and the Alzheimer’s Assn., to the Ronald McDonald House and the Orange Coast Medical Center, where a wing has been named in recognition of the Ferragamo Foundation’s contributions to the fight against breast cancer.\n\nBut football isn’t totally in the rear-view mirror. Ferragamo still attends a couple of Rams games each season, runs a flag football league for grade-school kids and co-hosts the weekly sports-talk show “On Point Live” with Slater.\n\n“He hasn’t changed. He’s still Vince,” said Slater, who has known Ferragamo since his rookie season. “He’s a confident guy, smart guy. And he’s very competitive. So he’s the same guy.\n\n“Kind of laid back. Family guy. Just loves the game of football.”\n\nThe ex-teammates remain close even though Slater says he almost got Ferragamo killed in the quarterback’s penultimate season with the Rams.\n\n“I got beat clean,” the hulking right tackle said. “My old high school nemesis, Ben Williams from the Buffalo Bills, beat me and Vince was standing there about to throw and he just put his helmet right in the middle of his back. Oh, it was an ugly thing to see.\n\n“Blood comes flying out of his mouth. I don’t how he bloodied his mouth when he got hit in the back.”\n\nThat, Ferragamo admits, wasn’t exactly the most memorable moment of his career. Asked to chose the highlight of those 10 years, he leans back in his chair, folds him arms across his chest and thinks for a moment before settling on the obvious answer.\n\n“It’s probably the Super Bowl,” he says, “and leading up to the Super Bowl.”\n\nAfter all he was the first Rams quarterback to get that far, a distinction he’ll own forever.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Random thoughts while waiting on the release of the new Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThe sight of Cubs star Pete-Crow Armstrong and Bears star Caleb Williams hanging out together at the Blackhawks and Bulls games was a nice way to portray Chicago as the biggest small town in America. Los Angeles has its Hollywood culture and New York is the media center of the world, but nowhere are the local sports stars as big a deal as they are in Chicago.\n\nIt’s nothing new, of course. Chicago’s stars have always supported each other. When the Bears played at Wrigley Field, Bobby Hull was a season ticket holder, and Billy Williams used to get tickets for games from Bears receiver Dick Gordon.\n\nThe budding bromance of Crow-Armstrong and Williams should last a long time, or at least until the Cubs and Bears sign them to massive deals.\n\nOne of the primary requisites of the job of commissioner of a major sports league should be the ability to project strength. But the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball are all weaklings, as evidenced by a report from The Athletic that Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and Rob Manfred will meet with President Donald Trump to help promote America 250, a celebration of the country’s 250th birthday.\n\nWhile Trump’s jackboots instill fear in Minneapolis, Chicago and other American cities, and he embarrasses the country on the international stage, these four pretend leaders will be posing for photo-ops in the Oval Office and pretending all is right with the country. None of them has the courage to speak out against what’s happening in America.\n\nLucky for them, they’re only beholden to the billionaire owners of their league’s teams, not the average fans who support their respective sports.\n\nESPN’s Pat McAfee has always appealed to the lowest common denominator, so it’s no surprise the clueless commentator is taking on unidentified media members who point out his lame frat boy act, calling them “fat … lazy nerds” on his TV show.\n\nMcAfee also tweeted that sports journalists “hate what sports are for people (happiness). They hate what sports are for society (unifier) … they’re political journalists by nature who’ve preyed on sports because they saw it as an easier path to ‘make it.’ Their days are numbered … my show being broadcasted on ESPN 10 hours a week with ZERO creative say from any ‘journalism school’ puppets is living proof of that.”\n\nActually, the audience of McAfee’s show is relatively tiny, or else it would be in a better time slot than in the early afternoon, when everyone else is working. He’s already wearing thin on college football fans, and sooner or later the ratings will slide and ESPN will pull the plug and send him off to UFC analysis, where he belongs.\n\nIllinois is having another stellar season, thanks to a deep team led by freshman Keaton Wagler. The 11th-ranked Illini are 17-3 after Saturday’s 88-82 road win over Purdue and in contention for the Big Ten title.\n\nAnd when the Illini are winning, coach Brad Underwood is at his most ornery, as when he recently sparred with an Illinois reporter who praised Tomislav Ivišić for a good game against Northwestern despite what he called an “up-and-down season.”\n\n“You guys say he’s been up and down,” Underwood shot back. “I just say his role changed. You guys create more damn narratives that are full of (bleep). That’s what he does. That’s why he’s been on draft boards. He’s big and can shoot the cover off of it. … No one has ever doubted Tommy.”\n\nLove him or hate him, Underwood is never afraid to speak his mind.\n\nKudos to White Sox general manager Chris Getz for immediately spending the $20 million he saved by dumping Luis Robert Jr.’s contract, signing reliever Seranthony Dominguez to a two-year, $20 million deal. Now maybe he can move Grant Taylor into the rotation where he belongs.\n\nMike Berman was a professional and a hardworking sports reporter willing to work long hours at NBC-5. A Glenbrook North alumnus who grew up rooting for Chicago teams, he did his job for 10 years without calling attention to himself. His work spoke for itself.\n\nBerman, who was let go by the station last week, deserved a better fate. Hopefully he winds up on another local station that will appreciate his work ethic.\n\nTerry Boers, who died Friday at age 75, was remembered by most as a radio host and an original member of The Score. But he was also a great newspaperman. Boers and I competed on the Illini basketball beat for one season back in the early 1990s, when he was still at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was as good a beat writer as there was and handed me my lunch on many occasions.\n\nBoers eventually found his way to radio, where he could put his brash personality into his job. He became a legend at WSCR-AM 670, along with the other originals such as Mike North, Tom Shaer and Dan McNeil. There will never be another quite like Boers, which is why his death has brought so many tributes from colleagues.\n\nCubs manager Craig Counsell is a Green Bay Packers fan, but he assured the media he is not a Bears hater. “Look, I grew up a Packers fan for sure,” he said before the Cubs Convention. “The Bears have struggled for a while, and so when a team hasn’t done well for a whole and starts to do well, you see what it does to a city. You feel it. That part of me knows what it’s doing for the city, and you root for that a little bit.”\n\nAsked who would be booed \n\nIt’s a tough call, but my guess is Counsell is still Public Enemy No. 1 among cheeseheads.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold can make USC history. Other Trojans will play huge roles as they all try to make the Super Bowl",
    "fullText": "We are one week closer to the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. This weekend will determine which two teams will make it to the Super Bowl. In both games, the former USC Trojans will play a huge factor and have their fingerprints all over games with the Super Bowl up for grabs. Sam Darnold not only has his legacy on the line, but also a chance to represent his alma mater for the first time on the NFL's biggest stage.\n\nHere are my predictions for championship weekend in the NFL:\n\nSam Darnold and the Seahawks will enter the biggest game in recent memory for the former NFC juggernaut. This time around, they enter with a defense similar to the Legion of Boom but an offense that is more well-rounded. Seattle has looked miles ahead of the other playoff teams left. I think the Rams will give them a challenge and this game will come down to the last drive, but Seattle has proven themselves to be the better team between the two teams in this matchup. They can blowout teams, they can win close, low-score games, and they can win shootouts. I think this game, Sam Darnold, and the Seahawks offense will have to be at its best, but I think Darnold will deliver the best quarterback performance in this matchup. Seattle will move on and represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.\n\nMany might gift wrap this win to the Patriots with Bo Nix being out for the rest of the season, but I disagree. I think the Patriots come out on top, but they will have to work for this game. The Broncos' defense will need former USC Trojan Talanoa Hufanga to fly around and make plays all day. The Patriots' offense has struggled to keep Drake Maye upright in each of their playoff games. Maye has been sacked 5 times. That is where the Broncos' defense specializes. Their defensive line can get after their quarterback like no other. The Broncos' defense will keep them in this game; it will come down to whether or not he can put together his best Nick Foles impression. I think he will play well, but not well enough to win this football game. I think he will come up short late and throw a costly interception, and Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel will iron out this victory in a low-scoring defensive battle.\n\nI think Sam Darnold saves his biggest performance for the game right before the Super Bowl. Darnold squeaked by Stafford and the Rams in the last meeting between the two teams in an overtime win. Darnold will have to play exactly like he did down the stretch in that game to get the victory in this one. I think Darnold reaches 300 yards through the air, and he and Jaxon Smith-Njigba light up the Rams' secondary. This secondary has given up their fair share of big games to their opponent. This game will be no different. Jaxon Smith-Njigba will have over 100 yards receiving, and he will connect with Sam Darnold for two touchdowns in this game. I think Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba have the two biggest performances in the NFC Championship game.\n\nIn the AFC, I think pass rusher Nik Bonitto has the most dominant performance. The Patriots have given up 5 sacks in each of their playoff games. In the last game versus the Texans, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. combined for 5 sacks. Bonitto this season had 14 sacks. I think he will have 3 sacks in this game and disrupt Drake Maye all game long.\n\nI think defensive tackle Milton Williams will also have himself a big game and disrupt the Broncos on the other end. Williams has been a huge reason for the Patriots' defensive turnaround, and he was great all regular season long. He creates pressure from the interior with the best of them, and he is a great run stopper. I think he will lead this Patriots defensive line to make the Broncos one-dimensional and take out their run game. Williams will also lead the Patriots in sacks with two. Verus the Chargers, Williams had two sacks, and against the Texans, he was an irritant all game long, forcing the pick 6 that took the momentum away from Houston initially. I think Milton Williams will use all of that to have his best playoff game with the Patriots and help send his team to the Super Bowl.\n\nMy Super Bowl matchup prediction is the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots have had quite the Super Bowl run vs tough defenses, but they still will not be prepared for the Seahawks' defense. Mike Macdonald and the Seahawks defense will make it a tough day for young star quarterback Drake Maye. I think his age and inexperience will come back to bite him in this match. I think Rashid Shaheed will pay homage to Devin Hester and take the opening kickoff back for a touchdown, setting the tone for the entire game. I think Darnold will not have to do much to be the top quarterback on the field, but he still will put up a respectable performance. Seattle will play their last complete performance of the season, getting their Super Bowl victory. Darnold will look to be greedy and not just settle for being the first Trojan quarterback to start in the Super Bowl, but he will also become the first Trojan quarterback to win a Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Predictions for USC on championship weekend in NFL playoffs",

    "fullText": "Falcons listed as best landing spot for Super Bowl-winning quarterback originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe quarterback position in Atlanta is a bit up in the air right now. Michael Penix is the team’s QB of the future, but he might not be ready for the start of the 2026 season after suffering a torn ACL in November.\n\nThe Falcons also have veteran Kirk Cousins on the roster, but they could look to release him in a cost-cutting move in the coming weeks.\n\nIf they do move on from Cousins, they would need to identify another quarterback who could potentially serve as a starter in Penix’s absence and then shift to a reserve role. That’s where Joe Flacco could come in.\n\nIn a recent article, Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report listed the Falcons as the best landing spot for Flacco, citing his relationship with new head coach Kevin Stefanski and ability to effectively operate as a fill-in starter.\n\n“If the Falcons don't retain Cousins as veteran insurance, Flacco would be the perfect alternative. Stefanski and Flacco helped take the Browns to the playoffs in 2023, and the pair could likely get Atlanta off to a hot start if Penix isn't ready to go when the season opens,” Knox wrote.\n\n“The Falcons don't quite have the receiving corps that the Bengals have, but Flacco would probably find success alongside Drake London, Bijan Robinson, and Kyle Pitts—assuming Pitts is retained in free agency.”\n\nFlacco would certainly be cheaper than Cousins, and even thought he’s 41 years old, he’s demonstrated that he can still run an offense at a high level.\n\nIn 13 games – and 10 starts – split between Cleveland and Cincinnati last season, Flacco threw for 2,479 yards and 13 touchdowns, compared to just four interceptions.\n\nFirst, the Falcons have to figure out what they want to do with Cousins. If they do decide to move on from him, Flacco could actually make a lot of sense as a replacement.\n\nCarolina Panthers predicted to land top edge rusher in free agency\n\nBaltimore Ravens predicted to cut ties with All-Pro defender\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles predicted to make quarterback trade over offseason\n\nPittsburgh Steelers urged to avoid veteran quarterback in free agency",

    "title": "Fact Check: Don't fall for rumor Jalen Hurts established Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund",
    "description": "According to the rumor, the NFL's 2025 Super Bowl MVP donated $300,000 of his own money as a way of kick-starting the special fund.",
    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund — in honor of the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis in January 2026 —and contributed $300,000.\n\nIn January 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund. Users' posts claimed the NFL's Super Bowl LIX MVP kickstarted the fund himself, contributing $300,000 of his own money.\n\nThe purported scholarship fund referenced Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident shot fatally shot on Jan. 7 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 20, a user managing the NFL Pulse Facebook page posted (archived) an image collage of three pictures allegedly showing Hurts hugging Good's 6-year-old son on a football field, Good holding her son in front of a body of water and Hurts walking inside a football stadium. The post's text claimed Good's killing inspired Hurts to launch the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, including the $300,000 contribution.\n\nIn short, the rumor was false. One or more users fabricated and promoted the claim with the help of images and text generated with artificial-intelligence tools.\n\nSnopes contacted a manager of the NFL Pulse Facebook page to ask about the fictional stories and AI-generated content displayed on the feed, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles to request an official statement, and will update this story if we receive more information.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post (archived) — as well as other Facebook posts sharing the same rumor — featured links leading to advertisement-filled articles hosted on WordPress blogs. The users owning those blogs earned revenue based on the combination of advertising and made-up stories. The NFL Pulse post redirected to an article on on such untrustworthy website.\n\nSearches of Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google found no news media outlets reporting about Hurts establishing a scholarship fund in Good's name. A Yahoo search did, however, mistakenly produce an AI-generated answer wrongly confirming the rumor as true. Outlets would have widely reported on the story involving Hurts and Good, had it truly occurred.\n\nRegarding the fake, AI-generated photo of Hurts holding Good's son, the most evident sign of AI — aside from the misspelling of \"Eagles\" as \"Eaglees\" — was the reality that sports and standard news outlets would have very widely publicized the moment, had the meeting between the quarterback and young boy truly taken place.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post's text, presented in its entirety later in this article, featured over-dramatic wording common with AI tools. For example, one part of the post read, \"This was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\" Additionally, the idea that individuals or teams aiming to rapidly produce inauthentic content for ad revenue would carefully, slowly and manually write text for their articles simply does not square with reality.\n\nThe person or people who authored the story about Hurts and Good fabricated the entire claim as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted celebrities and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. Such stories resemble glurge, which Dictionary.com defines as stories \"that are supposed to be true and uplifting, but which are often fabricated and sentimental.\"\n\nFor readers interested in the story told in the NFL Pulse Facebook post, the post presented the made-up tale as follows:\n\nJalen Hurts has officially established The Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, personally committing an initial $300,000 donation to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good — a mother whose story ended in tragedy after she was killed in Minneapolis, a loss that left an entire community grieving.\n\nBut this gesture goes far beyond a financial contribution.\n\nJalen Hurts founded the scholarship fund himself to ensure that Renee's 6-year-old son will receive full educational support from elementary school through college — including tuition, books, tutoring, and opportunities for personal development. Alongside the financial commitment, Jalen also dedicated his voice, his platform, and his heart to a child now facing a world without his mother.\n\nThis was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\n\nAcross the nation, many were moved not by the amount of money pledged, but by the meaning behind Jalen's decision: a promise that Renee Nicole Good's life mattered, and that her son's future will be protected, supported, and filled with hope.\n\nFor further reading, we previously reported about the time tech billionaire Elon Musk deleted a post supporting the Eagles supporting the Eagles after they lost the 2023 Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\"GLURGE Definition & Meaning.\" Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/glurge.\n\nHuberman, Bond, and David Emery. \"Snopestionary: What Does 'Glurge' Mean?\" Snopes, 21 Aug. 2021, https://www.snopes.com//articles/363643/what-does-glurge-mean/.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Davante Adams reached the NFC championship game four times during his eight seasons with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.\n\nEvery time, Green Bay came up just short of the Super Bowl — and Adams still feels the pain.\n\n“It just feels almost like a mythical thing to me at this point,” Adams said Wednesday. “You do everything you can to get there, and it’s been so hard. Been working so hard at it.”\n\nAfter an ensuing three years spent nowhere near a Super Bowl, Adams is back for his fifth shot when his Los Angeles Rams (14-5) visit the Seattle Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for another NFC title game.\n\nThe 33-year-old Adams is still going strong as the league leader in touchdown receptions and a key component of the NFL's top offense. But when the decorated receiver says he craves that final, ultimate team success far more than individual accolades, it's clear he's among the rare athletes who absolutely mean it.\n\n“Forgive me if I’m not smiling ear-to-ear after the first win or the second (playoff) win, having been here so many times and understanding what it takes to get where we’re ultimately trying to go,” Adams said. “We’re close, and we’ve just got to finish it off.”\n\nAlthough Adams has been waiting the longest, he's far from the only Rams player who will be playing for a chance at a Super Bowl debut when they face the top-seeded Seahawks for the third time this season.\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a championship four seasons ago, but only a handful of players are left from that team — just two on defense.\n\nMatthew Stafford, tight end Tyler Higbee and cornerback Darious Williams are the only players left who made major contributions to that Super Bowl title run and also played extensively for the current team. Williams left and returned to the Rams, as did linebacker Troy Reeder and center Coleman Shelton.\n\nReeder now plays mostly special teams, while Shelton and starting left tackle Alaric Jackson were backups in 2021. Receiver Tutu Atwell was injured as a rookie and right tackle Rob Havenstein is injured now.\n\nBut nobody has been waiting longer than Adams for his first shot at a championship ring. He is one of the most consistent receivers of his generation, posting eight seasons with at least 997 yards while moving up to 26th in NFL history with 12,633 yards.\n\nHe almost certainly would have recorded another 1,000-yard season with Los Angeles, but Adams injured his hamstring in December. The Rams fell out of the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC during his three-game absence to close the regular season, most notably blowing a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in Seattle.\n\nAdams has been vocal about the rejuvenating effect of working with Stafford and McVay, but he also knows his career is closer to its end than its beginning. After struggling along with his entire offense during an OT victory last week at Chicago, he's hoping to play a major role in what's likely to be a career-defining game in Seattle.\n\n“I started off with a great experience with the Packers and didn’t have anything else to compare it to, so you kind of, in a sense, take it for granted,” Adams said. \"I don’t think I was taking it for granted, but you go to a situation where you struggle a little bit \n\n“Being back in a position where you’re with a great team and a great situation, you definitely have a greater appreciation for times like this, for sure.”\n\nNOTES: The Rams only held a walkthrough practice at their training complex. ... LB Byron Young (knee soreness) wouldn't have practiced if the Rams had a full workout, McVay said. But Young, the Rams' sacks leader, is still expected to play Sunday. ... S Quentin Lake stayed home with an illness.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Rams escaped Sunday night with a 20-17 overtime win over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of the playoffs to move on and play in the NFC Championship Game.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams escaped Sunday night with a 20-17 overtime win over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of the playoffs to move on and play in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nOffensively, after the first drive, the Rams struggled for a lot of the game, but they did just enough to get the job done.\n\nStafford went 20/42 for 258, 0 touchdowns, 0 interceptions, two fumbles (he recovered one, and Kyren Williams recovered the other one), and was sacked four times. Stafford made all the throws he had to, but the Bears were able to heat him a lot and mess with the protections, which created lots of pressures and sacks, which stalled the LA offense.\n\nThe two biggest performers in the pass game were Puka Nacua and Colby Parkinson. Parkinson totaled three receptions for 56 yards and was a great option all night, making contested catches. Nacua hauled in five catches for 56 yards as well, and when the game was on the line, Stafford went back to him, and Nacua moved the chains on a key third down.\n\nDavante Adams also had two very important catches, the second one was on the sideline and a very tight throw from Stafford in overtime, which was able to move the chains and get the ball into field goal range for Los Angeles.\n\nOn the ground, the Rams totaled 111 yards on 31 carries, 3.6 yards per carry, and two touchdowns. Williams was the main back with 21 carries for 87 yards, an average of 4.1 yards per carry, and punched in both scores.\n\nLos Angeles abandoned the run game in the first half, but when they were able to establish it in the second half, that became the key to keeping the offense flowing and securing the win.\n\nAfter that great drive from Stafford and the offense, it set up a game-winning opportunity for first-year kicker Harrison Mevis. Mevis drilled the 42-yard game-winning field goal to send the Rams to the NFC Championship Game.\n\nFor the game, Mevis went 2/2 on field goals and 2/2 on extra points, also having a 32-yard field goal before the half to knot the game at 10-10. Mevis has a lot of confidence going into the most important game of his career and will look to redeem himself, as Seattle is the only stadium where he has missed a kick. Kickers will be very important this coming weekend.\n\nDefensively, the Rams’ pass defense was massively improved this week. LA forced Caleb Williams into 23/42, 257 yards, two touchdowns, three interceptions, but were not able to sack him one time.\n\nWilliams' unique playstyle created one of the most memorable plays in Chicago playoff history when he ran backwards to outrun the pass rush of LA, and he threw the ball up, and it landed in the hands of tight end Cole Kmet to tie the game at 17-17.\n\nIn overtime, however, Williams cost his team on a miscommunication with his receiver, DJ Moore, as Kam Curl intercepted the pass to get the ball back to Stafford.\n\nLos Angeles did have some trouble handling Colston Loveland and Moore as receivers in the pass game. Loveland went for five catches and 54 yards, and Moore hauled in five passes for 52 yards and one score.\n\nRome Odunze and Kmet also caused some problems. Odunze hauled in two catches for 44 yards, and Kmet had three receptions for 31 yards, and the late touchdown.\n\nOn the ground, the Bears actually ran the ball very well against a stout Rams’ rush defense. Chicago totaled 39 carries for 160 yards, and 4.1 yards per attempt. Swift led the way with 19 carries for 76 yards, and throughout the game, really tired out LA.\n\nWilliams was able to break containment quite a bit as he added five rushes for 40 yards, and this really devastated the defense at times. As the game got later, Kyle Monangai’s power wore Los Angeles out and created consistent runs, while his average wouldn’t indicate that. He had a total of 13 carries for 36 yards on 2.8 yards per carry.\n\nThe Rams were able to squeak out a win, but the run defense and quarterback contain must improve if they want to get to the Super Bowl. Also, Stafford and the offense must find a way to get into a rhythm a lot faster and get the ball to their playmakers in a tough road environment upcoming.\n\nTheir NFC Championship Game opponent, the Seattle Seahawks, had a start-to-finish dominant performance against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe game started with Rashid Shaheed taking a kickoff back 95 yards for a touchdown to get the crowd going and really make the 49ers feel they had no chance in this game.\n\nOffensively, Sam Darnold and the air attack didn’t do a lot, but they did take advantage of San Francisco's turnovers and made the throws when he had to.\n\nDarnold ended with 12/17, 106 yards, one touchdown, and was sacked twice. His top weapons were Cooper Kupp, Kenneth Walker, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Jake Bobo.\n\nKupp hauled in five passes for 60 yards, Walker contributed three catches for 29 yards, Smith-Njigba added three receptions for 19 yards and the lone touchdown, with Bobo adding his lone catch for 16 yards. The pass game will need to be a lot more productive next week.\n\nThe Seattle run game won the game for them in the divisional round. The run game went for 33 carries, 175 yards, 5.3 yards per carry, and three touchdowns. Walker led the way, totaling 116 yards on 19 carries and three scores.\n\nUnfortunately, Walker’s partner, Zach Charbonnet, will be out for the rest of the playoffs with a knee injury. So Seattle must look for someone to partner with Walker on the ground.\n\nJason Myers continued his excellent kicking year. He went 2/2 on field goals and 5/5 on extra points. The deeper into the playoffs we get, kicking will be key, and having a veteran like him will be great for Seattle.\n\nThe Seahawks’ defense was dominant, and San Francisco couldn't do much of anything all night long.\n\nThe pass game for the 49ers never really got going. Brock Purdy completed 15/27 passes for 124 yards, one interception, and was sacked twice. Purdy never got into a rhythm, and it showed the entire game. Purdy also fumbled once and lost it, creating another turnover.\n\nThe only issues the Seahawks had were covering Jake Tonges and Christian McCaffrey as backs and tight ends. Tonges hauled five passes for 59 yards, and McCaffrey went for five for 39 yards.\n\nCovering tight ends and backs at times can be difficult, so these will be matchups that will be crucial for this week and going forward.\n\nSeattle also did a tremendous job stopping the run against the running backs of San Francisco and the team as a whole. They held the 49ers to 27 rushes for 107 yards and 4.0 yards per carry.\n\nMcCaffrey was held to 11 carries for 35 yards and an average of 3.2 yards per rush. Purdy ended up being the team’s leading rusher on his scrambles, as he ran five times for 37 yards on 7.4 yards per attempt.\n\nThe Seahawks forced three fumbles, recovered two of them, and intercepted Purdy once. Their defense created a clear advantage in the turnover margin.\n\nThe strength of the Seahawks and their ability to stop the run could create a lot of problems for LA, and will definitely be something to watch for, one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nFor the LA defense versus the Seattle offense, the first major key is going to be the ability for which team can win at the line of scrimmage and dominate in the run game. In the Week 16 game, the Seahawks won this matchup; Los Angeles must change that.\n\nOver the last three games, Seattle has averaged 172.7 rush yards per game, which is second best in the league and clearly has been a point of emphasis. The Rams over their last three are allowing 107.3 rushing yards per game over their last three, which ranks 12th in the NFL and clearly will need to improve.\n\nThe line of scrimmage often determines championships, so one team must step up. This will be a very intriguing aspect of the game on Sunday.\n\nFor the Los Angeles offense, they must protect Stafford better than they did on Sunday night because this Seahawks defensive line and defense as a whole will take notes from Chicago and bring pressure in hopes of disrupting Stafford.\n\nThey must do this better than they did in Week 16 when LA scored 37 points.\n\nSeattle generates pressures at a 39.9% clip, which ranks sixth and is no group to mess around with. On the other side, the Rams allow pressure at just a 32.2% rate, which is fourth least and has been a solid unit all year long.\n\nAcross the board, Los Angeles has one of the best offensive lines, so this task for the Seahawks will be no easy one, and if they want any chance in this game, this is a matchup they have to win.\n\nFor Seattle’s offense, if they struggle running the ball and get into third and long, they must protect Darnold against a Rams’ pass rush that generates pressure fourth most at 41.6%. The main matchup to look at is going to be right guard Anthony Bradford versus the interior rushers of LA in Kobie Turner, Poona Ford, and Braden Fiske.\n\nBradford has a pass blocking grade of 40.8, which ranks 76th/81 guards. He has also allowed 28 pressures (57th/81 guards) and three sacks (48th/81 guards) this season, which clearly makes him the weak link for the Seahawks. If he steps up and provides protection for Darnold, it may be just enough to get the ball to the Seattle playmakers.\n\nHowever, Darnold has struggled under pressure at times in his career, and this season has turned the ball over quite a bit.\n\nDarnold and Seattle have played cleaner over the last three games, only turning it over 0.7 times per game, which is the 10th least. The Rams’ defense has really ramped up over its last three games and forced 2.3 turnovers per game, which ranks third, playing at an elite level.\n\nOne of these has to give, and Sunday’s outcome will have a lot to do with who wins the turnover margin.\n\nSpeaking of the Seahawks’ playmaker,s the most important one is Smith-Njigba, who has some success against LA in his career.\n\nSmith-Njigba has averaged 5.7 receptions on 9.0 targets, 73.8 receiving yards, and 0.5 touchdowns per game against the Rams.\n\nLA must be able to find ways to move coverages and take him off the board so Darnold gets to his next read, because without Smith-Njigba, this could be a tough day for the Seattle pass offense.\n\nAn x-factor for Seattle will be their explosive trade deadline addition, Shaheed, who has been making explosive plays all season. He had a kick return touchdown as mentioned last week to begin the game. Also, Shaheed had a punt return touchdown in Week 16, which completely turned the game around. So, his imprint on the game could do a lot for momentum.\n\nIt will also be interesting to see the battle of kickers in Myers versus Mevis, and who can make the big pressure kicks, or if both will. This game may come down to a clutch kick, and both of these kickers are prepared to make it.\n\nFor LA, their pass offense has clearly been their strength all season, and they must get it humming better than it was in the divisional round. If they can protect Stafford, it will come down to their weapons performing.\n\nLA has been in a rhythm and ranks first in passing yards per game, averaging 267.4. The Seahawks’ defense will have something to say about that, as they are the eighth-best passing defense, allowing 190.3 pass yards per game this season.\n\nThis season, Seattle limited the Rams to 130 passing yards, but in the second matchup, Stafford dominated with 457 passing yards.\n\nIn the third matchup of the year, it will be interesting to see who comes out on top. It is also important to note that in his career against Seattle, Nacua has dominated. Nacua averages 7.0 catches on 10.0 targets, 100.0 yards, and 0.6 touchdowns per game versus the Seahawks defense.\n\nThe final key to the game will be the Rams' run game and ability to blend personnel groupings to keep Seattle guessing and having to match their personnel. If LA can stick with the run game, this game will not have to completely sit on the shoulders of Stafford.\n\nThe Seahawks have been one of the stoutest run defenses in the NFL, allowing 92.6 rushing yards per game, which puts them second. It is no easy task against this defense.\n\nLA, when they stick with the rushing attack, has been fairly consistent in averaging 125.2 rush yards per game, which ranks 10th. LA just has to be consistent and stick with it, even if it gets tough at times.\n\nIn the Week 16 game, Seattle won the matchup in terms of yards per carry, limited to 3.2, so the Rams will need to find creative ways to open lanes for Williams and Corum.\n\nWith all of these matchups, this is clearly going to be one of the greatest playoff games in recent history, with both teams having strengths and weaknesses. This is a very tough game to predict.\n\nI believe LA will protect Stafford, find creative ways to run the ball, get the ball to Nacua and Adams, shut down the Seahawks' run game, and force Darnold into a few too many mistakes. My prediction is that the Rams will win 34-27.\n\nThis is going to be a very memorable game, and you don’t want to miss it. So, get your food ready with your friends and family, and tune in on Sunday at 3:30 EST on FOX for one of the best games of the season.",

    "description": "We share the most popular Super Bowl props and corresponding odds for Super Bowl 60, from the coin toss to game props.",
    "fullText": "The biggest game of the year comes with an even bigger feast of Super Bowl props to bet on! Get in on the action as we break down everything you need to know — from the best prop odds on the market to our handpicked favorite prop bets.\n\nKenneth Walker III is currently the betting favorite at +170 to score an anytime touchdown in Super Bowl LX, largely due to his role as the \"home-run hitter\" for the Seahawks. As the current Super Bowl favorites (+145), Seattle's offensive success heavily relies on Walker’s explosive ability. During the 2025 regular season, he surpassed 1,000 rushing yards and demonstrated elite efficiency, highlighted by a league-high number of explosive runs. His momentum is peaking at the right time, as evidenced by his dominant three-touchdown performance against the 49ers in the Divisional Round.\n\nWalker’s value is bolstered by his high usage in a high-powered offense led by Sam Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Given that the Seahawks are projected to reach the championship game in Santa Clara, Walker's knack for finding the end zone in high-stakes matchups makes him the most logical choice for oddsmakers.\n\nLooking for a live longshot? Look no further than Denver RB RJ Harvey. The rookie sensation led Denver with 12 total touchdowns in the 2025 regular season (7 rushing, 5 receiving), carving out a role as Sean Payton’s preferred goal-line option.\n\nAt +1800, you’re getting elite value on a dual-threat back in a high-scoring offense. Harvey was No. 1 on this list a week ago, but Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury has cast serious doubt into whether Denver can still advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nBetting on who will win Super Bowl MVP is one of the most popular and simple player props on Super Sunday. Skill positions and star players are normally among the favorites, including the starting quarterbacks for both teams.\n\nBe careful when taking long shots here, however, as a quarterback has won MVP in 34 of the 59 Super Bowls.\n\nFew would have guessed it when the season began, but the Seahawks and Patriots appear to be on a collision course. Seattle is a 2.5-point favorite at home against the Rams, while the Pats are 4.5-point road favorites against the Broncos, who will be starting Jarret Stidham under center. The former fourth round pick has not completed a pass since 2023.\n\nSince the NFL began using the current seeding format in 1975, the No. 1 seed from either the AFC or NFC has won the Super Bowl 27 times.\n\nBecause there are two No. 1 seeds every year (one per conference), this means a top-seeded team wins the championship roughly 54% of the time.\n\nWhile Super Bowl props can be a lot of fun to bet on, you should have a strategy and follow these tips to make sure you end up in the Big Game black:\n\nChances are if you’re betting Super Bowl props, you likely have a wager on the point spread or total. Use those wagers to build a narrative around how you see the game playing out and what each team has to do to get to that projected result.\n\nWith so many Super Bowl bets available, it’s easy to get your action tangled up. Make sure you’re not betting against yourself by contradicting previous wagers. If you like the Over, don’t bet on the Under when it comes to scoring or passing props. If you like the underdog to cover the spread, don’t bet on the favorite to go Over their yardage props.\n\nBetting on props was long considered a “square” market for many years. However, with the rapid expansion in prop offerings as well as the explosion in advanced analytics, more and more sharp bettors and professional gamblers are flocking to the opening prop odds.\n\nIf you’re trying to get the best of the numbers, pay attention to the early prop odds movement in the 12 to 24 hours after sportsbooks release these markets. Bookmakers will adjust quickly to these early sharp opinions. If you’re waiting until Super Bowl Sunday to get your prop bets down, you’re likely to get the worst of the number.\n\nSportsbooks up their available prop markets every February with more and more Big Game betting options. Plenty of these props are the same, in terms of format, but the totals and juice/vig attached to them can vary from book to book. If you have multiple sportsbooks available to you, don’t be afraid to shop around for the best return on your prop betting opinions.\n\nSuper Bowl prop bets, from basic game props and team props to the initial batch of player props, are released in the immediate hours after the Super Bowl matchup is set. Although now some sportsbooks are even providing hypothetical odds for matchups based on the potential outcomes of the AFC/NFC title games.\n\nFollow along as we’ll be updating this page — and our player props page — with live odds, picks, and analysis as soon as they are available.\n\nDepending on what they’re based on, Super Bowl prop bets can be graded and paid out either throughout the game or at the end of the game. The timing and promptness of payouts for Super Bowl bets depend on the sportsbook.\n\nMost Super Bowl betting sites have a large menu of Super Bowl prop bets. However, online-based books will offer \n\nWhile subjective, Super Bowl proposition bets (props) have nearly eclipsed commercials as the most fun and engaging part of the telecast. These entertaining alternatives to the standard odds markets can boost your winnings and maybe morale, too. Here are our keys to the props betting game:\n\nGreat way to diversify your bets, spreading action to different parts of the contest.\n\nTake your pick from the most commonly available: player, game, and exotic props.\n\nMake sure you’re not betting against yourself. If you like the Over, don’t bet on the Under when it comes to scoring or passing props.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Former Super Bowl champion reveals what Dolphins are getting in HC Jeff Hafley originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins have officially found their new head coach. Former Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley will be leading Miami from the sidelines in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHafley has an extensive coaching background, including being the head coach at Boston College and a defensive position coach for a number of NFL teams.\n\nTwo-time Super Bowl champion Logan Ryan attributed Hafley with his collegiate success at Rutgers, and predicted that he would be hired as a head coach this upcoming cycle.\n\nIn an interview with Ari Meirov, Ryan spoke about Hafley's mentorship and spoke about his success stories, such as himself and Darelle Revis at Pitt.\n\n\"You see what he did last year with the Packer defense. Now with Micah Parsons, I think Jeff Halfley is going to be the hottest coach in the NFL this offseason. He really gets the best.\nHe coached Darrelle Revis in college. He coached me. And not that I'm Darrelle Revis or anything like that, but I was really struggling to figure out what I was good at,\" Ryan told Meirov.\n\n\"And he found that fire in me, and really a big credit to my playing style and how I was able to be productive and versatile was what Halfley told me was to use my superpower, which is my IQ and use my instincts, trust your instincts. And when you have a boss that believes in you and wants you to be you, I really think that made a difference.\"\n\nHafley likely will be building things from the ground up in Miami and have the chance to put his imprint on the roster.\n\nIf he can do half of what he did with Ryan and Darrelle Revis, the Dolphins should be in great hands.\n\nMock draft sees Dolphins make aggressive trade to land Tua Tagovailoa replacement\n\nSheil Kapadia pitches Dolphins trade idea swapping first-round bust quarterbacks\n\nDolphins urged to give contract extension to defensive captain\n\nDolphins predicted to land Jaelan Phillips replacement in 2026 mock draft",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are set to hire their fourth head coach since 1970 in 2026, as the franchise has been moving quickly to schedule interviews with candidates and find their replacement for Mike Tomlin, who stepped down last week.\n\nPittsburgh has been selective with whom they'll interview, but one strong candidate for the Steelers' head coaching job is Los Angeles Rams head coach Chris Shula.\n\nShula is still in the playoffs, as the Rams picked up an overtime win over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round on Sunday. However, he interviewed virtually with Pittsburgh last Friday, and Bleacher Report's Erik Beaston predicts Shula will be the Steelers' next head coach.\n\nHere is what Beaston had to say about Pittsburgh's coaching search, and why Shula would be a logical hire:\n\n\"As for the Steelers, a head coaching candidate with an offensive mindset would represent a fresh start, although the team has been defined by its defense throughout its long and illustrious history.\"\n\nShula has established himself as an elite head coaching candidate this year, leading the Rams' defense to a top-ten scoring finish. Los Angeles has had to play high-powered offenses all season, but the moment hasn't been too big for Shula.\n\nMoving in a new direction and hiring an offensive coach would be a refreshing move from the Steelers. However, if the team sticks with their franchise identity and brings in another defensive coach, Shula is the obvious hire.\n\nThe 39-year-old is a promising defensive mind and would be able to take a capable offensive coordinator from the Sean McVay tree with him to the Steelers.\n\nRams passing coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, who is receiving interest as an offensive coordinator and even a head coach, would be a logical OC fit in Pittsburgh with Shula.\n\nThe grandson of Hall of Fame Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula, Chris, could be the next great defensive-minded head coach. Though the head coaching market is deep, the Steelers shouldn't pass on the opportunity to hire Shula.\n\nJosh Allen sheds tears during postgame presser after loss to Broncos\n\nBills veteran announces desire to only play for Buffalo or retire\n\nBrowns rumor could complicate Giants' offensive coordinator search\n\nSeahawks playoff win is bad news for Raiders, Ravens, Dolphins\n\nKenneth Walker contract looms large after dominant game vs. 49ers",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots are heading to the AFC Championship Game after taking care of the Houston Texans on Sunday.\n\nThe team will take on the Denver Broncos, who recently found out that starting quarterback Bo Nix will miss the rest of the postseason with a broken ankle. The Broncos were able to beat the Buffalo Bills anyway, but it'll be tough to move forward without their quarterback.\n\nHowever, not everybody is penciling the Patriots into the Super Bowl.\n\nFormer NFL quarterback Nick Foles was watching the game and wanted to remind everybody about something. Foles mentioned that the Patriots \"struggle against backup QBs\" in championship-style games.\n\n\"Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours. I feel for Bo and the team, and I'm sending prayers for a strong recovery,\" Foles said. \"A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.\"\n\nOf course, Foles is referring to Super Bowl LII, where he stepped in as the backup quarterback and led the Philadelphia Eagles to a win over the Patriots.\n\nIn that game, Foles played like a star, throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns. The famous \"Philly Special\" play was born that night, and the Patriots received plenty of grief for losing to a backup quarterback.\n\nFoles went on to play one more season with the Eagles after that Super Bowl before signing a massive free agent contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019.\n\nIt was a hilarious note from Foles, but the situations aren't exactly the same.\n\nFoles was the backup, but he had already been a Pro Bowler once in his career. The quarterback was a reliable veteran passer and one of the best backups in the league.\n\nThe Broncos, though, have to rely on Jarrett Stidham.

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Three reasons Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will (and won't) win Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60? The wide-open 2025-2026 NFL playoffs started with a combined 14 teams from the AFC and NFC, but it's down to four with the conference championship matchups now set for next Sunday.\n\nThe AFC has held form, with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos (14-3) ready to host the No. 2 seed New England Patriots (14-3). The best team in the NFC, the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks (14-3) will host the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in another NFC West rubber match.\n\nAny one of those teams can either win the Super Bowl or fall flat in the league semifinals. Based on each team's odds to finish the playoffs undefeated and raise the Lombardi Trophy, here's looking at why the Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will succeed or fail through the last two rounds:\n\n(Futures odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Seahawks led the NFL scoring defense (16.6 points allowed per game) and were third in total defense (282.8 yards per game) during the regular season. They were No. 2 against the run (92.6 yards per game) and No. 9 against the pass (190.3). They lived up to that reputation and then some in obliterating the 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs, 41-6.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks smacked 49ers behind dominant defense\n\nThey are in sync with the pressure and coverage and just erased San Francisco's running game. Outside of some issues covering backs and tight ends, Seattle has no defensive weaknesses. They are starting to channel much of the classic \"Legion of Boom\" energy from their Super Bowl 48-winning team.\n\nThe Seahawks ran the ball on 50.6 percent of their offensive plays, No. 2 in the NFL behind only the Ravens. They were No. 7 in rushing yards per game, averaging 126.2 yards. With a blowout in the divisional round, Seattle rushed the ball at a 63.5 percent clip, producing 175 yards on 33 attempts, with Kenneth Walker III (116 yards, 3 TDs) carrying the load after Zach Charbonnet (knee) got hurt.\n\nWhen Seattle can run the ball at a high clip, it takes a lot of pressure off Sam Darnold in the passing game. With their offensive line getting great interior blocking, it's a tough rushing attack to stop.\n\nThe Seahawks' run blocking has been on point and Klint Kubiak has done well to keep the offense balanced so it maintains explosiveness, too.\n\nSam Darnold has responded in his reunion with Kubiak, playing well off the running game. It's wise to trust elite breakout wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to make the big plays needed all the way through the end zone. Darnold has also hit on well-timed deep shots to other wideouts and made good use of his tight ends when called upon. Darnold has been fortunate to land in another QB-friendly system after his big season with Minnesota.\n\n1. Too little from the passing game\n\nDarnold is falling into the Trent Dilfer-Brad Johnson category of potential Super Bowl quarterbacks. He is more of a complementary strong supporter on a team led by defense and the running game. However, Darnold should be prepared to try to win another shootout in Seattle with Matthew Stafford after not needing to much to beat the 49ers.\n\nFor such a dominant team, the Seahawks were minus-3 in turnover margin during the regular season. They were second in the NFL with their 28 giveaways and Darnold threw 14 of Seattle's 15 interceptions. Although they crushed the 49ers in the turnover battle, 3-0, to reverse that trend, the Rams will be out looking for mistakes from Darnold.\n\nThe Seahawks were a middle of the pack offense on third down this season, converting on 39.8 percent of third-down chances. Seattle's third down struggles were highlighted in the divisional round, going 4-for-10 (40 percent) in the playoff rout of the 49ers. The Seahawks will need do better at sustaining drives or meet a playoff exit.\n\nThe Patriots' secondary was active and a big reason why they thwarted the Texans' makeshift receiving corps. C.J. Stroud saw some pressure, but his bad passes cost him because New England was opportunistic. New England also was all over ripping into Justin Herbert and his receivers in the wild-card round. The defense, not the offense, is why the Patriots remain alive, one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nMaye got out of some his early playoff jitters and kinks against the Texans and Chargers, facing a lot more pressure in two senses and being less accurate and careful with the ball. But after a hot finish vs. Houston's brutal all-around defensive test with little help from the traditional running game, Maye should have a lot more confidence he can do what Josh Allen did in Denver to the Broncos' defense, only minus the turnovers.\n\nMORE: Why Patriots won't get away with sloppy Drake Maye vs. Bo Nix-less Broncos\n\nMike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels have proved to be strong Belichickian proxies for New England with Maye and the young defensive talent making their jobs much easier to execute at a high level. Vrabel has wasted no time returning to the ranks off top NFL coaches, picking up where left off with lesser teams in Tennessee.\n\nMaye has gotten sloppy with his ball security when running or keeping pass plays alive in the pocket. He has also thrown an interception in each of his first two playoff games, and luckily hasn't been picked off more with some anomalous inaccuracy. The Patriots must win the turnover battle all-around to win the war.\n\nMORE: Texans can't take advantage of Drake Maye's turnover troubles\n\nMaye is in Year 2. Everyone's adjusting to the Vrabel-McDaniels era after one bad transitional year with Jerod Mayo. There is some youth serving well on the defense despite its green nature. The Patriots are a facing a tight-nit Broncos' defense and would get either the swarming Seahawks or the savvier Sean McVay-led Rams in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots tend to give up touchdowns deep when their opponents can sustain long drives. They made the Texans look better in this major area of struggle on Sunday. Not holding for field goals on a couple drives can make the biggest difference for Maye and the offense moving forward.\n\nMcVay is the best coach in the NFL, considering his offensive play-calling acumen, motivational skills and situational understanding. He took advantage of a flawed field to push the team toward its first championship under him in Super Bowl 56. His offensive staff and defensive coordinator Chris Shula crush it every week, too.\n\nMORE: Why Sean McVay-Ben Johnson postgame handshake was cordial\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Davante Adams\n\nStafford might have more chemistry with Nacua and Adams than he did with Cooper Kupp and his other receivers four years ago. Nacua is off to a historic start with his production and Adams' red zone dominance has further stamped his Hall of Fame career. Stafford has been on point getting them the ball and it's also opened up big plays downfield and after the catch for the tight ends and other receivers.\n\n3. A strong defensive front seven\n\nThe back end of the Rams' defense has had some coverage breakdowns at corner and safety, exploitable in several matchups. The Rams won their last Super Bowl with Aaron Donald as the linchpin and Jalen Ramsey as the mercenary. Now they've a rebuilt a stout disruptive corps with Jared Verse, Kobie Turner, Braden Fiske, Nate Landman and other active youngsters.\n\n1. Not running the ball enough or effectively\n\nThe Rams have a good rushing attack, especially in short yardage and in the red zone. They stuck with the run 31 times against the Bears, with Kyren Williams scoring both of their TDs. But they averaged only 3.6 yards a carry and couldn't put the game away with the rushing attack in the fourth quarter. They can't get afford to get stuck being too one-dimensional for Stafford's sake.\n\nThe Rams made some huge interceptions against Caleb Williams to help survive in the divisional round. But they also had some major coverage breakdowns and benefitted from a few just-missed connections and drops by the Bears receivers.\n\nMcVay tends to be old-school for still being a young hotshot calling the offensive shots at age 39. For example, he could have trusted Stafford and the passing game to run out the clock with one more first down in regulation, but invited the Bears back in with a late short punt. Some tougher fourth-down calls might be required to outlast the Seahawks plus either the Patriots or Broncos.\n\nSean Payton and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph have been on point, coaching complementary football. Payton has the experience of winning Super Bowl 44 while leading the Saints and will extract the most out of his now more injury-riddled roster one last time. That includes scheming to make backup Jarrett Stidham semi-successful filling in for Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos dodged a bullet with cornerback Patrick Surtain returning vs. the Bills. They also saw more playmakers come though in the secondary behind good pressure on Allen, led by Ja'Quan McMillan in the slot corner role. Nik Bonitto and others set Denver up for success against the Bills and should be ready to tee off against Drake Maye and the Patriots.\n\nWith Nix out for the season with a broken bone in his ankle, his early legacy of being a clutch late-game quarterback may rub off with the whole team. Expect Denver to rally around Stidham to come through in the end.\n\n1. No Bo Nix and more offensive injuries\n\nStidham will likely need to go to work minus wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin, just as the young targets were starting to come through for Nix. Now Stidham is dealing with a short-handed receiving corps on top of being rusty and jittery playing against his first NFL team at home.\n\nMORE:Why Nick Foles thinks Broncos have a chance after Bo Nix injury\n\nThe Broncos didn't find a reliable rushing attack even against the Bills' porous run defense, with Nix's scrambling leading the way in the running game. The team misses the power and juice of JK Dobbins with rookie RJ Harvey providing only some flashes without power-running substance. If the Broncos can't take pressure off Stidham with the running game vs. a nasty Patriots run defense, Stidham should be prepared to see a lot of heat in his face.\n\nSurtain and McMillan saved the day in many ways against the Bills, but the Broncos are not known for making big plays on the ball with only 10 interceptions and four fumble recoveries from the regular season. They need to be sound fundamentally for Vance Joseph and win the situational battles on third down and in the red zone. Any little crack in coverage and Maye will exploit it for chunk passes downfield with his fearless, big arm.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nConference championship weekend will determine who reaches Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8.\n\nDenver and Seattle advanced on divisional playoff weekend.\n\nThe Broncos will host the AFC championship game for the seventh time in franchise history, but the dominant storyline is the loss of Bo Nix, who suffered a broken bone in his right ankle in the 33-30 victory against Buffalo and will be replaced by Jarrett Stidham. New England beat Houston 28-16 in the AFC divisional playoffs behind second-year quarterback Drake Maye and a defense that forced four turnovers.\n\nDenver has beaten the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game in two past meetings.\n\nThe AFC championship game will be at 3 p.m. on CBS.\n\nThe Seahawks hammered the San Francisco 49ers 49-6 in the NFC divisional playoffs. Sam Darnold earned his first playoff victory, and Kenneth Walker III had three TD runs. The Rams survived a 20-17 overtime classic at Chicago in the NFC divisional round, and Matthew Stafford has a chance to get to a second Super Bowl with coach Sean McVay, who is looking for a third appearance.\n\nHere are Sporting News' picks for the AFC and NFC Championship games (odds courtesy of Caesars):\n\nNew England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver Broncos\n\nIt is a fun coaching matchup between Sean Payton and Mike Vrabel, who can take New England to the Super Bowl in his first season.\n\nStidham made two starts with coach Sean Payton in the 2023 season. How much will the Patriots speed up the seventh-year quarterback on his reads? Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions and took three sacks. The Broncos will have to rely on the running game more – which averaged just 3.2 yards per carry against the Bills. RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin need to be more effective against a Patriots’ defense that allowed 48 rushing yards against the Texans. New England’s defense that features linebackers Robert Spillane and Christian Elliss.\n\nHow much will Stidham be able to test New England in the passing game? Carlton Davis - who did not have an interception in the regular season – had two picks. The Patriots will take chances in coverage on Stidham, and Denver also has uncertainty at the receiver position. Troy Franklin suffered a hamstring injury in the divisional playoffs, and that leaves Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil’Jordan Humphrey at receiver. How much success will the Broncos have on third down in the intermediate range?\n\nBreaking down Broncos' QB depth chart behind Bo Nix\n\nCan the Broncos still win the Super Bowl without Bo Nix?\n\nGet to know new Broncos QB1, Jarrett Stidham\n\nDenver’s defense also will face more pressure to keep this a low-scoring game. Maye will be on the spot, too, especially in his first road playoff start. The Broncos generated five turnovers and three sacks against the Bills, and linebacker Nik Bonitto had a sack and two forced fumbles. There will be opportunities against Maye, who had four fumbles against the Texans, and the pressure has to land. The Patriots can lean on the running game with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, and that should help Maye settle in on the road.\n\nMaye has been trustworthy on the road this season, too. He’s 8-0 with an average 273.5 yards, 17 TDs and three interceptions on the road this season. This is Maye’s first start at Empower Field at Mile High, and the Broncos were 9-1 S/U at home this season and 2-0 S/U as a home underdog. It’s still a tough environment, and the Broncos are 6-1 S/U all time at home in the AFC championship game. Pittsburgh beat Denver 34-17 in the 2005 AFC championship game on Jan. 22, 2006.\n\nPatriots defense picks apart Texans to advance to AFC Championship\n\nC.J. Stroud's four first-half INTs doom Texans\n\nWhy Patriots can't afford another sloppy Drake Maye playoff performance\n\nWhere C.J. Stroud's disastrous day ranks among most turnovers in a playoff game\n\nCan Stidham pull a Jeff Hostettler – who led the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV victory after Phil Simms was injured. Hostettler had two regular-season starts before the playoffs. A week might not be enough time for Denver here. It’s just going to be tough to pull this off without the Patriots imploding on the road.\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\nThe two regular-season matchups were decided by a combined total of three points, including a wild 38-37 overtime thriller on Dec. 18. The NFC West rivals split the regular-season series, and three of the last four meetings at Seattle have gone into overtime.\n\nWalker is coming off a huge game, and he had 11 carries for 100 yards and a TD in the last meeting. The Rams allowed 160 rushing yards against the Bears, so Seattle can be patient with the two-headed rushing attack of Walker and Zach Charbonnet. Jared Verse has to be a difference maker off the edge for Los Angeles.\n\nThat should help Darnold – who finished 51 of 78 (65.4%) for an average of 274.5 yards, two TDs and six interceptions in the two regular-season meetings against the Rams. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 17 catches for 201 yards and a TD in those two games, and that is the matchup Seattle needs to win consistently in the passing game. Five different Los Angeles players had interceptions in those games, and the Rams intercepted Caleb Williams three times in the divisional playoff win. Turnovers will be key here, especially on the road.\n\nHow swarming Seattle defense is peaking at right time\n\nWatch Rashid Shaheed take opening kickoff for TD\n\nThis is another opportunity for Stafford, who had a 57.1% completion percentage in those two meetings but also did not take a sack. He had 457 yards and three TDs in the last meeting. Will Seattle coach Michael Macdonald choose to dial up the pressure in order to take Stafford out of rhythm with receivers Puka Nacua and Davante Adams? Tight end Cody Parkinson had 10 carries for 90 yards and a TD in two playoff games, too. The Rams also will look to establish the running game with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Seahawks allowed 5.3 yards per carry in their regular-season loss in the Rams and 3.2 yards per carry in the win.\n\nThe Rams were 4-5 S/U on the road, but they are 1-1 ATS as an underdog in the regular season, but they have won S/U as a road favorite each of the last two weeks. Seattle is 8-2 S/U and 6-4 ATS at home. The Seahawks are 3-0 S/U at home in the NFC championship game.\n\nIt's shaping up to be another instant classic between these rivals, but the Rams had a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in that last meeting and they have survived two tough road games. Does Stafford have one more road victory in him? It's hard not to trust the MVP-caliber quarterback in this matchup.\n\nRams fend off Bears' comeback attempt to advance to NFC Championship\n\nCaleb Williams overtime interception dooms Bears\n\nWatch Caleb Williams uncork spectacular TD pass to Cole Kmet to force overtime",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are one victory away from the Super Bowl following Sunday’s 28-16 win over the Houston Texans.\n\nNew England advanced to the AFC Championship Game in a sloppy, turnover-filled triumph over Houston. Following consecutive home wins, the Patriots will travel to Denver to face the Broncos for the conference title.\n\nAfter New England’s victory, the NFL announced the details for next weekend’s matchup. The Patriots will play the Broncos on Sunday, Jan. 25, at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nCBS will televise the AFC Championship Game, and viewers can also stream it on Paramount+.\n\nThe Patriots finished the regular season third in total offense, but their defense has carried them to double-digit playoff wins. They first sacked Justin Herbert six times in a 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers before locking down the Texans in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nHouston averaged just 3.3 yards per play, gaining a mere 48 rushing yards on 22 carries. Making matters worse, C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions — one returned for a touchdown — and lost a fumble.\n\nThe Patriots will look to improve to 9-0 on the road when playing the Broncos, who survived a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. But the AFC West champions suffered a huge loss in the process, as quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle at the end of the game.\n\nThat places former Patriots reserve Jarrett Stidham in line to make his fifth career start. The former fourth-round pick has a 78.3 passer rating with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.\n\nJason Kelce Celebrates ‘Pitbull’ Patriots Defensive Standout",

    "description": "Seattle's level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams.",
    "fullText": "Seattle laid its claim for the NFL throne in the exact way it did during its dominant run toward the NFC’s No. 1 seed: by ferociously pummeling their opponent without mercy.\n\nThe Seahawks’ offense had a productive, albeit somewhat ugly game Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers, but Seattle’s defense (and special teams!) stole the show in this 41-6 divisional round wipeout. Now Seattle is a game away from getting back to the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIt’s a playoff position star defender DeMarcus Lawrence, who had a strip sack of Brock Purdy late in the second half, hasn’t seen in his career after spending 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. His prophetic words from last March about leaving Dallas for Seattle in free agency made a comeback on social media after the Seahawks’ emphatic win. And they’re bound to have some staying power this coming week as the Seahawks prepare for the NFC title game. But what else stuck out for Lawrence that symbolized this tenacious defense was the new necklace he sported postgame with the initials: MOB.\n\nNew “MOB” necklace for DeMarcus Lawrence looks like it wasn’t free pic.twitter.com/sYP7WASZPE\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 18, 2026\n\n“Yeah, brand new MOB necklace, man,” Lawrence said. “You know, just letting the world know how we coming, you know.”\n\nIn a league where offenses and quarterbacks are the stars of the show, Seattle has built a defense that’s just as compelling as the biggest, flashiest arms in the NFL and they showed that they’re absolutely good enough to ride to a title.\n\nSeattle didn't even let the 49ers get into the game, doing the same thing it did during the Week 18 regular-season finale when it stifled the 49ers’ running game, which subsequently forced Brock Purdy to be a dropback passer and throw into the teeth of an immovable defense. This weekend, the Seahawks held the 49ers to 28 yards on 11 designed runs in the first half, and again forced the 49ers to play a style of football they don’t want to play.\n\nThe Seahawks forced their second turnover on downs of the night to open the third quarter, the offense rewarded the defense with a field goal and the 21-point deficit was too much against Seattle’s marauding defense.\n\nThis is the kind of performance that No. 1 seeds should have against weaker opponents in their conference. Not that the 49ers are a bad team, they’re just an absurdly injured one. But this level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. In a season when head coach Kyle Shanahan had all the answers as the 49ers’ lineups shifted and became more depleted, the Seahawks were all over everything he tried to throw out. Not only are they talented, they’re incredibly well-orchestrated with second-year head coach Mike Macdonald pulling all the strings on defense.\n\nThe 49ers didn’t even reach the red zone in this game and this was an offense that ranked top-three in most standard and advanced metrics over the back half of the season. It’s not like the Seahawks have been padding their stats against the worst teams that the league has to offer. This status is earned through trial. The only offense to put up over 20 points on Seattle over the final nine weeks of the season has been the Rams (the Titans scored 24 but they had a 90-yard punt return touchdown). They’ve given up 75 points since Week 13 with 37 of those points, legitimately half, coming against the Rams.\n\nTeams need to be as dialed in, talented and well-coached as the Rams to really score against this defense. The run the Seahawks are on will go down in the record books as an all-time finish if they can maintain this level of defensive dominance against one of two of the better offenses in the NFL. In the Rams’ case, they’re probably just the flat-out best offense period this season.\n\nThat creates a potentially fascinating third matchup between the Seahawks and their division rival Rams, but L.A. still has to get there first. Caleb Williams and the Bears are no pushover at this point, but when Seattle stuffs Shanahan and the 49ers in a locker for the second time in three weeks, it's hard not to feel like this is the current favorite for the Super Bowl. Seattle’s defense is really that good and it has one of the elite special teams units in the entire league, as shown by Rashid Shaheed’s 95-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown.\n\nThe health of the Bears or Rams will likely create a tougher test than what the 49ers were able to muster, but this defense is playing as well as a unit possibly can in the modern NFL and the Seahawks seem to be getting better each week. No matter who shows up to face the Seahawks next Sunday, the only thing louder than Lumen Field will be the boom this defense brings seemingly every single play.",

It's been a long season, I hate how it ended and it's going to stick with me for a long time.\"\n\nIn Saturday's other match-up, the Seattle Seahawks romped to a 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers.",

    "fullText": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - A study by AI risk management platform Alethea into the surge in artificial intelligence-generated fake content, dubbed \"AI slop,\" has warned sports teams, leagues and fans of the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated digital misinformation.\n\nRetired NFL player Jason Kelce never said ​2026 Super Bowl halftime singer Bad Bunny's critics were \"a bad fit for America's future\".\n\nSan Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle never ranted about slain ‌conservative activist Charlie Kirk and politics in football.\n\nHowever, thousands of people believed they did and that is the problem.\n\n\"Teams and players are suddenly being accused of things that are completely fabricated,\" Lisa Kaplan, ‌founder and CEO of Alethea, told Reuters on Friday, adding that the evolution of AI tools has made fake news a more daunting challenge.\n\n\"Content now looks real and is produced at a volume that makes it hard for the average person to determine if it's authentic,\" she said.\n\n\"Before, fake news often relied on human labour to repetitively copy and paste content. Today, AI can impersonate brands and create engaging images that mimic genuine announcements.\"\n\nKaplan noted that this wave of AI-generated misinformation has disrupted the traditional monetisation ⁠model of sports media. \"These networks drive engagement to questionable websites, ‌skew advertising metrics, and can even create scenarios that could manipulate betting markets,\" she added.\n\nC Shawn Eib, Alethea's Head of Investigations, described how these networks use tactics such as making multiple disjointed announcements, like the conflicting claims that former Baltimore Ravens coach ‍John Harbaugh had been hired by multiple teams at the same time.\n\n\"When a single figure appears to be linked with several teams at the same time, it quickly becomes clear that an AI system is behind the creation of these images,\" Eib explained.\n\nAI DECEPTION CAN EXPLOIT 'RAGE BAIT'\n\nThe content follows a formula: fake game updates, nonexistent celebrity feuds, manufactured scandals, and politicised ​quotes falsely attributed to star players.\n\nThe fabricated Kelce and Kittle quotes are prime examples. Both NFL stars publicly denied making comments they never said after the ‌posts went viral.\n\n\"If fans, players and even entire franchises fall prey to these manipulated narratives, it risks damaging reputations, undermining trust and even politicising sport,\" Alethea's VP of Communications Kaila Ryan said.\n\n\"Sports organisations need to proactively manage their brands and digital safety. It is crucial for teams and leagues to start monitoring these risks, work together across communications, legal and security teams, and educate fans to verify announcements from official channels,\" she added.\n\nThe business impact extends beyond reputational harm.\n\nThese networks siphon ad revenue from legitimate sports media and distort audience metrics. Some outbound links have been flagged for phishing and malicious redirects, presenting real fraud risk to fans.\n\nThe problem ⁠is not limited to the NFL. Alethea discovered similar operations targeting the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, ​NASCAR, Formula 1, IndyCar and professional tennis.\n\nKaplan added that beyond monetisation, sport remains a rare cultural ​touchpoint that unites people, making them attractive targets for influence operations, and she pointed to Russia's alleged exploitation of then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2018 'Take a Knee' protest as a precedent.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Russian trolls had focused heavily ‍on the kneeling debate as part of ⁠a broader effort to stoke racial tensions and divide the U.S. following the 2016 election.\n\n\"Kaepernick's protests were exploited for a purpose that had nothing to do with sport. Instead, it's a way of leveraging a cultural touchstone and turning it into something that polarises people,\" said Kaplan.\n\n\"Teams need to ⁠work in unison to defend their identities and protect their fans from falling victim to fraud or manipulation,\" she added, noting that the best advice for fans is to be vigilant.\n\n\"Verify breaking news ‌through official team channels, don't click links in suspicious page comments and remember that outrage is often the product, not the by-product, ‌of what you're seeing\".",

    "fullText": "Bruised and battle-hardened, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills face Denver on Saturday as their star quarterback seeks to reach his first Super Bowl and add the NFL's biggest prize to his list of accolades.\n\nThe league's reigning Most Valuable Player suffered a head blow, a sprained knee and a hand injury in last weekend's hard-fought clash with Jacksonville, but almost single-handedly dragged his team over the line.\n\nNow, Allen has been cleared fit to play against the Broncos -- the AFC's top seed -- in their highly anticipated divisional round game, knowing victory would leave them just one win away from next month's NFL championship decider.\n\n\"I feel good. Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks,\" Allen, who has also been managing a long-term foot injury, told a press conference.\n\nAllen's run of 122 consecutive starts is the longest streak among active quarterbacks and has led to his teammates and fans jokingly referring to him as \"Superman.\"\n\nBut the quarterback, who hails from the agricultural Central Valley of California, told reporters his toughness came from being a \"country boy\" from \"out in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that the defensive line he will be facing is notoriously robust.\n\n\"They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously they rush the passer extremely well,\" said Allen.\n\n\"Interior, again, some big stout guys that can really push the pocket.\"\n\nFor Denver, the match-up comes after a bye week, and offers another chance to prove that one of this season's surprise packages can be the real deal at the business end of the campaign.\n\nDespite finishing top of the AFC with the league's joint best record (14-3), the Broncos figure only fifth on the betting market's predicted Super Bowl winners.\n\nStar cornerback Pat Surtain said the team would be relying on a raucous crowd to spur them on for the Broncos' first postseason home game since 2015.\n\n\"I know the atmosphere is going to be crazy, the stadium is going to be rocking,\" Surtain said.\n\n\"I can already feel the magnitude of it,\" he added.\n\nIt is also a chance for the Broncos to avenge last year's devastating 31-7 playoff loss in Buffalo.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, the injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers will attempt the next step in their bid to reach a home-field Super Bowl by taking on the high-flying Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe clash pits the two divisional rivals against each other for the second time in three weeks.\n\nAs top seeds in the NFC, the Seahawks also had a bye last weekend. By contrast the 49ers -- who have been decimated by a deepening injury crisis for much of the season -- suffered yet another cruel blow against Philadelphia, when tight end George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon.\n\n\"We've kind of been in a hole for about seven months and once you get to the playoffs, it really doesn't matter,\" said 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, of the non-stop schedule.\n\n\"Everyone's into it. So, whether they gave us three days, one day, eight days... whenever you get dealt your hand, you're ready to roll.\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl will be held at the 49ers' home stadium, in Santa Clara, California, on February 8.\n\nIn Sunday's remaining divisional round games, the New England Patriots will host the Houston Texans, and the Los Angeles Rams travel to the Chicago Bears.",

    "fullText": "Against all odds, the San Francisco 49ers find themselves facing the Seattle Seahawks for a trip to the NFC Championship, and I expect Christian McCaffrey & Co. to stun the oddsmakers when they hit the field on Saturday night.\n\nA rematch of last year’s playoff showdown is in store, and while Denver has home-field advantage this time around, I’m not betting against Josh Allen.\n\nAs good as Denver’s pass rush is, Buffalo’s O-line remains elite, and Allen is coming off one of his best playoff starts to date.\n\nThe Bills’ defense has proven it will bend but not break, so I’ll take Buffalo to survive the Mile High City.\n\nKyle Shanahan and Robert Saleh continue to work their magic in San Francisco, most recently coaching their asses off in a thrilling win over Philadelphia.\n\nNo Fred Warner? No Nick Bosa? Brandon Aiyuk MIA? No problem for Bang Bang Niner Gang.\n\nThis is just Sam Darnold’s second career playoff start, and we all know how the first one went. The Seahawks being favored by a full touchdown screams impending letdown.\n\nI’m betting on the underdogs to pull off another miracle.\n\nConcussions to both Texans WR1 Nico Collins and Patriots CB1 Christian Gonzalez essentially cancel each other out, but the combination of New England’s cold-weather advantage and stingy defense will force another poor outing from C.J. Stroud.\n\nDeMeco Ryans’ team has been eliminated in the Divisional Round in consecutive seasons, and I see that trend continuing on Sunday.\n\nThe Rams are going to have to play much better than what they showed against Carolina, but Matthew Stafford and the L.A. offense are going to absolutely shred the Bears on Sunday.\n\nChicago couldn’t stop a nosebleed in the first half against Green Bay, and poor second-half coaching from Matt LaFleur — along with a godly throw on 4th-and-8 by Caleb Williams — is the only reason the Bears are still alive.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "Of the NFL's 32 franchises, 28 have reached the Super Bowl. Now meet the four teams still trying to get there.",
    "fullText": "The pinnacle of Roman numerals.\n\nWe’re talking about the Super Bowl, of course.\n\nOf the NFL’s 32 teams, 28 have reached the big game that spawns big theatrics. Quarterback Joe Namath predicted his New York Jets would upset the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 3, then delivered with a 16-7 victory. The New England Patriots rallied past the Atlanta Falcons despite trailing 28-3 in Super Bowl 51. And at the halftime show at Super Bowl 38, Janet Jackson experienced her infamous wardrobe malfunction.\n\nFour NFL teams have failed to play in the big game, much less win it. That sad fact may change when the 60th Super Bowl is played Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, at Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nSo without further adieu, let’s meet those sad-faced teams.\n\nThe Browns have suffered heartache, none so intense as in 1986, 1987 and 1989 – their three appearances in the AFC championship game. They lost all three to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe most painful one involved \"The Drive.\" Broncos quarterback John Elway drove Denver 98 yards on 15 plays and, with 37 second left in regulation, the Broncos tied the game at 20-20.\n\nThe Browns lost in overtime, 23-20.\n\nIn 1995, Cleveland turned its collective fury on Browns owner Art Modell when he announced he was moving the team to Baltimore. When the NFL awarded Cleveland an expansion franchise in 1999, some fans thought with Modell gone, the Super Bowl drought might finally end.\n\nSince then, the Browns have won only one playoff game.\n\nNothing captures the Browns’ version of dysfunction more than the team having had 42 starting quarterbacks since 1999. That includes Deshaun Watson, who the Browns acquired in 2022 through a blockbuster trade that turned out to be a blockheaded trade.\n\nWatson will go down in Browns infamy, a crowded room reserved for the likes of Johnny Manziel and Tim Couch.\n\nBut can Shedeur Sanders, the Browns' 42nd starting quarterback since 1999, lead the Browns to the Promised Land?\n\nThe Lions know abject losing, cruelty and squandered opportunity.\n\nCase in point: During the Hall of Fame career of Barry Sanders, the Lions won a single playoff game.\n\nIn 2023, the Lions reached the NFC championship game for only the second time in franchise history and at halftime led the San Francisco 49ers 24-7. Did we mention squandered opportunity?\n\nThe Lions lost the game, 34-31.\n\nLast year, the Lions entered the playoffs widely regarded as a favorite to win the Super Bowl. And they were 9.5-point favorites against the Washington Commanders in their playoff opener in Detroit.\n\nThen history reared its ugly head, and the Lions suffered a stunning 45-31 loss.\n\nThe team’s all-time playoff record is 9-15, which did not need to be updated this season after the Lions failed to make the postseason.\n\nThe Texans have not suffered the same shame and misery as have the Browns and Lions. After all, the Texans didn’t have their inaugural season until 2002, meaning they’ve only been eligible for 25 Super Bowls, counting the one being played this year.\n\nHouston is two victories away from reaching the big game. It would require the Texans to beat the New England Patriots in a divisional playoff matchup and then prevail in the AFC championship game against the winner of the divisional matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Texans have never played in the AFC championship game; the team has won only wild card games.\n\nThe team’s all-time playoff record is 7-8 − 7-2 in wild card games and 0-6 in divisional games.\n\nLike the Texans, the Jaguars deserve some grace. The team did not make its NFL debut until 1995. Remarkably, the Jaguars reached the AFC championship game in only their second season before losing to the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Jaguars have reached the AFC championship game twice more, losing to the Tennessee Titans 33-14 in January 2000 and squaring off against the Patriots again in January 2018.\n\nThe Jaguars led the Patriots 20-10 early in the fourth quarter on the road before Tom Brady rallied the Patriots to a 24-20 victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Which NFL teams have never played in the Super Bowl?

    "fullText": "Broncos' key defensive starter likely won't return this season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos have been as healthy as any team in the NFL this season, but heading into the divisional round of the playoffs against the Buffalo Bills, it appears that one of their defensive starters won't play again this season.\n\nIn his second season with the Broncos, Jones suffered a pectoral injury in Week 15 against the Green Bay Packers. He was placed on injured reserve, but there was hope at the time that he might be able to return for the playoffs.\n\nBroncos 9News insider Mike Klis reported that Jones, who has undergone surgery for a torn pectoral muscle, could be back for the Super Bowl if the Broncos get to Santa Clara. However, Broncos head coach Sean Payton sounded much less enthusiastic about that. When asked directly if Jones could be back at some point this season, Payton simply said, \"I don't think so\".\n\nSean Payton was asked by @ParkerJGabriel if he thinks Brandon Jones will play again this year.\n\n“I don’t think so.” pic.twitter.com/4esKqOzqA1\n\n— Luca Evans (@bylucaevans) January 13, 2026\n\nThat seems like the most likely scenario, as unfortunate as that is. A torn pectoral is not something that you can return quickly from, so Jones will likely be shut down for the season at this point, cheering his team on from the sidelines. In his place, P.J. Locke has been placed back into the starting lineup.\n\nLocke has started each of the team's last three games and has 16 tackles and three pass breakups on the season. He left the team's Week 18 game against the Los Angeles Chargers with a leg injury, but has been a full participant in practice this week. Devon Key and JL Skinner are the other safeties on the 53-man roster.\n\nREAD:Broncos' Pro Bowler given more reason to be named first-ever winner of new award\n\nIt's tough to lose Jones, who has been great for the team. He and Talanoa Hufanga made up one of the better safety combinations in the league this season. In his two seasons with the Broncos, Jones has recorded 193 tackles, four interceptions, 17 pass deflections and one fumble recovery.

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma City Thunder finally picked up their first win against the San Antonio Spurs, and it took them four games to do it. The defending champions breathed a huge sigh of relief after avoiding a regular-season sweep, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, true to his confident self, declared that the game was not as important as the external noise made it seem.\n\nBefore the Thunder’s first loss to the Spurs, they looked seemingly unbeatable, barring flukes. But Victor Wembanyama and company exposed glaring flawsand showed the league that beating them was possible. Gilgeous-Alexander, after finally avoiding defeat against the Frenchman, admitted that the Thunder did not see this coming.\n\nThe Spurs made them uncomfortable, but the reigning MVP feels that it was how they grew as a team. That’s what ultimately led them to their 119-98 win earlier today.\n\n*“They got the better of us the last three times we played them [and] that doesn’t happen to this group,”* Gilgeous-Alexander said.* “I can’t remember the last time its happened. But yeah, uncomfortable feelings and adversity is where you find growth that defines who you are.”*\n\n“And we showed that tonight,” the Canadian star added, before taking a dig at the magnitude of the occasion for the Spurs.\n\n*“Tonight wasn’t our super bowl. It wasn’t anything but another game in an 82 game season. We gotta [keep] finding ways to be better.” *\n\nWas this Gilgeous-Alexander trying to be nonchalant? Perhaps. Losing to a team four times in a regular season would have clearly shown the rest of the NBA that the Spurs were a true kryptonite for the Thunder. And although it does not matter in the long run, no team would want that next to its record.\n\nThe discussion will be over for now. The Thunder showed that they can beat the Spurs. Next, they may meet in the post-season where winning actually means more. If the Thunder fail there, Gilgeous-Alexander’s “this wasn’t our superbowl” comment would surely be revisited.\n\nThunder vs Spurs may very well be the NBA’s next big rivalry.\n\nThe post “Tonight Wasn’t Our Super Bowl”: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Trolls Spurs After 21-Point Blowout Win appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles had also seen enough of the Eagles’ underperforming offense.\n\n“Frustrated” watching elite talent fail to produce, he believes the Eagles, whose season ended in the wild-card round of the playoffs, realized their offense was broken much earlier than they let on.\n\nOn “The SZN with Nick Foles and Evan Moore” podcast, Foles said the Eagles are ready to replace first-year offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo.\n\n“I’m telling you, they’ve already got a plan in place,” Foles said. “They’re not just caught off guard by this. They’ve had all season to prepare. I think at the halfway mark, we knew what was going to happen, but Eagles fans and football fans were thinking like, ‘Hey, maybe they’ll figure it out.’ They never did. But I guarantee you, behind closed walls in a secret little dungeon, someone was researching who the next OC of the Philadelphia Eagles will be.”\n\nFoles believes the Eagles have been studying former head coaches Mike McDaniel (Miami Dolphins) and Brian Daboll (New York Giants) to gauge whether their styles would fit the Eagles’ personnel.\n\nFoles agreed with how a previous guest, former NFL cornerback and Amazon NFL analyst Richard Sherman, described the Eagles’ offense.\n\n“I thought he explained it perfectly with his illustration,” Foles said. “It’s like you have a Ferrari and you put a Toyota Corolla engine in it and you have all the pieces. It looks like a Ferrari, but it just doesn’t run and sound like a Ferrari. I was hoping that the Eagles did that this year with the offense because they have the parts. It looks like a Ferrari. It ran like a Ferrari last year. All these parts and the engine’s a little different. It was the same old story, which is frustrating.”\n\nDespite big names such as quarterback Jalen Hurts, running back Saquon Barkley, wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert, the unit finished the regular season ranked 24th in total offense (311.2 yards per game), 23rd in passing offense (194.3 yards per game) and 18th in rushing offense (116.9 yards per game).\n\nThe Eagles know where they’ll be picking in the first round of the 2026 NFL draft\n\nEagles star Saquon Barkley after disappointing season: ‘I let my teammates down’\n\nCould Brian Daboll fix Eagles? 10 candidates for OC job if Kevin Patullo is fired\n\nWill Eagles star Lane Johnson return for 2026 season? ‘Whatever happens, happens’",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL playoff field started with 14 teams. With five of six wild-card games in the books, it's down to a fine nine ahead of the Steelers hosting the Texans in Pittsburgh for the wild weekend finale on Monday night.\n\nThere were some classic shootouts and games that came down to the wire and three was the unlucky seed number with both the Eagles and Jaguars being upset at home on Sunday.\n\nWith the two top-seeded bye teams prepping for playoff action and the NFC and AFC conference games almost set, here's an updated comparison of the teams still alive to win Super Bowl 60:\n\nThe Seahawks won a tough NFC West from which the Rams and their opponents, the 49ers, also made the divisional round. They have a dominant defense, balanced and explosive offense and are well coached by Mike Macdonald and Klint Kubiak. They should be ready for the rubber match with San Francisco after losing to the 49ers at home in Week 1. The key is Sam Darnold and the entire team avoiding lingering turnover issues.\n\nThe Patriots showed they were a complete and playoff-tough team under Mike Vrabel when their offense was contained by the Chargers. Drake Maye still overcame some tough pressure and made the plays when they counted most. The defense also sent a strong message with a dominant start in the wild-card round. They are looking like the steady playoff winner they used to be with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nMORE: How Drake Maye overcame turnovers to beat Chargers\n\nThe Broncos will get a tough draw against the Bills, but then again Buffalo's offense has hit snags when Josh Allen faces top pressure and coverage defenses on the road. Denver's defense will need to set the tone at home, where Bo Nix tends to lead the offense best. The Broncos will see the Patriots as expected in the AFC championship game as long as they don't get off to too slow of a start and play catchup to the Bills.\n\nThe Rams' defense has a lot of potential with its run stopping, pressure and coverage, but it has its share of holes. The good news, they got a rough game out of their system against the Panthers.\n\nMatthew Stafford and Puka Nacua kept sizzling and trying to pass well enough to outscore them is a real challenge. With L.A. getting over an early scare, it should be refocused to rebound stronger for the divisional round.\n\nMORE: Three problems Sean McVay, Rams must fix after beating Panthers\n\nThe Bills got over a massive playoff obstacle in Josh Allen's first road wild-card game by outlasting the tough Jaguars by making fewer mistakes in the clutch, leading to a 27-24 fourth-quarter escape. In the divisional round, Allen will look up and see no Chiefs, Ravens or Bengals still in the AFC playoff mix.\n\nAllen has proved to be the great postseason equalizer and then some when their running game and defense are off. He should be the most trusted big-play and clutch QB left in the field.\n\nMORE: Three reasons why Bills passed their toughest test vs. Jags\n\nThe Bears seem to keep living dangerously as the worst total defense in the playoffs and have been too dependent on getting key takeaways. It had to feel good that they could win a game when four fumbles by the Packers didn't go their way and had zero interceptions from Jordan Love.\n\nIt would be nice for Ben Johnson  if Caleb Williams and the offense to start faster instead of waiting to explode while exploiting the best passing game matchups in the fourth quarter. Getting the league's No. 3 rushing offense going early would help. They will be ready to be better all-around after getting valuable playoff experience to take down their archrivals at home.\n\nMORE: How Caleb Williams made Bears' history in comeback victory over Packers\n\nThe 49ers took out the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles in Philadelphia with a gritty shorthanded defensive performance for the ages. They also had to adjust to yet another big offensive injury to George Kittle, grinding away with Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey with great playoff scheming by Kyle Shanahan. They might not have enough health in their favor to get to another Super Bowl, but their experience can't be ignored in a still wide-open field.\n\nMORE: Christian Mcaffrey shines with 2 TDs in upset victory over Eagles\n\nThe Texans have won playoff games in each of the previous two trips with C.J. Stroud at quarterback under DeMeco Ryans. They draw a tough even matchup against the low-scoring, defensive-minded Steelers on Monday night. They will need to get hot offensively and score more to advance and have a shot against the Patriots on the road.\n\nThe Steelers are hoping that Aaron Rodgers can have some throwback magic left in him at 41 with DK Metcalf returning to raise the big-play potential for their QB's still strong arm. But equal keys is finding a consistent running game and much improving the defensive communication. It might be asking too much for the Steelers to win ugly more than once.",

    "title": "2026 NFL offseason preview: Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl window hinges on fixing a broken offense",
    "description": "Here's a look at the offseason work ahead for the Philadelphia Eagles.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, and Yahoo Sports is previewing the coming months for all 32 teams, from free agency through the draft and more.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets\nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n2025 season record: 11-6 (u 11.5 wins), first in NFC East, lost to 49ers in wild-card round, 13th in DVOA\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. Last season. Philadelphia battled with some inconsistency in the offense but found a groove by the end of the season. The 2025 version never fully got it.\n\nHow the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The 2024 Eagles figured it out, while the 2025 version couldn’t adapt. Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo might take the fall for that, failing to replicate the work Kellen Moore did previously.\n\nThe talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nThe Eagles have just over $14 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap. That ranks 16th. They’re fairly locked into this roster. Because of how the Eagles have structured their contracts, there’s not a lot of restructure potential — most contracts are pre-restuctured with small base salaries and option bonuses. If the Eagles re-sign Dallas Goedert early, they could create space by shrinking the $20.5 million figure that would hit the cap when his contract voids on Feb. 16.\n\nTE Dallas Goedert \nEdge Jaelan Phillips \nLB Nakobe Dean \nS Reed Blankenship\n\nGoedert led the team and was ninth in the league with a 27.8% target share in the red zone. His 10 red zone touchdowns were second only to Davante Adams. Jaelan Phillips was a defense-changer after the trade that brought him to Philadelphia. From Weeks 1-9, the Eagles were 14th in pressure rate. After Phillips was acquired, they ranked fifth. Dean has been excellent and was immediately put back into the starting lineup when he returned from injury, but the presence of Jihaad Campbell and the high rate of nickel defense will likely make Dean expendable in free agency.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are two of the best players at their positions, but the second outside cornerback spot was a hole all season. Adoree’ Jackson was one of the most targeted cornerbacks on a per-snap basis and the Eagles ranked 24th in DVOA against WR2s.\n\nEven if Goedert is re-signed, the Eagles should add a tight end to the mix. Grant Calcaterra was a negative as a blocker and did not make up for it enough as a receiver — though the Eagles were fifth in EPA per play from 12 personnel, which they ran at the 12th-highest rate in the league.\n\nDepth on the edge will need to be addressed. That was the reason for the Phillips trade and bringing Brandon Graham out of retirement. Neither of them is under contract for 2026.\n\n1st round \n2nd round \n3rd round \n3rd round (projected compensatory) \n4th round \n4th round (projected compensatory) \n5th round (ATL) \n5th round (projected compensatory)\n6th round\n\nThe Eagles have built their dominance through the trenches, and now they find Lane Johnson’s long-term replacement. Lomu moves well for his size, and has polished technique and can add even more weight and strength. He can learn behind Jeff Stoutland and the All-Pros they have along the line before taking over himself.\n\nThe Eagles went 10-7 against the spread in the 2025-26 regular season, but were only 8-7 ATS as a favorite. They were also a surprisingly poor 4-4 ATS at home. — Ben Fawkes",

    "fullText": "The NFL play-offs continued with another nail-biting game as the Buffalo Bills claimed a 27-24 win at the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nA late interception by Buffalo safety Cole Bishop allowed the Bills to clinch victory after Josh Allen, the league's reigning Most Valuable Player, put them back in front with one minute four seconds of the game remaining.\n\nBuffalo were the pre-season Super Bowl favourites but have had to hit the road in the play-offs having failed to retain the AFC East title, while Jacksonville won the AFC South.\n\nThe Jaguars ended the regular season on an eight-game winning streak to secure the AFC's third seed, while Buffalo are the sixth, and most of Sunday's Wildcard Weekend game was a tight affair.\n\nBuffalo led 10-7 at half-time, then 13-10 heading into the fourth quarter, when the lead changed hands four times in a nerve-racking finale.\n\nQuarterbacks Trevor Lawrence and Allen then produced a shootout, with former number one draft pick Lawrence making touchdown passes to Parker Washington and Travis Etienne.\n\nBuffalo replied with Allen finding Dalton Kincaid for a score before barging over for his second rushing TD, which ultimately proved decisive.\n\nThere was enough time for Lawrence to lead a game-winning drive but he was picked off by Bishop to keep alive Allen's hopes of reaching his first Super Bowl.\n\nThis season could be his best chance yet to reach the NFL's championship game as the Kansas City Chiefs, who knocked Buffalo out in four of the past five years, have failed to reach this season's play-offs.",

    "fullText": "Jacksonville hosts Buffalo in the AFC Wild Card Round on Saturday, and despite this shaping up as Josh Allen’s prime Super Bowl opportunity, our Bills vs. Jaguars predictions see the Jaguars putting up stiff resistance right away.\n\nTake a deep dive into our best bets before kickoff comes at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday, January 11.\n\nEtienne Jr. anytime TD (-140 at FanDuel)\n\nAllen o227.5 passing yards (-114 at FanDuel)\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are small road favorites, but they really shouldn't be since the Jacksonville Jaguars enter the playoffs red-hot, going 8-0 SU and ATS in their last eight games.\n\nThe Jaguars finished the regular season with one more win than Buffalo, despite facing a tougher schedule, and are also slightly higher in the DVOA ratings.\n\nJacksonville is fifth in the league in defensive EPA and has been strong against both the run and pass. On the other side of the ball, Travis Etienne will churn out yards against a Bills run defense that is near the bottom of the league in every metric.\n\nThis total is too high when you consider that Buffalo has allowed the fewest passing yards per game in the NFL (156.9) while the Jags have allowed a league-low 85.6 ypg on the ground. Expect both teams to try to control this game on the ground, leading to the Under 51.5 cashing.\n\nThe Bills have allowed more rushing touchdowns to running backs than any team in the NFL, giving up 18 this season. Factor in catches, and running backs have scored 21 total against them.\n\nThat’s not the only reason Travis Etienne Jr. is the best bet on the board for the Jaguars, as Buffalo has also surrendered the sixth-fewest passing touchdowns, with just 19 through 17 games.\n\nExpect the Jaguars’ running back to find what many call the “ETN-zone” at least once.\n\nJosh Allen has always performed at a high level in the playoffs, and Sunday marks the start of a hopeful Super Bowl run for the Buffalo Bills. The quarterback didn’t play in the season finale against the New York Jets, but he did cash the Over in passing yards in two of his previous four games.\n\nThe last time Allen took the field, he threw for 262 yards in a 13-12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The signal-caller threw for 3,668 yards this season, and while he averaged just 187 yards per contest on the road, there’s reason to believe he’ll ball out on Sunday.\n\nThe Jags’ secondary ranks 21st in the NFL in passing yards allowed. This is not a strength for Jacksonville. After a week off, I’ll take Allen to make his presence felt downfield.\n\nEverBank Stadium, Jacksonville, FL\n\nMonitor gametime conditions with our live NFL weather info and learn how weather impacts NFL betting.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "From Davos and the Super Bowl to Burning Man and St. Barts, see the predictable social calendar billionaires follow and how much it all costs.",
    "fullText": "Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed.\n\nThe world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences.\n\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider.\n\nEach year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said.\n\n2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars.\n\nHere's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them.\n\nBusiness leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs.\n\nThis year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed \"A Spirit of Dialogue.\" While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nAccess to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public.\n\nApartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog.\n\nNFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on.\n\nThese billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment,\" Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nHost committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash.\n\nThe most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year.\n\nAs Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires.\n\nOprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee \"The Nickel Boys\" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont.\n\nThis year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful \"Hamnet,\" and James Cameron, director of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\n\nThe Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires.\n\nEach year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters.\n\nThe tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members.\n\nWarren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave.\n\nThe general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system.\n\nEvery year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles.\n\nDubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters.\n\nWhile the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers.\n\nThe event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission.\n\nWhile billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup,\" Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nThe soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market.\n\nWhile the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool.\n\nThere will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal.\n\nPrivate jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference.\n\nSince 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.\n\nThe conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995.\n\nLast year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced.\n\nThe vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nBurning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades.\n\nGoogle cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019.\n\nLast year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years.\n\nStill, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way.\n\nThis year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project.\n\nThe coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys.\n\nThe 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons.\n\nLast year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million.\n\nIn the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show.\n\nThe Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800.\n\nOctober presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections.\n\nFirst, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there.\n\nShortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit.\n\nLast year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill.\n\nA painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps.\n\nWhile the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs.\n\nFormula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades.\n\nThe racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures.\n\nThe various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names.\n\nLast year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll.\n\nThree-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options.\n\nWhile Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year.\n\nLast year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club.\n\nFor those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"",

Yet there's a lot more to winning than just rankings; it takes team chemistry, skill and just the perfect amount of luck to make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nHowever, some fans believe that none of that matters because the two teams playing in the big game can be predicted by the year's Super Bowl logo.\n\nHere's the story behind the theory and what teams might be on the way to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe theory is that the colors included in that year's Super Bowl logo are the colors of the two teams that will play in the Super Bowl that year.\n\nThe theory came to be after fans started to notice that teams that made it to the big game had their colors incorporated into the big game logo for that year. The NFL Super Bowl logo is released a year before the big game, so there's no way anyone could accurately predict which teams would be playing each year.\n\nSo this isn't just an arbitrary theory, there is some evidence to it ... or coincidences, believers say.\n\nFor Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the logo featured red, orange and yellow tones. The two teams to play that year were the Los Angeles Rams, sporting blue and yellow uniforms, and the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing orange and black.\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LVII in 2023, which was played in Glendale, shows a red-rock desert background with pink, teal and orangey-red colors. The two teams that played that year were the red Kansas City Chiefs and green Philadelphia Eagles, which are similar enough to the logo colors for the theory to continue.\n\nHowever, the Super Bowl LVIII logo in 2024 featured a purple and pinkish-red color, which did not predict the showdown between the Chiefs and the 49ers, as both teams' colors are red and do not incorporate any purple. True believers of the conspiracy theory think this happened because the purple Baltimore Ravens had to be eliminated to make way for Travis Kelce's Chiefs and his pop-star girlfriend, Taylor Swift, to draw more fans to the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LIX logo in 2025 was green and red coloring to it, and once again, the Chiefs and Eagles played in the Super Bowl, keeping the theory alive.\n\n🚨JUST IN: NBC HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL 2025 SUPER BOWL LOGO.\n\n👀👀👀 \n\nWow… pic.twitter.com/Lr9JBjGURl\n\n— MLFootball (@MLFootball) February 10, 2025\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LX was revealed in February 2025 and features a multitude of bright colors, making it difficult to narrow down which team it could represent.\n\nPink and blue are the main colors featured in this year's brightly colored logo; however, since no teams have pink in their jerseys, the main colors to look for are blue, green, and yellow.\n\nTo narrow down what this could mean for the logo theory, here are some teams that incorporate those colors into their uniforms.\n\nOut of that list, the teams that are currently still in the playoffs are: Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nWith all the differing colors and teams these colors could represent, there are many theories as to what this logo could mean.\n\nThe discord between logo theorists will continue until it's really revealed which two teams will play in the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LX is on Sunday, February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Who will play in the 2026 Super Bowl?

    "description": "Answering questions about the 49ers on offense, defense, and special teams ahead of the playoffs",
    "fullText": "After a one-year hiatus, the San Francisco 49ers return to the playoffs. The regular season has been full of rollercoaster moments. The highs include thrilling victories over the Rams and Bears, while the lows feature losing two of the best players in the league at their respective positions.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about Kyle Shanahan this year. Despite all the injuries the offense endured throughout the season, his scheme proved it can transcend the absence of star players. The 49ers were once again prolific offensively, finishing second in schedule-adjusted efficiency and third in success rate.\n\nIf the 49ers are going to make a playoff run, it’ll need to be on the backs of their offense. The defense showed some fight in Week 18, but the depth is depleted, and the margin for error no longer exists. Any drive that doesn’t result in points is a win for Robert Saleh.\n\nExpectations reset in the playoffs. What you did for 17 games doesn’t matter. It’s about which team executes for 50 minutes. With that in mind, let’s discuss five unanswered questions about the 49ers as they enter the playoffs.\n\nLooking at various numbers daily, the ones that show the most correlation with winning are passing success rate and generating explosive plays through the air. For the season, the 49ers finished third in passing success rate, at 53.1 percent. Since Week 11, the offense remained consistent, sitting third once more at 52.8 percent.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense was below league average this season in explosive play rate through the air, ranking 20th. They were much better in the final three games, ranking third, which is encouraging coming out of the bye week. Still, over the final 10 games, on a larger sample, the Niners were 20th.\n\nWeek 18 was a prime example of how difficult offense can be when you don’t generate explosives. The 49ers did it on one drive, and they quickly marched down the field and into the red zone. Outside of that drive, it was tough sledding for the offense.\n\nI’d expect Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff to review the Week 13 matchup between the Eagles and the Chicago Bears and watch it closely, perhaps stealing some of the concepts involving motion.. Ben Johnson windrow dressed his way up and down the field, had Philadelphia’s second-level defenders confused, and found a way to control the game, despite only one explosive passing play. It’s possible, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThere are a couple of trains of thought when it comes to fourth-down decision-making. Before we share those, there is nothing more valuable in football than possessing the ball. The best chance you have to win in this league is when you have the ball.\n\nKnowing that, teams are either uber-aggressive on fourth down because they know their offense is potent and can pick up whatever yardage they need. Then there are the coaches with elite defenses. If you know your defense is stingy, then you can afford to go for it on fourth down because you understand there is a high probability that you get the ball back.\n\nIn Week 18, Shanahan punted the ball on 4th & 2 from San Francisco’s 43-yard line. In a game like that, where every possession is so valuable, the probability of you gaining two yards, retaining the ball, and going down to score was well worth being wrong about.\n\nThere was zero indication that your defense could get a stop up to that point. The Seahawks scored on their previous drive and reached 1st & goal at the 1-yard line on their first drive. The odds that you were going to prevent Seattle from getting to the 43 were slim. Sure enough, Shanahan punted.\n\nThe result worked out, as the Seahawks missed the field goal. However, that doesn’t feel like the right way to look at it. You still didn’t score, nor did the defense stop Seattle from getting to the yard where you punted.\n\nShanahan went for it on the next fourth down. The offense needed one yard. They didn’t convert. That doesn’t mean the decision to go was incorrect. On the ensuing drive, the defense had a free run at Sam Darnold. They should have ended the possession scoreless had Dee Winters sacked Darnold. They allowed a field goal, which works.\n\nHow aggressive will Shanahan be on fourth downs in the postseason? The strength of this team is on offense. Shanahan was correct more often than not during the regular season when it came time to go for it.\n\nAlmost every team is above 50% on correct decisions now.\n\nSharp contrast to a decade ago when only a couple teams would be > 50%.\n\nLook at Carroll/Vrabel! pic.twitter.com/9Q9grE5jdK\n\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) January 5, 2026\n\nThe 49ers are at their best when the offense is on the field. Even against a top defense like the Eagles, keeping the offense out there on fourth downs will give them the best chance to win.\n\nSaleh will put you in a position to make a play. The 49ers are short on talent defensively, but that doesn’t excuse the mental mistakes or missed tackles. The Niners had 23 missed tackles in Week 18, leading to 272 yards after contact.\n\nA.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith aren’t known for being YAC merchants, but they’re not easy to get on the ground. Neither is Dallas Goedert. Saquon Barkley had 759 yards after contact this season. The Eagles have playmakers who can make you look silly.\n\nThe 49ers’ secondary will be put in a position, time after time, in the playoffs to make a 1-on-1 tackle. Malik Mustapha has a broken+missed tackle percentage of 26 percent, which is the 18th-highest among all defensive backs in the NFL. Deommodore Lenoir sits at 22.8, and Ji’Ayir Brown is 22.2 percent.\n\nIt’s problematic when both of your safeties and the corner that you put in cloud coverage as the primary force defender are consistently missing tackles. That’s not on Saleh when his players are whiffing. He can’t tackle for them.\n\nYou can control tackling. It wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners started Eric Kendricks and Kyzir White this Sunday. Since Fred Warner went down, missed tackles at linebacker have been problematic. The Eagles’ offense has been bogged down all year. The last thing Saleh’s unit can afford to do is give them extra chances and free yards because of missed tackles.\n\nSeattle went 6-for-13 on third down, but went 0-for-3 in the red zone in Week 18. The Bears went 6-for-12 on third down, but were 1-for-3 in the red zone. The Colts were 5-for-10 on third downs and scored a touchdown on both of their red zone trips.\n\nTeams have no issues moving the ball on the 49ers’ defense. That’s been a given all season. The postseason success will come down to whether Saleh’s unit can get off the field on third downs or force field goals in the red zone.\n\nFor the season, the 49ers were 10th in opponent red zone touchdown scoring percentage at 53.7 percent and 50 percent during the final ten games. They were 21st in opponent third-down conversion rate, one spot behind the Eagles.\n\nIt comes back to possessing the ball. Your offense needs to be on the field. One way the 49ers’ defense can keep the offense in the game is by holding their opponent to three points or forcing a third-down stop before they reach field-goal range. It doesn’t have to be the majority of the time, either. A 40 percent third-down rate allowed should be plenty good.\n\nIn Week 18, Jake Moody missed a 24-yard field goal after doinking a kick off the upright. Eddy Pineiro’s one miss came at the end of the half from nearly 60 yards. Pineiro’s near-perfection will come in handy this postseason.\n\nThe 49ers’ opponent’s kicking percentage should also benefit them. Last year, teams kicking against the 49ers made 96 percent of their kicks. This season, it’s been a league-low 66.6 percent — nearly six percentage points better than the team in second place.\n\nThe 49ers finished the season ranked 13th in special teams DVOA. The Eagles were 24th. Thanks to Skyy Moore and Brian Robinson, San Francisco was fifth in kickoff returns. Flipping the field once in a playoff game would be huge for multiple reasons.\n\nSurprisingly, the Niners lead the league in hidden points on special teams. It’s something that has been dragging the team down, arguably every season under Shanahan. But this year it’s been one of the biggest strengths on a 12-win team.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoff field is set. We know where all 14 teams will start their run to Super Bowl 60. We don't know where it will end -- just that a dozen franchises will fall short of their goal of making it to Santa Clara for the biggest game of the year.\n\nSome teams will have a smoother road to follow than others. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos earned a well-deserved week off and homefield advantage through their respective sides of the bracket by taking the top seeds in each conference. The Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Chargers, on the other hand, are three road wins away from even getting to see the Lombardi Trophy in person.\n\nWho's got it the easiest? Whose playoff schedule is the hardest? That's what we're gonna find out.\n\nLet's start with the softest paths to the Super Bowl in each conference. And because the obvious answer is \"the team that got the bye,\" let's exclude the Seahawks and Broncos.\n\nThe Rams missed out on a bye by giving up one of 2025's least likely comebacks in a Week 16 loss to the Seahawks. Their punishment? A trip to face the only team in this year's playoff field with a losing record and a point differential roughly on par with the Miami Dolphins. Los Angeles gets to face the league's 22nd-ranked defense and an offense led by Bryce Young. Young, despite his improvements, failed to crack the top 25 among starters when it came to:\n\nand ranked 25th in interception rate. That is balm for a burned defense. Sure, the Rams had a six-game winning streak snapped in Charlotte as a 10-point favorite this fall, but that was on a sloppy, rainy day that provided head coach Sean McVay a blueprint of what not to do in a game that matters.\n\nNext up, if all the top seeds win in Wild Card weekend, would be a game against the Seahawks -- a team the Rams split their season series against thanks to a late implosion in that aforementioned come-from-ahead less. LA would face off against Sam Darnold, who has faded down the stretch in each of his last two otherwise remarkable seasons.\n\nThe NFC title game could feature a showdown against a Niners team the Rams beat by 16 on the road (but lost to in overtime at home) or against Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears. Williams excels against the blitz but struggles with pressure generated by a four-man front. Los Angeles has a top-five pressure rate and a bottom-four blitz rate. It should be able to contain the Bears' late-game surges.\n\nThe Patriots have the top non-bye seed in the AFC. Week 18 delivered them from an early rematch with a Buffalo Bills team that beat them in Gillette Stadium four weeks earlier, erasing a 21-0 deficit in the process.\n\nInstead, they get to face Justin Herbert, author of one of the most crushing postseason defeats in Los Angeles Chargers history (a franchise well versed in them). Los Angeles is a different team than the one that allowed Jacksonville to rally back from a 27-0 deficit in 2023, but Justin Herbert, 0-2 in the playoffs, remains.\n\nHerbert is better than his record suggests and is bolstered by a dominant defense. But he lost last year's postseason opener thanks in part to a Houston pass rush that pressured him on one-third of his dropbacks. The Patriots have generated pressure on 35 percent of passing plays this winter and have Milton Williams back in the lineup to create chaos from the middle of the line. So when LA's backup tackles collapse, Herbert -- more pressured in 2025 than ever in his career -- won't be able to step up in the pocket and create magic.\n\nNext likely comes a date in Foxborough with the Jaguars, Steelers or Bills. Any would be a tough out, but New England has handled Buffalo before. The Steelers have a one-man receiving corps that plays nicely into Christian Gonzalez's presence on the boundary. Jacksonville, as good as its been, is prone to glitching. So is the Denver offense with Bo Nix, which leaves the possibility of a throwback to the Tom Brady days and a home game with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n\nHonorable mention here belongs to those Jaguars, who are riding an eight-game win streak and get to face a Buffalo Bills team that's been uneven throughout 2025 and has few reliable targets to offer Josh Allen. But they still have Josh Allen, which makes their Wild Card matchup at least 40 percent terrifying.\n\nNow let's take a look at the teams with the hardest paths to Super Bowl 60.\n\nThe Packers came into Week 18 knowing they were set to face a team against whom they'd already lost. Thus, we were subjected to Clayton Tune and the worst up-the-middle run in modern NFL history.\n\nThe good news was they managed to avoid a date with the Philadelphia Eagles, who they have not beaten in the Jordan Love era (0-4 if you count his 2022 play in relief of Aaron Rodgers). The bad news is they have to face the Bears, an arch rival in search of their first playoff win since 2010 and eager to upend the franchise that's embarrassed them for the bulk of the last three decades.\n\nGreen Bay split the season series with Chicago but gave up a 10-point lead in the final two minutes at Soldier Field in a game that effectively decided the AFC North champion in Week 16. Jordan Love will be back at full strength after missing most of that matchup with a head injury. Micah Parsons will not, due to a torn ACL. That's a problem.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Williams' passer rating jumps from 83.0 to 104.5 when biltzed. He's also significantly worse when pressured, which suggests he's identifying blitzes, finding open spaces and making quick decisions for easy gains. Without Parsons as a phantom able to crash the pocket from anywhere, the Packer defense has struggled to consistently generate pressure; in their last three games their pressure rate has fluctuated from 40 to 24 to 44 percent.\n\nIf the Packers start sending extra pass rushers on third down, Williams is equipped to handle it. Next up would be the Seattle Seahawks. While we touched on Darnold's late-season struggles, it's also worth noting he's *also* stable against the blitz (his expected points added per dropback rise from 0.05 to 0.08). Green Bay knew it needed to generate a pass rush without blitzing to take down the NFC's best quarterbacks. That's why they traded two first round picks and Kenny Clark for Parsons.\n\nTough break. Especially for a team that cannot possibly host a playoff game this January.\n\nBuffalo is a slight favorite in Jacksonville in the Wild Card, which is a reflection on the Jaguars' past rather than their current status. The Bills depleted secondary has to take on Trevor Lawrence, winner of eight straight games and the league's third-best quarterback (behind Drake Maye and Jordan Love) in terms of EPA per dropback in that stretch (24 total touchdowns, six turnovers). In that same span, the Bills' pass defense has been solid (seventh-best) but its run defense has been awful (29th), giving Jacksonville plenty of leverage should its incredible quarterback sputter.\n\nIf the top seeds hold serve aside from the Jags, a date with the Denver Broncos swarming-but-somehow-underwhelming defense awaits. That group only ranks eighth in total defensive efficiency, but has Patrick Surtain II in the secondary to erase whomever gets the call to be Josh Allen's top target in the Divisional Round. Is Keon Coleman gonna go out there and draw interference flags on Riley Moss? Josh Palmer? Tyrell Shavers?\n\nAllen will have to take matters into his own hands against a defense that's only allowed 18.3 rushing yards per game to quarterbacks in 2025. Go further down the line in a potential AFC title game and you've got an awful run defense matched up against overperforming tailbacks like Rhamondre Stevenson, Jaylen Warren or the Chargers' young duo of Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal.\n\nThe Bills can absolutely make it to the Super Bowl because Josh Allen is a Ford F-150 some trickster god made human. But it's going to require some unheralded players to step up and flesh out his passing game while producing the run stops that force opponents into third-and-long situations. Otherwise, the rest of the AFC is built to poke holes in Buffalo's latest playoff hopes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Who has the easiest, toughest paths to Super Bowl 60?",
