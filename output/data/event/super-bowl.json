    "fullText": "As the 2026 Super Bowl creeps closer and closer, fans have started to make their predictions as to which two teams will play in the big game.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed, while the Denver Broncos are the AFC's No.1 seed. Yet there's a lot more to winning than just rankings; it takes team chemistry, skill and just the perfect amount of luck to make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nHowever, some fans believe that none of that matters because the two teams playing in the big game can be predicted by the year's Super Bowl logo.\n\nHere's the story behind the theory and what teams might be on the way to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe theory is that the colors included in that year's Super Bowl logo are the colors of the two teams that will play in the Super Bowl that year.\n\nThe theory came to be after fans started to notice that teams that made it to the big game had their colors incorporated into the big game logo for that year. The NFL Super Bowl logo is released a year before the big game, so there's no way anyone could accurately predict which teams would be playing each year.\n\nSo this isn't just an arbitrary theory, there is some evidence to it ... or coincidences, believers say.\n\nFor Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the logo featured red, orange and yellow tones. The two teams to play that year were the Los Angeles Rams, sporting blue and yellow uniforms, and the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing orange and black.\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LVII in 2023, which was played in Glendale, shows a red-rock desert background with pink, teal and orangey-red colors. The two teams that played that year were the red Kansas City Chiefs and green Philadelphia Eagles, which are similar enough to the logo colors for the theory to continue.\n\nHowever, the Super Bowl LVIII logo in 2024 featured a purple and pinkish-red color, which did not predict the showdown between the Chiefs and the 49ers, as both teams' colors are red and do not incorporate any purple. True believers of the conspiracy theory think this happened because the purple Baltimore Ravens had to be eliminated to make way for Travis Kelce's Chiefs and his pop-star girlfriend, Taylor Swift, to draw more fans to the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LIX logo in 2025 was green and red coloring to it, and once again, the Chiefs and Eagles played in the Super Bowl, keeping the theory alive.\n\n🚨JUST IN: NBC HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL 2025 SUPER BOWL LOGO.\n\n👀👀👀 \n\nWow… pic.twitter.com/Lr9JBjGURl\n\n— MLFootball (@MLFootball) February 10, 2025\n\nThe logo for Super Bowl LX was revealed in February 2025 and features a multitude of bright colors, making it difficult to narrow down which team it could represent.\n\nPink and blue are the main colors featured in this year's brightly colored logo; however, since no teams have pink in their jerseys, the main colors to look for are blue, green, and yellow.\n\nTo narrow down what this could mean for the logo theory, here are some teams that incorporate those colors into their uniforms.\n\nOut of that list, the teams that are currently still in the playoffs are: Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nWith all the differing colors and teams these colors could represent, there are many theories as to what this logo could mean.\n\nThe discord between logo theorists will continue until it's really revealed which two teams will play in the big game.\n\nThe Super Bowl LX is on Sunday, February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Who will play in the 2026 Super Bowl?

    "title": "5 unanswered questions about the 49ers ahead of the playoffs and any potential Super Bowl run",
    "description": "Answering questions about the 49ers on offense, defense, and special teams ahead of the playoffs",
    "fullText": "After a one-year hiatus, the San Francisco 49ers return to the playoffs. The regular season has been full of rollercoaster moments. The highs include thrilling victories over the Rams and Bears, while the lows feature losing two of the best players in the league at their respective positions.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about Kyle Shanahan this year. Despite all the injuries the offense endured throughout the season, his scheme proved it can transcend the absence of star players. The 49ers were once again prolific offensively, finishing second in schedule-adjusted efficiency and third in success rate.\n\nIf the 49ers are going to make a playoff run, it’ll need to be on the backs of their offense. The defense showed some fight in Week 18, but the depth is depleted, and the margin for error no longer exists. Any drive that doesn’t result in points is a win for Robert Saleh.\n\nExpectations reset in the playoffs. What you did for 17 games doesn’t matter. It’s about which team executes for 50 minutes. With that in mind, let’s discuss five unanswered questions about the 49ers as they enter the playoffs.\n\nLooking at various numbers daily, the ones that show the most correlation with winning are passing success rate and generating explosive plays through the air. For the season, the 49ers finished third in passing success rate, at 53.1 percent. Since Week 11, the offense remained consistent, sitting third once more at 52.8 percent.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense was below league average this season in explosive play rate through the air, ranking 20th. They were much better in the final three games, ranking third, which is encouraging coming out of the bye week. Still, over the final 10 games, on a larger sample, the Niners were 20th.\n\nWeek 18 was a prime example of how difficult offense can be when you don’t generate explosives. The 49ers did it on one drive, and they quickly marched down the field and into the red zone. Outside of that drive, it was tough sledding for the offense.\n\nI’d expect Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff to review the Week 13 matchup between the Eagles and the Chicago Bears and watch it closely, perhaps stealing some of the concepts involving motion.. Ben Johnson windrow dressed his way up and down the field, had Philadelphia’s second-level defenders confused, and found a way to control the game, despite only one explosive passing play. It’s possible, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThere are a couple of trains of thought when it comes to fourth-down decision-making. Before we share those, there is nothing more valuable in football than possessing the ball. The best chance you have to win in this league is when you have the ball.\n\nKnowing that, teams are either uber-aggressive on fourth down because they know their offense is potent and can pick up whatever yardage they need. Then there are the coaches with elite defenses. If you know your defense is stingy, then you can afford to go for it on fourth down because you understand there is a high probability that you get the ball back.\n\nIn Week 18, Shanahan punted the ball on 4th & 2 from San Francisco’s 43-yard line. In a game like that, where every possession is so valuable, the probability of you gaining two yards, retaining the ball, and going down to score was well worth being wrong about.\n\nThere was zero indication that your defense could get a stop up to that point. The Seahawks scored on their previous drive and reached 1st & goal at the 1-yard line on their first drive. The odds that you were going to prevent Seattle from getting to the 43 were slim. Sure enough, Shanahan punted.\n\nThe result worked out, as the Seahawks missed the field goal. However, that doesn’t feel like the right way to look at it. You still didn’t score, nor did the defense stop Seattle from getting to the yard where you punted.\n\nShanahan went for it on the next fourth down. The offense needed one yard. They didn’t convert. That doesn’t mean the decision to go was incorrect. On the ensuing drive, the defense had a free run at Sam Darnold. They should have ended the possession scoreless had Dee Winters sacked Darnold. They allowed a field goal, which works.\n\nHow aggressive will Shanahan be on fourth downs in the postseason? The strength of this team is on offense. Shanahan was correct more often than not during the regular season when it came time to go for it.\n\nAlmost every team is above 50% on correct decisions now.\n\nSharp contrast to a decade ago when only a couple teams would be > 50%.\n\nLook at Carroll/Vrabel! pic.twitter.com/9Q9grE5jdK\n\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) January 5, 2026\n\nThe 49ers are at their best when the offense is on the field. Even against a top defense like the Eagles, keeping the offense out there on fourth downs will give them the best chance to win.\n\nSaleh will put you in a position to make a play. The 49ers are short on talent defensively, but that doesn’t excuse the mental mistakes or missed tackles. The Niners had 23 missed tackles in Week 18, leading to 272 yards after contact.\n\nA.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith aren’t known for being YAC merchants, but they’re not easy to get on the ground. Neither is Dallas Goedert. Saquon Barkley had 759 yards after contact this season. The Eagles have playmakers who can make you look silly.\n\nThe 49ers’ secondary will be put in a position, time after time, in the playoffs to make a 1-on-1 tackle. Malik Mustapha has a broken+missed tackle percentage of 26 percent, which is the 18th-highest among all defensive backs in the NFL. Deommodore Lenoir sits at 22.8, and Ji’Ayir Brown is 22.2 percent.\n\nIt’s problematic when both of your safeties and the corner that you put in cloud coverage as the primary force defender are consistently missing tackles. That’s not on Saleh when his players are whiffing. He can’t tackle for them.\n\nYou can control tackling. It wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners started Eric Kendricks and Kyzir White this Sunday. Since Fred Warner went down, missed tackles at linebacker have been problematic. The Eagles’ offense has been bogged down all year. The last thing Saleh’s unit can afford to do is give them extra chances and free yards because of missed tackles.\n\nSeattle went 6-for-13 on third down, but went 0-for-3 in the red zone in Week 18. The Bears went 6-for-12 on third down, but were 1-for-3 in the red zone. The Colts were 5-for-10 on third downs and scored a touchdown on both of their red zone trips.\n\nTeams have no issues moving the ball on the 49ers’ defense. That’s been a given all season. The postseason success will come down to whether Saleh’s unit can get off the field on third downs or force field goals in the red zone.\n\nFor the season, the 49ers were 10th in opponent red zone touchdown scoring percentage at 53.7 percent and 50 percent during the final ten games. They were 21st in opponent third-down conversion rate, one spot behind the Eagles.\n\nIt comes back to possessing the ball. Your offense needs to be on the field. One way the 49ers’ defense can keep the offense in the game is by holding their opponent to three points or forcing a third-down stop before they reach field-goal range. It doesn’t have to be the majority of the time, either. A 40 percent third-down rate allowed should be plenty good.\n\nIn Week 18, Jake Moody missed a 24-yard field goal after doinking a kick off the upright. Eddy Pineiro’s one miss came at the end of the half from nearly 60 yards. Pineiro’s near-perfection will come in handy this postseason.\n\nThe 49ers’ opponent’s kicking percentage should also benefit them. Last year, teams kicking against the 49ers made 96 percent of their kicks. This season, it’s been a league-low 66.6 percent — nearly six percentage points better than the team in second place.\n\nThe 49ers finished the season ranked 13th in special teams DVOA. The Eagles were 24th. Thanks to Skyy Moore and Brian Robinson, San Francisco was fifth in kickoff returns. Flipping the field once in a playoff game would be huge for multiple reasons.\n\nSurprisingly, the Niners lead the league in hidden points on special teams. It’s something that has been dragging the team down, arguably every season under Shanahan. But this year it’s been one of the biggest strengths on a 12-win team.",

    "description": "Not counting the two teams who get Wild Card weekend off, which teams have the lightest lift to get to Super Bowl 60? Who'll carry the most weight?",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoff field is set. We know where all 14 teams will start their run to Super Bowl 60. We don't know where it will end -- just that a dozen franchises will fall short of their goal of making it to Santa Clara for the biggest game of the year.\n\nSome teams will have a smoother road to follow than others. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos earned a well-deserved week off and homefield advantage through their respective sides of the bracket by taking the top seeds in each conference. The Green Bay Packers and Los Angeles Chargers, on the other hand, are three road wins away from even getting to see the Lombardi Trophy in person.\n\nWho's got it the easiest? Whose playoff schedule is the hardest? That's what we're gonna find out.\n\nLet's start with the softest paths to the Super Bowl in each conference. And because the obvious answer is \"the team that got the bye,\" let's exclude the Seahawks and Broncos.\n\nThe Rams missed out on a bye by giving up one of 2025's least likely comebacks in a Week 16 loss to the Seahawks. Their punishment? A trip to face the only team in this year's playoff field with a losing record and a point differential roughly on par with the Miami Dolphins. Los Angeles gets to face the league's 22nd-ranked defense and an offense led by Bryce Young. Young, despite his improvements, failed to crack the top 25 among starters when it came to:\n\nand ranked 25th in interception rate. That is balm for a burned defense. Sure, the Rams had a six-game winning streak snapped in Charlotte as a 10-point favorite this fall, but that was on a sloppy, rainy day that provided head coach Sean McVay a blueprint of what not to do in a game that matters.\n\nNext up, if all the top seeds win in Wild Card weekend, would be a game against the Seahawks -- a team the Rams split their season series against thanks to a late implosion in that aforementioned come-from-ahead less. LA would face off against Sam Darnold, who has faded down the stretch in each of his last two otherwise remarkable seasons.\n\nThe NFC title game could feature a showdown against a Niners team the Rams beat by 16 on the road (but lost to in overtime at home) or against Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears. Williams excels against the blitz but struggles with pressure generated by a four-man front. Los Angeles has a top-five pressure rate and a bottom-four blitz rate. It should be able to contain the Bears' late-game surges.\n\nThe Patriots have the top non-bye seed in the AFC. Week 18 delivered them from an early rematch with a Buffalo Bills team that beat them in Gillette Stadium four weeks earlier, erasing a 21-0 deficit in the process.\n\nInstead, they get to face Justin Herbert, author of one of the most crushing postseason defeats in Los Angeles Chargers history (a franchise well versed in them). Los Angeles is a different team than the one that allowed Jacksonville to rally back from a 27-0 deficit in 2023, but Justin Herbert, 0-2 in the playoffs, remains.\n\nHerbert is better than his record suggests and is bolstered by a dominant defense. But he lost last year's postseason opener thanks in part to a Houston pass rush that pressured him on one-third of his dropbacks. The Patriots have generated pressure on 35 percent of passing plays this winter and have Milton Williams back in the lineup to create chaos from the middle of the line. So when LA's backup tackles collapse, Herbert -- more pressured in 2025 than ever in his career -- won't be able to step up in the pocket and create magic.\n\nNext likely comes a date in Foxborough with the Jaguars, Steelers or Bills. Any would be a tough out, but New England has handled Buffalo before. The Steelers have a one-man receiving corps that plays nicely into Christian Gonzalez's presence on the boundary. Jacksonville, as good as its been, is prone to glitching. So is the Denver offense with Bo Nix, which leaves the possibility of a throwback to the Tom Brady days and a home game with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n\nHonorable mention here belongs to those Jaguars, who are riding an eight-game win streak and get to face a Buffalo Bills team that's been uneven throughout 2025 and has few reliable targets to offer Josh Allen. But they still have Josh Allen, which makes their Wild Card matchup at least 40 percent terrifying.\n\nNow let's take a look at the teams with the hardest paths to Super Bowl 60.\n\nThe Packers came into Week 18 knowing they were set to face a team against whom they'd already lost. Thus, we were subjected to Clayton Tune and the worst up-the-middle run in modern NFL history.\n\nThe good news was they managed to avoid a date with the Philadelphia Eagles, who they have not beaten in the Jordan Love era (0-4 if you count his 2022 play in relief of Aaron Rodgers). The bad news is they have to face the Bears, an arch rival in search of their first playoff win since 2010 and eager to upend the franchise that's embarrassed them for the bulk of the last three decades.\n\nGreen Bay split the season series with Chicago but gave up a 10-point lead in the final two minutes at Soldier Field in a game that effectively decided the AFC North champion in Week 16. Jordan Love will be back at full strength after missing most of that matchup with a head injury. Micah Parsons will not, due to a torn ACL. That's a problem.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Williams' passer rating jumps from 83.0 to 104.5 when biltzed. He's also significantly worse when pressured, which suggests he's identifying blitzes, finding open spaces and making quick decisions for easy gains. Without Parsons as a phantom able to crash the pocket from anywhere, the Packer defense has struggled to consistently generate pressure; in their last three games their pressure rate has fluctuated from 40 to 24 to 44 percent.\n\nIf the Packers start sending extra pass rushers on third down, Williams is equipped to handle it. Next up would be the Seattle Seahawks. While we touched on Darnold's late-season struggles, it's also worth noting he's *also* stable against the blitz (his expected points added per dropback rise from 0.05 to 0.08). Green Bay knew it needed to generate a pass rush without blitzing to take down the NFC's best quarterbacks. That's why they traded two first round picks and Kenny Clark for Parsons.\n\nTough break. Especially for a team that cannot possibly host a playoff game this January.\n\nBuffalo is a slight favorite in Jacksonville in the Wild Card, which is a reflection on the Jaguars' past rather than their current status. The Bills depleted secondary has to take on Trevor Lawrence, winner of eight straight games and the league's third-best quarterback (behind Drake Maye and Jordan Love) in terms of EPA per dropback in that stretch (24 total touchdowns, six turnovers). In that same span, the Bills' pass defense has been solid (seventh-best) but its run defense has been awful (29th), giving Jacksonville plenty of leverage should its incredible quarterback sputter.\n\nIf the top seeds hold serve aside from the Jags, a date with the Denver Broncos swarming-but-somehow-underwhelming defense awaits. That group only ranks eighth in total defensive efficiency, but has Patrick Surtain II in the secondary to erase whomever gets the call to be Josh Allen's top target in the Divisional Round. Is Keon Coleman gonna go out there and draw interference flags on Riley Moss? Josh Palmer? Tyrell Shavers?\n\nAllen will have to take matters into his own hands against a defense that's only allowed 18.3 rushing yards per game to quarterbacks in 2025. Go further down the line in a potential AFC title game and you've got an awful run defense matched up against overperforming tailbacks like Rhamondre Stevenson, Jaylen Warren or the Chargers' young duo of Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal.\n\nThe Bills can absolutely make it to the Super Bowl because Josh Allen is a Ford F-150 some trickster god made human. But it's going to require some unheralded players to step up and flesh out his passing game while producing the run stops that force opponents into third-and-long situations. Otherwise, the rest of the AFC is built to poke holes in Buffalo's latest playoff hopes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Who has the easiest, toughest paths to Super Bowl 60?",

    "fullText": "A dynasty has fallen, big names have faltered and also-rans have become Super Bowl contenders.\n\nEven veteran NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth has said \"this is the most unusual year I can remember in the NFL\".\n\nNow 14 teams are set to battle it out in the play-offs, and for the first time in 11 years, the Kansas City Chiefs are not among them.\n\nDefending champions Philadelphia have not been as dominant as last season while pre-season favourites Buffalo have not lived up to that billing.\n\nBut for just the second time in 35 years, 11 of the 14 play-off teams gained at least 11 wins in the regular season.\n\nA record five teams have qualified after at least 11 defeats the previous season, with two of them going from worst to first in their division - New England and Chicago - so good luck picking the winner for Super Bowl 60.\n\n\"If you ask me to pick a favourite, I don't know, because you can put something on all of them,\" Collinsworth added.\n\n\"It's going to be amazing to watch these young quarterbacks go at it because I don't know what they will do. This is when legends begin to be built.\"",
