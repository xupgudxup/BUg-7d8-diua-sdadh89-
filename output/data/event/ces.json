    "description": "At the CES conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive, said the more efficient and powerful chip would begin shipping later this year.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.\n\nMr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.\n\nNvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nCompanies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.\n\nIf the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.\n\n“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.\n\nThe Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.\n\nBut the company is facing increased competition from chip makers and even some customers who are eager to seize a slice of the lucrative A.I. industry. Last year, Advanced Micro Devices, known as AMD, and Google, which buys Nvidia chips but also makes its own chips, struck deals to provide their technology to OpenAI, one of the world’s largest users of A.I. chips.\n\nThe rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.\n\nBecause more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.\n\nThe competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.\n\nIn December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.\n\nDemand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.\n\nNvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.\n\nSince 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.\n\nMr. Huang said the company started working on self-driving technology eight years ago. It has more than a thousand people working on the project.\n\n“Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,” Mr. Huang said.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS — Nvidia (NVDA) is touting its latest robotics advancements at CES 2026 as the broader tech industry begins a large-scale effort to bring humanoid robots to life.\n\nDuring the company's keynote on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that firms ranging from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar (CAT) to LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics are using Nvidia's robotics technologies to develop and power their various bots.\n\nNvidia has claimed that physical AI could revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries, and the company wants to be at the center of it all.\n\nDuring CES, Nvidia revealed a variety of new AI models to help train robots to interact with the world around them, as well as the hardware necessary to power their digital brains.\n\nIn addition to humanoid bots, Nvidia showed off a new family of models for self-driving cars called Alpamayo. According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\n\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\n\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\n\nNvidia said companies including Lucid (LCID), Uber (UBER), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\n\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Intel launched Panther Lake, its new AI chip for laptops, on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, as the company seeks to ​reassure investors about the first product made using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A.\n\nJim Johnson, ‌senior vice president and general manager of Intel's PC group, offered technical details about the company's first line of Panther Lake chips known ‌as Intel Core Ultra Series 3. The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first products with the 18A manufacturing process in 2025, referring to ⁠the Panther Lake chips.\n\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar ‌Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share ‍it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ​would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\n\nIntel plans to launch a platform ‌for handheld video games based on the Panther Lake designs this year, Johnson said. Handheld PCs designed by a range of suppliers have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, ⁠AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ​EST on Monday  (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will ​likely launch new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\n\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies ‍plan to deploy this year. ⁠The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\n\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia, Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES ⁠on Monday. He said the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing ‌of the company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast Is an Automatic Wet Food Feeder for Your Cat",
    "description": "The Yumshare can automatically dispense wet food for up to one week.",
    "fullText": "I don't have a cat, but I do have a dog, and my dog can be a picky eater. After months of trial and error, the only way we could get him to consistently eat breakfast and dinner was with wet food. There is no scenario in which I or someone watching my dog can outsource the task of feeding him, but that's not the case for cat owners. I know that cats sometimes stay home alone for extended periods of time, where an automatic food dispenser becomes essential. I can only imagine, then, that cat owners who, like me, feed their pet wet food, now have a challenge: Someone has to be there to feed the cat.\n\nThat's what intrigues me about Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast, an automated cat feeder that specifically works with wet food. I covered the Yumshare briefly when Petkit first announced it last week, but I got some hands-on time with the product today on the CES show floor. And while the device I saw isn't going to market just yet, I was intrigued.\n\nThe concept itself is pretty simple, but a bit more complex in execution. As you might expect, the feeder distributes portions of food for your cat to eat when you're not available—only here, that food is wet, not dry. To achieve this, Petkit outfitted the Yumshare with a chamber that can hold up to seven pouches of wet food at once. These pouches are designed for the Yumshare alone: Right now, the only company making pouches is Food Chain, which uses Petkit's proprietary design to fit the Yumshare, but it's possible more companies more jump on board in the future.\n\nWhen the Yumshare first opens one of these pouches, it sets a timer: After 48 hours, the pouch is discarded. In the meantime, the machine can automatically dole out portions set by the user, into a cup, which is stored in a separate chamber in the device. Once the portion is distributed, the pouch is sealed until the next portion is needed. The machine also uses UVC ultraviolet light to sanitize the package, with the goal of eliminating bacteria.\n\nThe automation extends to the portion of wet food itself, as well. Whether your cat eats all of the food, some of the food, or none of the food, the Yumshare can discard what's left when it detects it's time to do so. That might be the AI camera identifying that the food has dried up, or an internal clock recognizing that too much time has passed for the food to be safe to eat. Either way, the food drops into a waste compartment, which can hold up to 15 cups at once. The stand remains empty until it's time to hand out another portion of food.\n\nHow large or small each portion is, as well as how often portions are distributed, is up to you. Petkit showed me a mockup of the Yumshare's app, which lets you customize this feeding schedule. The app will also tell you how many portions have been distributed, and how many are left in the chamber. You can also take a look at a live video feed of your cat, via the 4K camera embedded in the device, or view a clip history of your cat's feeding habits.\n\nMy only question is the lack of refrigeration: Petkit says that there is no need for it, since the pouches are all sealed until use, closed in between portions, and the chamber uses ultraviolet light to sterilize for bacteria. But I'd want to confirm there are no health risks to keeping an opened pouch unrefrigerated for up to two full days, even with that UVC light. Assuming that's true, I'm quite impressed with this prototype. If I were a cat owner that frequently needed to leave my pet alone at breakfast and dinner, this is something I'd have my eye on.",

    "description": "The ROG Zephyrus Duo is back for 2026, with two full-sized screens.",
    "fullText": "CES is the time of year for weird computers, and Asus is bringing back an old fan favorite to help fill its unusual form factor quota. Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.\n\nLooking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n\nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\n\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n\nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n\nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.\n\nThe new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "description": "Help me, ROG. You're my only hope.",
    "fullText": "With the rise of streaming culture, a lot of gamers have started investing in computers that don't just play games well, but that look good while doing it. Asus's newest pre-built gaming desktop, the ROG G1000, is pretty by-the-book when it comes to high-end performance, but it's got one major selling point when it comes to those all-important gamer aesthetics: holograms.\n\nBuilt into this computer's front panel and one of its side panels, safely tucked into inaccessible glass windows, are rapidly rotating LED strips that, when in motion, create convincing full-color images that appear to have depth. The \"frame rate\" can be a little low, but it's a known technology that's all over the show floor at every CES now, and you can actually buy generic standalone hologram fans on Amazon for around $60-$100. It's just rare to see it integrated into something like a PC.\n\nThis hologram tech, called AniMe Holo, should make for a great way to show off on camera (or to your buddies in a college dorm) and Asus is promising some pretty expansive customizability. You can put still images and gifs on it, sure, but Asus also told journalists it can support full videos or mp4 files, without any limit on length. I think I'd try to use it to watch Shrek.\n\nThe effect comes across a bit better in-person, but it's still unusual enough to look enticing over video, even if you lose some of the depth. Unfortunately, still photos aren't really a great way to show this thing off, since they can't depict the rotating motion.\n\nAesthetics aside, the G1000 is also at the top of the power game, coming with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 3D CPU, an RTX 5090 GPU, up to 128GB of RAM, and a 2TB storage. It's got bite to back up its bark, and will be able to play the latest games at max settings with no issue.\n\nOf course, specs like that are likely to cost you a pretty penny, especially with the hologram gimmick tossed on top of them. Asus hasn't tipped its hand on pricing yet, but the ROG G1000 is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "CES 2026: Withings' Body Scan 2 Is a Smart Scale With Smartwatch Health Features",
    "description": "With sensors on a handle, and a screen to display data, the Body Scan 2 may replace a smartwatch in addition to a smart scale.",
    "fullText": "Withings launched their $600 Body Scan 2 smart scale at CES Unveiled last night—but they're positioning it as a \"longevity station\" rather than a smart scale. The device has a handle in addition to the footplate, which allows for extra sensors, and the new features include things like hypertension notifications that we've previously seen from smartwatches. (Hypertension notifications only just came to the Apple Watch a few months ago.)\n\nI got to see the Body Scan 2 at a CES event but haven't had a chance to use it for myself. According to Withings, the Body Scan 2 can measure \"60+ biomarkers\" that it says are relevant to tracking your health over time. With the caveat that I'm asking the company \n\nSmart scales generally aren't very accurate for data like body fat percentage, or really anything that goes beyond simple body weight. A typical smart scale runs a weak electrical current from one foot to another, measuring the electrical resistance of your lower legs. The Body Scan 2 adds a handle with electrodes, which brings the upper body into the mix. The screen on the handle also allows it to display data like ECG readings or other detailed results. Since the screen is in your hands, you don't have to squint at a display at your feet. (In product photos, the retractable handle sits on top of the footplate, but at yesterday's demo, Withings had the handles mounted on little holders at hand height.\n\nThis setup allows for more detailed data than smart scales can usually measure. For example, a Withings rep told me yesterday that it can measure arterial stiffness by comparing the timing of your pulse in your torso, hands, and feet—the faster blood flows between these areas, the better. The Body Scan 2 uses impedance cardiography, a well-studied technology that can measure several aspects of heart health, and it includes a six-lead ECG. This means you can get ECG data and hypertension notifications—two headline Apple Watch features—without having to wear a watch every day.\n\nThe scale isn't yet available for sale, but Withings estimates that it will be available in the second quarter of this year, pending FDA clearance for some features. The price will be $599.95. Withings already sells a first-generation Body Scan scale, with a handle but with fewer sensors and without a screen on the handle, for $399.95.",

    "title": "CES 2026: You Can Finally Use XREAL's AR Glasses With the Nintendo Switch 2",
    "description": "Plus, XREAL's new AR glasses can automatically convert 2D content to 3D.",
    "fullText": "At CES 2026, I was able to play the Nintendo Switch 2 in AR. That's something I hadn't done before, and that's because until now, only one company had an AR dock that worked with Nintendo's latest console, which doesn't like to play nice with AR glasses plugged directly into it. Viture's solution is fine, if a bit bulky, but Lifehacker has long praised the AR glasses from competitor XREAL, and finally, you can use XREAL glasses with the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nPreviously, XREAL did have an accessory that allowed for gameplay on the original Nintendo Switch, but it's since been discontinued, and even if you buy it secondhand, it won't work with the Switch 2. Now, the XREAL NEO changes that.\n\nComing in smaller than Viture's dock, the NEO is basically a combination portable battery bank and AR adapter that allows you to use your XREAL glasses while powering them and charging/converting whatever device you're displaying at the same time. It's got a 10,000 mAh capacity and a 20W output on its own—enough for fast charging—but you can also plug it into a wall while using it, which will allow your devices to charge at 65W+. That should be especially handy if you're primarily using the Neo as an adapter, and yes, it will allow your glasses to display the original Switch as well, not just the Switch 2. XREAL also notes that you can use the Neo on other handhelds like the Steam Deck, although it's a bit less necessary there, as the Steam Deck can output video to XREAL glasses directly.\n\nIn a confusing move, the Neo also has a magnetic ring to attach directly to your device, but it can't charge wirelessly. It seems the magnet is more there for easy storage, and so you can use a flip-out kickstand on the back of the Neo to prop your device up.\n\nUsing the Neo with the Switch 2, it worked like a dream. The console immediately swapped over to docked mode and started playing on a connected pair of XREAL glasses like it was on a television, which gave me a virtual 171-inch screen and graphics outputting at 1200p. Oh, and those graphics? They were in 3D.\n\nThat's because, alongside the Neo, I got to test out the new XREAL 1S AR glasses. These bump the resolution up to 1200p, and increase the FOV from the base XREAL One's 50 degrees to 52 degrees. Refresh rate is still 120Hz, but the glasses are brighter (at 700 nits) and the aspect ratio is larger, at 16:10. Most importantly, these come with the ability to add 3D depth to 2D imagery out of the box.\n\nI tried it out with Mario Kart World, and if you told me the game was designed with this 3D natively, I would have believed you. It was flawless, just the right amount of subtle, and I never saw any telltale blur around the characters. According to XREAL, though, the 2D-to-3D conversion is happening entirely within the glasses using the onboard spatial chip and AI.\n\nThis has the benefit of working with any content you plug into the XREAL 1S, although XREAL did warn me the effect might not come across as well for flat content as opposed to content using CGI. For instance, the AI just didn't know what to do with the original Super Mario Bros. for NES, leading to some elements getting depth and others being ignored.\n\nStill, you can turn the effect off in those cases, and I could see it being really handy if you're a big fan of 3D movies, since it can be kind of hard to find them on streaming. Now, you can turn any movie 3D, even if your mileage may vary from flick to flick.\n\nThe best part of the XREAL 1S, though? Despite the upgrades, they're actually cheaper than the base XREAL ONE, at $449 vs. $499. And they're available now, with estimated delivery windows sitting around this weekend. Plus, if you don't want to get a new pair of AR glasses, the 2D-to-3D conversion tech, called Real 3D, is also now out for the XREAL ONE Pro, and can be downloaded in an update.\n\nThe XREAL NEO, meanwhile, is currently only up for pre-order, with shipments scheduled to start in February. The Neo is available for $99 until February 4, by the way, but the price will jump up to $119 after that.\n\nEven with the cheaper NEO pricing, the total package for both the dock and the glasses will cost you $548. But if you really miss the 3DS, this is another easy way to play your Nintendo games in 3D, without sacrificing portably, but while keeping a big screen at the same time.",

    "description": "The new Panther Lake chips are expected to launch during CES week.",
    "fullText": "We're just hours away from the start of CES 2026, and with that comes Intel's launch event. The chip giant is expected to provide more details on its AI PC initiative and the new processors powering it: The Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs (aka Panther Lake) are made using an 18A process — that's 18 angstroms, or just under 2nm — and designed for high-end laptops and gaming devices.\n\nFor Intel, the stakes at CES are higher than ever. In the past 12 months, both NVIDIA and the US government acquired ownership stakes in the company, helping nearly double the stock price by the end of the year. But that's still down over more than 20 percent since 2021, as rivals like TSMC, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA have taken the leadership mantle in chip fabrication and AI hardware.\n\nSenior VP of Intel's Client Computing Group Jim Johnson will kick off the launch event on Monday, January 5 at 6PM ET. A livestream will be available on the Intel Newsroom YouTube channel, which we'll post here when it's live.\n\nAs we noted above, Intel has publicly confirmed that it will be highlighting \"the next generation of Intel-powered PCs, edge solution, and the AI experiences enabled by the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Processors.\" We'll be keen to hear if the company can address the profitability concerns that have surrounded those next-gen chips since at least last summer, when published reports indicated that yields were still under 50 percent. (In response, Intel told Engadget that it felt \"very good\" about its trajectory on Panther Lake, though it didn't hit the late 2025 release date it had envisioned at the time.)\n\nWill we get any updates on that NVIDIA partnership? It's possible. But don't expect to hear anything about Intel possibly fabricating the chips for that rumored new entry-level MacBook Air. If that comes to pass, the announcement will definitely be at a time and place of Apple's choosing.",

    "description": "The OLED evo W6 from LG makes a glorious return with an even more minimalist design.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly 10 years since LG first introduced its Wallpaper TV that was so thin that the mounting process felt like applying wallpaper. After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the \"world's thinnest\" OLED that's truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.\n\nInstead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It's similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its Frame TV lineup. While you won't have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor's hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That's more than three times the thickness, but it's still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.\n\nThe latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG's third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There's even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.\n\nThe updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that's crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA's G-Sync, AMD's FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you're not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its Gallery+ feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.\n\nLG didn't reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn't offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn't be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last Wallpaper TV, which cost up to $20,000.",

    "title": "My Five Favorite Things I Saw at CES Unveiled 2026",
    "description": "I saw robotic dogs, 3D screen protectors for your iPhone, and rapid food allergen testers.",
    "fullText": "While CES doesn't technically kick off until Tuesday, the conference gets a bit of a soft launch with CES Unveiled. This event hosts a ton of companies, all proudly showing off their latest products and concepts in one giant room. While there's plenty to write home about, five products in particular this year caught my eye:\n\nTombot's robotic puppy, \"Jennie,\" isn't supposed to be a pet-replacement. Instead, Jennie is specifically designed to help people with Alzheimer's. The bot is a healthcare device, and is made to not only comfort owners, but to monitor \"sundowning,\" or the confusion that some living with Alzheimer experience in late afternoon and at night.\n\nI can't speak to the medical claims, but Tombot impressed me. I've seen products like this before, but what struck me was the realism. That's not to say Tombot's robot tricks you into thinking there's a real puppy on the table. But the company has designed the bot with enough motors and sensors to make it realistic enough. When you look at Jennie, she looks at you; when you move, her face reacts in kind, powered by cleverly-placed motors. There are capacitive touch sensors to react to touch, light sensors to adjust to the lighting of the room, gyros for orientation, and microphones to responds to sounds.\n\nJennie is designed to be interactive: You can call its name—either Jennie, or a name you set in the app—and it responds to the call, potentially with a bark. Tombot says that it hired a number of ten-week-old lab puppies to record the voices for its bot. In all, Jennie will have about 1,500 unique behaviors when Tombot launches her this year.\n\nTombot told me that Jennie is designed to last all day on a single charge. When you aren't home, Jennie can drop into a sort of low power mode, that should last over a week. When you come back, Jennie should immediately welcome you home. Tombot says its bot will cost $1,500 at launch, but will offer financing options.\n\nWhat if you could turn your iPhone into a 3DS? That's what I took away from the premise of CubicSpace's CubicScreen, anyway. The company makes a screen protector for your iPhone embedded with an optical filter that allows you to view spatial photos and videos in 3D, without the need for glasses or a separate device. It's your 2D iPhone, in 3D.\n\nI was a bit skeptical walking past the booth, but, in practice, the tech really works. CubicSpace had some 3D photos and videos already stored in the CubicScreen app on their demo iPhones, and, when looking at the screen, they really did appear three dimensional. This isn't \"pop out of your screen\" 3D, mind you; rather, it's an depth effect. If you've ever used the 3D feature on a 3DS, this is that experience: You'll be able to see the depth behind subjects in your photos and videos, which adds to the immersion of the image.\n\nPart of the effect uses eye tracking to adjust the effect as you view the image. To that point, the app can support zooming while retaining the 3D effect. It's a little trippy: You zoom in on an picture, and, most of the time, it snaps into 3D instantly. Sometimes, the effect falls out, and you can tell you're looking at a distorted image. But most of my experience, the effect held.\n\nThis 3D effect wasn't just a trick of editing, either: CubicSpace took a photo of Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor, Michelle Ehrhardt at the booth, which instantly took on the 3D effect. The screen overlay and the software appears to work fast.\n\nCubicScreen will cost $79 when it launches. There is currently an order page, but they aren't accepting payment yet.\n\nIf you have a food allergy, you know the stress that comes when you're not in control of your meals. There's a risk to eating food you didn't make yourself, and for some of us, that risk isn't an option.\n\nThat's why I found Allergen Alert's \"the mini lab\" so intriguing. The idea is, when you want to know whether your food contains a certain allergen, you can scoop a sample of it into the provided container, place that container into the mini lab, and within two minutes, you'll have a positive or negative result. The device itself isn't large—about the size of a portable speaker—which makes it feasible to take out to restaurants and other people's houses.\n\nRight now, the company says the mini lab can detect milk and gluten, up to five parts per million, but the goal is to detect other major allergens, like egg, fish, soy, sesame, peanuts shellfish, tree nuts. Of course, I have no way to actually test whether it can detect milk and gluten at this time, so I can't necessarily endorse the product. In fact, it isn't currently available: Allergen Alert tells me the product is supposed to launch in September for $200.\n\nHowever, if Allergen Alert is correct in its claims, this product could be a game changer. A two minute check on that supposedly allergen-free meal could literally save someone's life, and offer peace of mind to those who could have serious adverse effects from ingesting an allergen.\n\nBirdfy brings a new smart bird feeder concept to CES just about every year. And while the company had its previous models on display at Unveiled this year, its newest prototype grabbed my attention.\n\nThe Hum Bloom is not meant for all of the birds that visit your house or garden. Instead, this product is specifically designed for hummingbirds. The Hum Bloom has an 4K camera that can shoot up to 120fps slow-motion video. While that'd make for some dramatic landings for any bird, it's particularly ideal for capturing hummingbirds that flap their wings hundreds or thousands of times per minute.\n\nBirdfy says the Hum Bloom's AI can identify more than 150 hummingbird species, so you'll know which type of bird you're watching in slo-mo on your phone. Birdfy claims the feeder is \"leak-proof,\" and also comes with ant moat to keep out bugs. Personally, I'm stuck on Birdfy designing a slo-mo camera system just for hummingbirds. I look forward to seeing that footage from reviewers in the future.\n\nThis is one of those products my picture will simply not do justice. In order to understand why I was so taken by this speaker, you'd need to hear it for yourself.\n\nAdmittedly, I wasn't expecting much when I agreed to demo the speaker. Again, at first glance, the Opsodis just looks like your typical wireless speaker. That changed once the rep played a video on a connected iPad: Suddenly, I was hearing sounds next to my ears; behind my ears; around my ears. I wasn't really paying attention to what was happening on screen, because I was too distracted wondering how I was hearing everything I was hearing from a relatively tiny speaker directly in front of me.\n\nAs it turns out, this wouldn't work if I had the speaker placed just about anywhere. The demo used Opsodis' \"narrow mode,\" one of three audio modes the speaker is capable of. Narrow mode is the stronger spatial audio experience, but requires the speaker to be placed close and directly in front of the user: specifically, 60 centimeters away, or 23.62 inches. \"Wide mode,\" which I didn't try, offers a \"softer\" spatial audio experience, while the third mode simulates standard stereo audio.\n\nWhile this won't necessarily offer a movie theater-like experience just by placing it in front of your TV, this was some of the most fun I had at CES Unveiled tonight.",
