    "description": "Robotaxi reporter Lloyd Lee breaks down what he saw — and heard — on the ground at the world's largest consumer tech show, CES, in Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The race to dominate the robotaxi space may not be as close as some companies suggest.\n\nLloyd Lee, Business Insider's reporter covering robotaxis and emerging mobility tech, went to CES for the first time to check out the autonomous service from Zoox, Vay, and other providers. Lee, who has taken a few rides with robotaxis recently entering the market, said the experience sharpened his view that one company appears to be significantly ahead — and that the industry still faces major hurdles before the vehicles can truly go mainstream.\n\nIn the Q&A below with BI News Chief Steve Russolillo, Lee breaks down his biggest takeaways from CES, the most impressive tech he saw, and how the experience will shape his coverage in the year ahead.\n\nSteve Russolillo: Lloyd, this is your first time at CES. What are your impressions and biggest takeaways from the event?\n\nLloyd Lee: First, CES is a massive event. It is humanly impossible to stop by every booth no matter how militant you are with your time. Second, I was struck by how much space the convention was dedicated to automobility. I agree with what Paul Costa, a 25-year Apple veteran who worked on the company's self-driving car project and is now at Ford, told me: CES has become a car show as much as it remains a tech show.\n\nRussolillo: What's the craziest and wildest piece of new technology that you saw?\n\nLee: Hyundai Motor Group's booth had a really impressive display of how far it's trying to take autonomy — from EV charging stations and robotaxis to robotic arms and humanoid robots. Boston Dynamics, a Hyundai unit, demoed its Atlas humanoid robot at the booth. Just the way it activates and stands up is terrifying and awe-striking at the same time.\n\nRussolillo: You cover robotaxis for BI and had the opportunity to test drive two different robotaxis this week. What stood out to you the most?\n\nLee: I tried two robotaxi services for the first time, including Amazon's Zoox. There are obviously a lot of smart people working on this technology. But I have to say: Trying those services only made me realize 1.) how far ahead Waymo is or at least appears to be, and 2.) just how difficult it is to make a profitable business case for robotaxis right now.\n\nGetting autonomous driving right is only part of the challenge. There's also the operations side — like fleet scaling and management — that Waymo has had to build up to help make robotaxis feel like a real autonomous ride-hailing service you can use in your day-to-day. (That is if you live in the city Waymo operates.) And even then, we know Waymo is burning money on its service.\n\nRussolillo: What are some of the predictions you've heard from sources about tech, AI and business?\n\nLee: Chris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte with expertise in software-defined vehicles, had a few interesting points.\n\nRussolillo: What startup you never heard before really stole the show and impressed you?\n\nLee: Perhaps less stole the show, but I thought Vay, a German startup developing a driverless car rental service, reminded me that there's still room for some contrarian voices in the driverless space. Remote driving is the big bogeyman for robotaxi companies. You don't want to be caught using it. This startup's entire business model is built around it. Vay is using remote driving — with a potential to pursue autonomy in the future — for a small fraction of the overall driving experience: Getting the car delivered to a renter without a human inside. It was a \"Huh, I never thought about that\" moment.\n\nRussolillo: What did you learn that might change how you go about your tech coverage for BI?\n\nLee: Broadly, emerging technologies like humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and, more generally, AI, contain a lot of unknowns and uncertainties. And company leaders in those spaces can be evasive when you ask for specifics, or they simply don't know the answer. Possibly both. My instinct is to resolve that ambiguity, which in this space, will not always be realistic. Instead, I should write to the uncertainty, not through it. Name the ambiguity, build the story around it.",

    "title": "The Biggest Fitness Trends at CES 2026 (and What I Think About Them)",
    "description": "Exoskeletons, rings, and smart bands were popular, but a lot of big name companies seem to be running out of ideas.",
    "fullText": "I just got back from CES 2026, and you can see my real-time reports on some of the best and weirdest things I saw in our CES 2026 live blog. I tried on six(!) different exoskeletons, perked up my ears whenever I heard about a new smart strap, and looked in vain for new models of familiar fitness tech like watches. Here are the biggest trends I noticed and some notes on what was conspicuously missing. I've included prices where possible; anything without a price is likely too far from market to have one yet.\n\nThis is a continuation of a trend that really got going in 2025. Whoop is no longer the only player in the screenless fitness strap space. Last year we saw straps from Amazfit ($99) and Polar ($199), plus a sleep band from Garmin ($169). At CES I learned about two more.\n\nThe Luna Band is likely to be the next one to market—the company’s reps said to expect it to ship sometime in the next month or two. (I plan to review it once units are available.) It will be $149, won't require a subscription, and it will use the same app as the Luna Ring, which I’m currently reviewing. Its maker, Noise, is new to the U.S. wearables market but is one of the leading smartwatch makers in India.\n\nBesides the new hardware, Noise also announced that the Luna app will soon have a system to take voice notes to give context to your health data. (This is coming to the app in the next few weeks.) For example, if you tell the app that you had a few glasses of wine, it will remember this when it sees your poor sleep the next morning, and it will adjust its recommendations accordingly—say, reminding you to hydrate, rather than telling you to take a nap.\n\nSpeediance also announced the Speediance Strap, although it doesn’t seem to be as close to market. No price has been announced, and the units at the show were clearly prototypes. The Strap will collect sleep and recovery data, without requiring a subscription to view it, although some more advanced metrics will require a premium subscription.\n\nOura has had competitors for years (and has taken up suing them to stop sales), but it seems like the number of smart rings out there is just exploding—though not all of them are fitness or health oriented. Besides Pebble’s Index 01 ($75), which is charmingly simple, there are plenty of rings that pack in more functions—NFC payments, AI voice processing, haptic alerts, and more. There are so many I can’t give a full list, but to name a few: there’s the Muse Ring One ($323), the Dreame Ring, and the Vocci AI ring.\n\nRingConn announced its third-generation ring, with blood pressure insights (I’m skeptical) and haptic alerts, including the ability to buzz for a smart alarm (I’m intrigued). This one isn’t on the market yet, and a rep at the booth asked me what price I thought it should go for. In the meantime, RingConn gave me a gen 2 ring to compare to Oura and others—watch for my review soon.\n\nThe companies that make smartwatches and fitness watches tend to be on their own release cycles, not necessarily tied to CES. Apple certainly wasn’t going to announce a new Apple Watch; Google and Fitbit didn’t show up, either. Amazfit had a new watch, the Active Max ($169) in its lineup, but it was more of a refinement to the product line than a new exciting announcement.\n\nThe only real exception I can think of is Pebble, but you’ve heard from me already on why it bucks the trend. I got to go hands-on with the Time 2 (announced last year) and the Round 2 (announced last week), which was so thin and sleek it made the Coros on my wrist feel like a big ol’ hunk of plastic. As a reminder, the Round 2 doesn’t have a heart rate monitor and Pebble is trying not to be a fitness watch brand. (I’m still looking forward to reviewing its watches anyway.)\n\nI think the main reason for the stagnation here is that watches already have everything they need to have for fitness and health tracking. There's not a lot of room left to innovate; either you give a device slightly better battery life (nice, but yawn) or you stick something else into it just to say you did—like a flashlight or a microphone. That's nothing against flashlights or microphones, which are both great in context, but we're hardly in game-changing territory anymore. Companies like Oura and Whoop are pivoting to services like blood tests that take the focus off their hardware. My colleague Stephen Johnson said it best: tech launches don't feel magical anymore, partly because we don't have many problems left that consumer tech can easily solve, and partly because every new advice adds a hassle to your life.\n\nAnd so Garmin’s main announcement this weekend was a nutrition tracking feature in its Connect+ subscription. I thought at least there was a good chance of a new watch from Garmin—nope. Garmin announced the Instinct 3 at last year’s CES, but no new hardware this year besides a camera system for truckers (I’m happy for them).\n\nA few other companies used the buzz around CES to announce non-hardware developments as well: Oura is finally shipping the charging case it promised last fall, and Ultrahuman announced a limited-time free tier of its blood testing service with 20+ markers. Its other tiers give you 50+ markers for $99, or a 100+ marker test followed by a 60+ marker follow-up test for $365. (Ultrahuman told me that the exact blood tests it's able to offer vary slightly by state, hence the vague numbers.)\n\nThere were, of course, plenty of mentions that “AI” is baked into this or that fitness app. But the companies mostly seemed to understand that while AI might help to create features their users want, users don’t buy devices for the AI. (See also: Dell executives commenting that its customers don’t seem to want AI, and that it has adjusted the marketing for its computers to de-emphasize it.)\n\nI heard at CES that apps are using AI to identify foods from photos (Garmin and Amazfit) or that AI is helping to find patterns in data (basically everybody). Merach did say it would let me try an AI-powered treadmill, but a rep apologetically told me the device wasn’t available in time to ship the prototype to CES.\n\nExoskeletons were the biggest new-to-me trend at CES. These are devices that you strap on to your body, and their motors give an added boost to what your muscles are doing. Several of the companies described them as being like an e-bike for walking.\n\nI gave myself a side quest of trying every exoskeleton that was available to demo. That ended up being a total of six: four that assisted you at the hip, one at the knee, and one at the ankle. One device made by Ascentiz ($1,299-$1,848) can be configured with combined hip and knee action, but the knee module wasn’t available for me to test.\n\nAll six devices really did give me a boost while walking (or climbing stairs—several of the companies wisely included a mini staircase in their booths to try out). But I have to wonder who the exoskeletons are really for. If you’re not a serious hiker, an exoskeleton might help you hike up a mountain and keep up with your friends. But I’d think that only a serious hiker would have $1,000+ to spend on hiking gear like an exoskeleton—and that they would probably prefer to train harder and spend the money on something else.\n\nIf I had to predict where this tech is going, I think the rental market makes the most sense. Imagine if you could borrow the Ascentiz for a scenic hike on vacation without having to train for months ahead of time, or strap on Dephy’s “powered footwear” ($4,500) to get you through a day at Disneyworld.",

    "title": "The Five Weirdest AI Inventions I Saw at CES 2026",
    "description": "AI gadgets had to get weird to stand out at CES 2026.",
    "fullText": "AI is still the big thing in the tech world, but it's no longer the big new thing. It's been around long enough that simply integrating it into your product isn't enough to make it stand out anymore, especially at the biggest tech show in the world. While I attended this year's CES, the trend I noticed over and over again on the show floor was that AI is getting weird now. From personal hologram sidekicks to a gaming monitor that basically cheats for you, here are the five weirdest AI inventions I saw at CES 2026.\n\nAt last year's CES, gaming lifestyle company Razer introduced Project AVA, an AI esports coach concept that was just a disembodied voice that lives in your laptop. Yawn. This year, the company's expanding on that by bringing AVA into the real world.\n\nIn Razer's suite this year, I held a conversation with \"Kira,\" an anime girl \"hologram\" that lives in a little USB tube you can plug into your laptop. She noticed my orange sweater thanks to a camera installed in the tube, before asking me about the show and prompting me to start up a round of Battlefield 6, where she gave me some generic loadout advice. I spoke with her using microphones also built into her tube, and she responded using her own speaker rather than the laptop's. Razer said this demo was more directed, hence why she brought up gaming right away, but that the end goal is to let the new AVA work as a convincing all-purpose AI companion, so you don't have to use it for only play.\n\nTo that end, the company says it's \"AI agnostic,\" so you can plug your own model into it. The demo I ran through was clearly using Grok, and generally felt a lot like talking to the AI companions built into that app, right down to the cringeworthy jokes. But Razer said you could theoretically use ChatGPT or Gemini instead.\n\nWhile we were chatting, Kira played animations courtesy of Animation Inc., which powers similar but more app-driven AI companions. In other words, the chatbot and the animations aren't really new here, so what you'd be buying would be the USB tube and the characters.\n\nKira isn't your only option for an AI companion here—she's a typical anime gamer girl, but I also got to briefly look at Zane, a tattooed muscle man in the deepest V-neck I've ever seen. You can kind of see the target audience for both of these characters right away, but if you want something more tame, you can also have your tube display Razer's logo surrounded by an audio waveform, which simply goes by AVA (even though the project as a whole is still called AVA). And the company's also working on celebrity likenesses, with esports star Faker and influencer Sao having already given their approval.\n\nRazer said it's still working on figuring out how it'll distribute these characters, and I was told you'd get a bundle of them with your purchase, but would probably be able to buy more down the line.\n\nAs for pricing and availability, no word on that. This is technically still a concept, so it might go back to the drawing board again. But Razer's website does say it's hoping for a release in the second half of 2026, and that you can put $20 down now to reserve your unit.\n\nIn short, if you strip away the functionality that's already baked into apps you can download now, the new Project Ava is basically a talking hologram toy for your desk. That's still not a bad pitch, but unfortunately, I'm not sure if hologram is the right word for this. Kira looked pretty flat to me, less like that one Princess Leia projection and more like she was displaying on a normal transparent screen that just happened to be stuck inside of a cylinder. I don't think the novelty quite matches the pitch yet.\n\nWhenever I play a competitive game, instead of hopping right into a match, I instead load up into a few practice sessions to warm up. It's helpful, but time consuming. The new Neurable x HyperX concept headset is hoping to change that by helping you lock in within just a few minutes.\n\nEssentially, it looks like a normal gaming headset, but built into the earcups are various sensors that can supposedly read your focus levels. These are similar to the brain-computer interfaces you might have seen in sci-fi shows, the ones with a bunch of wires and discs attached to them, but shrunken down for the consumer market, with no creepy wires in sight.\n\nThat's where the AI comes in. Shrinking down the sensors so much does mean this headset gets fewer readings than the bigger ones in labs, but Neurable claims its models are still able to pick up on trends in those readings and translate them into useful data, while also throwing out junk data.\n\nFor gamers, that means it can run you through a quick focus exercise called \"Prime,\" where you concentrate while noticing a cloud of dots shrink into a solid orb. Once this is done, which took about 90 seconds for me, you're supposedly focused up and ready to play.\n\nUnfortunately, I actually did worse in a practice shooting game after focusing than beforehand, but that doesn't mean the data was useless. I ran through the exercise with a colleague whose score improved by maybe about a third after focusing, and with such a small sample size, there could be any number of reasons I choked after focusing up. The company said that it could even be helpful to practice choking in this way.\n\nAnd at any rate, numbers are fun. That's why I'm most excited about the headset's plug-in for streamers, which allows them to show their focus levels on screen for their chat to see. I could easily imagine a community looking at that data and teasing their favorite streamer to try to distract them.\n\nThat said, it'll be a while until you can actually buy this. It's still a concept for now, with no pricing or promise of release. However, Neurable does already have a similar, non-gaming headset made with Master & Dynamic that will be shipping out soon, just without this software. For more, read my full article here.\n\nThis one is more of a hardware innovation, but it's a clever touch. This CES, Lenovo introduced a laptop with a motorized hinge that can automatically close, open, and even rotate from side-to-side. It'll be coming out later this summer, but while the company was demonstrating the unit to me, it also showed off a prototype chatbot app it's making for it. This uses ChatGPT for now, and is still just a concept and will not ship with the laptop. But it was cute.\n\nEssentially, while I talked with the app, the laptop displayed a big pair of animated eyes on screen, and used its hinge to nod or shake its head no when I asked it questions. It also displayed small animations in response to certain questions, like showing an umbrella when I asked about the rainy weather.\n\nIt's still very early days, but I was impressed that the hardware was able to recognize what an affirmative answer was and trigger the laptop to respond accordingly. A lot of AI feels pretty disconnected from the real world, so anything that can give it a physical presence is probably a good idea if you want people to take it seriously.\n\nAlso shown off at CES this year, Lenovo's AI Frame gaming monitor is probably the most practically useful item on this list, almost to the point where it feels like cheating. Essentially, this fills up most of the 21:9 screen with a regular 16:9 view of whatever's on your computer, and uses AI to show a zoomed-in look at critical game information on the rest.\n\nFor instance, in a demo showing a MOBA game (think League of Legends), the monitor zoomed in on the map. In a demo showing Counter-Strike 2, it zoomed in on the reticle. Personally, I didn't think getting a blown-up look at the map was all that helpful, but being able to constantly see what was essentially a sniper scope around my reticle was a game changer, since it worked with any gun and made targets much easier to see.\n\nI could see Counter-Strike 2 developer Valve go as far as banning this if it ever makes its way to market, since it's taken similar actions before. But this is still just an idea for now. Still, it shows that companies are starting to figure out concrete ways AI can help you in your games, beyond just feeding you advice you probably already know.\n\nFinally, probably my favorite AI invention at CES this year was XREAL's new REAL 3D technology. Built into its newest AR glasses and already added to an existing pair via a firmware update, this uses AI to automatically find depth in any 2D video source and convert it into 3D. And trying it out for myself, it practically looked official.\n\nWhen I used it to play Mario Kart World, I would have believed you if you told me Nintendo had added this mode itself. It also worked great with James Cameron's Avatar, and there was no loading time to set it up or turn it off. There also wasn't any fuzziness, like there might be with glasses-free 3D screens like the 3DS.\n\nIt's a great option for people who like watching 3D games and movies, but might have trouble finding them now that 3D TVs and the Nintendo 3DS are mostly in the past. Now, you can just watch your existing 2D library, but in 3D.\n\nThe only issue you might come across is in content that doesn't have depth. For instance, XREAL's Ralph Jodice told me the software didn't quite know what to do when he tried playing the original 8-bit Super Mario Bros. with it, and would randomly emphasize only certain game assets without any rhyme or reason. An illusion of depth does seem to work, though. Super Mario Bros. is entirely flat, but when I tried watching the pen-and-paper animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with this technology, it correctly separated characters in the foreground from scenery in the background, even though everything on screen was entirely hand-drawn.",

    "fullText": "Robot vacuums that can climb stairs and device for BlackBerry lovers also on display at annual Las Vegas tech show\n\nThis year will be filled with robots that can fold your laundry, pick up objects and climb stairs, fridges that you can command to open by voice, laptops with screens that can follow you around the room on motorised hinges and the reimagining of the BlackBerry phone.\n\nThose are the predictions from the annual CES tech show in Las Vegas that took place this week. The sprawling event aims to showcase cutting-edge technology developed by startups and big brands.\n\nMany of these fancy developments will be available to actually buy, moving from outlandish concepts to production devices, although some are still limited to costly prototypes.\n\nThe rise of the humanoid robot continues, with the show floor filled with myriad prototypes, some of which operated autonomously rather than being remotely controlled or performing set routines this year.\n\nNot one but two different robots promised to do your laundry, make breakfast and serve drinks. In demos LG’s CLOiD home robot, which is reportedly due to undergo real-world testing next year, looked like a disembodied torso on a rolling platform, slowly and autonomously doing chores linked with various LG kitchen appliances.\n\nThe Chinese company Switchbot’s Onero H1, however, looks more like a security bot crossed with a robot vacuum with articulating arms ready to do chores. The company says it should go on sale later this year for an undisclosed sum. It joined impressive demos from many other Chinese robotics outfits, including Unitree, Booster Robotics and X-Humanoid, the recent winner of Beijing’s humanoid robot half-marathon.\n\nThis also promises to be that year that Boston Dynamics’ long-tested Atlas robot finally goes from awkward prototype to polished product, with a new design unveiled during the parent company Hyundai’s CES show.\n\nThe South Korean firm is partnering with Google’s DeepMind for robotic AI research and plans to deploy the Atlas robots, which are water resistant, can lift 50kg and automatically swap their batteries, to its manufacturing plants in the next couple of years.\n\nRobot vacuums are the more prevalent home robot for now, but even they have new tricks. Dreame’s Cyber10 Ultra arm-equipped robovac can lift up to 500g and use brushes and other nozzles while cleaning your floors. It will reportedly go on sale around August for about €1,800 (£1,560), although it was the company’s Cyber X concept with four legs and tank-like tracks that had attenders captivated because it might help it finally vanquish the mortal enemy of robot vacuums: climbing stairs.\n\nHowever, if actually cleaning the stairs is the goal, Roborock’s first two-wheel-leg robovac might be better. The Saros Rover is in development, shown off in prototype form, and can raise, lower and jump its way to each step, cleaning as it goes.\n\nNot even the humble fridge was safe this year from the march of robotics. Samsung debuted its new Family Hub fridge, which includes a screen on the front but its party piece is voice-controlled doors you can open and close hands-free.\n\nLess novel but potentially just as useful, GE built a barcode scanner into its new Profile fridge, which is designed to scan things as you discard them to automatically add them to a shopping list ready for when you need it. A camera inside the fridge lets you check remotely to see if anything’s finished or rotten.\n\nScores of new laptops were on show from all the major manufacturers including Acer, Dell, Samsung and others. But Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept was the start of the show: a regular-looking 16in laptop with a OLED screen that unrolls horizontally to a full-size 24in monitor for gaming and productivity on the go. Meanwhile, the company’s new ThinkPad Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist is going from concept to actual product with a motorised rotating hinge that automatically turns the screen to face you or your audience if you are presenting.\n\nSamsung used CES to show off its cutting-edge trifolding flexible screen Android phone-tablet hybrid, which takes the book-style folding design and adds another section that unfolds again like a pamphlet to reveal a large wide-screen tablet. Having gone on sale in South Korea just before the end of 2025 the Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to reach the US and other markets in the first half of this year for a big sum.\n\nBut for those who long for the days of physical keyboards on phones, the accessory company Clicks is bringing back the BlackBerry with its new Communicator: an Android phone with a physical keyboard. Designed as a “communication companion” with custom software that puts messaging above doomscrolling on social media, the Communicator can be used as a primary phone or as a partner to your existing iPhone or Android. It has a notification LED around the power button and a fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Reservations are open and the phone is due to ship later this year.\n\nClicks already sells keyboard cases for the iPhone, Pixel and other devices for those that don’t want to replace their phone completely with a BlackBerry. But it also had a new slide-out keyboard Bluetooth that doubles as a magnetic wireless charging battery pack on show at CES. The Power Keyboard magnetically sticks to the back of the phone and will be compatible with iPhones and Androids supporting Qi2, shipping in the spring.",

    "description": "The world's biggest technology trade show is here, and Jordan Calhoun, Beth Skwarecki, Jake Peterson, and Michelle Ehrhardt are on the ground in Las Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "fullText": "on January 8, 2026 at 6:36AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nAt the start of the year, you can always rely on the Consumer Electronics Show to be a hub for exciting innovations, bold prototypes, and downright weird ideas that aim to make life more convenient. While CES 2026 is (predictably) being dominated by AI shoehorned into various products this week, the show still has a few surprises up its sleeve. Between iterative gaming laptop upgrades for 2026 and flashy new OLED TVs, the event is also serving as a hub for interesting and weird technology.\n\nSome of this gear--like Razer's holographic AI companion tube--is already scheduled to be released later this year, while more experimental stuff, like brain-scanning headphones, are still a long way from being seen on store shelves. In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "description": "Jackson said that faster chips aren't the big news from Jensen Huang's talk. Instead, the shifting nature of AI infrastructure is the key takeaway.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the new year by giving investors some key product updates at CES 2026, drumming up fresh bullishness about the chip titan's business.\n\nAt the high-profile industry event, Huang revealed that production has begun on Rubin, its six-chip AI platform and the follow-up to the popular Blackwell architecture.\n\nThe talk generated a lot of buzz about the future of AI demand and Nvidia's business outlook, but hedge fund manager Eric Jackson argues that the most important takeaway from the talk is much bigger than innovations in chip tech.\n\nJackson, who helped spur rallies in several stocks followed by retail traders last year, said that he thinks many investors missed the key takeaway from the event. In his view, the most important thing isn't that faster or more advanced chips are coming; it is that AI is being built as a utility-scale infrastructure designed to operate for decades.\n\n\"Most people watched NVIDIA's CES keynote and heard 'faster chips,''\" he said. \"That wasn't the message. The real takeaway was this: AI factories are now being planned years in advance — at the land, power, and shell level.\"\n\nIn short, he thinks these statements mean that AI is being treated like electricity or telecom networks, a technology that will serve as a fundamental part of everyday life.\n\n\"The CES + JPM conversations made it clear: AI factories are being planned like utilities — not experiments,\" Jackson noted. \"That changes the slope.\"\n\nAs he sees it, the shifting industry landscape is poised to create more efficient AI production, which will lead to more demand for it through new use cases.\n\nThe investor highlighted the Jevons Paradox, an economic adage that argues that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, people consume it more, not less, despite assumptions. Economist William Stanley Jevons first introduced it in the 19th century to illustrate the growing dependence on coal.\n\n\"The market's obsession with 'capex slowing' misses the point,\" Jackson added. \"If inference + agents + long-context workloads are compounding, power becomes monetizable for longer, not shorter.\"\n\nJackson added that recent AI market developments are feeding his bullish thesis on small-cap tech stocks like Hut 8, IREN, and Cipher Mining, as all three stand to benefit from an economy increasingly powered by AI.\n\n\"Most investors still ask: 'Is AI demand peaking?'\" he wrote. \"The better question now is: Who can deliver reliable power and uptime as AI becomes permanent?\"",

    "description": "The 'Best of CES' award winners are official, highlighting the best new tech that CES had to offer.",
    "fullText": "In the middle of the Las Vegas Convention Center, amidst the world's largest tech trade show, an awards show was taking place. The audience included nominees ranging from large companies like Nvidia to scrappy startups introducing themselves to the world, alongside journalists, tech insiders, and enthusiasts gathering to watch the Best of CES 2026 awards. After days of scouring showroom floors, speaking with innovators about their new technologies, and deliberating for six hours, finalists and winners were chosen by experts from CNET, PCMag, Mashable, ZDNET, and Lifehacker. I had the privilege of helping to judge and present several awards, and aside from my gratitude for the experience, my takeaway was simple: There's a lot of new technology worth being excited about.\n\nCNET Group, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association, awarded winners across 22 categories, plus a 'Best Overall' award. To qualify for a Best of CES award, a product or service had to be an official exhibitor at CES 2026 and either include a compelling new concept or idea, solve a major consumer problem, or set a new bar in performance, design, or quality. The official Best of CES 2026 winners were announced live Wednesday, Jan. 7, at 4 p.m. PT. Here are all the finalists and winners of Best of CES 2026.\n\nTombot's Jennie has been capturing hearts at CES for years, but the realistic robot puppy is finally launching in 2026. Designed to comfort seniors with dementia and help combat loneliness, Jennie is packed with sensors and motors, allowing it to move its head to look at you, raise its eyebrows, wag its tail, and bark when you ask if it wants a treat. Seniors at a memory care facility we visited loved Jennie.\n\niGuard is a smart stove shutoff that helps older adults age in place. This new version of the device uses radar to tell when a person is in the kitchen, and has a configurable five-minute grace period. It can also report to a caregiver app if your loved one didn’t show up in the kitchen to make breakfast as usual.\n\nQira is Lenovo's answer to Apple Intelligence, a hybrid AI assistant that leverages a mix of on-device processing and cloud-based models for a powerful personalized assistant that's available anywhere, even as you switch from the phone in your pocket to the laptop or tablet in your hand.\n\nNvidia is once again the talk of CES, and the biggest announcement by the world's most profitable company is the Rubin AI platform. Nvidia’s six new Rubin chips work together to reduce the costs of data processed by AI, known as tokens. That's important for big tech companies, and all of us, as AI models become more compute-intensive.\n\nThis AI wearable brings it back to basics. Users can jot down quick notes throughout their day that they don't want to forget by clicking on the button and speaking into the ring. Then, an LLM on the app will process what you said for easy access and even take actions for you.\n\nSamsung Music Studio 5 (Winner)\n\nThe Samsung Music Studio 5 houses a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters in one of the most compelling designs we've seen in a home speaker. In addition to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, it supports the Samsung Seamless Codec for compatibility with other Samsung Galaxy ecosystem products.\n\nxMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip\n\nAs smartglasses become more mainstream, they require an audio chip that is as advanced as their AI features. The xMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip enhances the smartglasses audio experience. Based on our listening tests, they provide a high-fidelity listening experience, and at one millimeter thin, directly aid in keeping smartglasses form factors thinner and lighter.\n\nAs a part of LG's Sound Suite, the H7 Soundbar extends the usefulness of Flex Connect to any TV with an HDMI input. The soundbar looks good and it sounded great with movies. The only drawback is that you can only add LG branded Flex Connect speakers to the soundbar and not those from other brands.\n\nIntel Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) (Winner)\n\nIntel’s Core Ultra 300 Series “Panther Lake” platform is our winner for delivering bar-raising integrated graphics performance to the mass consumer market. The top chip offers up to 12 new “Xe3” Xe cores for (by far) the best-ever integrated graphics performance from Intel silicon, enabling graphics and gaming workloads for a huge range of portable laptop categories through 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt's all about the TOPS: The mainstream version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 laptop processor family maintains the 80 trillion operations per second of the higher end X2 Elite chips. Expected in laptops starting around $800, it promises field leading NPU performance at a lower price.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 392, AI Max Plus 388\n\nAMD’s expanded Ryzen AI Max+ platform democratizes workstation power with the 392 and 388 models, featuring 40 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, 60 TFLOPS of compute, and 192GB unified memory. These chips bring elite local AI and GPU-free performance to thinner, more affordable devices with a superior price-to-performance ratio.\n\nAfter developing alignment-free wireless power for two years, Willo demonstrated the ability to deliver power over the air for multiple devices simultaneously, regardless of their position or movement. This represents a breakthrough in energy technology, offering wireless charging without the need for a pad, coil, or dock.\n\nJackery's solar energy-seeking robot showed an ability to follow you around like a puppy, but its real job is to follow the sun, collecting energy with its retractable 300W solar panels. The idea is that this autonomous bot can always find the sun, and then bring you the power when you need it.\n\nA water heater that automatically generates bitcoin with daily use. It utilizes the excess heat generated from bitcoin mining to heat running water in a home, offsetting up to 80 percent of electricity and water costs with the earnings from the process. You can control and manage it with an app or web console for ease of use.\n\nLego Smart Play System (Winner)\n\nA single 2-by-8 Lego brick filled with light, sound, and proximity sensors to enable new ways to play. This little block, and the tinier snap-on tab that gives it instructions, can drive anything from lightsaber duels to board games, adding color and sound effects based on what you build and how you play.\n\nIxana's Wi-R is a chip that sends data through a hyperlocal field generated by your body. This alternative to Bluetooth and WiFi is still a concept, but it has some upsides to conventional data protocols such as less power drain and less potential for clogged signal.\n\nLenovo Legion Pro Rollable Concept (Winner)\n\nRollable OLED displays have been a thing for a couple years, but they’ve been limited to enterprise laptops, if they ever even come out. The Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept uses this tech to bring ultrawide gaming to a laptop for the first time. Is the future rollable? We don’t know, but either way it’d be the perfect portable battlestation.\n\nA gaming PC with multiple monitors has become the norm, and while portable monitors have been around for a while, there haven't been many ways to have this experience built-in to a laptop. The Asus Zephyrus Duo takes the multiple-display idea Asus has been playing with since the original Zephyrus Duo and expands it to something actually useful: a full second display.\n\nXreal’s AR glasses are some of the best, and now PC company ASUS is partnering with Xreal to make them better, especially for gamers. These AR glasses have everything even the pickiest player needs, giving you a virtual 171-inch screen right on your face. That screen is OLED and 1080p, but the real kicker is the 240hz refresh rate. It’s smooth big-screen gaming, on the go.\n\nThe Ecoldbrew combines a portable grinder and brewer into a compact gadget that whips up a batch of cold brew coffee in five minutes. The cleverly designed device slots onto its own thermos, but it's a common size so you can easily attach it to the top of your own thermos if you have one that you love. Slated to launch on Kickstarter soon, it starts at an affordable $99.\n\nSeattle Ultrasonics' C-200 UltraSonic Chef's Knife has a Japanese steel blade that vibrates about 30,000 times per second. Its movement is so subtle that you can't see or hear it move, but you will notice how effortlessly it slices through food without clinging to it. The C-200 retails for $399, a similar price point as other nice knives. The first batch ships this month.\n\nWe've covered our fair share of smart ovens at CES but Apecoo has boiled it down to the essentials. This compact cooker uses a camera above and scale below to ID food type and size and then deploys a precise cooking program pulled from a deep AI algorithm. Perfectly cooked steak, anyone? This machine can determine the exact thickness of meat or volume of veggies like no oven before it. The oven even recognizes multiple types of food at once and uses appropriate cooking times and temps for each. Best of all, it's about half the size of a typical smart oven.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition (Winner)\n\nModular laptop designs for greater serviceability and sustainability are a definite trend at CES 2026, and the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best example of it. Lenovo’s flagship business laptop introduces its Space Frame design that lets you access and replace individual parts when something breaks instead of needing to buy a new laptop.\n\nYes, it's clearly inspired by the MacBook Pro, but MSI's big, redesigned Stealth pours on the special sauce. This thin rig deploys Intel's Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) CPUs and GeForce graphics up to a roaring RTX 5090, alongside amped-up cooling and airflow. Plus, a new, subtler MSI design and a 240Hz Gorilla Glass panel will excite gamers and prosumer creators alike.\n\nAsus' Zenbook Duo is a niche device, but it's the most elegant expression of a dual-screen laptop we've seen yet. The 2026 Zenbook Duo has matured on its design with notable improvements from last year: thinner bezels, a more sturdy kickstand, and a better hinge. Powered with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H CPU, it’s well-equipped for diverse creative workloads.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold (Winner)\n\nThe culmination of Samsung's efforts to make a sleeker and more versatile folding phone. It's a true hybrid gadget that's a standard phone when closed and opens up to a sprawling 10-inch display, making this a practical, two-in-one device that fits securely in your pocket.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Fold is a solid entry in the book-style folding phone category thanks to its large screens, clean software, and powerful cameras. Together with stylus support, it's a fine option for those who need a device that's focused on productivity\n\nThe OhSnap Mcon is a Bluetooth controller with a slide-out plate to mount your iPhone (via MagSafe) or Android phone (via magnets) for a portable gaming experience. The pocketable accessory can be used in three ways: as a mounted handheld device, a wireless gaming controller, and a docked gaming console when your phone is connected to an external monitor.\n\nCoro feels like a product that should have existed for years. It solves the problem of measuring how much your baby is eating in a simple and meaningful way. I wish it was around when my babies were young.\n\nEarflo is a medical device designed to look and work like a sippy cup for kids as young as two. When you sip from the cup, a small mask forms a seal on your nose, and with each swallow, air flows through the nose. The pressure on the nasal cavity helps releasing trapped fluid in the ear. In a peer-reviewed study, after four weeks of Earflo use, 90 percent of children did not need ear tube surgery three months later.\n\nKids and parents already spend quality time building with Lego. Now, in Lego's CES debut, the company is launching its new Smart Bricks as part of its new Smart Play platform, which brings Lego creations and characters to life. Lego Smart Brick includes a tiny chip inside that enables Legos to tell color, direction, distance, sound and more. Now Lego creations can interact with families, enabling more time together.\n\nSatellai's new collar (Satellai Collar Go) and software (Petsense AI) are proactive tools that could flag subtle behavioral shifts in your dog before they become obvious health problems. It can also warn you when your dog has left your yard, and retails for a reasonable $79.\n\nPawport launched its smart pet door in late 2025. The pet door uses ultra-wideband technology, which can detect how close your dog is to the door. That lets you customize how close your dog needs to be before the door opens, both coming in and out of the house. It also extends the collar tags’ battery life from 12 to 18 months.\n\nOne of the devices debuting is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic wet cat food feeder Petkit describes as its first entry into robotic wet feeding. The unit can dispense scheduled meals over seven days while monitoring consumption through an integrated camera, and can automatically discard spoiled and leftover food.\n\nOf the many humanoid robots to have made their debut at CES 2026, it's Boston Dynamics' Atlas that stands out as the best of the bunch. The prototype version demoed at the show impressed us with its naturalistic walking gait, meanwhile the sleek product version is ready to be deployed into Hyundai manufacturing facilities from this year, where it might just be working on your next car.\n\nThe Solar Mars Bot may never make it to Mars, but it solves several problems with portable generators. It's far easier to move wherever you need and it can chase the sun without intervention.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover can traverse the biggest obstacle for robot vacuums: stairs. It's the first model that can navigate to different floors on its own without the help of a separate attachment. It pulls off this feat thanks to a pair of bendable legs that it controlls independently to avoid obstacles, and it can even clean stairs as it climbs.\n\nThe Lockin V7 Max is a new smart lock that doesn't require recharging or replacing its batteries. Instead of using a removable battery, the V7 Max uses Lockin AuraCharge, an external device that you plug in approximately four meters away, sending a light beam to a receiver on the lock. The lock converts the light into energy to charge its battery.\n\nThe Robotin R2 is the first robot vacuum that can wash and dry a carpet, just like a carpet cleaner. It comes with a core module and two modular attachments that let it switch from vacuuming and mopping to carpet washing and drying. It takes about one hour to clean a 300-400 square foot room and two hours to dry. There's also an absolutely massive base station with two clean water tanks, a large dustbin and a dirty water tank.\n\nThis might save lives. A French startup has created a $200 portable device to test food samples for allergens. The startup, Allergen Alert, only had mock-up devices at CES, but it's licensing the tech from French biofirm bioMérieux. If the startup can pull off the food testing, the impact could be huge. Expect it to arrive in this year's second half.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, it's because Pebble was the first company to popularize smartwatches in 2010s. After several company moves, the brand is back as a startup with a new lineup of affordable watches with battery life improvements and improved form factors. It also has a new AI ring.\n\nThe Nirva AI jewelry is a startup that aims to continuously learn from your real-world behavior by recording your audio throughout the day. From those recordings, it offers advice on work, relationships and everyday decision-making. Nirva positions itself as a personal AI companion, designed to understand your life as you live it. Think of it as \"audio journaling\" after a long day.\n\nClear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (Winner)\n\nAnxious about plastic waste? Clear Drop's Soft Plastic Compactor can mash them into dense bricks to send off to be recycled into products like patio furniture. Clear Drop's product and subscription ensures none of your recycled soft plating ends up in a landfill.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nCambridge Consultants Ouroboros smartwatch\n\nUshering in the new age of right-to-repair legislation is this concept smartwatch design from Cambridge Consultants. It's proof that you can make a smartwatch that allows for self repair without compromising on design or user experience.\n\nThere's plenty of talk about autonomy in cars, but Stutt brings the next-generation technology to an accessible application. The Ev1 mobility scooter can map and then navigate spaces autonomously, allowing people to get around via voice commands. It can also autocorrect manual navigation to prevent bumping into obstacles. This is the rare device that combines mobility, accessibility and autonomy, and it's hard not to be impressed.\n\nDolby Atmos adds a literal new dimension to car audio. However, not everyone can buy a new luxury car just to upgrade their listening experience. Pioneer’s Sphera receiver allows almost anyone to add Dolby Atmos via Apple CarPlay to the car they already own with the speakers already installed and immerse themselves in spatial audio.\n\nPromising huge improvements in energy density, charging speed and safety, solid state battery tech is a holy grail for electric cars, home energy, drones and a host of other applications. Donut Lab is first to market with a solid state battery in a production EV which can be found in partner Verge Motorcycles’ TS Pro Gen 2.\n\nWheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort, and they can struggle through difficult terrain. WheelMoves is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are.\n\nThe Jitlife JS07i is a rideable suitcase that travelers can use to drive long distances through airports. It's the size of a standard cabin bag but carries up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour, and can travel six miles on a charge. Already popular overseas, rideable luggage is making its way to the US, and Jitlife is the best we tried.\n\nThe Samsung S95H is the most impressive TV we saw at CES for a number of reasons, firstly, it’s 35 percent brighter than before. Secondly, it’s a wired TV which is great for gaming, but it has a wireless option for a cleaner look and which enables more connections. Thirdly, it’s the first OLED that can show artwork from the Samsung Art Store — the S95H has anti-burn-in technology that enables it to work like a Frame TV, but with even better image quality.\n\nThe 116UXS builds on the still very new and promising RGB LED TV concept by adding even more color to the mix. Its mini-LED backlight array uses red, green, and blue LEDs, then adds a fourth sky blue (cyan) LED that Hisense says lets it cover 110 percent of the BT.2020 color range.\n\nThe W6 is LG's \"wallpaper\" TV, an OLED TV only 9mm deep that can be mounted nearly flush against a wall. It's one of LG's brightest OLEDs yet, and it's almost completely wireless thanks to its Zero Connect box you can place up to 30 feet away to send it video and its Dolby Atmos FlexConnect-powered LG Sound Suite support for building a spatial audio system around it.\n\nHaving a tiny animated girl living on a small screen inside a physical cylander case is certainly very weird. Lepro's new AI companion Ami is exactly that. Its not quite an AI assistant meant to help with actual tasks. Its an AI meant for a loney person looking for some interaction. The characters dance and gyrate inside the case and can do so at the user's request as well, upping the weirdness factor.\n\nSuck on this lollipop and listen to a song directly from your mouth to your ears using bone conduction technology, so you can \"experience music you can taste.\" I tried it out, and though you had to bite down on it a bit to hear the music, it did work. It's a weird, fun novelty item. It costs $8.99.\n\niPolish touts itself as the \"world's first digital color-changing nails.\" They take the form of press-on nails that you can individually put into a little wand to instantly change the color via a selection of over 400 shades on an app.\n\nPerimenopause affects people transitioning to menopause, and is commonly marked by symptoms such as anxiety, hot flashes, and night sweats. Peri is a wearable designed to track those symptoms, and help you make informed decisions about how to manage them — whether that's through lifestyle changes and supplements alone, or hormone replacement therapy.\n\nA majority of those who menstruate report severe period pain. This wearable neurostimulation device aims to reduce period symptoms and cramps. By attaching near the ear and delivering gentle neurostimulation, the device targets the auricular branches of the trigeminal and vagus nerves to regulate menstrual cycle symptoms and help the body return to a rested state.\n\nFood allergies are common and can cause a wide range of unpleasant symptoms. Severe reactions can be deadly. Allergen Alert is a mini, portable lab that allows you to test food for common allergens on the spot at a restaurant, school, or anywhere you dine out. A single-use pouch analyzes the food sample inserted into the device and displays results within minutes.\n\nBeatbot AquaSense X ecosystem (Winner)\n\nBeatbot has introduced the world's first self-emptying pool robot cleaner. In addition to its industry leading navigation and suction, the AquaSense x Ecosystem removes the worst chore associated with robot vacs — cleaning the debris baskets filled with soggy leaves, slime and bugs. The standalone cleaning dock empties debris into a disposable bag in a bin waiting below. Next, it rinses the internal mechanisms with fresh water fed from an attached hose, keeping the filter, debris baskets and vents clear and clean.\n\nThe Luba 3 AWD stole the show at CES 2026, easily climbing slopes up to 80 percent thanks to its four-wheel drive design. This smart mower also offers wire free navigation enhanced by LiDAR and AI vision, plus adjustable cutting heights. This attractive robot lawnmower can also overcome and avoid obstacles in your yard, from tennis balls to rogue hedgehogs.\n\nBirdfy's smart 4K hummingbird feeder has a beautiful, unique design that more closely resembles an actual flower. Most importantly, it captures slow-motion video at 120 frames per second, letting you see the flap of hummingbirds' wings as they flit through your backyard. Using AI and its 8MP camera, the Hum Bloom will identify 150 different species of avian visitors.\n\nSamsung Galazy Z Trifold (Winner)\n\nA vanguard in melding eye-catching design with genuine utility, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold achieves CES's highest honor, Best Overall. This slim device lives up to the promise of a foldable, full size tablet-phone hybrid that's as functional as it is pocketable. Its futuristic allure and seamless practicality elevate the tech while keeping it within reach.",

    "description": "Finally, a robot vacuum that can climb stairs.",
    "fullText": "Robot vacuums are a convenient way to keep your house clean without actually putting in much work, but they've all got one major problem—what if your house has multiple stories? At CES this year, I saw two attempts to fix this problem, but one of them was much more fabulous than the other.\n\nThis is the more unique of your stair climbing robot vacuums, and the one that's new for this year. At CES 2026, robot vacuum company Roborock introduced the Roborock Saros Rover, which has two fold-out and individually articulated legs built into it, with wheels on either one.\n\nThis lets it act like a standard robot vacuum when it's on flat terrain, but when it hits a pair of stairs, it will use its legs to slowly pull itself up and over them. And because those legs are individually articulated, unlike other solutions, it can clean those stairs while it climbs.\n\nPlus, it can also run through fun programmable routines, like dancing and even hopping. Honestly, it looks a lot more cute than the other bipedal robots I've seen littering this year's CES. Maybe that's because it still serves a concrete purpose.\n\nThe problem? You'll need to get the new model to benefit from the stair climbing, whereas competitors are introducing solutions that work with existing vacuums.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover also doesn't have hard pricing or a release date yet, but Roborock assured me it isn't a concept, and will make its way to market eventually. I was told the goal is this year, but the company couldn't confirm that.\n\nNext to Roborock's booth, I also saw another approach to a stair climbing robot vacuum from competitor Dreame. This actually showed up at German tech conference IFA last year, but it's still worth bringing up, if only to highlight how different the Roborock is. Essentially, instead of building a single robot vacuum model with individual legs, Dreame instead built a dock that your existing robot vacuum can drive into, and then the dock will take it up the stairs like a taxi.\n\nThe catch is that, because the dock needs to be able to drive to the stairs, it does not use individually articulated legs to climb, and instead uses treads that move in sync with each other. This gets it up and down stairs with no problem, but unlike Roborock's solution, it's not able to clean while doing so.\n\nHowever, I'll note that I did personally see Dreame's dock go down a flight of stairs, something Roborock's unit didn't do in the demo I watched. Maybe this is a more stable approach.\n\nUnfortunately, while Roborock said it's definitely planning on bringing the Saros Rover to market, Dreame's dock, called the Cyber X, is still just a concept, and may not actually ever make it to consumers.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Gaming Controllers Are Going Modular This Year",
    "description": "One controller to rule them all!",
    "fullText": "Gaming controllers are just one of those things that I love to collect, but living in a small New York apartment, eventually enough is enough. At CES this year, I saw three new controllers that are all trying to be the last ones I'll ever need to buy (for specific systems, at least). It seems like modularity is in, and all three of these devices want to meet all of your needs. However, they're not settled on what the best approach is.\n\nThe GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron is probably the cutest controller on this list, especially if you grew up playing GameCube or Nintendo 64. Essentially, it's a telescopic mobile controller that stretches to fit around your phone or small tablet, but the gimmick is that all of the face buttons and sticks come in hot swappable modules, and can be freely mixed-and-matched for multiple configurations.\n\nYou could do a standard Xbox style layout. You could opt for a layout with symmetrical, PlayStation style thumbsticks instead. You could use GameCube or Nintendo 64 style face button configurations, which is a unique touch. There are even options for a six-button arcade style layout or a Steam Deck style trackpad.\n\nEssentially, play your cards right, and this thing could fit any need you might possibly have, so long as you're playing on mobile. You could even get weird and slot in a GameCube layout for your left hand and a Nintendo 64 layout for your right hand.\n\nThe different configurations all pop in and out easily, but don't feel loose when you're using the controller. And there are also bells and whistles like back paddles and trigger stops, for extra buttons and quicker reaction times. The sticks are also capacitive, which essentially means they shouldn't drift, but also won't cause magnetic interference like Hall Effect or TMR sticks (other popular anti-drift technology) can.\n\nThe catch? While this isn't a concept, pricing and availability aren't set in stone yet. GameSir also told me it's still figuring out distribution, so it's unclear how many control modules will come with the controller, if you'll be able to buy them separately, and how much they'll cost if you do. The company did say it's targeting a $100 release, but that could change, and it's still figuring out how to make that a reality.\n\nThe other issue, of course, is that this is mobile only, although GameSir said it might make a more traditional version in the future. This isn't the first controller with hot swappable modules, but others are usually pro-level and don't have nearly as many options as the X5 Alteron does.\n\n8BitDo is one of my favorite controller companies, especially for retro style controllers. Last year, it already dipped its toes into modularity with the 8BitDo Pro 3. That was a PlayStation-style controller that allowed you to individually swap out any of the main four face buttons to place them in whatever order you wanted, which made it easier to swap between Xbox (ABXY) and Nintendo (BAYX) style layouts. Now, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e is taking that concept and really running with it.\n\nOfficially licensed by Xbox but also compatible with PC and mobile devices, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e looks like a standard Xbox controller at first, but has a removable face plate that gives you access to a bunch of options. Take it off, and you can lift out the sticks, D-Pad, or face buttons to swap them for ones with a different feel.\n\nYour overall control layout will still be the same—there's no mimicking the GameCube, swapping the order of the ABXY buttons, or changing your stick position here. But you could opt for either a four-way or circular D-Pad or sticks with different lengths or grips, for instance. The ABXY button modules also come in both quiet silicone versions or clicky, micro-switch versions.\n\nThat's a lot of control, and it comes on top of 8BitDo's standard Ultimate controller features, like the included charging dock, extra macro buttons, trigger stops, a gyroscope, and 1,000hz polling.\n\n8BitDo says the Ultimate 3e controller will cost $150 and will come with all your control options. It's set to ship later this year.\n\nWhen I reviewed the MCON magnetic gaming controller late last year, I wanted to love it. It was my favorite product from last CES, but when it came to market, I had a few issues with it that made me feel like it wasn't quite complete. Well, they're still in the prototype phase, but MCON makers OhSnap are now working on two new MCON models that are looking to fix pretty much all of my problems with the original device.\n\nCalled the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite, these versions of the device are much smaller and should be much cheaper than the version that's on the market now, but retain almost all of its features. There are a few compromises to make that happen, but ultimately, they look like moves in the right direction.\n\nFirst, both the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite have manual sliding mechanisms for their controls. That means the controls normally slip tucked away behind your phone, but can be pulled out like an old-school Android keyboard. I actually prefer this. The original MCON instead uses a spring-loaded sliding mechanism, and it's pretty violent, and can send your phone flying if you're not careful.\n\nSecond, when I say these are smaller, I mean it. If the original MCON felt like attaching a MagSafe battery bank to your phone, these feel a lot more like using a MagSafe wallet. I didn't mind the size of the original too much, but it really is impressive how much the new models have slimmed down.\n\nFinally, while pricing isn't finalized yet, MCON told me to expect the new models to be somewhere between 1/3rd to half the price of the current one. That's a huge markdown on the pricey $150 original, even as these fix some of my problems with it.\n\nTo be fair, you do lose out on a little bit here, but not much. The MCON Slim and MCON Lite still have a kickstand mode, and still feature a full set of buttons, but they handle their shoulder buttons and thumbsticks differently. Both the Slim and Lite have \"inline\" shoulder buttons, which means the L1/R1 and L2/R2 buttons are next to each other horizontally rather than stacked. Not a big deal for me, but some people may prefer a console-like layout. The bigger differences come in the thumbsticks.\n\nThe MCON Slim uses 3DS-style circle pads instead of Switch-style thumbsticks, which is how it's able to save so much space. They aren't my favorite, but I've never had any problems making them work. The MCON Lite, then, uses dual-trackpads instead of thumbsticks. That makes it even smaller than the Slim, but I've never had great luck using trackpads for analog style inputs. It could be useful for games that need a mouse, though.\n\nSo, what makes these modular? Well, aside from giving you more model options and carrying forward the removable kickstand mode from the original MCON, part of what allows these models to be so thin is that they use custom backplates designed for certain phones, whereas the original model used a bulkier solution that fits all phones.\n\nThe MCON Slim and MCON Lite are the most conceptual of the devices on this list, but OhSnap assured me that at least one will make its way to market, hopefully this year. Apparently, there are still internal debates about whether the model with trackpads is worth releasing or not.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Ford Is Launching Its Own AI Assistant",
    "description": "Your Ford is getting its own ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Listen up, Ford drivers: You're getting a new AI assistant this year. During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026.\n\nWhile the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.\n\nFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time.\n\nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.\n\nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app.\n\nAs someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.\n\nOf course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuard keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuard is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version, called the iGuardStove, used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuard has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuard can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuard has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuard seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.\n\nUpdate 1/7/2025 at 7:48 a.m. PST: Corrected to note that the new product is named iGuard, and the previous version with motion sensors was iGuardStove.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "Standard wheelchairs are less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.",
    "fullText": "Wheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and on cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort and can struggle through difficult terrain. Standard wheelchairs are simply less capable than electric ones. WheelMove wants to change that.\n\nWheelMove is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are. It debuted at CES 2026, marking a significant leap in accessibility for wheelchair users who travel.\n\nWhen I found WheelMove at CES \"Unveiled,\" I thought back to a recent family trip just two weeks ago, where two of my older family members often rented wheelchairs. They don't use wheelchairs in their day-to-day lives, but walking through a theme park all day wasn't possible. They needed support navigating the park, and the rest of us gladly took shifts pushing their wheelchairs. With a portable attachment like WheelMove, though, wheelchair users can use less effort and enjoy more independence through the battery-powered, remote-controlled attachment.\n\nRiders simply attach WheelMove to the front of any standard wheelchair, and the device lifts the wheelchair's smaller front wheels off the ground. Once attached, the rider controls the WheelMove through a basic remote control on their armrest, thigh, or wherever is most comfortable. The attachment weighs under 20 pounds, including its 10-inch wheel, 250W motor, and a battery that goes about 15 miles on a charge. Carrying an additional battery can double its range before needing to recharge, and it can navigate terrains including gravel, grass, and uneven surfaces like cobblestone.\n\nWheelMove is an incredibly innovative assistive technology poised to broaden personal mobility for those who need it, and it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category. Pre-orders are available in France where the start-up is based, but the founders plan to expand internationally later this year. It costs about €5,000 or $6,000.",

    "fullText": "It's CES week, when the tech world gathers in Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets, prototypes, and innovations that will shape the future. Lifehacker's tech team is on the ground at the convention, tracking down big stories and cool gear.\n\nBilling itself as \"The Most Powerful Tech Event in the World,\" CES (short for \"Consumer Electronics Show\") is the Consumer Technology Association's trade convention. It began in 1967 as a small showcase for televisions and radios, but over the decades CES has become a gathering of the tribes for tech culture. Everyone is there, from huge companies like Samsung and Sony, to scores of journalists, to scrappy startups with big dreams. From innovative AI tools to electric vehicles, laptops, e-readers, and robotic dogs, CES is where tech companies show off their wares, journalists dig up the next big story, and tech insiders network and sneak a look into the future.\n\nCES is held in Las Vegas from Jan. 6-9. The Las Vegas Convention Center hosts the main show floor, but there are CES-related events at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Sphere, and other locations across Las Vegas.\n\nMost major electronics and technology companies are attending CES 2026 in some form. Here are some of the most vital exhibitors:\n\nSamsung Electronics: Samsung's theme this year is \"Your Companion to AI Living,\" and the focus is how artificial intelligence can enhance people's day-to-day lives.\n\nLG Electronics: Describing it as \"innovation in tune with you\" and \"affectionate intelligence,\" LG is showing off its take on AI designed to power robots, appliances, vehicles and TVs.\n\nSony: Sony's main focus this year is mobility. It's unveiling the Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) and showcasing the AFEELA electric vehicle Prototype.\n\nTCL: It's not CES without new TVs, and TCL is showing off a gigantic set with a SQD-Mini LED display.\n\nPanasonic: Under the banner \"The future we make,\" Panasonic promises it is \"leveraging the power of AI to amplify the impact of our human-centric technologies, services and solutions.\"\n\nNVIDIA: The chip-maker is showcasing its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer platform, the Alpamayo reasoning model for self-driving vehicles, and more.\n\nAMD: AMD is unveiling the Ryzen AI processors for PCs and the Ryzen 7 9850X3D for gaming.\n\nIntel: Intel launched its new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed \"Panther Lake.\"\n\nUber: Transportation firm Uber wants you to know about its new robotaxi.\n\nThe LEGO Group: Lovable toy makers LEGO announced \"Smart Bricks,\" packed with a tiny processor that \"brings play to life.\"\n\nIkea: Making its first appearance at CES, Swedish furniture retailer Ikea unveiled 21 new smart home products.\n\nIn fact, so many brands exhibit at CES, it's more notable which ones aren't there. This year's list of no-shows includes Apple (which never really does CES), iRobot, and Tesla. Big brands with a more limited presence include Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nAlong with the expected innovations in televisions and laptops, CES 2026 is crammed with artificial intelligence, robots, and mobility devices, and health-focused wearables. Here are some of the biggest announcements at CES 2026 so far.\n\nAt its keynote, NVIDIA unveiled Alpamayo, \"the world's first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI.\" This could be serious competition for Tesla.\n\nHP showed off a new mini desktop computer, The Eliteboard G1a. You just plug the keyboard into any monitor and go to town. Only time will tell if this is a gimmick or a new form factor.\n\nHyundai and Boston Dynamics showed off humanoid robot Atlas. But Hyundai didn't show off any new electric vehicles, suggesting a cautious outlook for the near future.\n\nBroadcom showed off Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips, providing a practical look into the future.\n\nBelow is a guide to some of the major events at CES 2026.\n\nSunday, January 4: Media Day 1 at Mandalay Bay\n\nMonday, January 5: Media Day 2 at Mandalay Bay. C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nTuesday, January 6: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 10 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nWednesday, January 7: Show Floor Press Conferences, Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nThursday, January 8: Exhibits: 9 AM-6 PM, C-Space: 9 AM - 5 PM\n\nFriday, January 9: Exhibits: 9 AM-4 PM\n\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas – The Official Media Event of CES 2026 with innovative product previews – 4:00-7:00 PM\n\nAMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su, 6:30 PM, The Venetian\n\nSiemens President and CEO Dr. Roland Busch, 8:30 AM, The Venetian\n\nLenovo Chairman and CEO Yuanqing Yang, 5:00 PM, Sphere\n\nCaterpillar CEO Joe Creed, 9:00 AM, The Venetian\n\nCES is a trade-only event, so it's not open to the general public, but if you're affiliated with the tech industry in some way, you can register at CES's official site.

    "title": "CES 2026: I Made Fun of My Daughter, but This Rideable Luggage Made Me a Believer",
    "description": "When my daughter showed me videos of rideable luggage, I was cynical. Then I actually tried it out.",
    "fullText": "Like many parents, sometimes I view my kids as lazy. This was one of those times: At Orlando International Airport, on our way to Disney World, my 16-year-old daughter shared how much she wanted a rideable suitcase. I laughed and told her that she can walk just fine. \"Besides,\" I added, \"that would never work.\"\n\nI hadn't seen rideable luggage yet, and I pointed out the immediate detractions that came to mind. First, it wouldn't work for someone like me—6'3 and 215 pounds. Second, I had doubts that it would have much storage space to carry items, which is the whole point of luggage. And third, who would be caught dead riding something so silly? But my daughter was determined to prove to me not only that they exist, but that they're popular. She showed me videos of them in action. I wasn't convinced.\n\nWe joked about rideable luggage as we walked through the airport. It came up again as we trekked through Disney World. (\"See, if we had rideable luggage, we wouldn't be so tired.\") By the time we walked to baggage claim after returning to LaGuardia, it was a running gag. That same week, as I prepared for CES, I looked into rideable suitcases and made plans to test them out at the show. And as it turns out, my daughter was right.\n\nAt CES, I tried several rideable suitcases, putting my bulky 6'3, 215-pound frame on motorized, battery-powered, airplane cabin-sized bags. The best I rode came from Jitlife, which is premiering its fourth model, the Jitlife JS07i, this year. Not only did it impress, but it's also one of the finalists for the official Best of CES 2026 awards for the travel category.\n\nLike all the suitcases I drove, the Jitlife rideable suitcase is the size of a standard cabin bag but can carry up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of around 8 miles per hour, and can travel about six miles on a charge. The suitcase has a capacity of 28 liters, which is indeed much less than the 60-80 liters of space I expect from a standard check-in bag, but it's better than I thought for something that weighs under 20 pounds and can carry me around. Overall, the kid was right: Rideable luggage can work, and it's actually already a fairly common sight in Asia, particularly in China.\n\nAs for looking goofy riding one, well, I believe my point stands. But, for those with accessibility needs, younger children, or people who prioritize its functionality over the judgment of strangers, rideable luggage might be a worthwhile solution for moving through large airports more quickly and easily. Testing it out is certainly the most fun I've had at CES, so whatever the future of rideable luggage, I'll live with the \"I told you so\" from my kid.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Accessory Can Turn Your MacBook’s Display Into a Touchscreen",
    "description": "The Intricuit Magic Screen is going on Kickstarter soon, the company says.",
    "fullText": "Plenty of people have been asking for a MacBook with a touchscreen display, and now that is possible with the Intricuit Magic Screen, according to an announcement at CES 2026. It's a snap-on accessory that attaches to your MacBook's display, and uses one of the USB-C ports on the laptop for power. Once connected, you can touch the Magic Screen and your input will be registered on the Mac.\n\nThe good news is that this product ships with a stylus, which will make it a lot easier to interact with different Mac apps. When you tap something on your iPhone or iPad, the UI takes into account the fact that your fingers are a lot thicker than a mouse pointer. On the Mac, the default input is the mouse cursor, so the Magic Screen's stylus is better suited to those interactions than using your fingers. Having said that, you can use your fingers with this touchscreen accessory too.\n\nKeep in mind that using a snap-on touchscreen accessory has a few caveats. The first is that you can't quickly close your MacBook's lid when the Magic Screen is attached. The company has added a thick piece of plastic to the base of the accessory. This part rests just above your MacBook's keyboard and it'll stop you from accidentally closing your laptop's lid with the Magic Screen attached. This ensures that you won't accidentally damage your laptop'd display by slamming the lid shut when the accessory is attached.\n\nIt also means that you'll always have to unplug the Magic Screen when you're not using the Mac, which can be a bit annoying. Intricuit says it also works in pen tablet mode, so you can place the Magic Screen on your desk and use your stylus to draw something or to control the Mac. This accessory's battery will last up to 100 hours on a single charge, the company claims.\n\nIntricuit announced this product at CES 2026 and said the Magic Screen will be on Kickstarter soon at a launch price of $139. The company says it expects to start shipping the product in the first quarter of 2026. It currently supports the 16-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 14-inch M-series MacBook Pro, 15-inch M-series MacBook Air, and 13-inch M-series MacBook Air models. You'll just need to choose the correct variant for your laptop while placing the order.",

    "description": "Hard-drive and storage stocks surged after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted data storage as a key AI bottleneck at CES.",
    "fullText": "The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.\n\nThe surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.\n\nSanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.\n\nHuang described the memory storage market as a \"completely unserved market today.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nMemory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.\n\nThe AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.\n\nDriven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\n\"For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,\" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "description": "Lenovo's Yoga Mini i actually has a useful power button.",
    "fullText": "Mini PCs are great for people who want minimal desk setups, but aside from the Mac Mini, they're not really something that appeals to the average user. Most are boring and still-slightly-chunky boxes, come from lesser-known companies like Geekom, and are built either for enterprise or thrifty gamers. What's a Windows user who doesn't want to swap to Apple to do? This year, Lenovo's launching a new Mini PC with some of that Apple sleekness, to try to fill that niche.\n\nUnveiled at CES, the Lenovo Yoga Mini i is a cute little circle that fits in the palm of your hand and weighs just about 1.3 pounds (with small variations depending on how you configure it). A slightly textured, silvery-gray paint job covers the entirety of the device, and ports are generous but stay in dedicated areas on either the rear or side of the device. The rear's got slots for an ethernet port, a USB-A cable, an HDMI cable, and three USB-C cables, with one set aside for power, one for Thunderbolt 4 accessories, and one for all the rest. The side has a 3.5mm headphone jack (thank goodness) and another Thunderbolt 4 port.\n\nIt's an overall attractive appearance, which is important when you're selling something based on form factor, but the kicker is that the power button is actually on the side of the device. It sounds simple, but that's bound to drive people who bought the latest Mac Mini, which has its power button underneath the computer, crazy with envy. Better yet? That power button also doubles as a fingerprint reader for easy sign-ins.\n\nSpecs wise, it comes decked out with the latest Intel Core Ultra X series AI chips, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. It also features a WiFi 7 adapter, two speakers, and even a microphone built-in, for zippy internet connectivity and easy audio calls. That's more than enough performance for the average person, and probably even outclasses my years-old full-size desktop. Don't expect to play the latest games at max settings on it, but this should be roughly equivalent to a high-end productivity laptop if you go for its most powerful configuration options.\n\nTo push it over the edge, the Yoga Mini i also has its own \"one more thing.\" There's actually an accelerometer with a touch sensor inside this thing, so it can work with Lenovo's Smart Connect ecosystem. The company says you can use this to take calls by tapping on the PC, use certain touch gestures to adjust the Yoga Mini's performance mode, or use a customizable double tap to do other actions, like calling up an AI chatbot.\n\nTaken all together, the smooth appearance, user-friendly design tweaks, and tiny size make for probably the closest thing I've seen to a Windows version of the Mac Mini yet—and that goes for the pricing, too. The Yoga Mini i will start at $700, which is $100 more than the base Mac Mini, but is still pretty affordable for those kind of specs in the middle of a memory shortage. Lenovo hasn't said how expensive it could get if you go for extra storage or RAM, too, and it's possible its mid-range configurations could come in at less expensive or around the same price as the Mac Mini's.\n\nPersonally, I was seriously considering downsizing to a Mac Mini for my next computer, but with the Lenovo Yoga Mini i, maybe I'll stick to Windows for at least a little bit longer. If you're in the same boat, Lenovo expects to release the Yoga Mini i sometime this June.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Nvidia's Updated DLSS Makes Games Run Worse on Older GPUs",
    "description": "The most commonly uses Nvidia graphics cards are starting to get left in the dust.",
    "fullText": "Unless you run an AI data center, Nvidia's announcements this CES have been more on the quiet end. There were updates to GeForce Now cloud streaming and its DLSS upscaling tech, but no new graphic cards. That's fine—it's normal for Nvidia to have a quiet year on consumer tech every now and then, and the RTX 50-series GPUs just came out last year. Unfortunately, it turns out those DLSS updates are actually making games run worse on older GPUs.\n\nThe new version of DLSS, called DLSS 4.5, is pretty great when it works. It already makes lighting appear far more realistic even when ray tracing or HDR isn't being used, and in the spring, it will introduce dynamic frame generation, which can adjust how many AI frames are inserted into your game on the fly, so that it doesn't waste compute producing more frames than necessary, or than your monitor can produce. I saw examples of both of these use cases in person at CES, and as someone who mostly plays without upscaling when I can, I was impressed enough that I might want to get a new GPU and make the swap.\n\nAnd I stress that \"new GPU\" part. Unfortunately, DLSS 4.5 only seems to work best on Nvidia's newest cards. It released in beta for all Nvidia GeForce RTX cards yesterday, but gamers on older RTX 3000-series cards are already reporting issues. According to a report from X user Mostly Positive Reviews (via Tom's Hardware), users on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU could see up to a 24% dip in performance in Cyberpunk 2077, and a 14% drop in The Last of Us Part 2. Those are just a few examples, but others in the comments posted their own headaches, as did users on Reddit.\n\nThat's not a small issue. The RTX 3080 Ti might be a few generations behind, but it was near the top of the line when it was current. More importantly, according to Steam's own data, the RTX 3060 is currently the most common graphics card on Steam, and it's weaker than the RTX 3080 Ti. And technically, DLSS 4.5 is available for the even weaker RTX 2000-series, which are bound to run into even more severe problems.\n\nSo where's this massive performance loss coming from, and what can you do about it? Likely, it has to do with the new AI transformer model powering DLSS, which Nvidia said was built with RTX 40-series and RTX 50-series cards in mind. While you can use DLSS 4.5 with an older GPU, it doesn't seem like it's intended.\n\nThankfully, if you decided to try out DLSS 4.5 on an older card and you don't like what you're seeing, you're not stuck with it. Currently, public DLSS 4.5 implementation is in beta, and needs to be applied to games by choosing either the \"Model M\" or \"Model L\" preset in the Nvidia app (under \"Latest\" and \"Custom,\" respectively). Choosing another model, like Model K, should get you back to normal. When DLSS 4.5 gets a full release on January 13, I assume this will get even simpler.\n\nStill, it's not a great look that most Nvidia gamers can't use its exciting new feature. Because it can be reversed, it doesn't break anything, but it also shows that Nvidia is starting to leave all but its most loyal GPU customers behind. And as someone who mostly only uses upscaling while on weaker hardware like the Steam Deck, what I find especially weird is that upscaling is already all about using software to improve performance when you're lacking raw power. That should theoretically make gamers with weaker cards the target audience.\n\nBut it's not all doom-and-gloom for my fellow cheap gamers. Alongside DLSS 4.5, Nvidia also announced a native Linux client for Nvidia GeForce Now, alongside a native Amazon Fire TV app. That extends the cloud gaming platform to even more users, and because GeForce Now has a free tier, it's a pretty sweet deal. Play it right, say by getting a Fire TV on sale and loading up a free game, and you could game using Nvidia's latest GPUs on the big screen while spending less than $20. Sure, you might have to deal with some latency and video compression while doing it—as is the tradeoff with cloud gaming—but as DLSS 4.5 shows, even using local hardware comes with its own problems.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Lenovo Gaming Laptop Can Stretch From 16:9 to ‘Ultrawide’ With the Push of a Button",
    "description": "It's the best of both worlds.",
    "fullText": "Choosing a gaming monitor is a tough choice. Do you want a standard, 16:9 monitor that takes up a small amount of desk space, or a larger 21:9 or even 32:9 ultrawide monitor that takes up more space, but will also show you more of your game? This goes double for laptops, where ultrawide models are few-and-far between, and are absolutely gigantic. Lenovo's new concept for CES, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, aims to give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen the laptop is closed, or when you first open it up, the Legion Pro Rollable looks like any other gaming laptop. It's a little thick, with RGB keys and a full numpad, but otherwise isn't notable. It's also got a bog standard, 16:9 aspect ratio. But with the press of a button, it can extend to a 21:9 ultrawide screen. And while it's not quite as fancy as the 32:9 screens the most spoiled gamers use, you can actually extend it further to a 24:9 screen if you want.\n\nThat trick is possible thanks to a rollable OLED panel, something Lenovo's shown off and even released before, but for laptops that extend vertically, and aren't meant for gamers. The transformation is quick and quiet, and Windows doesn't even need time to adjust to match your new aspect ratio. It kind of feels like you're unfurling a scroll.\n\nIn total, the screen space can extend from 16-inches in 16:9 (or \"Focus\") mode to 21-inches in 21:9 (or \"Tactical\") mode to 24-inches in 24:9 (or \"Arena\" mode). Aspect ratio numbers don't always match screen space measurements that neatly, but hey, they're easy to keep track of here.\n\nHaving up to 24 inches of screen space on-the-go could be a life changer, and not just for gamers. Currently, I'm writing this article while traveling, which means I'm stuck with just my laptop screen. I'm sorely missing the second monitor I have at home, and being able to swap my screen into an ultrawide mode could easily fix that issue. Plus, I could just shrink it back down to a more standard form factor when it comes time to pack it away.\n\nThe only real catches would be weight and price. I don't have specific numbers for how heavy this is, but it didn't feel too different from any other gaming laptop in my hands. Beefy, but not back-breaking.\n\nAs for price, here's the kicker. Because this is just a concept, there's no pricing or availability info, since it's not guaranteed to come out. Lenovo does say the unit I saw is based on a top-specced Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, though, which currently goes for around $3,000.\n\nThat would be a lot to pay, especially because the extending screen would probably add a couple hundred dollars to the price tag. I wouldn't put too much stock into the demo unit right now, though—if this does make it to market, you'll probably be able to configure it to better match your needs.\n\nPersonally, though, I might be willing to pay that $3,000. Not only is this truly unique in the space, but it also conveniently solves one of my biggest pain points when I have to use my laptop, which is the lack of a two-screen setup. It could even be useful for desktop gamers looking to make the transition to portable gaming—no more having to choose which type of monitor you want.",

    "title": "This Radar-Equipped Stove Shutoff Is One of the Most Practical Things I Saw at CES",
    "description": "The iGuardStove keeps seniors safe in the kitchen by reducing the chance of cooking fires.",
    "fullText": "Radar-based sensors seem to be having a moment at CES, especially in tech meant for people to keep tabs on their aging family members. One product in particular caught my eye because it’s focused on a single important function—preventing kitchen fires caused by a person wandering away from the stove.\n\niGuardStove is essentially a smart shutoff for a stove or cooktop. Its new, radar-equipped version costs $399 and can work on gas or electric stoves. (For gas, you’ll need to have a plumber install a shutoff valve.) If you leave the kitchen while cooking, a five-minute timer starts. If you don’t return by the time it goes off, the device either cuts the power to your electric stove, or shuts off the supply line to your gas stove. It can also notify a caregiver that a shutoff event occurred.\n\nA big theme in smart tech this year is aging-in-place. Most older adults would prefer to live at home as long as they can, but health challenges can make that difficult. When it comes to cooking or other activities that require a sharp mind, mental health issues like dementia come into play, as do medications that can have cognitive side effects. With all that in mind, caregivers often worry about a parent leaving the kitchen while cooking, forgetting that the stove is on.\n\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that cooking fires are the top cause of home fires, the top cause of fire-related injuries, and the number three cause of fire-related deaths. Unattended cooking equipment causes half of those deaths. Older adults are overrepresented as fire casualties compared to younger and middle-aged people.\n\nThe device has a five-minute timer, specifically, because that was a safety margin the company developed with safety organization UL, chief marketing officer Jon Landers told me. You can also override the five-minute timer if you’re roasting a turkey or preparing a slow-simmered sauce. In this case you tell the device how long the food is expected to cook, and it lets this cook time complete before resetting to the usual five-minute timer behavior.\n\nA previous version of the iGuardStove used motion detectors, but if you’ve ever worked in an office that had lights on motion sensors, you know why that wasn’t a great solution: sit still at a table for too long, and the lights go off. The older version of the device could potentially shut off while you're just waiting for your dinner to cook, and could be triggered by motion from pets. Radar solves those problems, since it can more accurately identify when a person is in the room.\n\nI’ve been seeing radar in a number of aging-in-place products at CES this year. The Silver Shield from PontoSense uses radar to monitor a person’s presence and movement in a room, reporting movement and potential falls to a caregiver’s app. Luna, a conversation and reminder device from Cairns Health, includes radar that can monitor heart rate and breathing (even through blankets!) when positioned near a person’s bed. The iGuardStove has some monitoring features in common with those devices, but it stays focused on its main task of ensuring stoves aren’t left running unattended.\n\nRadar can “see” a lot, but it doesn’t feel quite as privacy-invading as a camera. Having a device in the kitchen is also a bit less intrusive than in a bedroom, for those who would feel creeped out knowing that a tech device is watching them sleep.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove, the iGuardStove can report to a caregiver (via an app, of course) things like what time each day a person first enters the kitchen. It can catch nighttime wandering if the person visits the kitchen at night; it can also send an alert if the person doesn’t seem to be up and active at their usual time. For example, if your mom usually makes coffee around 9:00 every morning, you can ask the app to notify you if the kitchen is still empty at 10:00.\n\nBesides shutting off the stove and reporting on the presence of a person in the kitchen, the iGuardStove has a few other clever features. The version of the device made for gas stoves can detect unburned gas, in case somebody left it on without a burner running.\n\nThe device can also be configured to keep the stove from being turned on by pets or children, or it can be locked to not allow cooking during certain hours or days (say, at night). The app can also alert a caregiver if temperatures get too hot or cold, prompting them to check in if a heat wave or a cold snap is bad enough to affect indoor temperatures.\n\nWhile a lot of products I’ve seen at CES are speculative or hopeful in their use cases—I often find myself asking “who would actually use this?”—the iGuardStove seems thoughtfully designed and has a concrete use case and benefit. I was impressed! The new device is expected to ship later this year.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Lenovo's New 'AI Frame' Gaming Monitor Might Actually Just Be Cheating",
    "description": "Is it OK to use AI to zoom in on your reticle in a shooter?",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take this for granted, but not everyone is able to immediately look at a shooting or strategy game and find the reticle or map. Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.\n\nHardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help.\n\nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n\nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n\nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.\n\nI suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field).",

    "fullText": "Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.\n\nI'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.\n\nRobotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThings have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?\n\nIt's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the \"long tail\" of self-driving.\n\nUber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.\n\nI'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy\n\nThink of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.\n\nCheck back in for more updates.\n\nThis is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.\n\nI got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: \"Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.\")\n\nMy immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.\n\nUnlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.\n\nThe robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.\n\nMaybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.\n\nUber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.\n\n\"We've been moving very, very quickly,\" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. \"We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.\"",

The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see.

That's why I keep an eye out for products with a shorter launch window so you can actually get your hands on the things you're excited about. The Soundcore Aerofit 2 Pro is one of those products. As Anker itself admits on the product page, the Aerofit 2 Pro isn't for everyone. The biggest quirk of this product is its size. It's a lot bigger than most ANC earbuds, and the ear hooks go all the way around your ears, which isn't a fit that works for everyone. The charging case is also quite large, when compared with other ANC earbuds: It's 4.23 inches (11cm) wide, and it supports wireless charging.\n\nMost noise-cancelling headphones let you switch to a listening mode that allows ambient sounds via software, but the Aerofit 2 Pro lets you do this by physically twisting the earbuds. This adjustment seems quite seamless based on the demo video on the product page, but I haven't tested it in-person, so I'll reserve my judgment until I do. There are five levels of adjustment for the ear hooks, with levels 1 and 2 reserved for open-ear listening, and 4 and 5 for noise cancellation. Level 3 maintains your previous listening mode to prevent accidentally switching to a different mode.",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Tried a Gaming Headset That Can Read Your Mind",
    "description": "Lock in before you drop in.",
    "fullText": "Before this CES, I thought gaming headsets had gotten about as complex as they ever would. How many improvements can you possibly make on speakers and microphones? Well, forget all that. Apparently, the future of gaming headsets is mind reading.\n\nIn a private demo with a colleague from IGN, I tested out a collaboration between HP's HyperX gaming brand and brain-computer interface company Neurable. Neurable's been at CES before, but most of its work has been in the defense and enterprise sectors. The brand is specifically aimed at helping you nail down your focus, and now, Neurable thinks it can use that to help gamers.\n\nBefore trying on the Neurable x HyperX headset, I did a quick run-through in a target shooting game, where I shot down 30 targets with a 547ms response time. Then, I was guided through a focus program called Prime. This showed a cloud of dots on the screen, and I was told to do whatever I needed to do to focus up. I decided to stare into the distance and count, and in about 90 seconds, the dots had shrunken down into a small orb and I was \"primed.\" Neurable also suggested focusing techniques like repeating a word in your head over and over, or following one of the dots as it moved about the screen, but these didn't work for me.\n\nThen, I did the shooting test again. Theoretically, I should have been better, but I actually scored slightly worse this time—a 559ms response time. Still, that response time isn't terrible, and your mileage may vary. I might have already been locked in before priming. In contrast, my colleague actually reduced her response time by about 40ms after priming. If all of that optimization sounds really nitty-gritty, it is. This is aimed at esports players and streamers, where every millisecond counts.\n\nThat's probably where the headset's coolest feature comes in for me. Alongside Prime, Neurable and HyperX are also working on an overlay plugin for streamers that can show their focus levels on screen. You can display this as a speedometer, or as that cloud of dots, or even as a progress bar that shows whether you're \"on tilt\" or not. It should make for some pretty fun interactions with viewers, and play well with existing plug-ins, like eye trackers that show where a streamer is looking.\n\nPlus, my slightly worse response time after priming wasn't totally useless. Neurable said the headset could be used to help you \"practice choking,\" where you psych yourself up shortly after locking in and end up worse off. I thought that sounded like marketing spin, but my colleague, a high-level raider in World of Warcraft, said it would have real use for her.\n\nIt's still just a concept for now, but it's exciting to see this kind of tech getting ready to hit the mass market. What also sets Neurable apart is how portable it is. Unlike other brain-computer interfaces, this just looks like a normal headset, and all the contacts are just stored in the ear cups. There's no need for a giant helmet with discs and wires attached to it, thanks to Neurable's expertise in AI. The company says that using such a compact form factor does result in getting a small amount of data (and a lot of junk data, at that), but thanks to an on-device AI model, it's easily able to detect trends in your focus and translate them into something usable.\n\nThat seemed to be true in my demo, which at the end of the day, kind of felt like a guided meditation with real-time feedback. You could use this for more than gaming, but it's a clever use case for digital mind-reading, and the streaming plugins really take the cake, helping solidify the concept into a clear product with a concrete goal and target audience.\n\nIt'll take a while for the gaming version of Neurable's tech to be ready, although the company said it hopes to get it out this year. In the meantime, you can buy an ultra-luxury headset with Neurable's mind-reading built in, although it's currently on pre-order and will set you back $500. It also won't come with Prime or that streaming plugin, although because those are based in software, that could change in the future.",

    "title": "CES 2026: XREAL's New Gaming Glasses Put a Huge, Fast Gaming Monitor Right on Your Face",
    "description": "Asus and XREAL are working together to make the big screen better for gaming, and smaller than ever before.",
    "fullText": "I've been a fan of XREAL for a while, but outside of people who are really into AR, it's still a lesser-known company. Lifehacker has given XREAL's glasses stellar reviews before, but in the company's new collaboration with Asus, it's aiming to expand its market. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are the first XREAL glasses aimed specifically at gaming (though its other models aren't exactly bad for gaming), and they basically put the best gaming monitor you could ever want right in front of your face.\n\nYou wear these like a normal pair of sunglasses, and you get a massive 171-inch virtual TV floating in a black void right in front of you. It's an OLED, so there are crisp colors and high contrast, and the resolution is a respectable 1080p. Most importantly, the glasses max out at a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning they can display up to 240 frames per second.\n\nTaken all together, that's better than pretty much all of the full-size desktop monitors I have at home, but these are portable. They're barely heavier than my reading glasses, too, and you can set your virtual screen to either be anchored in one spot (meaning it won't follow your head) or stay in front of your eyes at all times. I prefer the former, since it shakes around less.\n\nI also didn't get any of the usual problems I have with AR or VR, like light bleed or fuzzy graphics. Aside from the black void, this really did feel like looking at a real-life screen. And you don't even have to use the full 171 inches, if you prefer something smaller.\n\nAside from the glasses, Asus is also shipping these with a dock, to help you better use them with your various devices. It has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort connection, so you can have up to three devices ready to go at one time. It's probably the most realistic way to simulate gaming on a movie theater screen, and it's only set to improve down the line. Asus told me these glasses will eventually support XREAL's 2D-to-3D conversion tech, which just came out on the new XREAL 1S glasses and automatically converts any image to 3D. The effect uses AI to determine how to split the image between your eyes, but it was so convincing to me when I tried it with Mario Kart World that it felt like it was officially developed by Nintendo.\n\nAnd on that end, I have confirmation from XREAL that the ROG XREAL R1 glasses are compatible with the XREAL Neo mobile dock and battery pack. This is much more compact than the dock that comes with the headset, and, if you plug the glasses and the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it at the same time, it will allow you to play your Nintendo console in AR. Even Asus' dock can't do that without another Switch dock acting as an intermediary first. Plus, this will charge whatever device you're playing at the same time.\n\nThe ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses will release later this year, although pricing isn't available quite yet. They're expected to release in the first half of this year.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Rescue Retriever Wants to Help Firefighters Find Your Pets in a Fire",
    "description": "The silent smoke detector has a strobe light to help locate your pets.",
    "fullText": "No pet owner wants to think about what might happen to their animal friend in the event of a fire. As a dog owner, I know I don't. But fires do happen, and pets can't follow your family fire plan. Rescue Retriever wants to change that. I spoke with the company during CES' Pepcom event, and learned how it's working to make it easier for firefighters to find your pets in the event of a fire. (Rescue Retriever first launched back in March of 2024. The company was started by two brothers—one of whom is a former firefighter.)\n\nDuring a fire, pets tend to run to where they feel safe—maybe that's under the bed, or somewhere tucked away in a room. That makes it difficult for firefighters to locate pets during an emergency: In a situation where seconds count, they don't have the ability to search every corner of a burning home. Unfortunately, as a result, pets sometimes don't make it out. Rescue Retriever wants to change that.\n\nIn an attempt to solve that problem, Rescue Retriever's smoke detector works a bit differently. It isn't supposed to be placed where your current smoke detector is; rather, the idea is to place it where your pet is most likely to go when scared. If you know they like to hide under your bed, for example, you can place the detector there. Once the device detects smoke during a fire, a bright light begins to strobe inside, spread out by a mix of holes placed throughout the device. (Even under the bright lights of Pepcom, the strobe looked intense to me.) That way, firefighters can look out for the strobing lights when trying to locate pets in your home. There's even an accompanying sticker you can place on your home's window, so firefighters know you have a pet to look out for.\n\nThe device is silent, so as to not scare your pets away from their hiding space. It wouldn't do any good to have a beacon for firefighters to locate your pet, only to have them scurry off because of an alarm.\n\nNew from the company this year is the Fire Tag, which brings the strobe light from the main unit to a small tag you can place on your pet's collar. The tag syncs up to the main unit using RFID. When the main unit detect smoke and starts strobing, the Fire Tag will pick up the signal and follow suit.\n\nIt's great that the main unit doesn't make a noise to scare your dog, but that doesn't guarantee they will go to the spot where the smoke alarm is installed—maybe the house smoke alarm scares them again or they don't follow their usual pattern and hide somewhere away from where you placed the main unit. Having a Fire Tag on their collar would give firefighters a better shot at locating the pet, wherever they may be in the home.\n\nRescue Retriever tells me these tags have a range of up to a quarter mile, so if your dog runs away from your house, their collar might still light up. Even still, the Fire Tag opens up, allowing you to place a tracker like an AirTag inside, so if your dog runs out of that quarter mile range, you can still track them if they come within Bluetooth range of a device within the Find My network.\n\nRescue Retriever says the Fire Tag is ready for production, and, when available, can be purchased either individually ($29.99), or as part of a larger bundle with the main Rescue Retriever unit ($89.99). The main unit can be purchased now for $39.99, but it also comes in bundles with accessories for varying prices.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Pawport's Smart Dog Door Launched With One Big Upgrade",
    "description": "This is almost the same pet door I saw last year, except for one major update.",
    "fullText": "If you've been following smart pet tech closely over the last couple years, you might know Pawport. I saw the company's smart pet door at the last two CES's, and was my first introduction to this specific product category. At the time, Pawport hadn't yet launched; now they have. But there's one key difference between the pet door Pawport showed off at CES 2025, and the one that eventually launched late last year.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Pawport's official pet door is the product I saw last year: Pawport is made of aluminum, and is reportedly bulletproof. (The company has a model riddled with bullet holes on display). This smart door is designed to fit over an existing pet door in your home. If you don't have one, the company also sells an insert to install into your wall. It's weatherproof, has deadbolts on the top and bottom for security, and connects to smart home and voice control assistants. It can even work on battery power, though you can also plug it into power.\n\nBut Pawport tells me the big change between last year's prototype and its official launch model is the technology used in the smart tag that attached to your pet's collar. Now, Pawport uses a type of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to communicate between the tag and the door. That gives the user more control over things like how far your pet has to be from the door before it opens: Maybe you prefer your dog to be two feet away inside before it opens, but five feet away when outside. Pawport says UWB also gives the door more security than before. Now, the tech enables end-to-end encryption between the dog collar and the door, so, according to the company, the door can't be hacked. It's a bold claim, but, if true, that should give pet owners some peace of mind.\n\nPawport now also gives pet owners control over whether pets can run outside in adverse weather conditions. If there's rain or lightning, users can configure the app to lock the door from the inside, so pets can't scurry off into an unsafe backyard. That only locks one way, as well, so if the pet is already outside when the weather lock takes effect, they can still get back inside.\n\nIn addition, the company tells me that UWB has extended the battery life of the tag this go around. While the previous prototype was rated for around six months of battery life, the new model has an advertised battery life of one year, though users could see their batteries lasting up to 15 to 18 months.\n\nPawport plans to eventually sell a dedicated outdoor pet door as well, but at the moment, it only sells the indoor unit. That starts at $599 for the company's six standard colors in their medium sized unit, and $849 for one of eight \"signature series\" designs, which adds a polished wood look to the door. You can upgrade to a large unit for another $50, or the extra large unit for an extra $100.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

Hangzhou-based Unitree plans to showcase its \"next-generation humanoids\", while AgiBot will present its full product lineup.\n\nLast week, Chinese robotics firm UBTech reached a key milestone by producing its 1,000th Walker S2 humanoid robot at its Liuzhou manufacturing facility.\n\nChina's advances in humanoid robotics are no longer confined to research centers or industrial labs.\n\nIn Beijing, humanoid machines are now appearing in retail environments next to common consumer products, highlighting how quickly the technology is entering everyday commerce. This shift from experimentation to commercialization is set to gain international attention at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where China's growing influence in the sector will be prominently on display.\n\nOfficial CES figures show that Chinese companies make up the majority of exhibitors in the humanoid robotics category this year. Of the 38 companies participating, 21 are from China, giving the country more than half of the total presence.\n\nThe group includes well-known names such as Unitree Robotics, alongside newcomers like AgiBot and Noetix Robotics, many of which are using the event to pursue international expansion, reports Ajupress.\n\nThe size and diversity of China's showing highlights its growing influence in a sector widely viewed as a critical intersection of advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence.\n\nIndustry analysts note that the number of exhibitors suggests a broad, coordinated effort to establish leadership before the global humanoid market fully takes shape.\n\nChina's advantage is also evident in intellectual property and production capability. Over the past five years, Chinese entities have filed 7,705 humanoid-related patents, compared with 1,561 in the United States, according to a December report by Morgan Stanley. At the same time, Chinese manufacturers are pushing rapidly toward large-scale production, reinforcing their lead beyond research and design, reports Ajupress.\n\nChinese technology companies registered a major presence at CES 2026, with robotics, AI, and consumer electronics set to dominate their showcases.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Unitree sales manager Pedro Zheng invited visitors via LinkedIn last month to \"experience\" the company's next-generation humanoid robots at the event. Hangzhou-based Unitree previously drew attention at CES with a range of humanoid and quadruped robots, underscoring the rapid expansion of its product lineup.\n\nAgiBot, founded by former Huawei \"Genius Youth\" recruit Peng Zhihui, has also confirmed its participation. In a post on X, the Shanghai-based company said it would present its full product portfolio and industry-leading solutions.\n\nFounding partner Yao Maoqing told the Global Times that the showcase reflects AgiBot's ambition to build an ecosystem of humanoid robots capable of operating across industries, environments, and everyday life, moving beyond single-task machines toward embodied intelligence.\n\nChinese firms will face competition from global players such as Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean automaker Hyundai. Boston Dynamics announced last month that its new Atlas humanoid robot will make its public debut at CES 2026, according to SCMP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Br0hD6jUw&pp=ygUdcm9ib3QgaW50ZXJlc3RpbmcgZW5naW5lZXJpbmfSBwkJTQoBhyohjO8%3D\n\nThe Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center will display several Tiangong Walker models, highlighting full autonomy and \"one-brain, many-machines\" coordination for industrial sorting and heavy-duty tasks. Booster Robotics will showcase its Booster K1 and T1 platforms, focusing on multitasking, scenario-ready robotic systems, according to the Global Times.\n\nBeyond robotics, Chinese smart eyewear makers Rokid, Even Realities, and XReal are expected to exhibit, alongside robot vacuum cleaner brands Dreame Technology and Roborock. Lenovo Group will host its largest-ever Tech World event at CES as part of its \"Hybrid AI\" strategy, featuring speakers including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nHong Kong will also send its largest CES delegation to date, with 60 tech companies showcasing innovations across AI, health, smart cities, and sports technology.",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Water Dispenser Uses Facial Recognition to Track Your Cats' Drinking Habits",
    "description": "If you have more than one cat, it can track them all.",
    "fullText": "I spent some time with Petkit on the show floor of CES on Monday, where I got to see the company's automatic wet food cat feeder, its newest smart litter box, as well as an AI-powered water dispenser. Of course, a water dispenser should ideally do one thing: dispense fresh water for your pet. The Eversweet Ultra water dispenser, however, adds a number of smart features to the mix, some of which actually seem particular useful for owners of multiple cats.\n\nI first learned about this water dispenser last week when Petkit officially announced it, and some of the specs and features are the same on paper as they are in person: This smart dispenser comes with a five-liter tank, as well as a 1080p camera with a 140-degree-wide-angle view. That allows you to see your cat approach the dispenser, as well as monitor their drinking habits. You can either choose to tap into a live stream to watch them as they drink, or check out prerecorded clips saved to the app. Petkit tells me the app even chops up clips for you to post to your socials automatically—if you think your friends and family want close-ups of your cat taking a drink.\n\nOne of Petkit's selling points here, however, is the health tracking. The clips aren't just for posting to stories; instead, the camera can track how your pet drinks over time, noting any discrepancies or changes. You can see daily, monthly, and even yearly drinking trends, so you know whether your cat is drinking an abnormal amount of water for January. I'd want to consult a veterinarian before definitively stating whether this type of tracking is effective, but I can imagine it might be useful to know whether your cat changes its behaviors—something you might not notice if you aren't diligently watching them drink.\n\nThat doesn't change if you have multiple cats, either. The Eversweet's camera uses machine learning for facial recognition, and can identify individual cats in your home. That health tracking can apply to specific cats as they drink water, so you shouldn't have results mixed between your various pets. If you really want to know when one cat is drinking water over another, this should help you keep track.\n\nWhile some water dispensers recycle the water, the Eversweet disposes of the water after a set period of time. I knew about this from the press release, but it was fun seeing the machine dump the water in real time: The pump that serves to keep the water running cuts out, and the entire mechanism lifts up to reveal a drain. The water dumps out, and a spout refills the tank, only to dump the water again. This is an attempt to clean out the tray, and remove any bits of hair or debris that might've been left behind.\n\nPetkit also made a point of showing me that the dispenser's pump is always running, which turns the Eversweet into a bit of a water feature—not that you should buy one just for decoration. The idea is, cats are a bit more attracted to the moving water than still water, which encourages them to drink. I don't have a cat, so I can't speak to that, but it's an added aesthetic perk—until the water dumps out, of course.\n\nPetkit says it's aiming for an April release for the Eversweet, which will be available on both Amazon as well as through Petkit's official site.",

    "title": "CES 2026: AMD Just Showed Off 'Helios,' the Hardware That Will Power the AI Content in Your Feeds",
    "description": "\"The world's best AI rack.\"",
    "fullText": "When you come across an AI video on Instagram, or watch ChatGPT respond to your query, do you ever think about how that content was generated? Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware.\n\nDuring a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced \"Helios\" against a backdrop of dramatic music, the company's upcoming AI rack, that packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds.\n\nEach \"cross-section\" of these racks, if you will, is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: The company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out Bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\n\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.\n\nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking its real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in.\n\nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.\n\nIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking whe compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nThese new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.",

    "description": "Who needs a screen?",
    "fullText": "If you're anything like me, you spend 90% of your time using your laptop with it docked and plugged into a monitor (or two). And if you're at that point, you might be wondering why you even bother having a screen attached to your computer at all. If so, HP's got your back. Announced at this year's CES, the HP Eliteboard G1a looks like a normal keyboard on the outside, but on the inside, it's got a whole Windows PC.\n\nThat's not exactly a new concept, but with the experimental days of Windows XP long behind us, it's mostly been reserved for less powerful, Linux-based single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi. That's great if you're a hacker or tinkerer, but not if you're just looking for a screenless, keyboard-equipped Mini PC to get you through the workday.\n\nThe Eliteboard G1a, instead, comes equipped with the latest AMD Ryzen AI chips, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage, so while you shouldn't expect to play the latest and greatest games on it, for internet browsers and lightweight productivity programs, it should really be able to hustle.\n\nIt's also a bit of a sleeper build. I've been able to go hands-on with it, and to all outside eyes, it really does look like a regular office keyboard, complete with black, low-profile chiclet keys, a function row, and a numpad. Ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 pounds based on how you spec it out, it's also pretty lightweight, and the right person might believe you if you said it was just a keyboard, with no computer inside whatsoever.\n\nThe catch? This baby is aimed at enterprise customers, rather than your typical consumer. That does come with a few bonuses, like a Kensington lock slot, some extra security software, and an optional fingerprint reader. But it also means you're not going to find it up for sale anywhere other than the HP store, and while pricing hasn't been announced yet, it'll probably be a bit more expensive if bought individually rather than as part of an office fleet. It can also only connect to monitors using DisplayPort, which is fine if you're an office manager that knows to buy displays that will work with it, but may not fit into everyone's home set-up.\n\nThat's a shame, because I love unusual form factors, and this keyboard PC could make for a really clean desk in my home office. It's strong enough, uses a familiar operating system with wide app compatibility, and can even output to two 4K monitors at once. There are also two versions, one that always needs to be plugged in, and one with a battery and a detachable USB power cable for quickly moving between different workstations. That's great flexibility, since the battery version is a bit more portable, but is also heavier.\n\nHere's hoping this is just an early experiment for HP, because I'd love to buy a consumer version of this laptop at some point in the future. If you're willing to take the plunge on the enterprise model, though, HP says it's expected to launch on HP.com sometime in March.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Intel's New Chips Are Coming For Your Gaming Handhelds",
    "description": "Intel's got a new integrated GPU, and is promising better battery life.",
    "fullText": "Every year at CES, Intel and AMD announce their newest processors. This year, Intel debuted its first line of chips made with its 18a process, which stands for 18 angstroms, or under 2nm. To make that a little less nerdy, that means these chips can fit a lot of tech into a small area, which means big gains in performance.\n\nColloquially called Panther Lake, the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips are focused on laptops and mini-PCs. But that doesn't mean they don't put out impressive numbers. During its keynote, Intel promised \"77% faster gaming performance,\" and for everyone actually using their PCs to do work, \"60% better multithread performance.\" Impressively, it also said its new chips would also enable \"up to 27 hours of battery life,\" rivaling Apple's M-series chips and other ARM chips from manufacturers like Qualcomm. Battery life has been a sore spot for both Intel and AMD for a while, and I'm excited to get my hands on machines that use Panther Lake processors.\n\nAnd then there's the AI. Intel says its top Intel Core Ultra Series 3 models have 50 NPU TOPs and 180 TOPS in total when you combine the NPU and GPU numbers. To translate, that basically means faster AI performance for developers who don't want to bother with the cloud, and would prefer the speed and privacy of a locally downloaded AI model.\n\nSpeaking of that GPU, Intel's upgraded its integrated graphics this generation to the Intel Arc B390, which has twice the cache of its prior GPU and 50% more cores. I already mentioned that 77% increase in gaming performance, but AI developers will also see a 53% increase in performance over Intel Core Ultra Series 2, and a two times performance increase over Intel Core Ultra Series 1.\n\nSo, better computers. That's pretty par for the course for CES, but there is a \"one more thing\" here. Intel is coming for AMD's dominance in handheld gaming PCs.\n\nUntil now, most handheld gaming PCs have used AMD chips, with those that have opted for Intel getting hit in reviews for buggy or poorly optimized performance. The Steam Deck uses an AMD chip, and so does the Xbox handheld. Intel says it's going to change that.\n\nAfter announcing the new integrated GPU and walking through features like frame generation and ray tracing, the company said it \"will be launching an entire handheld gaming platform with Panther Lake.\"\n\nThat means big moves, and soon—Panther Lake won't last long before getting replaced. The company didn't say much more, but it did show a slide with partners set to use Intel chips in their handhelds, including Acer, MSI, and hey, Microsoft. I guess we'll see another Xbox handheld model soon.\n\nAnd that's about it for Intel this year. The new chips are smaller, stronger, and more efficient, but smartly, the company is also planning to use them to shore up its weaknesses, specifically in gaming and battery life. That makes sense. With developers like Apple having famously ditched Intel throughout the decade, the company has been on the backfoot.\n\nAccording to Intel, the earliest machines powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will start accepting pre-orders on January 6, with availability beginning on January 27.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Sony's Keynote This Year Was All About Electric Cars",
    "description": "The Sony Honda Mobility Afeela 1 is finally coming out.",
    "fullText": "At last year's CES, Sony's press conference showed off products from all over its portfolio, including a first look at The Last of Us season 2. This year, it was all about the Afeela, an electric car Sony's making in collaboration with Honda that it's been teasing for years, but is now finally getting ready to release.\n\nSony has big plans for Afeela. Previews have been less about hard specs like mileage or speed and more about the company's plans to change how we look at cars. Previously, that's included demo'ing integrations with other Sony services like Crunchyroll and themes for the car's interior based on Sony brands. Just last month, the company confirmed it would support PlayStation Remote Play in the Afeela, after teasing it at CES 2024. And the first time I saw the Afeela at CES, it was driven onto stage using a PS5 controller.\n\nNow, Sony's ready to talk more than aesthetics and cute integrations, but that unique voice didn't go anywhere. Headlining the show was the promise that the company's currently working on something called Afeela Intelligent Drive. Currently, it's sitting at level 2+ driver assistance, which means it can handle tasks like merging or lane changes, but Sony's planning to take it to level 4+ \"in the future,\" meaning full self-driving within certain areas. It probably won't be ready for launch, but it does show the company's getting serious about usability.\n\nOn that note, it also showed concepts for a future where Afeela users will basically just chill while the car drives itself. Those kind of promises aren't rare at CES, but Sony specifically called out its brand of entertainment products as what riders would occupy themselves with on their rides. Combined with the Intelligent Drive news, apparently that's what all those ecosystem cross-promotions were leading towards.\n\nBut until that future arrives, Sony still isn't afraid to use Afeela to push its products, although it isn't stopping there. The company brought PlayStation on stage to quickly reaffirm Remote Play will be baked into the Afeela (while also dropping the surprising stat that apparently half of all PlayStation Remote Play sessions now happen on the PlayStation Portal streaming handheld). It also said that the Afeela will have themes for its touchscreens based on Sony properties like Astro Bot and Gran Turismo. None of that is too far off from what the company's shown before, but the idea of turning your car into a media ecosystem doesn't stop there. Sony also announced the Afeela co-creation program, which will let developers and content creators make their own custom apps or media for the car.\n\nThese include things like themes and even special Android apps, but apparently, drivers can even customize the Afeela's \"motor\" sound, and put visuals on a small \"media bar\" on the front of the car. As an example, Sony brought out Japanese music producer Tomoko Ida, who demonstrated a motor sound she created that sounded more like a THX commercial than anything else.\n\nIt's honestly a pretty clever move for a car that's been all about the ecosystem as opposed to the hard specs so far. But it does have one oddity that maybe speaks to how long this thing's been teased. Apparently, developers for the Co-Creation program will be able to get paid in crypto, which Sony says will \"accelerate open co-creation,\" although it also says the Co-Creation program will be \"open to other automakers and service providers.\" I'm not sure Toyota will want to get paid on the blockchain, but whatever.\n\nDrivers will be able to access utilities and apps made for their Afeela using an app, but that raises the question: When will you finally be able to drive this thing?\n\nThe Afeela has been teased since CES 2023, but finally Sony says the car is in production and will begin delivering to customers in California sometime this year. In fact, all the photos you've seen of the Afeela throughout this article have been of an actual pre-production model for the initial Afeela car, now called Afeela 1.\n\nThat's huge for Afeela, but there is a catch. Those deliveries might take a while to reach the rest of the country. Sony says Arizona is next on its radar, but that sales won't make it there until 2027. Japanese deliveries are also slated for 2027, but living in New York, I'll just have to keep pretending this thing doesn't exist.\n\nThat's a bit of a blow for a car that started off this press conference promising a new future for how we drive, since even once it gets on the streets, it'll probably take even longer for that to come true. Still, Sony says it will allow people who have already registered to buy a car to start doing test drives of the car sometime before deliveries begin.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't cover cars much, and that this year's Sony press conference was all about one maybe points to a quiet year across the rest of the brand. That said, for people who are into driving, I can see the Afeela's appeal. It definitely feels more like a gadget than a gas guzzler, and I'm wondering if this is what the Apple Car might have looked like if it ever came out.\n\nProbably not—despite the fancy mock-ups, I did sit inside an Afeela last year, and it was fancy but still familiar. But that's also not where Afeela is stopping. Sony ended its keynote by driving the \"Afeela Prototype 2026\" onto the stage. It didn't look that different from the outside, but the company says it will offer \"greater spatial flexibility and accessibility.\" To me, that implies a step closer towards that future where the car is essentially a hangout zone that moves you while you play PlayStation, but only time will tell. I'll see you when I actually get behind the wheel of one of these things, probably sometimes in 2040.",

    "title": "CES 2026: These Smart Glasses Can Help Some People See Even Better Than Normal Glasses",
    "description": "People with central vision loss can see text and faces with this device.",
    "fullText": "“Smart” glasses have been big at CES this year, but the headset that has impressed me most is a device that helps people with central vision loss, including those who are considered “legally blind,” to see what they otherwise couldn’t. At a press event, I met a woman with macular degeneration, Liz Baker, who uses them daily—and I got to try them myself.\n\nThe device is called eSight Go. It’s a headset with little screens in front of your eyes, sort of like a VR headset, but small enough to perch on your nose. The device’s battery pack sits around the back of your neck, so that you don’t have to support the weight of the battery on your head. The glasses are bulky, but the battery pack design made them comfortable for me to wear.\n\nThe device is designed for people with central vision loss, which includes conditions like macular degeneration. In these conditions, the middle of the person’s visual field isn’t clear—things they look directly at appear blurry or simply aren’t visible, but their peripheral vision is still clear.\n\nRegular eyewear can’t correct this issue, since the information in the center of the visual field just isn’t there. But the eSight device works by zooming in so much that the person’s peripheral vision is able to process what they’re seeing, and that central “blind spot” essentially disappears. The company’s studies show that people gain seven lines of improvement on vision charts—that’s huge.\n\nIt’s hard for me, as a sighted person, to know exactly what that’s like, but Baker gave me a few examples. With the device, she can read ingredient labels and see people’s facial features; without it, those things are literally a blur. She told me about noticing her daughter’s freckles when looking through the eSight device, and using it to shop without help. (Previously, small text at stores was impossible to read; she says she kept buying shampoo when she meant to buy conditioner.)\n\nThe device has a dizzying array of features that I wasn’t able to master in my short time with it. To name a few: You can zoom in and out with buttons on the arm of the headset, or with a handheld remote. You can increase the contrast of whatever you're looking at. You can freeze-frame, zoom in, and then move your head to read the enlarged image as if it were a giant billboard in front of you (even if it’s something small or far away, like a brochure in your hand or a menu on a restaurant wall.)\n\nThe device costs $4,950 and is not covered by most insurance. It comes with access to a “coach” who is themselves an eSight user with vision loss who can talk new users through learning the features or helping them to figure out how to do specific tasks.\n\nThe battery life on the eSight Go is about four hours, so I asked Baker how she keeps the device charged throughout the day. She says she doesn’t wear the glasses continuously, which saves battery life. She keeps them around her neck (essentially in a sleep mode) when she isn’t actively using them to read text or look at a specific thing in detail.\n\nDirector of sales Roland Mattern says people who test the glasses sometimes zoom all the way in and note that the image can be pixelated, but most users don’t need the max zoom level, and those who do tend to find that it’s still an improvement over what they can see without the glasses.\n\nThe hefty price isn’t usually covered by insurance, although the Department of Veterans Affairs will cover it, and Mattern says a few users with other insurance companies have sometimes managed to get coverage. Sometimes other programs can cover it, like state-run vocational rehabilitation programs that help people with disabilities return to work.",

    "description": "At the CES conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive, said the more efficient and powerful chip would begin shipping later this year.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.\n\nMr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.\n\nNvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nCompanies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.\n\nIf the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.\n\n“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.\n\nThe Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.\n\nBut the company is facing increased competition from chip makers and even some customers who are eager to seize a slice of the lucrative A.I. industry. Last year, Advanced Micro Devices, known as AMD, and Google, which buys Nvidia chips but also makes its own chips, struck deals to provide their technology to OpenAI, one of the world’s largest users of A.I. chips.\n\nThe rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.\n\nBecause more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.\n\nThe competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.\n\nIn December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.\n\nDemand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.\n\nNvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.\n\nSince 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.\n\nMr. Huang said the company started working on self-driving technology eight years ago. It has more than a thousand people working on the project.\n\n“Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,” Mr. Huang said.",

According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\n\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\n\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\n\nNvidia said companies including Lucid (LCID), Uber (UBER), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\n\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Intel launched Panther Lake, its new AI chip for laptops, on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, as the company seeks to ​reassure investors about the first product made using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A.\n\nJim Johnson, ‌senior vice president and general manager of Intel's PC group, offered technical details about the company's first line of Panther Lake chips known ‌as Intel Core Ultra Series 3. The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first products with the 18A manufacturing process in 2025, referring to ⁠the Panther Lake chips.\n\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar ‌Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share ‍it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ​would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\n\nIntel plans to launch a platform ‌for handheld video games based on the Panther Lake designs this year, Johnson said. Handheld PCs designed by a range of suppliers have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, ⁠AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ​EST on Monday  (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will ​likely launch new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\n\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies ‍plan to deploy this year. ⁠The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\n\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia, Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES ⁠on Monday. He said the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing ‌of the company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast Is an Automatic Wet Food Feeder for Your Cat",
    "description": "The Yumshare can automatically dispense wet food for up to one week.",
    "fullText": "I don't have a cat, but I do have a dog, and my dog can be a picky eater. After months of trial and error, the only way we could get him to consistently eat breakfast and dinner was with wet food. There is no scenario in which I or someone watching my dog can outsource the task of feeding him, but that's not the case for cat owners. I know that cats sometimes stay home alone for extended periods of time, where an automatic food dispenser becomes essential. I can only imagine, then, that cat owners who, like me, feed their pet wet food, now have a challenge: Someone has to be there to feed the cat.\n\nThat's what intrigues me about Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast, an automated cat feeder that specifically works with wet food. I covered the Yumshare briefly when Petkit first announced it last week, but I got some hands-on time with the product today on the CES show floor. And while the device I saw isn't going to market just yet, I was intrigued.\n\nThe concept itself is pretty simple, but a bit more complex in execution. As you might expect, the feeder distributes portions of food for your cat to eat when you're not available—only here, that food is wet, not dry. To achieve this, Petkit outfitted the Yumshare with a chamber that can hold up to seven pouches of wet food at once. These pouches are designed for the Yumshare alone: Right now, the only company making pouches is Food Chain, which uses Petkit's proprietary design to fit the Yumshare, but it's possible more companies more jump on board in the future.\n\nWhen the Yumshare first opens one of these pouches, it sets a timer: After 48 hours, the pouch is discarded. In the meantime, the machine can automatically dole out portions set by the user, into a cup, which is stored in a separate chamber in the device. Once the portion is distributed, the pouch is sealed until the next portion is needed. The machine also uses UVC ultraviolet light to sanitize the package, with the goal of eliminating bacteria.\n\nThe automation extends to the portion of wet food itself, as well. Whether your cat eats all of the food, some of the food, or none of the food, the Yumshare can discard what's left when it detects it's time to do so. That might be the AI camera identifying that the food has dried up, or an internal clock recognizing that too much time has passed for the food to be safe to eat. Either way, the food drops into a waste compartment, which can hold up to 15 cups at once. The stand remains empty until it's time to hand out another portion of food.\n\nHow large or small each portion is, as well as how often portions are distributed, is up to you. Petkit showed me a mockup of the Yumshare's app, which lets you customize this feeding schedule. The app will also tell you how many portions have been distributed, and how many are left in the chamber. You can also take a look at a live video feed of your cat, via the 4K camera embedded in the device, or view a clip history of your cat's feeding habits.\n\nMy only question is the lack of refrigeration: Petkit says that there is no need for it, since the pouches are all sealed until use, closed in between portions, and the chamber uses ultraviolet light to sterilize for bacteria. But I'd want to confirm there are no health risks to keeping an opened pouch unrefrigerated for up to two full days, even with that UVC light. Assuming that's true, I'm quite impressed with this prototype. If I were a cat owner that frequently needed to leave my pet alone at breakfast and dinner, this is something I'd have my eye on.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Asus' New Gaming Laptop Looks Like a Gigantic Nintendo DS",
    "description": "The ROG Zephyrus Duo is back for 2026, with two full-sized screens.",
    "fullText": "CES is the time of year for weird computers, and Asus is bringing back an old fan favorite to help fill its unusual form factor quota. Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.\n\nLooking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n\nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\n\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n\nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n\nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.\n\nThe new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "description": "Help me, ROG. You're my only hope.",
    "fullText": "With the rise of streaming culture, a lot of gamers have started investing in computers that don't just play games well, but that look good while doing it. Asus's newest pre-built gaming desktop, the ROG G1000, is pretty by-the-book when it comes to high-end performance, but it's got one major selling point when it comes to those all-important gamer aesthetics: holograms.\n\nBuilt into this computer's front panel and one of its side panels, safely tucked into inaccessible glass windows, are rapidly rotating LED strips that, when in motion, create convincing full-color images that appear to have depth. The \"frame rate\" can be a little low, but it's a known technology that's all over the show floor at every CES now, and you can actually buy generic standalone hologram fans on Amazon for around $60-$100. It's just rare to see it integrated into something like a PC.\n\nThis hologram tech, called AniMe Holo, should make for a great way to show off on camera (or to your buddies in a college dorm) and Asus is promising some pretty expansive customizability. You can put still images and gifs on it, sure, but Asus also told journalists it can support full videos or mp4 files, without any limit on length. I think I'd try to use it to watch Shrek.\n\nThe effect comes across a bit better in-person, but it's still unusual enough to look enticing over video, even if you lose some of the depth. Unfortunately, still photos aren't really a great way to show this thing off, since they can't depict the rotating motion.\n\nAesthetics aside, the G1000 is also at the top of the power game, coming with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 3D CPU, an RTX 5090 GPU, up to 128GB of RAM, and a 2TB storage. It's got bite to back up its bark, and will be able to play the latest games at max settings with no issue.\n\nOf course, specs like that are likely to cost you a pretty penny, especially with the hologram gimmick tossed on top of them. Asus hasn't tipped its hand on pricing yet, but the ROG G1000 is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see.

    "description": "With sensors on a handle, and a screen to display data, the Body Scan 2 may replace a smartwatch in addition to a smart scale.",
    "fullText": "Withings launched their $600 Body Scan 2 smart scale at CES Unveiled last night—but they're positioning it as a \"longevity station\" rather than a smart scale. The device has a handle in addition to the footplate, which allows for extra sensors, and the new features include things like hypertension notifications that we've previously seen from smartwatches. (Hypertension notifications only just came to the Apple Watch a few months ago.)\n\nI got to see the Body Scan 2 at a CES event but haven't had a chance to use it for myself. According to Withings, the Body Scan 2 can measure \"60+ biomarkers\" that it says are relevant to tracking your health over time. With the caveat that I'm asking the company \n\nSmart scales generally aren't very accurate for data like body fat percentage, or really anything that goes beyond simple body weight. A typical smart scale runs a weak electrical current from one foot to another, measuring the electrical resistance of your lower legs. The Body Scan 2 adds a handle with electrodes, which brings the upper body into the mix. The screen on the handle also allows it to display data like ECG readings or other detailed results. Since the screen is in your hands, you don't have to squint at a display at your feet. (In product photos, the retractable handle sits on top of the footplate, but at yesterday's demo, Withings had the handles mounted on little holders at hand height.\n\nThis setup allows for more detailed data than smart scales can usually measure. For example, a Withings rep told me yesterday that it can measure arterial stiffness by comparing the timing of your pulse in your torso, hands, and feet—the faster blood flows between these areas, the better. The Body Scan 2 uses impedance cardiography, a well-studied technology that can measure several aspects of heart health, and it includes a six-lead ECG. This means you can get ECG data and hypertension notifications—two headline Apple Watch features—without having to wear a watch every day.\n\nThe scale isn't yet available for sale, but Withings estimates that it will be available in the second quarter of this year, pending FDA clearance for some features. The price will be $599.95. Withings already sells a first-generation Body Scan scale, with a handle but with fewer sensors and without a screen on the handle, for $399.95.",

    "title": "CES 2026: You Can Finally Use XREAL's AR Glasses With the Nintendo Switch 2",
    "description": "Plus, XREAL's new AR glasses can automatically convert 2D content to 3D.",
    "fullText": "At CES 2026, I was able to play the Nintendo Switch 2 in AR. That's something I hadn't done before, and that's because until now, only one company had an AR dock that worked with Nintendo's latest console, which doesn't like to play nice with AR glasses plugged directly into it. Viture's solution is fine, if a bit bulky, but Lifehacker has long praised the AR glasses from competitor XREAL, and finally, you can use XREAL glasses with the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nPreviously, XREAL did have an accessory that allowed for gameplay on the original Nintendo Switch, but it's since been discontinued, and even if you buy it secondhand, it won't work with the Switch 2. Now, the XREAL NEO changes that.\n\nComing in smaller than Viture's dock, the NEO is basically a combination portable battery bank and AR adapter that allows you to use your XREAL glasses while powering them and charging/converting whatever device you're displaying at the same time. It's got a 10,000 mAh capacity and a 20W output on its own—enough for fast charging—but you can also plug it into a wall while using it, which will allow your devices to charge at 65W+. That should be especially handy if you're primarily using the Neo as an adapter, and yes, it will allow your glasses to display the original Switch as well, not just the Switch 2. XREAL also notes that you can use the Neo on other handhelds like the Steam Deck, although it's a bit less necessary there, as the Steam Deck can output video to XREAL glasses directly.\n\nIn a confusing move, the Neo also has a magnetic ring to attach directly to your device, but it can't charge wirelessly. It seems the magnet is more there for easy storage, and so you can use a flip-out kickstand on the back of the Neo to prop your device up.\n\nUsing the Neo with the Switch 2, it worked like a dream. The console immediately swapped over to docked mode and started playing on a connected pair of XREAL glasses like it was on a television, which gave me a virtual 171-inch screen and graphics outputting at 1200p. Oh, and those graphics? They were in 3D.\n\nThat's because, alongside the Neo, I got to test out the new XREAL 1S AR glasses. These bump the resolution up to 1200p, and increase the FOV from the base XREAL One's 50 degrees to 52 degrees. Refresh rate is still 120Hz, but the glasses are brighter (at 700 nits) and the aspect ratio is larger, at 16:10. Most importantly, these come with the ability to add 3D depth to 2D imagery out of the box.\n\nI tried it out with Mario Kart World, and if you told me the game was designed with this 3D natively, I would have believed you. It was flawless, just the right amount of subtle, and I never saw any telltale blur around the characters. According to XREAL, though, the 2D-to-3D conversion is happening entirely within the glasses using the onboard spatial chip and AI.\n\nThis has the benefit of working with any content you plug into the XREAL 1S, although XREAL did warn me the effect might not come across as well for flat content as opposed to content using CGI. For instance, the AI just didn't know what to do with the original Super Mario Bros. for NES, leading to some elements getting depth and others being ignored.\n\nStill, you can turn the effect off in those cases, and I could see it being really handy if you're a big fan of 3D movies, since it can be kind of hard to find them on streaming. Now, you can turn any movie 3D, even if your mileage may vary from flick to flick.\n\nThe best part of the XREAL 1S, though? Despite the upgrades, they're actually cheaper than the base XREAL ONE, at $449 vs. $499. And they're available now, with estimated delivery windows sitting around this weekend. Plus, if you don't want to get a new pair of AR glasses, the 2D-to-3D conversion tech, called Real 3D, is also now out for the XREAL ONE Pro, and can be downloaded in an update.\n\nThe XREAL NEO, meanwhile, is currently only up for pre-order, with shipments scheduled to start in February. The Neo is available for $99 until February 4, by the way, but the price will jump up to $119 after that.\n\nEven with the cheaper NEO pricing, the total package for both the dock and the glasses will cost you $548. But if you really miss the 3DS, this is another easy way to play your Nintendo games in 3D, without sacrificing portably, but while keeping a big screen at the same time.",

    "fullText": "We're just hours away from the start of CES 2026, and with that comes Intel's launch event. The chip giant is expected to provide more details on its AI PC initiative and the new processors powering it: The Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs (aka Panther Lake) are made using an 18A process — that's 18 angstroms, or just under 2nm — and designed for high-end laptops and gaming devices.\n\nFor Intel, the stakes at CES are higher than ever. In the past 12 months, both NVIDIA and the US government acquired ownership stakes in the company, helping nearly double the stock price by the end of the year. But that's still down over more than 20 percent since 2021, as rivals like TSMC, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA have taken the leadership mantle in chip fabrication and AI hardware.\n\nSenior VP of Intel's Client Computing Group Jim Johnson will kick off the launch event on Monday, January 5 at 6PM ET. A livestream will be available on the Intel Newsroom YouTube channel, which we'll post here when it's live.\n\nAs we noted above, Intel has publicly confirmed that it will be highlighting \"the next generation of Intel-powered PCs, edge solution, and the AI experiences enabled by the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Processors.\" We'll be keen to hear if the company can address the profitability concerns that have surrounded those next-gen chips since at least last summer, when published reports indicated that yields were still under 50 percent. (In response, Intel told Engadget that it felt \"very good\" about its trajectory on Panther Lake, though it didn't hit the late 2025 release date it had envisioned at the time.)\n\nWill we get any updates on that NVIDIA partnership? It's possible. But don't expect to hear anything about Intel possibly fabricating the chips for that rumored new entry-level MacBook Air. If that comes to pass, the announcement will definitely be at a time and place of Apple's choosing.",

    "description": "The OLED evo W6 from LG makes a glorious return with an even more minimalist design.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly 10 years since LG first introduced its Wallpaper TV that was so thin that the mounting process felt like applying wallpaper. After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the \"world's thinnest\" OLED that's truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.\n\nInstead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It's similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its Frame TV lineup. While you won't have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor's hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That's more than three times the thickness, but it's still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.\n\nThe latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG's third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There's even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.\n\nThe updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that's crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA's G-Sync, AMD's FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you're not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its Gallery+ feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.\n\nLG didn't reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn't offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn't be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last Wallpaper TV, which cost up to $20,000.",

    "title": "My Five Favorite Things I Saw at CES Unveiled 2026",
    "description": "I saw robotic dogs, 3D screen protectors for your iPhone, and rapid food allergen testers.",
    "fullText": "While CES doesn't technically kick off until Tuesday, the conference gets a bit of a soft launch with CES Unveiled. This event hosts a ton of companies, all proudly showing off their latest products and concepts in one giant room. While there's plenty to write home about, five products in particular this year caught my eye:\n\nTombot's robotic puppy, \"Jennie,\" isn't supposed to be a pet-replacement. Instead, Jennie is specifically designed to help people with Alzheimer's. The bot is a healthcare device, and is made to not only comfort owners, but to monitor \"sundowning,\" or the confusion that some living with Alzheimer experience in late afternoon and at night.\n\nI can't speak to the medical claims, but Tombot impressed me. I've seen products like this before, but what struck me was the realism. That's not to say Tombot's robot tricks you into thinking there's a real puppy on the table. But the company has designed the bot with enough motors and sensors to make it realistic enough. When you look at Jennie, she looks at you; when you move, her face reacts in kind, powered by cleverly-placed motors. There are capacitive touch sensors to react to touch, light sensors to adjust to the lighting of the room, gyros for orientation, and microphones to responds to sounds.\n\nJennie is designed to be interactive: You can call its name—either Jennie, or a name you set in the app—and it responds to the call, potentially with a bark. Tombot says that it hired a number of ten-week-old lab puppies to record the voices for its bot. In all, Jennie will have about 1,500 unique behaviors when Tombot launches her this year.\n\nTombot told me that Jennie is designed to last all day on a single charge. When you aren't home, Jennie can drop into a sort of low power mode, that should last over a week. When you come back, Jennie should immediately welcome you home. Tombot says its bot will cost $1,500 at launch, but will offer financing options.\n\nWhat if you could turn your iPhone into a 3DS? That's what I took away from the premise of CubicSpace's CubicScreen, anyway. The company makes a screen protector for your iPhone embedded with an optical filter that allows you to view spatial photos and videos in 3D, without the need for glasses or a separate device. It's your 2D iPhone, in 3D.\n\nI was a bit skeptical walking past the booth, but, in practice, the tech really works. CubicSpace had some 3D photos and videos already stored in the CubicScreen app on their demo iPhones, and, when looking at the screen, they really did appear three dimensional. This isn't \"pop out of your screen\" 3D, mind you; rather, it's an depth effect. If you've ever used the 3D feature on a 3DS, this is that experience: You'll be able to see the depth behind subjects in your photos and videos, which adds to the immersion of the image.\n\nPart of the effect uses eye tracking to adjust the effect as you view the image. To that point, the app can support zooming while retaining the 3D effect. It's a little trippy: You zoom in on an picture, and, most of the time, it snaps into 3D instantly. Sometimes, the effect falls out, and you can tell you're looking at a distorted image. But most of my experience, the effect held.\n\nThis 3D effect wasn't just a trick of editing, either: CubicSpace took a photo of Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor, Michelle Ehrhardt at the booth, which instantly took on the 3D effect. The screen overlay and the software appears to work fast.\n\nCubicScreen will cost $79 when it launches. There is currently an order page, but they aren't accepting payment yet.\n\nIf you have a food allergy, you know the stress that comes when you're not in control of your meals. There's a risk to eating food you didn't make yourself, and for some of us, that risk isn't an option.\n\nThat's why I found Allergen Alert's \"the mini lab\" so intriguing. The idea is, when you want to know whether your food contains a certain allergen, you can scoop a sample of it into the provided container, place that container into the mini lab, and within two minutes, you'll have a positive or negative result. The device itself isn't large—about the size of a portable speaker—which makes it feasible to take out to restaurants and other people's houses.\n\nRight now, the company says the mini lab can detect milk and gluten, up to five parts per million, but the goal is to detect other major allergens, like egg, fish, soy, sesame, peanuts shellfish, tree nuts. Of course, I have no way to actually test whether it can detect milk and gluten at this time, so I can't necessarily endorse the product. In fact, it isn't currently available: Allergen Alert tells me the product is supposed to launch in September for $200.\n\nHowever, if Allergen Alert is correct in its claims, this product could be a game changer. A two minute check on that supposedly allergen-free meal could literally save someone's life, and offer peace of mind to those who could have serious adverse effects from ingesting an allergen.\n\nBirdfy brings a new smart bird feeder concept to CES just about every year. And while the company had its previous models on display at Unveiled this year, its newest prototype grabbed my attention.\n\nThe Hum Bloom is not meant for all of the birds that visit your house or garden. Instead, this product is specifically designed for hummingbirds. The Hum Bloom has an 4K camera that can shoot up to 120fps slow-motion video. While that'd make for some dramatic landings for any bird, it's particularly ideal for capturing hummingbirds that flap their wings hundreds or thousands of times per minute.\n\nBirdfy says the Hum Bloom's AI can identify more than 150 hummingbird species, so you'll know which type of bird you're watching in slo-mo on your phone. Birdfy claims the feeder is \"leak-proof,\" and also comes with ant moat to keep out bugs. Personally, I'm stuck on Birdfy designing a slo-mo camera system just for hummingbirds. I look forward to seeing that footage from reviewers in the future.\n\nThis is one of those products my picture will simply not do justice. In order to understand why I was so taken by this speaker, you'd need to hear it for yourself.\n\nAdmittedly, I wasn't expecting much when I agreed to demo the speaker. Again, at first glance, the Opsodis just looks like your typical wireless speaker. That changed once the rep played a video on a connected iPad: Suddenly, I was hearing sounds next to my ears; behind my ears; around my ears. I wasn't really paying attention to what was happening on screen, because I was too distracted wondering how I was hearing everything I was hearing from a relatively tiny speaker directly in front of me.\n\nAs it turns out, this wouldn't work if I had the speaker placed just about anywhere. The demo used Opsodis' \"narrow mode,\" one of three audio modes the speaker is capable of. Narrow mode is the stronger spatial audio experience, but requires the speaker to be placed close and directly in front of the user: specifically, 60 centimeters away, or 23.62 inches. \"Wide mode,\" which I didn't try, offers a \"softer\" spatial audio experience, while the third mode simulates standard stereo audio.\n\nWhile this won't necessarily offer a movie theater-like experience just by placing it in front of your TV, this was some of the most fun I had at CES Unveiled tonight.",
