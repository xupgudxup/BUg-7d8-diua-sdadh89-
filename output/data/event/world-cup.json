    "description": "CEO JT Batson says the tournament is forcing brands to see the value of the sport’s fans.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup — jointly hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico— represents a coming of age for the sport that most of the world calls football in the country that calls it soccer. JT Batson, CEO of US Soccer, hopes the kickoff to the tournament this June will also be a vindication of four years of work to modernize the group behind the US men’s and women’s national teams, and a moment for more brands to understand the spending power of their fans.\n\n“Having the World Cup here has been a bit of a forcing function to crisply articulate your soccer strategy as a brand,” he says. US Soccer counts two dozen commercial partners, from American Airlines and AT&T to Visa and Volkswagen, who Batson says have been drawn by the demographics of the sport’s large US fanbase. “It’s growing, it’s young, it’s diverse, and it’s tech savvy; those are all things you care about as a brand.”\n\nSurveys suggest the sport has the momentum to build that fan base further. A Harris Poll last year found the number of US soccer followers increased 17% between 2020 and 2025. Almost three-quarters of Americans now say they are interested in soccer, of whom 20% describe themselves as “obsessed.”\n\nUS Soccer’s own growth has exceeded that pace: Its revenues are up more than 300% since 2023, as it changed its commercial model to bring sponsorship, media, and marketing rights in-house. Batson has pulled in record philanthropic donations, including $50 million from Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank for a new national training center in Atlanta, and $30 million from Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang for women’s and girls’ programs.\n\nAnother factor has helped the corporate interest, Batson adds: the fact that many large companies are run by executives who grew up watching the sport. “Generations ago, that was not the case.”\n\nBatson, an early employee of Mozilla who had played for Augusta Arsenal in Georgia before becoming a referee, came to his job after a chance encounter with US Soccer’s board chair on an Amtrak train. “I learned it was a nonprofit that didn’t do fundraising, so I went home and made a fundraising strategy,” he recalls. He joined as a volunteer before being made CEO in 2022. Here’s how he describes his game plan for the World Cup and the sport he now oversees.\n\nAndrew Edgecliffe-Johnson: US Soccer’s revenues have increased by more than 300% since 2023. What has it taken to do that?\n\nJT Batson: The biggest thing for us is embracing that we are a soccer nation. We’ve grown a tremendous amount since the 1994 women’s World Cup, and we set out a strategy last year of being “in service to soccer.” We asked ourselves, “If we stepped out of our role and were back to being a fan, what would we hope US Soccer would be doing?” There were three things we needed at the same time to unlock our potential: trust, the right strategy, and the right communication. If you’re missing any one of those three, this doesn’t work.\n\nWhat has driven the growth in corporate partnerships?\n\nFirst, the US soccer market is large, with well over 100 million fans. Second, the US men’s and women’s national teams are among the most popular teams in the country. And third, so many people in positions of responsibility in corporations are soccer people through and through. In a previous generation, maybe they’d have been football people or baseball people or basketball people. This generation deeply understands the sport and cares about it as a growth driver. A number of big brands have told us their No. 1 growth priority is soccer.\n\nWhat’s your strategy for using the World Cup to elevate soccer in the US?\n\nFirst, we’ve got to make sure that our team is in the best position to win. We’ve hired the best possible coaches for our team, and we’ve got a great player pool. We’re also very focused on making sure everyone in America can participate. So we’re making it super accessible to go into a Walmart or a CVS and buy US Soccer gear, and we’re supporting watch parties in hundreds of communities.\n\nWhat we want to hold ourselves accountable to is being in a position where soccer is the most-played sport in every community. We’ve announced initiatives around soccer in schools, aimed at ensuring anyone who wants to play soccer can play. We also focus on making sure kids are having fun. Very often there’s a professionalization of kids’ sports at too young an age. Of course we want to produce players who can win World Cups, but at its core, you want to train hard when you’re having fun.\n\nCritics including New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani are concerned that World Cup tickets will be unaffordable. Is the sport pricing fans out?\n\nAll sports are having to confront the fact there are way more people who want to be in the stands than there are seats. We’re very mindful of that, [so] for all our games, we’ll have a reserved set of tickets that are very affordable for our core fans. We’re looking at how we leverage technology to ensure our diehard fans are closest to the field.\n\nWith 27 national teams, you’re surrounded by coaches. What have you learned about leadership from them?\n\nI’ve asked them about the dynamics of managing a team and they ask me as many questions around managing a business. What we find is that there’s a lot in common. Probing an analogous space leads you to learn and stretch.\n\nWhat leads to success in soccer is very similar to what leads to success in business. A key thing is to remember that every market is unique. If you enter a new market and you do not become a student of that market and learn everything about it, the rules, it’s going to eat you up and spit you out. You can have the greatest [product], but if you can’t solve for the consumers in that market, you can waste a whole lot of time and money.\n\nWill soccer in the US one day have the global status that the Premier League, the Bundesliga, or Serie A do now?\n\nOur market is very big. It is growing, we now have infrastructure, and we have talent. You’ve also got a generation of Americans who’ve grown up when they’ve only known Major League Soccer to exist and it’s a core part of their media diet. Talent is a leading indicator of success in an organization, and the talent that’s choosing to go to MLS is getting better and better. Then you apply the great commercialization of sport in the US, and you’re onto something. The [team] owners in the US are the best in the world. Think about their resources and their sports business acumen. The Bundesliga or Serie A don’t have that. The ownership depth and breadth is a huge strategic advantage.\n\nUS Soccer held a summit in Washington, DC, in December that drew more than 400 partners and donors, highlighting the organization’s “financial glow-up” under Batson, Sports Business Journal reported.",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior has a unique opportunity to put an old grudge to bed as Chelsea gear up for their Champions League Round of 16 clash against Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nIt’s a familiar matchup for Chelsea, who will face Paris Saint-Germain over two legs in the Champions League, just like they did in the FIFA Club World Cup final.\n\nThe fixtures are expected to fall on the 11th and 17th of March, with Stamford Bridge set to host the second leg on the 17th.\n\nChelsea fans will recall fondly their summer FIFA Club World Cup victory over PSG, when Enzo Maresca’s team cruised to a 3-0 win.\n\nBut recent Champions League meetings between these sides haven’t gone in Chelsea’s favour. The last encounter ended in defeat for the Blues at Stamford Bridge, while the two group stage matches before that both finished level.\n\nChelsea fans will remember well the 2014/15 Champions League campaign under Jose Mourinho, which ended in frustration against Paris Saint-Germain. After a 1-1 draw at the Parc des Princes, Chelsea looked to be in control when Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off just over half an hour into the second leg.\n\nInstead of pushing forward, though, Mourinho’s side dropped deep and allowed PSG to take control. Despite goals from Gary Cahill and an Eden Hazard penalty, Chelsea were twice pulled back by headers from corners – first by former Blue David Luiz and then a late one from Thiago Silva.\n\nThe tie ended 3-3 on aggregate with PSG progressing on away goals. After the match, Ibrahimovic famously called Chelsea’s players ‘eleven babies,’ while Mourinho admitted his team struggled to handle the mental side of the game.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s next Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain is more than just another fixture—it’s an opportunity to address the lingering memories of 2015 that still linger for many Chelsea supporters.\n\nRosenior, though, has already shown this season that he can get results against Luis Enrique’s PSG, having steered Strasbourg to a 3-3 draw earlier in the campaign. Instead of mirroring Mourinho’s cautious style from years past, Rosenior brings a more aggressive approach. It’s a shift that could help this young Chelsea side avoid falling into the same psychological traps that cost them in previous meetings.\n\nThe key will be to maintain the high-energy play that helped Chelsea dismantle PSG 3-0 in last summer’s Club World Cup final, rather than slip back into defensive habits.\n\nWhile Rosenior brings fresh ideas, some recent performances have looked worryingly familiar. Games like Burnley and Leeds United saw Chelsea let leads slip away—reminiscent of how Mourinho’s teams sometimes retreated under pressure instead of pushing forward.\n\nHow Richard Hughes is assessing Arne Slot’s situation as Liverpool head coach\n\nWho is Roland Sallai? The Galatasaray defender Liverpool have already made contact to sign\n\nMichael Carrick speaks out on Harry Maguire’s future and contract situation at Man Utd",

    "fullText": "\"It's a question for him, but would we love to have him? Yes.\"\n\nHe may have only had a handful of training sessions with Northern Ireland, but interim boss Kris Lindsay has already left a big impression on his players according to long-serving midfielder Nadene Caldwell.\n\nLindsay will lead NI in their opening two 2027 World Cup qualifiers away to Switzerland on Tuesday, 3 March and at home to Turkey on Saturday, 7 March.\n\nWhat happens beyond that for Lindsay, who also manages the Northern Ireland men's under-16 team, remains to be seen, but early indications from Caldwell suggest the players are fully behind Tanya Oxtoby's short-term replacement.\n\n\"Kris has come in for these two games and has been a breath of fresh air,\" she told BBC Sport NI's Nicola McCarthy.\n\n\"He's had home-based sessions for the players and you can see his enthusiasm already and hopefully that will come across on the pitch. He wants every individual player to be 1% better and that's all we can ask.\n\n\"Kris has been very open, honest and transparent with the players, he's fully in. He's laid out what he wants and the players what they want, so we're on the same page.\n\n\"I'm sure he would like to go on and take the job, it's something he's involved in and he'll like to stay involved in.\"\n\n2027 Fifa Women's World Cup qualifiers\n\nGlentoran's Caldwell appreciates that \"from the outside it seems transitional\" with Northern Ireland still yet to find a permanent successor to Oxtoby, who left to join Newcastle in November.\n\nThe squad is also oscillating between an experienced core and an influx of younger players, but Caldwell insists they are merely focused on the task at hand and not the public perception of the squad.\n\n\"It is going to happen in football [transitions], but we're professional players and we'll take a professional approach on the pitch when we have a job to do,\" she explained.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who has won 91 caps for her country, believes the permanent appointment of Lindsay would only serve to aid NI's ability to navigate a transitional period given his previous role of working with young players.\n\n\"He's a great person, manger and coach and these three things can only bring us success.\n\n\"With the transition of players coming though, he would be an amazing asset.\n\n\"He has a wealth of experience and he knows that it's like to be from Northern Ireland and that would get the green and white army on side to support.\"\n\nRafferty returns for NI's World Cup qualifiers\n\nWhat awaits interim boss Lindsay in NI job?\n\n'Whirlwind' - Lindsay excited to manage NI",

    "fullText": "Carrie Jones says Wales' players are grateful to have Jess Fishlock in the dressing room – if not on the pitch – as they head into a new Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWales start their bid to reach the 2027 tournament in Brazil when they face the Czech Republic in Uherske Hradiste on Tuesday.\n\nRhian Wilkinson's team will have to cope without Wales' most-capped footballer and all-time leading goalscorer after Fishlock retired from international football last October.\n\nBut Fishlock is part of Wales' preparations as a technical assistant to head coach Wilkinson – and midfielder Jones believes she has a \"hugely important\" role to play.\n\n\"Jess staying on as a coach gives huge experience for us as a team - the player that she is and the experiences that she holds,\" Jones said.\n\nFishlock to join Wales staff for opening qualifier\n\n'Really ugly' abuse affects players - Wales' Cain\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying\n\n\"Even as a player, she was always coaching and I was always trying to learn off her and she's even more that way as a coach - always coaching, always trying to give those extra details.\n\n\"I think it says a lot about her that she's wanting to stay involved and I think we're all really grateful as a team that she is involved.\"\n\nFishlock has been working with her now former team-mates this week and will travel for what is a testing opening fixture in Group B1.\n\nThe Czech Republic have never qualified for a women's major tournament, but are ranked 31st in the world by Fifa, one place higher than Wales.\n\nFishlock will leave the Wales squad after Tuesday's game in order to rejoin Seattle Reign's preparations for the new National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season.\n\nWilkinson's players, meanwhile, will return home for a second qualifier against Montenegro in Llanelli on Saturday, 7 March.\n\nWatch live on BBC Two Wales and iPlayer from 17:15 GMT; radio commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru; text commentary and match highlights on BBC Sport website and app.\n\nHaving reached Euro 2025, the first major women's tournament in the nation's history, Wales' next target is to reach a first World Cup.\n\nHowever, the path to qualification is not simple, with no automatic route available to Wales because they are not in League A.\n\nAssuming they do not finish bottom of a group which also features Albania, Wales will face play-offs late in 2026.\n\nShould Wales finish top of the group, their first-round play-off would be against a side who finish second or third in a League B pool.\n\nBut if Wilkinson's team finish second or third, they would face a side who finish in fourth place in League A or a Group B winner.\n\nThe second round of the play-offs is seeded and should Wales get that far, they would be likely to face League A opposition.\n\nEven a win at that stage may not mean Wales' job is done, because the lowest-ranked of the eight European sides who get through the play-offs will go into inter-confederation play-offs in February 2027. Wales could conceivably be that side.\n\nFor the moment, Jones says, Wales' focus is on making a good start in the group – and they begin with confidence having beaten Switzerland in their most recent international to end a 12-game winless run.\n\n\"As a footballer in general to not win for such a long time, I think you take responsibility for that and it can hurt,\" said Jones, who plays her club football for Swedish side IFK Norrkoping.\n\n\"We always had faith and we knew last year was a challenging year with the opposition we faced. But I think the win against Switzerland definitely gave us some confidence going into this campaign.\"",

This win was not perfect but it was undoubtedly their best of the tournament so far.\n\nJacks is in the middle of the best form of his career – a run that gives England serious threat.\n\nHis runs, in addition to his 2-23, were match-winning and won him the player-of-the-match award for the fourth time in this competition.\n\nBut Jacks may not have been able to pull off the heist without 21-year-old Ahmed, whose six from the second ball he faced brought the chase to life in his first World Cup match.\n\nHis second, hit off the vastly experienced Santner, effectively sealed the deal.\n\nAhmed, who also took a wicket with his first ball, was picked for the conditions here. Can England really leave him out next week?\n\nThe big issue that remains is the form of Jos Buttler. He was out for a two-ball duck – his fifth single-figure score in a row.\n\nPhil Salt also nicked off in the first over while Brook made 21, Jacob Bethell 21, Tom Banton 33 and Sam Curran 24 – all contributions but not match-defining scores.\n\nJacks and Ahmed ensured that will not be the focus, however. England may face India in Mumbai next week. What an occasion that would be.\n\nThough Mumbai has offered decent turn, England are unlikely to face such spin-friendly conditions in the remainder of the tournament.\n\nStill, their versatility was impressive. There was no pace bowled after Jofra Archer bowled three overs and Curran one in the powerplay.\n\nArcher, who began by beating the bat four times in a maiden, was unlucky not to take a wicket early, which allowed Tim Seifert and Finn Allen to build a partnership of 64.\n\nRashid had Seifert stumped before Brook twirled through his tweakers - Ahmed having Rachin Ravindra caught mid-wicket in the 12th over.\n\nJacks bowled accurately but also took the crucial wickets of Allen, caught at deep mid-wicket for 29, and the dangerous Phillips for 39.\n\nPhillips was bowled by one that turned sharply to hit the all-rounder's stumps and afterwards Ahmed took the final over for the first time in his international career.\n\nThis campaign stuttered through matches against Nepal, West Indies, Scotland and Italy but now there is a feeling of real belief emanating from this squad.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

He has attended a senior national team camp but, without U.S. or Barcelona first-team appearances, is not in the World Cup mix.\n\nThe two legs will take place March 10-11 and 17-18.\n\nOlympique Lyonnais, the Europa League’s top seed after the initial stage, received a playoff bye and will face French rival Lille or Spain’s Celta Vigo on March 12 and 19.\n\nCrystal Palace, which knocked out Zrinjski Mostar on Thursday on a 3-1 aggregate, will clash with Mainz (Germany) or Larnaca (Cyprus) on March 12 and 19. Richards played every minute of the two legs against the Bosnian opponent.\n\nAside from McKennie, U.S. regulars with clubs that failed to advance in either of the previous two Champions League stages included Tim Weah (Olympique Marseille), Folarin Balogun (Monaco) and Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven).\n\nOn Thursday, despite a 1-0 victory at Stuttgart, Auston Trusty and Celtic were ousted from the Europa League on a 4-2 aggregate.\n\nThe elimination of Juventus and Monaco this week ended terrific campaigns by McKennie and Balogun, respectively.\n\nMcKennie started all 10 matches, scoring four goals, including a three-game streak between November and January. On Wednesday, his 82nd-minute header while his team was down to 10 men capped a three-goal aggregate comeback that forced extra time before Türkiye’s Galatasaray prevailed.\n\nWESTON MCKENNIE DOES IT AGAIN! 🇺🇸\n\nJuventus overturn a three-goal deficit to complete the comeback in Turin 🤯 pic.twitter.com/PnVKw0C1FZ\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 25, 2026\n\nBalogun, the U.S. team’s first-choice striker, also had a three-game scoring streak this winter, then recorded two goals against Paris Saint-Germain last week in the first leg of their two-game playoff. PSG advanced Wednesday on a 5-4 aggregate.\n\nAtlético Madrid reached the Round of 16 by routing Club Brugge 4-1 on Tuesday for a 7-4 advantage. Cardoso snapped a 1-1 draw early in the second half with his first goal in all competitions for the Spanish club.\n\nJohnny Cardoso's first goal for Atlético Madrid is a BEAUTY 🇺🇸🔥 pic.twitter.com/TDczQgmeky\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 24, 2026\n\nShould Atlético go the distance, Cardoso would return to a continental final; last year, he started for Real Betis in the Conference League championship loss to Chelsea.\n\nTillman missed Leverkusen’s 0-0 draw with Olympiacos on Tuesday with an ankle injury — his team advanced on the strength of a 2-0 away win last week — while Musah remained a bench warmer for Atalanta, which routed Borussia Dortmund 4-1 to overturn a 2-0 loss in the opener. In his first season with the Italian team, Musah has started two Champions League matches and subbed into four others.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Diving World Cup scheduled in Mexico next week was canceled due to safety concerns on Thursday.\n\nThe meet was to take place from March 5-8 in Zapopan, near Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, where there has been a surge in violence since Sunday following the capture and death of the leader of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), Nemesio Oseguera.\n\n“A thorough risk assessment of the situation included consideration of travel restrictions and advice given by a number of international governments regarding travel to Mexico at the current time,” World Aquatics said in a statement. “The safety and participation of all athletes remain a fundamental priority for World Aquatics.”\n\nMexican sports officials were yet to comment on the cancellation.\n\nCartel members have burned cars and blocked roads in nearly a dozen Mexican states and authorities report that at least 70 people have died. The CJNG is considered the most powerful and violent cartel in Mexico and it is centered in Jalisco state.\n\nEven though Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has said things are getting back to normal, in Guadalajara there was still fear among its citizens.\n\nFour high-level soccer matches were postponed last Sunday, including one in the central city of Queretaro, where Mexico defeated Iceland 4-0 on Wednesday in a friendly. Top-tier team Atlas held workouts through Zoom.\n\nOn Wednesday, four softballers from the Guadalajara-based Jalisco Charros of the Women's Professional League asked to be released from the team for “personal reasons.” They were American Nicola Simpson, Canadians Natalie Wildman and Janet Lung and Dutch player Eva Voortman.\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports",

    "fullText": "Saracens have rejected \"disrespectful\" reports that they have offered Ireland head coach Andy Farrell a coaching role for after the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe club said \"no offer has been made\" after the Irish Independent reported that Farrell has been approached with a deal worth more than £1m per year to return to Sarries following next year's tournament in Australia.\n\nBrendan Venter will return to the director of rugby role at the Premiership club when long-serving Mark McCall steps down at the end of the season.\n\n\"Andy has not discussed his future with anyone on the board or ownership group of Saracens and we can categorically state, despite numerous reports to the contrary in the press, that no offer has been made to Andy,\" the club statement read.\n\n\"The misguided reporting is disrespectful to Brendan Venter who will be assuming the DOR [director of rugby] responsibilities from Mark McCall at the end of the 25-26 season. It is also disrespectful to Andy and the IRFU.\"\n\nFarrell was a Saracens player between 2005 and 2009, also winning eight England caps, having switched to union after a long and successful career in rugby league with Wigan, during which he also captained Great Britain. After retiring as a player, he took his first steps into coaching with Saracens.\n\nThe 50-year-old - whose son Owen rejoined the Premiership outfit last summer after a season in France with Racing 92 - took over as Ireland head coach in 2019 from Joe Schmidt, stepping up from an assistant role he took up in 2016.\n\nIn 2023, he led Ireland to a Six Nations Grand Slam and the championship title the following year.\n\nHe then turned his attention to the British and Irish Lions, guiding them to a 2-1 series victory over Australia last year, before returning to the Ireland role.\n\n\"Given Andy's close relationship with Saracens, the club looks forward to welcoming him to more home fixtures once the Six Nations Championship has concluded,\" the Saracens statement concluded.",

South Africa have also joined them.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams still in contention need to progress to the next stage.\n\nA total of eight teams progressed to the Super 8 stage, with each being placed in to two groups - Group 1 and Group 2.\n\nGroup 1: West Indies, South Africa, India Zimbabwe\n\nGroup 2: England, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka\n\nEach team plays three matches in the Super 8 phase, facing each of the other teams in their respective group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams in each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8 group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nSouth Africa are through after two impressive victories out of two.\n\nIndia and West Indies are effectively playing for a spot in the semi-finals when they meet on 1 March.\n\nZimbabwe were eliminated after losing against India on 26 February.\n\nEngland are through to the semi-finals after wins over Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\nNew Zealand will progress if they beat England or if Pakistan fail to beat Sri Lanka.\n\nIf the Black Caps lose to England, Pakistan could qualify by beating Sri Lanka but it would come down to net run-rate (NRR).\n\nSri Lanka are eliminated following their defeat by New Zealand on 25 February.\n\nNet run-rate is the common method for differentiating teams level on points in a limited-overs cricket tournament.\n\nIt is a formula that measures a team's average margin of victory, or defeat - a side with several big wins will have a positive net run-rate, while those who have suffered sizeable losses will have a negative one.\n\nTo understand net run-rate, you have to first get your head around run-rate.\n\nThat's the average number of runs scored per over by a team in the innings of one match - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs for Team A equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is then calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nSo if Team B scored 130 off 20 overs, their run-rate would be 6.5 runs per over.\n\nTherefore Team A would emerge from the encounter with a positive net-run rate of 0.500 (7 - 6.5), while Team B would take away one of -0.500 (6.5 - 7).\n\nOnce a side has played more than one match in a competition, these figures are calculated cumulatively.\n\nLet's say Team A scored 160 runs from 20 overs in their next match, then they would have a tournament total of 300 runs, divided by 40 overs - a run-rate of 7.5.\n\nIf their second opponents scored 180 runs from 20 overs, we first add that to Team B's score, making 310 divided by 40 overs - that makes 7.75.\n\nTake 7.75 from 7.5 and Team A end up with a run-rate of -0.25.\n\nAre we done with the calculations now? Well, not quite...\n\nIf a team loses and is bowled out early, then we wouldn't want to divide their score by the overs they played, as that would potentially deliver them a higher run-rate than their opponent.\n\nTherefore if a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing their runs by the maximum overs they could have batted.\n\nWhat is net run-rate in cricket?\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "India will now face West Indies in a virtual quarter-final on Sunday",
    "fullText": "A rampant India piled up a record total and handed Zimbabwe a 72-run shellacking in a Super Eight contest on Thursday to revive their T20 World Cup title defence.\n\nThe hosts blasted 256-4, the tournament's highest score this year, after Abhishek Sharma and Hardik Pandya smoked blistering half-centuries.\n\nIt rained 17 sixes and as many fours at Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium as India's top order feasted on a modest Zimbabwean attack made even blunter by their sloppy catching.\n\nLeft with a mountain to climb, Zimbabwe managed 184-6. Brian Bennett hit an unbeaten 97 but it was not enough to prevent their elimination from the tournament.\n\nIndia and West Indies will clash in a virtual quarter-final in Kolkata on Sunday, with South Africa beating West Indies earlier in the day to leave them on the brink of the last four.\n\n\"The contribution from all the batters...it was heartening to see,\" India captain Suryakumar Yadav said.\n\n\"We could have been a little bit more clinical with the ball but it's fine. At the end of the day, a win is a win.\"\n\nIndia's title defence was on shaky ground since their Super 8 defeat to South Africa, who lead Group 1 after beating West Indies earlier on Thursday.\n\nIndia began brightly as Sanju Samson (24) pressed his case on return and Abhishek sought a return to form.\n\nSamson could not kick on, but Abhishek, who began the tournament with three ducks in a row, tore into Zimbabwe as India cruised to 80-1 after the six-over powerplay.\n\nZimbabwe's woes deepened when Tashinga Musekiwa shelled Ishan Kishan, the tournament's most prolific India batter, on 26.\n\nKishan (38) could not cash in, falling to Sikander Raza's spin, but Abhishek (55) sped to a 26-ball fifty before Tinotenda Maposa's change of pace undid him.\n\nSuryakumar, dropped on eight, departed after milking 33 off 13 balls but there was no respite for Zimbabwe.\n\nPandya (50) and Tilak Varma (44) stitched an unbroken 84 off 31 deliveries to effectively bat Zimbabwe out of the contest.\n\nZimbabwe escaped their powerplay unscathed after Tadiwanashe Marumani (20) was dropped in the deep but the opener fell to Axar Patel in the spinner's first over.\n\nBennett raced to a 34-ball fifty but Arshdeep Singh (3-24) removed Raza (31) and Ryan Burl in the same over to put India on course for victory.\n\n\"We could have executed our defensive plans better as well and we gave too many runs away,\" Zimbabwe captain Raza said.\n\n\"Once the train goes, it is hard to get back. We could have restricted them to 210 or 220.\"",

Ryan Rickelton chipped in with a quickfire 45 not out off 28 at number three.\n\nMarkram sealed South Africa's fifth win of the tournament in Ahmedabad with his 11th boundary.\n\nThe victory puts the Proteas on the verge of the semi-finals without making them mathematically sure. They will go through if India beat Zimbabwe in Thursday's other game. West Indies play India in their final match of the group knowing a defeat will likely eliminate them.\n\nSouth Africa, finalists in 2024, should have been chasing a significantly lower total after taking four wickets in the powerplay and later reducing West Indies to 83-7.\n\nHowever, the two-time champions fought back through Romario Shepherd and Jason Holder, who put on 89 (57) for the eighth wicket to drag West Indies beyond 170.\n\nAfter smacking spinner Keshav Maharaj's opening over for 17, West Indies, who piled on 254-6 against Zimbabwe in their Super 8 opener on Monday, lost four wickets in 11 balls to slump from 29-0 to 43-4 inside four overs, with Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi collecting two wickets apiece.\n\nSherfane Rutherford, who couldn't capitalise on being dropped on three, Rovman Powell, and Matthew Forde joined the procession back to the dressing room before Shepherd and Holder came together in the 11th over.\n\nAfter rebuilding steadily, the pair burst into life from the 15-over mark, Shepherd accelerating from 21 (17) to finish unbeaten on 52 (37) and Holder reaching 49 (31) before being run-out off the penultimate ball of the innings.\n\nThey added 58 runs off the final five overs, including Holder taking the 18th, bowled by Marco Jansen, for 23.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "England will consider bringing in leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed for the T20 World Cup Super 8s match against New Zealand in Colombo.\n\nEngland, who are already through to the semi-finals, will wait for another look at the pitch on Friday before naming their XI.\n\nThe match will be played on the same surface as New Zealand beat Sri Lanka on Wednesday, when 10 of the 15 wickets fell to spin, and England are keen to cover all options.\n\nBowling coach Tim Southee said he expects a \"pretty scrappy\" wicket.\n\n\"We've seen spin play such a big part here,\" Southee said.\n\n\"It's such a big ground. That doesn't mean seamers can't still have an impact - like [New Zealand seamer] Matt Henry last night.\"\n\nAhmed, 21, has been a regular around England squads but has not played a T20 since the tour of Ireland last September, nor has he featured at a World Cup.\n\nHe played in the three one-day internationals against Sri Lanka last month, also held on this ground, and twice filled in as an opener.\n\nThe leg-spinner would likely replace a pace bowler if he is selected - possibly Jamie Overton.\n\nNew Zealand picked only two pace bowlers in their win over Sri Lanka, in which 30 of the 40 overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nEngland would still have Jofra Archer and Sam Curran as pace bowlers, plus Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson and Will Jacks.\n\nJacob Bethell is yet to bowl in the tournament because of a cut on his finger. His availability to bowl would also impact England's thinking.\n\nWhat should England do about Jos Buttler?\n\n'The day Brook showed he is an England leader'\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nSouthee backed out-of-form opener Jos Buttler, who is on a run of four single-figure scores in succession.\n\n\"Jos has played enough cricket to know he would have been through various tough times throughout his career and I'm sure he'll bounce back at any stage,\" Southee said.\n\nThe Black Caps could be pipped to a semi-final place by Pakistan if they lose but England confirmed their progression with victory over Pakistan on Tuesday.\n\nThe run to the last four comes after the dismal Ashes defeat, which brought the future of coach Brendon McCullum into question.\n\nSouthee said McCullum, who he played alongside 170 times for New Zealand, has not changed amid the scrutiny.\n\n\"One thing with Brendon is he is the most consistent guy I have ever come across,\" Southee told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Nothing really changes from him. He believes in what he believes in. And we've seen in this tournament, we've won in different ways.\n\n\"Baz is just Baz. He just wants guys to do well, wants the team to do well and that hasn't changed when he was a player and as a coach as well.\"\n\nSouthee also spoke of his disappointment at not to be able to remain as bowling coach during the Ashes.\n\nHe was with the squad in the build-up and the first Test in Perth but then left to fulfil a playing contract in the ILT20.\n\n\"I had a two-year existing deal with the IlT20 which I had to fill, obviously the dates got moved from January to December which clashed with the Ashes,\" Southee said.\n\n\"It was disappointing. I'd have loved to have been there for all five [Tests].\"",

    "description": "After a long time in the wilderness, Zimbabwe are again contending on the biggest stage at the 2026 T20 World Cup - this is the story of their resurgence.",
    "fullText": "For those of a certain generation, the idea of the Zimbabwe cricket team succeeding on a global stage is entirely plausible.\n\nReaching the second stage of a World Cup, as they have in this T20 tournament, once seemed a possible and even expected achievement.\n\nThe late 1990s saw Test series wins against India and Pakistan.\n\nAt the 1999 World Cup, a side clad in a loud red uniform finished an admirable fifth in the Super Six stage, narrowly missing out on the semi-finals.\n\nWith stars like future England coach Andy Flower, and bowlers Heath Streak and Henry Olonga, they proved a relatively small country could provide some of the world's finest players.\n\nThe future looked bright. But then - wilderness.\n\nThis is how Zimbabwe battled back to impress again on the biggest stage.\n\nAt the 2003 World Cup - hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya - Flower and Olonga wore black armbands in response to the 'death of democracy' under the country's leader Robert Mugabe. Both men subsequently fled the country.\n\nA year later, 14 senior players resigned in protest at political interference and selection quotas. By 2006, massive defeats and off-field struggles led to Zimbabwe voluntarily suspending its own Test status.\n\nFor 15 years, the side languished with only occasional moments to remind dejected supporters of previous successes. A return to Test cricket in 2011 saw a win over Bangladesh, but national governing body Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) accumulated debts reportedly as high as $27m (£20m at current conversion rate).\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2023, former all-rounder Sean Williams reflected on the darker days.\n\n\"There were more office members employed than players,\" he said. \"It was a nightmare.\n\n\"People knew how much money Zimbabwe Cricket was getting paid but nothing was happening. It looked like it was dying at that time - if not dead.\"\n\nThe nadir arguably came in 2019, when the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended ZC and barred them from qualifying for the 2021 T20 World Cup.\n\nZimbabwe's black armband protest remembered\n\n'For 20 years I felt like Zimbabwe's most hated man'\n\nHowever, under the stewardship of chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani, finances were tackled to become almost debt-free, the board operating on a shoestring budget to right a ship that had not so much been listing as sitting at the bottom of Lake Kariba.\n\nHuge sacrifices were made by staff, careful planning required to give a once-proud side the chance of recovery.\n\nFormer captain Tatenda Taibu told BBC Sport hope was never lost.\n\nHe said: \"Even when things seem to be going southward, there is a certain statement that's often said in Zimbabwe: 'I will make a plan'.\n\n\"There have been a lot of ups and downs from the 2000s, but anyone who knows Zimbabweans, you know Zimbabwe will bounce back.\"\n\nAs well as the work behind the scenes, the cricket approach became unusually old-school, with a focus on developing players in the red-ball game.\n\n\"When the new board took over, they made a conscious decision to say, 'Let's go back and play Tests - this is the only way our team's going to improve,'\" ZC managing director Givemore Makoni told the BBC last year.\n\n\"And since we started, we've seen some huge progress in terms of how the team is performing.\"\n\nThe appointment of Justin Sammons as head coach in 2024 was pivotal to a regular shift towards on-field success.\n\nSammons focused on fitness and embraced a culture of ensuring opportunities for young players, like opener Brian Bennett and fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani.\n\nBoth have starred in this T20 World Cup, helping the Chevrons finish top of Group B thanks to stunning wins over former champions Australia and Sri Lanka.\n\n\"The players must get the credit as they take to the field and execute all the various plans formulated,\" said former fast bowler and commentator Pommie Mbangwa.\n\n\"Management and coaching too should be recognised for their consistency, but there is never any doubt with regard to how hard all involved need to work in order to give themselves a chance of doing well.\"\n\nPerhaps the most significant on-field figure has been all-rounder and T20 captain Sikandar Raza.\n\nAfter moving from Pakistan to join his family in Zimbabwe in 2002, Raza put aside the disappointment of an eye condition ruining his hopes of becoming a fighter pilot and sought a career as a cricketer.\n\nThree player-of-the-match performances at the 2022 T20 World Cup, smashing 133 off 43 deliveries as his side hit a T20 international world record 344-4 against Gambia in 2024 and smacking a 54-ball hundred - Zimbabwe's fastest one-day international century - against the Netherlands in 2023 are just a few examples of his exploits.\n\n\"This is probably the first time in a long time where the fans have travelled to support,\" said Raza.\n\n\"That is because of the way we have played cricket over the last year. We have given them hope that this team is onto something and we can achieve something if we all are together.\n\n\"And that's just not the cricketers, or the changing room, or the technical staff. It is our fans. It is our media. It is the citizens of our country.\"\n\nNow approaching his 40th birthday, Raza continues to lead from the front.\n\nWhen sub-par performances meant a qualifying tournament in Kenya was required to reach this T20 World Cup, Raza's message was clear.\n\n\"I sat down with the squad and said either we feel sorry for ourselves and be ashamed or actually understand the reality,\" he said. \"It's because of us we are in this mess and it's only us who can get out of it.\"\n\nAnd he knows how proud those at home will be.\n\n\"Let's just be together and actually enjoy this because it's a huge achievement for the country,\" he added.\n\nFor those that saw the dark days, like Taibu, a moment like reaching the Super 8 stage must be treasured.\n\n\"In World Cups, Zimbabwe will always be an underdog. I'm very proud,\" he said.\n\nMbangwa added: \"It is wonderful to see the team do well on the world stage. It breeds positivity and gives so many people joy.\"\n\nAnd the future is bright, with a core of talented players, strong leadership and the prospect of an ICC event on home soil.\n\nThe men's 50-over World Cup in 2027 will be co-hosted by Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia, with matches played at a new, 10,000-seat stadium near Victoria Falls.\n\nAs to that vision of success in years to come, Mbangwa wants the country to cherish the now.\n\n\"What's important is to enjoy the present and keep doing what they're doing,\" he said.\n\nAfter coming through Group B unbeaten - a win over Oman and a washout against Ireland alongside those remarkables victories against Australia and Sri Lanka - Zimbabwe suffered a crushing 107-run defeat by West Indies in their Super 8 Group 1 opener.\n\nThey next face defending champions and co-hosts India - smarting from defeat by South Africa and in need of victory - in Chennai on Thursday.\n\nBut while the Chevrons are not favourites to progress to the semi-finals, nothing can be ruled out.\n\nAs Taibu says: \"Possibilities? They are always there where Zimbabwe is concerned.\"",

    "description": "What are the options facing England amid Jos Buttler's struggles at the T20 World Cup. Could they really drop their former captain?",
    "fullText": "It feels wrong to be even asking the question.\n\nJos Buttler is one of England's all-time white-ball greats – a two-time World Cup winner.\n\nBut the 35-year-old has looked horribly out of touch over the past few weeks and his two against Pakistan was his fourth single-figure score in a row.\n\nHe has put in extra net sessions and faced local spinners, padded up against England's options as well as coaches with the dog stick, yet nothing has lifted him from his slump as yet.\n\nCould England really make a change for Friday's final Super 8s match against New Zealand or next week's semi-final?\n\nHere are the options facing England and the issues at play…\n\nThis remains the most likely scenario – overwhelmingly so.\n\nCaptain Harry Brook strongly backed his predecessor after Tuesday's win over Pakistan, saying a return to form is \"just a matter of time\".\n\n\"People have got to cut him a little bit of slack,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He's been phenomenal. He's arguably our best player, he's [just] not hitting them out of the middle at the minute.\"\n\nButtler is the fourth highest run-scorer in T20 international history. He scored 83 from 35 balls against South Africa last September.\n\nBut the right-hander has not scored a fifty in any of his 16 international innings this winter and this is now the longest run of single-figure scores in his T20 international career.\n\nThough he has come through lean patches previously, the upturn has not always been immediate.\n\nAs England's 50-over World Cup spiralled in 2023, he did not score a fifty and made scores of nine, 15, eight, 10, one, five and 27 as his side exited the tournament.\n\nThis would be somewhat of a halfway house.\n\nWith Buttler struggling at the top, why not move him down the order where the pressure to score quickly is not as great? He does play the finisher role in 50-over cricket after all.\n\nButtler has batted at five and six 45 times in T20s for England, though not consistently since 2018.\n\nThis change would obviously require someone else to step up to open.\n\nEngland have various options, given both Tom Banton and Will Jacks are openers by trade.\n\nBut Banton was recalled specifically to play a role in the middle order because of his prowess attacking against spin. Jacks has also been England's player of the tournament so far with 159 runs from 90 balls as a finisher.\n\nBrook and Jacob Bethell have both opened in the Indian Premier League but Brook has just scored a stunning century at number three and Bethell is not the quickest starter.\n\nYou could simply swap Brook and Buttler, leaving Buttler to come in at first drop as he was up to the start of last summer for England. He also had a successful IPL at number three last year.\n\nThe way Buttler and Phil Salt complement each other in their opening partnership was viewed England's big strengths before the tournament, however.\n\nNone of these options are entirely straightforward.\n\nThe most drastic option also appears the least likely.\n\nButtler, who signed a new two-year central contract last year, has been a mainstay of England's white-ball teams for more than a decade. Could they really leave him out entirely for a World Cup semi-final?\n\nThat encounter may be at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, where Buttler has made scores of 94 not out, 89 and 116 in the IPL.\n\nBen Duckett is the spare batter in England's squad - another man struggling for form.\n\nDuckett is averaging 18.88 across 12 matches this winter across all formats and was out for a first-ball duck in his most recent innings at the start of the month.\n\nLeg-spinning all-rounder Rehan Ahmed would be a left-field replacement. That would be a massive call.\n\nPerhaps Friday's match against New Zealand, effectively a dead rubber for England given they are already through, is the perfect, pressure-free opportunity for Buttler to help make the hierarchy's decision an easy one.\n\n\"Who is writing Jos Buttler off?,\" said former England spinner Alex Hartley.\n\n\"If you are, get a grip. He is one of those players where it takes one shot crunched through the covers and he will be back.\n\n\"It would be a worry if England were not winning games. I have no doubt when push comes to shove Jos Buttler will be OK.\"\n\n'The day Brook showed he is an England leader'\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

    "fullText": "Morocco are weighing up a sensational move to hire Xavi Hernandez as doubts intensify over the future of head coach Walid Regragui just months before the 2026 World Cup, per The Athletic.\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has publicly denied that Regragui has left his post, but senior figures have sounded out potential replacements.\n\nFormer Barcelona midfielder and head coach Xavi is among the names being discussed.\n\nNo agreement has been reached, and sources close to the Spanish tactician suggest he would prefer to take on a new role after this summer’s tournament rather than immediately.\n\nRegragui made history by guiding Morocco to the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the furthest any African nation has progressed in the competition.\n\nThat remarkable run increased expectations at home, fuelled by significant investment in facilities and infrastructure over the past decade.\n\nHowever, subsequent tournaments have failed to match that high.\n\nMorocco exited at the last-16 stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and then fell agonisingly short in last month’s 2025 final, losing in extra time to Senegal on home soil.\n\nCriticism of Regragui’s pragmatic style has grown louder, with pressure mounting despite his previous achievements.\n\nMorocco have been drawn alongside Brazil, Scotland and Haiti at the expanded 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the FRMF could make a coaching change before the tournament begins.\n\nXavi would be a bold appointment. The 46-year-old impressed during his stint as Barcelona head coach, winning the league and Spanish Super Cup while blooding many young players.\n\nA World Cup winner with Spain in 2010, he enjoyed a glittering career at Barcelona, lifting four Champions League titles and eight La Liga crowns.\n\nHe moved into coaching with Al-Sadd and later returned to manage Barcelona between 2021 and 2024.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8 Group 2, Pallekele\n\nPakistan 164-9 (20 overs): Farhan 63 (45); Dawson 3-24\n\nEngland 166-8 (19.1 overs): Brook 100 (51); Shaheen 4-30\n\nHarry Brook's sensational century under pressure led England into the T20 World Cup semi-finals with a two-wicket victory over Pakistan in Pallekele.\n\nThe England captain promoted himself to number three after Phil Salt was dismissed first ball and made exactly 100 in a chase of 165.\n\nIt was the first time Brook had batted first drop in his T20 international career but he played the situation perfectly, going up and down the gears as wickets fell around him.\n\nJos Buttler failed again - out for three in the third over - while Jacob Bethell fell for eight and Tom Banton two as England slipped to 58-4.\n\nBut Brook hit 10 fours and four sixes - once again delivering on his undeniable talents.\n\nHe was bowled by Shaheen Afridi a ball after reaching his hundred - the first of his T20 international career - in 50 balls but by then only 10 runs were needed from the last three overs.\n\nBrook's team-mates still threatened to throw all of his good work away as the wickets of Will Jacks and Jamie Overton followed, leaving it to Jofra Archer to swing away the winning runs with five balls to spare.\n\nIt means Brook's side return to India for a semi-final on either Wednesday or Thursday next week, with their opponents and the venue still to be confirmed by the remainder of the Super 8 stage.\n\nThey are there without ever really convincing - here they were sloppy in the field when restricting Pakistan to 164-9 - but are the first team to secure their spot in the last four.\n\nPakistan must hope other results go their way and win the final Group 2 game against Sri Lanka at this venue on Saturday.\n\nBrook century blasts England into semi-finals\n\n'Clocked' by a bouncer in Wellington, as culpable as anyone in the dismal Ashes defeat in Australia, pictured drinking in Noosa and found to have lied when apologising in Sydney.\n\nBrook has had quite the winter.\n\nThis, though, was everything good about England's white-ball captain. He batted at his destructive best.\n\nSurprise greeted the sight of Brook walking down the steps rather than Bethell after Salt nicked off to Shaheen but the thinking was smart.\n\nIt kept the right-hander away from Pakistan's five spinners on a turning pitch at the start of his innings and allowed him to take advantage of the powerplay fielding restrictions.\n\nBrook faced three dots in his first five balls but then took left-armer Salman Mirza for a four and six in the second over.\n\nHe muscled a brutal straight six over long-on off while hitting spinner Mohammad Nawaz for 17 in the sixth, before nudging singles after Banton nicked off to Usman Tariq. The mystery spinner was Pakistan's major threat.\n\nAt halfway, Brook kicked on again, crashing leg-spinner Shadab Khan for a perfect straight six. He scored all around the ground but those straight hits and his drives through the covers were particularly eye-catching.\n\nHe reached three figures with two more hits over mid-off - one for six and another a one-bounce four.\n\nIt made him the third man to score centuries in all three formats for England, after Jos Buttler and Dawid Malan, but more importantly it keeps them on course for a third T20 title.\n\nThe win means England qualify before their final Super 8 game against New Zealand on Friday. They can use that match to try and fine tune.\n\nButtler's form remains a major worry. One of England's all-time greats, who has scored 15 runs in his last five innings and got a bottom edge on a cut here, is struggling.\n\nBefore that, England's fielding, which had remained strong through the tight wins against Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage and Sri Lanka on Sunday, faltered.\n\nBethell let two regulation stops through his hands on the boundary and Brook dropped Shadab on four before he made an important 23. There was also the careless moment of a no-ball for one too many fielders outside the 30-yard circle.\n\nSahibzada Farhan was Pakistan's highest scorer with 65 but he and Babar Azam batted too slowly in a partnership of 46 in 44 balls.\n\nLiam Dawson and Jamie Overton did well to restrict Pakistan in the second half of the innings. Left-arm spinner Dawson took three wickets and a fine high catch while Overton bowled Babar and had Farhan lbw, also taking an excellent diving catch of his own.\n\nThey ensured Pakistan did not kick on from their platform and, along with Brook, were the other major plusses for England.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Italian cricket is in crisis days after the country's T20 World Cup debut, as it emerged that a senior national governing body official has been investigated over a sexual assault allegation.\n\nFederazione Cricket Italiana (FCRI) women's cricket co-ordinator Prabath Ekneligoda, 57, was the subject of a criminal investigation relating to a claim he inappropriately touched a member of the Azzurri women's national team.\n\nMultiple members of the Italy board are said to have resigned over this case and other governance issues, BBC Sport has been told.\n\nThe sexual assault allegation was made to police in Rome in March last year by a player who has represented the national team.\n\nThe player, whose identity is protected for legal reasons, alleged that the sexual assault occurred during a massage on a knee injury at a training session, and she had been scared to report the incident because she feared it would cost her a spot in the team.\n\nAn investigation was concluded by a Rome prosecutor in November 2025 and Ekneligoda was interviewed by police the following month.\n\nA decision is now set to be made on whether there is sufficient evidence to bring it to trial. Ekneligoda's lawyer said his client denies the allegation, that there are ulterior motives to the allegation, and that a witness supports his version of events.\n\nFCRI said in a statement to BBC Sport it \"noted proceedings are currently under way before the federal prosecutor's office\" and will \"co-operate with the relevant authorities\".\n\n\"The Italian Cricket Federation reiterates that its conduct is guided by principles of fairness, transparency and the protection of its registered members, as well as by the ethical and civic standards that underpin the sporting system,\" added the statement.\n\n\"The federation therefore defers to the competent judicial authorities for any determinations arising from the matter.\"\n\nEkneligoda, who is originally from Sri Lanka, was suspended from his role with the FCRI in November but has remained a visible presence on the Italian cricket scene.\n\nHe is the partner of FCRI president Maria Lorena Haz Paz and accompanied her to India for the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nBBC Sport has seen evidence that Ekneligoda attended Italy's matches wearing official accreditation and was permitted to sit with the rest of the FCRI party.\n\nEkneligoda was also seen at various events laid on for Italy's cricket delegation, including a reception at the Italian consulate in Kolkata for officials, players and coaching staff.\n\nThe FCRI, its president Haz Paz, and safeguarding officers, had full knowledge of the seriousness of the claim made against Ekneligoda before the World Cup.\n\nLast weekend, Il Messaggero, external and Corriere della Sera, external reported the allegation in the Italian media for the first time.\n\nAs of Monday, Ekneligoda was still listed as the women's cricket coordinator on the FCRI website.\n\nSources have told BBC Sport that some members of the FCRI's board have resigned over the matter, and other governance issues, which has placed Haz Paz's position under greater scrutiny.\n\nSenior officials in Italian cricket fear potential reputational damage, and the possibility of legal cases, will hamper opportunities to capitalise on their debut T20 World Cup appearance and grow the game further in the country.\n\nHaz Paz was appointed president of the Italian cricket federation in February 2025 until 2028.\n\nItaly's debut at the T20 World Cup, and the stories of some of their players, had captured the imagination of the cricket world.\n\nThe Azzurri failed to make the Super 8 stage but beat Nepal in Mumbai and gave England a scare in Kolkata in their Group C fixtures.\n\nIPL-linked teams 'not considering Pakistan players'\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\n'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",

With 220 runs to his name and at least two matches still to come, Farhan finds himself in rare territory, one that inevitably invites comparisons, records, and pressure.\n\nAt the pre-match press conference, he was asked a million dollar question on whether he is aiming to take down Virat Kohli's 12-year-old record as leading run-getter in the T20 World Cup. Kohli amassed 319 runs in the 2014 edition and 296 runs in 2022. His 319-run tally is still the highest by any batter in a single T20 World Cup.\n\n“I don’t look at stats. Even when I perform, people tell me how many runs I’ve scored,” he told reporters. “If you start thinking about records, it becomes an added burden. I want to finish well. I want Pakistan to be proud.”\n\nThat philosophy has shaped Farhan’s T20 World Cup so far. In a tournament where rain washed away momentum and Pakistan’s batting order repeatedly collapsed under pressure, Farhan has provided something invaluable: time at the crease. While critics have questioned strike rates and tempo, a conversation that has followed Pakistan’s top order for years, Farhan pushed back gently but firmly. “This is international cricket. You can’t start hitting from ball one every time. You have to read the pitch,” he explained. “If the ball is in my range, I attack. Once I get momentum, I try to take it long so the team can benefit.”\n\nThose words also reflect Pakistan’s broader dilemma. The bowlers, especially the spinners, have largely delivered. The batting, however, has struggled to keep pace, particularly against top opposition. Farhan did not shy away from acknowledging that reality. “Yes, we have collapsed in batting,” he admitted. “In T20 cricket, your top three or four have to score runs. We haven’t done that consistently. But the boys are working hard, and they are focused.”\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Farhan spoke with notable calm about the pressure surrounding senior players and teammates. Whether it was Saim Ayub’s lean run or the criticism aimed at experienced campaigners, Farhan stressed belief and roles over panic. “Not every player can perform in every match. Everyone has their own role,” he said. “Saim is an impact player. He believes in himself, and that belief matters in T20 cricket.”\n\nAttention also turned to upcoming challenges, including facing elite pacers. Asked about squaring up against England's Jofra Archer, Farhan was refreshingly blunt. “It’s not a big deal,” he shrugged. “We’ve faced him before. He will plan for me, but I have planned for him too. That’s international cricket.”\n\nWhat perhaps stood out most was Farhan’s clarity amid chaos. Rain delays, points-table permutations, decisions at the toss, none seemed to interest him. “Those calls are for the captain and coach,” he said. “Our job is to prepare and play according to the conditions.”\n\nAs Pakistan head deeper into the Super Eight phase, Farhan’s runs carry added weight. Each innings inches him closer to Kohli’s historic World Cup tally, even if he insists that the numbers mean little. Yet records means a lot to the players, especially in the subcontinent. \n\nWhether he reaches the mark or not, one thing is clear. In a T20 World Cup filled with noise around Pakistan’s batting, Sahibzada Farhan has chosen the quietest route, scoring runs, absorbing pressure, and letting his bat talk.",

Now I am trying to think less and the bat will now do the talking and I react [to] what's in front of me,\" Hetmyer said afterwards.\n\nZimbabwe rued dropping him twice, with the hapless Musekiwa wishing the Wankhede turf would swallow him up after he spilled two opportunities his team-mates would have expected him to take.\n\nIt might have been different had the first been held, although with strike rates of 238 (Rutherford), 210 (Shepherd) and 325 (Holder), possibly not.\n\nZimbabwe were never in the chase after Motie and Hosein turned the screw - West Indies' left-arm tweakers bagging seven of the wickets to fall.\n\nThe West Indies World Cup bandwagon rolls on after banking another impressive victory and the only concern is whether they are peaking too early.\n\nCertainly on this evidence they will take some stopping.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "With Pakistan's spinners promising to provide a \"tough time\", England's frequent batting weakness stand between them and a World Cup semi-final.",
    "fullText": "England batters and spin bowling. It has rarely been pretty.\n\nFor every Joe Root, Kevin Pietersen or Graham Thorpe, there have been far more troubled by the tweakers.\n\nEngland beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs on Sunday, meaning victory against Pakistan on Tuesday will secure a place in the semi-finals, but the issue that has dogged their batting throughout this T20 World Cup did not go away.\n\nFour of England's top five were out to spinners. The other, Tom Banton, was run out.\n\nAnd Pakistan used six different spinners in their match against India earlier in the tournament. They have bowled a higher percentage of spin than any other team.\n\nEngland's problems have not gone unnoticed.\n\n\"They were struggling against the spinners,\" said batter Sahibzada Farhan.\n\n\"We have one of the best spin attacks. which has Usman Tariq, [Mohammad] Nawaz, Shadab [Khan], even Abrar [Ahmed] is one of the top spinners.\n\n\"I am confident we will give them a tough time.\"\n\nEngland's 'Jack of all trades' delivers for Brook again\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?\n\nEngland's issues against spin at this tournament are curious, given what had come before.\n\nDuring the T20 series against Sri Lanka before this World Cup they lost only three wickets against spin across three matches.\n\nEven in the one-day international series that preceded it, with many of the same players, they averaged 43.9 collectively against the turning ball.\n\nHowever, those numbers have nose-dived on the biggest stage.\n\nOverall, 21 of England's 38 wickets have fallen to spin - not a major disparity to the 17 against pace - but more significant have been the moments those dismissals have come.\n\nThere were four in succession against Italy in the group stage and before that six in a row through the middle in defeat by West Indies in Mumbai.\n\nThe Sri Lanka win was the third occasion England were unable to break from a stranglehold.\n\n\"We were very good in the bilateral series here against Sri Lanka, where we played spin,\" said spinner Liam Dawson in defence of his top order.\n\n\"We know we can bat a lot better than what we have batted. We've won games and that's the main thing.\"\n\nAn lbw dismissal to Dunith Wellalage means England's captain Harry Brook has been removed by spinners four times in a row at this World Cup.\n\nOverall he now averages 19.1 against spin in T20 internationals, compared to 46.2 against the quicks.\n\nJacob Bethell, who played a horrible slog to fall to Maheesh Theekshana on Sunday, has got out to a spinner in every innings.\n\nJos Buttler was pinned in front by Wellalage, though he looked equally as troubled by the seamers.\n\nButtler, who has made three single-figure scores in a row, was the only player from the expected XI for Tuesday to train on Monday evening.\n\nGiven England rarely train when there is only one day between matches, that shows Buttler's struggle to find form.\n\nTuesday's match is again in Pallekele, where England have now won four T20s in a row in a matter of weeks. It is becoming a home far away from home in the Sri Lankan jungle.\n\nThe match will also be played on a fresh, unused pitch, which England will hope is more suited to clean-hitting. If not they, of course, have their own potent spin attack as Sunday's win showed.\n\nBut Pakistan's spin attack still looms large. It features 6ft 4in mystery spinner Usman Tariq, whose side-arm action and stop-start run-up is almost unique in world cricket.\n\nIt has been discussed at length throughout this tournament and Brook was seen mimicking his approach on Friday while England trained in the nets.\n\n\"It's just weird that he pauses more than anything,\" Bethell said last week.\n\n\"It's also interesting how they only use him after the 10-over mark.\n\n\"Maybe we try and put some pressure on them and see if they want to bring him on earlier - that might mess him up a bit.\"\n\nBanton is the only England batter to have faced Tariq before, having done so at the ILT20. He was dismissed by the lanky spinner and afterwards appeared to question the legitimacy of his bowling action.\n\nThe insights of Sam Curran, Tariq's ILT20 captain, and Buttler and Luke Wood, who played with him in the Abu Dhabi T10, may be useful.\n\nEngland should know what is coming.\n\nA threat they have rarely nullified stands between them and a World Cup semi-final.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Mexico's co-hosting of this summer's Fifa World Cup could be compromised by the eruption in drug cartel violence which began on Sunday, experts have told BBC Sport.\n\nThe Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) drug cartel - one of the country's most powerful and feared criminal organisations - has engaged in gun shootouts with the Mexican military, blocked roads and burned vehicles in response to the killing of its leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, better known as 'El Mencho', in an army operation.\n\nViolence began in the central-western Jalisco state - where a code red security situation has been declared - and has now spread to at least a dozen more regions, with videos posted online showing gunmen patrolling streets and smoke billowing over cities.\n\nAt least 25 National Guard officers have been killed inside 24 hours.\n\nGuadalajara, capital city of Jalisco and home to more than a million people, is scheduled to host four matches at this summer's tournament. Another five are scheduled in Mexico City, and four in Monterrey.\n\n\"When you push down on the cartels you do get pushback - the danger is that it can be very difficult to manage a security situation that spirals out of control,\" says Javier Eskauriatza, assistant professor of criminal law at the University of Nottingham.\n\nThe power vacuum created by El Mencho's killing could lead to a period of instability and further conflict as contenders vie to replace him.\n\n\"In general the cartels have an economic interest in making sure the World Cup is peaceful,\" Dr Eskauriatza adds.\n\n\"Yes they pay off politicians and local police forces, but they also buy restaurants and own hotels. They are part of the economic system.\n\n\"It is useful for them if Brits, Americans, and others go to Mexico, spend their money and have a good time.\"\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.\n\nThe CJNG is estimated to be worth more than £10bn and has tens of thousands of members. It has been responsible for a series of massacres, kidnappings and killings of politicians since its formation in 2009.\n\nBut some cartel figures retain a level of popularity within local communities in Mexico, as they provide financing for local infrastructure and facilities.\n\n\"The response by the CJNG is, in a way, required by the rules of the game - if you have your leader nabbed, you have to respond, otherwise you look weak\", says Dr. Eskauriatza.\n\n\"They are not idiots - they know that social media will film and amplify these videos for them and and they have made sure the response looks national.\"\n\nThe US government has advised Americans in Jalisco to shelter indoors until further notice, while fellow World Cup co-host nation Canada has cancelled flights to the Puerto Vallarta airport, and flight tracking apps showed many aeroplanes returning to their departure destinations around the world.\n\n\"In terms of tourists, I would say there will be a moderate risk for them\", says Dr. Karina Garcia-Reyes, senior lecturer in criminology at UWE Bristol.\n\n\"Unless more military operations are conducted this week, I would expect that the authorities in the most affected areas will be able address potential risks, so overall I would expect tourists to be safe as long as they follow the authorities' indications.\"\n\nSecurity planning for the World Cup has already been under scrutiny over the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to major US cities by President Donald Trump, leading to the killings of two US citizens by federal agents so far this year, and a series of mass protests.\n\nLast month, Football Supporters Europe said it was \"extremely concerned by the ongoing militarisation of police forces in the US\".\n\nNow eyes are on Mexico and whether it can guarantee the safety of travelling fans.\n\nFour football matches - two in the top flight and two in the second division - were postponed on Sunday because of the violence.\n\n\"People in Mexico are hoping that this is a one-off retaliation and that as the cartel reorganises itself, things will settle down,\" says Monica Serrano Carreto, professor of international relations at El Colegio de Mexico.\n\n\"But there is also a risk that this leads to a new period of instability, unpredictability and the violence continues.\n\n\"The type of weapons that the cartel has access to means that a military-style confrontation in the aftermath is inevitable - the government would have known that. We have seen in the past they [the cartel] even have weapons capable of shooting down helicopters.\n\n\"I think it will already have had an impact on how people view coming to Mexico because the images are top of the news around the world.\"\n\nMexico has been under increased political pressure to take action against cartels in the past year.\n\n\"This response is not unique but is very serious and very high scale,\" says Jon Benjamin, UK ambassador to Mexico between 2021 and 2024.\n\n\"President Trump has designated the cartels as terrorist organisations and Mexico has already handed over dozens of cartel figures to them. The Trump factor is very important in what is happening.\"",

(Photo by Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)\n\nA knee injury is delicate, and Barcelona want him to feel completely secure before stepping back into competitive action.\n\nAs such, optimism is growing internally, as the upcoming international break could actually benefit him, giving him uninterrupted weeks of training without the pressure of immediate match demands.\n\nThe plan is for him to complete full sessions consistently, increase intensity step by step, and reconnect with the feeling of being a competitive footballer.\n\nFor Gavi, the past months have been difficult and now, feeling useful to the team again before the end of the season is his short-term objective.\n\nMeanwhile, Luis de la Fuente has maintained regular contact with him.\n\nThe Spain coach is closely following his progress and understands both the risks and the potential reward.\n\nDe la Fuente has never hidden his admiration for the Barcelona midfielder and believes he could still play a role if he reaches the required level in time.\n\nReaching the World Cup will not be easy, as competition in Spain’s midfield is fierce. Despite that, if Gavi regains his rhythm and intensity, the door will not be closed.",

    "fullText": "He had created a sensation with Curaçao: the island state will participate in the World Cup this summer. But it won't be with Dick Advocaat on the bench. The Dutchman has decided to resign for personal reasons.\n\nThis was confirmed by the federation on \"X\". His successor is already known: Fred Rutten will lead the team during the tournament that will take place in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nThe coach himself also speaks in this article and explains his motivations. \"I have always said that family comes before football for me,\" said Advocaat.\n\nBut this doesn't change the fact that he will miss Curaçao, its people, and his colleagues greatly. \"Qualifying the smallest FIFA country for the World Cup is one of the highlights of my career. I am proud of my players and my coaching team, as well as the board members who believed in us,\" said the 78-year-old.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Charlie O'Leary was the Republic of Ireland kitman, but his influence extends to football across the island.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to football on the island of Ireland, there isn't much 102-year-old Charlie O'Leary has not seen or done.\n\nFrom serving as the Republic of Ireland's kitman at two World Cups and a European Championship, to refereeing behind the Iron Curtain, the Dubliner has an almost legendary status.\n\nWhat is not as well known is his involvement in founding the \"street leagues\", which helped hone the skills of some of the best players in the history of both the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nNow his story is the focus of a new film which will premiere at the Dublin International Film Festival on Tuesday.\n\nAs the Republic's kitman, O'Leary was part of the national team setup during its golden era, when Ireland defeated England in Stuttgart at Euro '88 and famously stunned Italy in New York at World Cup '94.\n\nBut his influence stretches to some other iconic moments thanks to the street leagues, which he founded in East Wall in Dublin in 1945.\n\nCharlie suggested to the local priest the idea of using the parish church's juvenile sodality - a religious group for young parishioners - as the basis for a football league.\n\nThe sodality was organised on the basis of the local streets - and so the street leagues were born.\n\n\"Schoolboy football hadn't been organised and there was nowhere for a young boy around 14 if he wanted to play football,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"At least this gave those kids at that age a chance of representing those roads in football and getting them interested.\n\n\"So we formed the leagues and they really cottoned on.\"\n\nSo much so that by the 1950s the leagues had spread across Dublin and then to cities across the island, including Belfast.\n\nThe leagues first took root in east Belfast, where people associated with the Harland and Wolff shipyard were among the first to compete.\n\nThey began to feature young men who would go on to achieve sporting greatness.\n\nIn the Republic they included Tony Dunne, who won the European Cup with Manchester United in 1968, Liam Brady, winner of the FA Cup with Arsenal and two Serie A titles with Juventus, and Johnny Giles, part of the great Leeds United side of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, at least three of the 1958 World Cup squad spent time in the street leagues - Harry Gregg, Bertie Peacock and Jimmy McIlroy.\n\nIn later years Manchester United's Sammy McIlroy - who went on to manage Northern Ireland - and Jimmy Nicholl, current Northern Ireland assistant manager, took part in the leagues.\n\nThere was an early sign of things to come in 1957 when Republic of Ireland B took on Romania B in Dublin.\n\n\"There was Liam Tuohy of Newcastle, Noel Payton of Leeds and Dickie Whittaker of Chelsea, all three of them standing together, shoulder to shoulder, for the national anthem,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"Each of those had played, you could pull a curtain over where they lived, the houses were that close.\n\n\"On one day they represented Ireland and all played in the street leagues.\"\n\nCharlie was born just a few months before the Irish Free State - as it was then known - played its first international football match.\n\nThe story of his life - which has therefore spanned the entire existence of his country's national team - will be shown in The Charlie O'Leary Story - From Johnny Cullen's Hill to the Olympic Stadium Rome.\n\nFergus Dowd, who produced the film along with Joe Lee, said the street leagues gave opportunities to young people who would not otherwise have had them.\n\n\"One of the players said to Charlie it was like playing for your country, you played for your street but you were amongst friends and it was really community based,\" he said.\n\n\"I think in a sense we've really sort of lost that innocence - these kids had a jersey on, they were representing the road and their mothers and fathers were watching, so it was a massive community event.\n\n\"Nowadays a lot of the clubs here have their own academies whereas this grew very much organically and it was down to Charlie's idea of making it happen.\"\n\nThe leagues persisted into the 1970s, giving an opportunity to the man who delivered Northern Ireland's greatest moment on the world stage, Gerry Armstrong.\n\nA few years after his iconic goal sealed a 1-0 victory against hosts Spain in the 1982 World Cup, it was the turn of the Republic of Ireland to revel in a shock victory.\n\nThey defeated England 1-0 in Euro '88 and Charlie was watching from the dugout, having been appointed kitman two years earlier.\n\n\"I saw grown men cry,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"There was a man who used to live next door to me and he had gone with his son and he came over to me and he was sobbing.\n\n\"He said 'Charlie, I can boast, I was here when we beat England'.\"\n\nSix years later there was another iconic win, this time against Italy at the World Cup and again, Charlie was there.\n\nThose great victories were masterminded by Jack Charlton, who Charlie said was the best man manager he ever worked under.\n\nHe recalled one occasion when the boss quizzed him after some players were involved in a \"drinking session\" the night before which had ended in a \"rumpus\".\n\n\"He said 'I'm asking you a simple question, what happened last night?',\" Charlie said.\n\n\"I said 'boss hang on a second, if I tell you then you're involved and you've got problems to resolve.\n\n\"I tell you what I'll do, if I say to you everything is resolved, then it's all resolved.\n\n\"So Jack said, 'that's all I want to know, we'll leave it at that,'\n\n\"I got away with that gag every time there was a problem.\"\n\nFrom being part of the backroom team for those famous victories to refereeing in East Germany during the Cold War - \"a bit frightening\" - Charlie has plenty of footballing highlights to pick from.\n\nSo what is his favourite moment?\n\n\"I have to say, I'm a Roman Catholic, when we went to Italy [for the 1990 World Cup] we were brought to see the Pope,\" he said.\n\n\"I was frozen, I couldn't speak.\n\n\"People say, I said this and I said that, I don't remember saying that.\n\n\"But that to me was the biggest thrill I ever got in my life.\"",

    "fullText": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need \"two big performances\" to reach the semi-finals after Sunday's huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.\n\nIndia came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.\n\nIn their first chase of the tournament, India's batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.\n\nIndia collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa's 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.\n\nThe magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.\n\n\"Very disappointed in the performance,\" said Ryan ten Doeschate.\n\n\"When you set out to win a World Cup, don't expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,\" the assistant coach added.\n\n\"We've messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.\"\n\nIndia are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe West Indies face Zimbabwe on Monday night in Mumbai in their Super Eights opener.\n\nIndia next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.\n\nSouth Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram's side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.\n\n\"Obviously with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it's going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\nIndia's fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.\n\nIndia's media tore into the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"The night the cloak came off,\" blazed a headline in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\n\"Sloppy India reach point of no return,\" said the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndia's ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.\n\nIshan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world's top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.\n\n\"It's certainly not panic stations,\" said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India's batting line-up.\n\n\"If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\n\"So can we get them to temper the way they're playing and be a little bit smarter?\n\n\"Or do we just let them go on the way they are?\n\n\"Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?\"\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.\n\n\"Chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,\" he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.\n\n\"We lost too many wickets in the power play.\"\n\nThe 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

    "fullText": "The two-time champions West Indies have looked confident and clinical in the shortest format, showcasing their trademark flair and aggressive style. Under the guidance of head coach Daren Sammy, the Caribbean side have spoken about creating their own slice of history, but consistency will be crucial as the competition intensifies.\n\nThe West Indies enter the match on the back of four consecutive wins, putting behind a disappointing run in bilateral series before the tournament. Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer have led the batting charge, while Jason Holder and Roston Chase have provided balance with their all-round skills. Romario Shepherd has also impressed with both bat and ball, particularly on Indian surfaces where he has IPL experience.\n\nZimbabwe, on the other hand, have been one of the biggest revelations of the tournament. The Sikandar Raza-led side have pulled off memorable victories over former world champions Australia and Sri Lanka, earning respect and recognition on the global stage. Young batter Brian Bennett has been their standout performer with the bat, while Blessing Muzarabani and Brad Evans have been among the leading wicket-takers in the competition.\n\nWith short boundaries and a batting-friendly pitch expected at the Wankhede Stadium, West Indies are likely to target a big-hitting approach, but Zimbabwe’s confidence and resilience suggest they are capable of pushing their opponents to the limit.\n\nWest Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match: Live streaming details\n\nWhen will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe West Indies vs Zimbabwe Super 8 match will be played on Monday, February 23, 2026.\n\nWhere will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe match will take place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India.\n\nWhat time will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match start?\n\nThe match is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss at 6:30 PM IST.\n\nWhich TV channels will broadcast the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network in India.\n\nHow to watch live streaming of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nFans can watch the live stream on the Jio Hotstar app and website.\n\nWhere can we follow the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match online?\n\nLive ball-by-ball updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.",

    "fullText": "With Mauricio Pochettino about three weeks from selecting the U.S. roster for March training camp and friendlies, a rush of good news concerning two players arrived a few hours apart Saturday:\n\nMidfielder Tyler Adams was on the field for the first time in more than two months and striker Ricardo Pepi was in uniform for the first time in six weeks.\n\nAdams, who recovered earlier than anticipated from a sprained knee ligament, started in Bournemouth’s 0-0 draw at West Ham, while Pepi, in uniform after recovering from a fractured forearm, scored a sensational goal as a second-half sub in PSV Eindhoven’s 3-1 triumph over Heerenveen.\n\nRicardo Pepi laat zich direct gelden bij zijn rentree 🎯👏#psvhee pic.twitter.com/z4UrAtaZkr\n\n— ESPN NL (@ESPNnl) February 21, 2026\n\nWith both back in the mix for national team duty next month — Adams is certain and Pepi is probable — Pochettino has, at the moment, almost his entire player pool available for selection.\n\nOnly midfielder Gio Reyna (muscular issue) and winger Alex Zendejas (adductor) have remained out for multiple weeks.\n\nAdams, the 2022 World Cup captain, missed 10 matches before suiting up at Everton on Feb. 10 — an absence of eight weeks instead of up to a feared three months. On Saturday, he logged 66 minutes, completed 41-of-45 passes and earned the second-best defensive statistics among players on both teams as eighth-place Bournemouth extended its Premier League unbeaten streak to seven.\n\nWith his left forearm well-protected, Pepi entered in the 76th minute and, after video replay negated his apparent goal, he rocketed a 25-yard shot in the 87th minute to stretch his Eredivisie scoring streak to six games. He increased his league total to nine and overall count to 12 in just 22 appearances.\n\nThe timing was ideal for the 23-year-old Texan, who, while injured, fell behind Coventry City’s Haji Wright and Derby County’s Patrick Agyemang on the U.S. depth chart behind No. 1 striker Folarin Balogun (Monaco).\n\n“Amazing feeling to be back!” Pepi posted on social media. “Thank you to all the PSV’ers for the warm support on my return.”\n\nPochettino plans to name his squad for next month’s camp March 17 ahead of friendlies in Atlanta against Belgium on March 28 and Portugal on March 31 — the last gathering before his World Cup decisions. He must submit a provisional list of between 35 and 55 players to FIFA by May 11 before announcing the 26-man squad on or about May 26.\n\nIt was quite a week for Balogun, who followed his two-goal performance against reigning European champion Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a second-half goal that sparked Monaco’s three-goal uprising to shock Ligue 1 leader Lens, 3-2.\n\nHe increased his overall goal haul to 11: five in Ligue 1, five in the Champions League and one in the French Cup.\n\nMidfielder Tanner Tessmann (58 minutes) and third-place Lyon saw their 13-game winning streak across all competitions end with a 3-1 defeat at Strasbourg.\n\nRight back Tim Weah was Olympique Marseille’s best player from an analytical standpoint in a 2-0 loss at Brest, extending fourth-place OM’s overall slump to 1-3-2 heading into next Sunday’s critical home match against Lyon.\n\nToulouse center back Mark McKenzie served a yellow card suspension and missed the 1-1 draw with Paris FC.\n\nCenter back Chris Richards helped Crystal Palace register its second shutout in three Premier League matches, a 1-0 victory over last-place Wolverhampton, which played a man short for about a half-hour before conceding the goal.\n\nLeft back Antonee Robinson was held out of Fulham’s 3-1 triumph at Sunderland without an official explanation, his third consecutive league absence. He had played 90 last weekend in the FA Cup.\n\nMidfielder Brenden Aaronson (73 minutes) and Leeds earned their third straight away draw in Premier League play, a 1-1 result at Aston Villa.\n\nAfter productive matches in the English Championship last week, Wright and Agyemang were quiet. Wright played 71 minutes in a 2-0 victory at West Brom and Agyemang went 90 in a 2-0 loss at Watford.\n\nMidfielder Aidan Morris went 75 in Middlesbrough’s 0-0 draw with second-to-last Oxford, leaving his club three points behind first-place Coventry but six points ahead in the race for the second promotion to the Premier League.\n\nChristian Pulisic, who has been battling bursitis, returned to AC Milan’s lineup after three substitution appearances with a 62-minute effort and two quality scoring chances during a 1-0 home loss to Parma — its first loss in Serie A since the August opener, a stretch of 23 games.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie, who has been in tremendous form for Juventus this winter, played all of the 2-0 loss to Como, a result that stretched the Turin club’s winless rut to five games heading into the home leg of the Champions League affair with Galatasaray on Wednesday. (Juventus lost last week’s opener, 5-2.)\n\nMidfielder Yunus Musah remained on the bench for the seventh time in nine matches as Atalanta edged Napoli, 2-1. He has appeared in 14-of-26 Serie A matches with just three starts, totalling 447 minutes.\n\nIn Serie B, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann has conceded 10 goals in three matches, the most recent setback coming in Cesena’s 3-2 loss to Spezia.\n\nMidfielder Malik Tillman played 81 minutes in Bayer Leverkusen’s 1-0 loss at Union Berlin, ending a seven-game unbeaten streak heading into the Champions League second leg Tuesday against Olympiacos. Leverkusen won the first leg, 2-0.\n\nTeenage center back Noahkai Banks (17th start) continued to impress at Augsburg, which used a late comeback to earn a 3-2 victory at Wolfsburg.\n\nReyna’s call-up hopes continued to dim after missing his fifth consecutive match for Mönchengladbach. Over two months, he has played just 28 minutes. Teammate Joe Scally, a right wing back, played the entire match.\n\nMidfielder James Sands’ run of 17 consecutive starts for St. Pauli across all competitions ended, but he entered in the 80th minute and helped seal a 2-1 victory over Werder Bremen, which lifted the Hamburg side out of the automatic relegation zone.\n\nIn the second division, left wing back John Tolkin (70 minutes) and Holstein Kiel lost at Karlsruher, 3-1 — their fifth consecutive loss overall.\n\nMidfielder Johnny Cardoso made his fifth consecutive La Liga start for Atlético Madrid, which defeated Espanyol, 4-2, to snap a three-game winless streak in league play.\n\nRight back Alex Freeman did not play in Villarreal’s 2-1 win over Valencia.\n\nWhile Pepi’s goal headlined the U.S. contributions for PSV Eindhoven, right back Sergiño Dest made his 22nd start as the league leaders continued to run away with the title, thanks to a 20-2-2 record and a plus-41 goal differential.\n\nCenter back Auston Trusty’s second red card in four weeks – for violent conduct in the 74th minute – imperiled Celtic, which conceded Hibernian’s late winner in the 2-1 outcome. He will miss next Sunday’s Old Firm clash against Rangers.\n\nOn opening weekend, three Vancouver players in the U.S. pool – center back Tristan Blackmon, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and striker Brian White – played the whole match as the Whitecaps edged Real Salt Lake, 1-0. RSL midfielder Diego Luna sat out with a knee ailment.\n\nFive goalkeeping candidates started, led by Pochettino’s undisputed starter, New York City’s Matt Freese, who made five saves in a 1-1 draw against the L.A. Galaxy. The others were New England’s Matt Turner, Chicago’s Chris Brady, Columbus’ Patrick Schulte and Cincinnati’s Roman Celentano.\n\nCenter backs Tim Ream (Charlotte), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati) and Walker Zimmerman (Toronto) and left wing back Max Arfsten (Columbus) played every minute and midfielder Luca de la Torre (Charlotte) went 69.\n\nLos Angeles FC midfielder Timothy Tillman assisted during his 82-minute stint in the 3-0 home rout of Inter Miami before 75,673 at the Coliseum. Midfielder Cristian Roldan captained Seattle’s 2-0 win over Colorado.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8s Group 2, Pallekele\n\nEngland 146-9 (20 overs): Salt 62 (40), Jacks 21 (14); Wellalage 3-26,\n\nSri Lanka 95 (16.4 overs): Shanaka 30 (24); Jacks 3-22\n\nA superb bowling performance breathed life into England's T20 World Cup campaign as Harry Brook's side beat co-hosts Sri Lanka by 51 runs in their opening match of the Super 8s phase.\n\nEngland remained unconvincing with the bat in posting 146-9 but their bowlers took full advantage of a tricky surface to knock over their hosts for 95.\n\nJofra Archer dismissed key batter Pathum Nissanka and fellow opener Kamil Mishara but even more impressive were the three wickets for all-rounder Will Jacks inside the powerplay.\n\nJacks, who has struggled with the ball at times in this tournament, removed Kusal Mendis and Pavan Rathnayake in consecutive deliveries and added the scalp of Dunith Wellalage as Sri Lanka crumbled to 34-5 under the pressure of a chase.\n\nAfter Kamindu Mendis chipped back a catch to Liam Dawson and Dushan Hemantha hit his own wicket, Jacks combined with Tom Banton to complete a fine relay catch on the boundary to dismiss Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka's captain and the last recognised batter, for 30.\n\nThat England's batting remains far from perfect is pushed to another day. Jos Buttler made a tortured seven from 14 balls, Jacob Bethell fell to a wild slog and Tom Banton ran himself out.\n\nPhil Salt's 62 and 21 from Jacks, who was the next highest scorer in a fine all-round display, were crucial.\n\nEngland play Pakistan on Tuesday and New Zealand on Friday in their remaining Super 8s matches.\n\nOne win should be enough to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nSalt and Jacks dragged England to a score but Sri Lanka still appeared favourites at halfway.\n\nThough England defended 128 on this ground in a series before the World Cup, Sri Lanka chased 182 with two overs to spare to beat Australia here in the group stage.\n\nThis surface was trickier than that one. Its sticky nature and decent turn offered assistance to the spinners and Jacks capitalised.\n\nAfter conceding four from an accurate first over, Jacks got one to grip to take the leading edge of Mendis. Rathnayake charged him a ball later and was caught skying a hideous swipe.\n\nBrook also used Archer for three consecutive overs at the start.\n\nArcher bowled at high pace and had Nissanka, who scored a brilliant hundred against Australia, caught at deep square leg before finding the edge of Mishara.\n\nHemantha's dismissal – he hit his stumps with his bat flapping at Jamie Overton – summed up a poor Sri Lanka batting display, not that England will care.\n\nAfter nervy wins over Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage, they are closing in on a place in the last four.\n\nStill we wait for England's batting to truly fire at this tournament.\n\nWith his feet stuck and best form seeming distant, Buttler missed three deliveries and toe-ended another before being pinned in front by Wellalage's left-arm spin on the reverse sweep.\n\nOnly 37 runs came from the powerplay, with Bethell caught at short third trying to hit Maheesh Theekshana over mid-wicket.\n\nAs the pressure to score rose, Banton took on a single that was never there and Brook was trapped tentatively on the crease for 14.\n\nThe highest partnership of the match was 26 between Salt and Sam Curran. Battling cramp from the ninth over, Salt did not find top gear and Curran holed out at long-on\n\nJacks targeted the off side smartly and struck four important fours and Overton clubbed a six in the last over.\n\nThere remains room for improvement but England's tactic of favouring batting depth - Jacks was at number seven and Overton nine here – is proving to be smart as the top order struggles.\n\nT20 World Cup: England complete convincing win over Sri Lanka - as it happened\n\nTMS podcast: Bowlers bail out England as they beat Sri Lanka\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses what went wrong in England's record home defeat by Ireland and what areas could be improved for the final two rounds.\n\nRemember two years ago when England were going to get beaten at home by 40 points against Ireland?\n\nThe narrative in this tournament rarely plays out as expected. Teams overperform and sides crack under pressure. That is the beauty of the Six Nations.\n\nThat predicted thumping in 2024 never happened. Instead, England stunned Grand Slam-chasing Ireland with the last play of the game to win 23-22.\n\nRoll on two years, when expectations were much lower, and Ireland delivered that record away win.\n\nAndy Farrell's side arrived with the mentality to deliver a historic victory, bringing the tactics and accuracy needed to win.\n\nThe 21-point difference at Allianz Stadium came down to tactics and decision-making. England made a load of mistakes, and some of that came down to trying to play the match like a game of chess.\n\nThe issue with doing that is that they could not change on the hoof how they wanted to play.\n\nThe tactical battle between coaches Andy Farrell and Steve Borthwick was won by Farrell, but England need players on the field who are able to change tactics as they go.\n\nThey have struggled with sticking to the script instructed to them by Borthwick, with any changes then being delivered at half-time.\n\nGiven the talent and winning run, I was expecting England to adapt better.\n\nWhy do teams play with a high tempo against them? Because England are good.\n\nIt looked like they thought another team could not replicate Scotland's attacking play from last week.\n\nIt was very unlike England, but that is what happens when you get stressed.\n\nThey lacked the senior Lions mentality to get out of sticky situations. Over the last two weeks, where were those decision-makers?\n\nThe defence and attack needed adjusting in the first quarter. They waited 40 minutes and had conceded 22 points.\n\nEngland have good leadership, but Maro Itoje - who will only get better with more minutes under his belt - cannot do it all on his own.\n\nHe wants the leaders around him to step up in their roles, especially given he is not finishing games at the moment.\n\nSomeone like Ollie Chessum can jump in with an idea of how to fix the line-out. Freddie Steward, who can see the flow of the game from the back, could offer input on where the space to attack is.\n\nThe squad has not changed from the 12-game winning run. They are a group of very good rugby players.\n\nEllis Genge was honest and brave in his assessment, but I do not feel let down by England.\n\nThey are capable of winning in Rome and Paris.\n\nThe loss should not be the reason for a load of changes for the Italy game, as Borthwick's continuity in selection is what brought success.\n\nDespite a rest week coming, a three-game block of games is very taxing and England have the depth available.\n\nI would freshen up the half-backs and bring in Fin Smith and Jack van Poortvliet.\n\nAlex Mitchell's injury may open that door for Van Poortvliet, but I want to give a new opportunity to key decision-makers in an away Six Nations game.\n\nSmith is a confident player and, having been England's starting 10 in last year's Six Nations, he will want to prove his ability to adapt in-game.\n\nFull-back George Furbank is another intelligent player who can spot space in attack, and I want to see him as he will also be chomping at the bit to prove his worth.\n\nI would then go Tom Roebuck and Henry Arundell on the wings. A free-flowing game in Rome suits their attacking attributes.\n\nThe back row, too, I felt lacked some balance against Ireland.\n\nBringing Henry Pollock and all his energy off the bench is a play that I would go back to.\n\nA new outlook and perspective from players who have been outside the pressure cooker may well bring long-term benefits.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\nRuthless Ireland beat England, & Scotland come back in Cardiff\n\nNow the narrative is that they did not win big away games in 2025. They beat what was in front of them, and they have proved themselves to be a good side.\n\nLike a good golfer, they are tinkering that bit too much. That has enormous ramifications.\n\nThe progress up until the Scotland game was good enough for a World Cup, but they are trying lots of different things that they do not need at the moment.\n\nOff the back of a tough 2024, England used being the underdog to their advantage.\n\nThey won in Argentina with a young squad and beat New Zealand in November. It becomes trickier when you are known to be one of the top sides.\n\nEngland were getting into that bracket as they blew Wales away, and the rest of the Six Nations knew they were going to have to come up with something superhuman to beat them.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened, and Borthwick's side must deal better with higher expectations.\n\nThe pressure is also different, as every breath for the past month has been about the Six Nations and possibly winning it. That is draining and tiring.\n\nFinding the energy as an underdog to play above yourself is easier than finding that spark within yourself when you are expected to win.\n\nEvery single year you will get these types of results, and that will not change.\n\nIt is not out of the question that England go to Paris and beat France. What is the narrative then?\n\nNothing said Ireland could win against them by 20-odd points - and it happened.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8s Group 1, Ahmedabad\n\nSouth Africa 187-7 (20 overs): Miller 63 (35), Brevis 45 (29); Bumrah 3-15\n\nIndia 111 all out (18.5 overs): Dube 42 (37); Jansen 4-22, Maharaj 3-24\n\nSouth Africa underlined their credentials as serious challengers for the T20 World Cup with an eye-catching 76-run victory against defending champions India in their opening match of the Super 8s phase.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2024 final in Barbados which India won by seven runs, South Africa set the co-hosts a target of 188 as a 35-ball 65 from David Miller and Dewald Brevis' 29-ball 45 helped them recover from a precarious 20-3 after four overs.\n\nIndia, who came into the game with a perfect record of four wins in the group stage, produced an uncharacteristically timid chase in Ahmedabad and looked resigned to their fate after slipping to 51-5 by the 10th over before being bowled out for 111.\n\nOpting to bat first, South Africa were in trouble after losing captain Aiden Markram, Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton for single digits inside the powerplay and needed Miller and Brevis to rebuild their innings.\n\nMiller, who previously played for Ahmedabad-based Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League, looked right at home from the start, finding boundaries with ease as Brevis was happy to play second fiddle.\n\nBrevis then picked up the pace and fell five runs short of a half-century but Miller soldiered on to reach his half-century in 26 balls and by the time he departed in the 16th over, South Africa were well poised at 152-5.\n\nSome good death bowling from Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh reined them back but a late flourish from Tristan Stubbs, who added 20 off Hardik Pandya's final over, in an unbeaten 44 took them to 187-7.\n\nMarkram gave the Proteas the perfect start with the ball by sending back the dangerous Ishan Kishan for a duck in the first over before Marco Jansen removed Tilak Varma three balls later.\n\nKishan's opening partner Abhishek Sharma ended his run of three consecutive ducks but could only muster 15 before falling to Jansen while captain Suryakumar Yadav became the fifth India batter to fall halfway through their innings.\n\nWith him went India's remaining hopes as Keshav Maharaj, who picked up three wickets in the 15th over, and Jansen, who took two in the 19th to finish with 4-22, wrapped up the tailenders.\n\nIndia will need to defeat Zimbabwe in Chennai on Thursday to stay alive in the competition while South Africa will remain in Ahmedabad to face former champions West Indies on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Africa captain Aiden Markram: \"Great performance. We're pumped for the bowling crew, they've been working hard. The partnership [between Miller and Brevis] steadied the ship and kept us in the game. We looked at where we could run hard and our batting in the middle was the difference.\n\n\"We're going to have to enjoy this but park it and get our minds sharp [to face West Indies]. We don't want to take confidence and good vibes for granted.\"\n\nIndia captain Suryakumar Yadav: \"You can't win the game in the powerplay, but you can lose it. We lost too many wickets in the powerplay.\n\n\"Hopefully we bat well, bowl well and field well [against Zimbabwe]. I hope we play the same brand of cricket, nothing changes.\"\n\nTest Match Special commentator Prakash Wakankar: \"You see the satisfaction but also the steely determination on the faces of the South Africa players. Right from the toss, there wasn't the customary smile from Markram, who was very serious and focused.\n\n\"The disappointment from the captain after getting out really said a lot. It clearly shows that South Africa came here with a plan and executed it with ruthlessness to deliver a result that will be very, very well received by their supporters.\"\n\nT20 World Cup: South Africa complete impressive win over India - as it happened\n\nHow South Africa conquered Test cricket in 2025\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Will Jacks, labeled England's 'Jack of all trades' by Harry Brook, delivers again at the T20 World Cup to keep the winter of a lifetime rolling on.",
    "fullText": "Will Jacks has already had quite the winter.\n\nHe made his Ashes debut in Australia, got engaged to his partner Ana in Sydney and now, at times single-handedly, is taking England towards the T20 World Cup semi-finals.\n\nWhich would he rank as his best moment?\n\n\"That is not for me to answer,\" laughed his captain Harry Brook.\n\n\"But he has had three man-of-the-match awards this World Cup and I don't think he has played his best cricket yet.\"\n\nBrook and Jacks go back a long way.\n\nThey were 15-year-olds when they played against each other at the famous Bunbury Festival – Jacks playing for the London schools' side and Brook the north of England.\n\nJacks made 46. Brook took two wickets.\n\nFour years later they were roommates with the Under-19s and now Jacks is keeping Brook's first World Cup campaign as captain afloat.\n\nWhen this tournament began with questions around Brook's suitability to be captain after off-field controversy in Wellington, it was Jacks who was put forward to speak to the media to defend his mate.\n\nAgainst Nepal, the right-hander hit 39 not out, without which England would have suffered one of the great World Cup shocks, and his first T20 fifty against Italy, a powerful 53 not out, pushed a tight game out of the reach of the Italians in their valiant chase.\n\nHis 21 with the bat and three wickets with the ball against Sri Lanka was another gift for Brook, coming on the captain's 27th birthday.\n\nEngland now sit one win from a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\"He is a very competitive lad,\" said Brook. \"He was annoyed when he got out tonight.\n\n\"After his first over he said 'I always bowl better when I am annoyed'. That was one of the reasons I kept him on.\n\n\"He is that perfect player. He is the Jack of all trades who can do everything.\"\n\nJacks' Ashes was not all fairytale proposals below Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nOff the field, he was one of the England players plastered across the front page of the Australian newspapers with a pint in hand in Noosa.\n\nOn it, he struggled with his two wickets in the third Test against Australia in Adelaide costing 212 runs. Across the series he took six wickets for 394 runs.\n\nJacks' stubborn batting in Australia did show a side of his game that hinted at promise and now he is thriving as England's T20 man for all seasons.\n\nBacked by Brook on Sunday he was asked to open the bowling for England for the first time since a match against Australia in Barbados at the last T20 World Cup.\n\nThat day, after what Jos Buttler later described as a \"gut feel\", Aussie opener Travis Head – the man who cut and pulled him into submission in Adelaide – sent him onto the Kensington Oval roof in an over that cost 22 runs. England's campaign never recovered.\n\nThis time his opening over cost only four, even that a boundary courtesy of a misfield.\n\nBrook said it was a \"last-minute\" decision to give Jacks the new ball, the logic being that with a shorter boundary to the left-handed Kamil Mishara's leg side it was better to have Jacks' off-spin turning the ball away.\n\nTypically, after that good first over, Jacks dismissed two right-handers in his next – the dangerous Kusal Mendis poking and chipping back a catch and Pavan Rathnayake charging and slicing a catch high to the off-side ring.\n\n\"Rathnayake's been a very good player for them, and probably their best player of spin - the way that he runs down the pitch,\" Brook said.\n\n\"To get him out first ball was a very crucial part in the game for us.\"\n\nControl was something often lacking with Jacks' off-spin during the winter but here he delivered his most accurate spell.\n\nBowling four overs on the spin, he pitched 91% of his deliveries on the stumps or in the channel - the highest of any England match of his career.\n\nHis only bad ball, one which slipped from his sweaty hand, was pulled for six by Dasun Shanaka but later Jacks got his revenge by being the initial catcher in a brilliant relay grab with Tom Banton.\n\nIf his first three wickets put England on course for victory, the dismissal of Shanaka confirmed it.\n\n\"I love getting the responsibility with the ball,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"It encourages me to get into the game and perform better.\n\n\"[Opening the bowling] is not foreign for me. And with a surface like that, I come in knowing what to do.\"\n\nJacks has been given the nickname of Slim Shady by some England players during this tournament – a reference to his pre-tournament haircut and bleached blond hair. In the dressing room he has even been asked to rap.\n\nBrook appears happy with his Jack of all trades. He is keeping this winter rolling on.\n\nEngland bowlers secure crucial win over Sri Lanka\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nStats battle: Can you beat our new T20 World Cup game?",

    "description": "Rain washed out the Pakistan vs New Zealand Super 8 match, with both teams sharing one point and the semi-final race wide open. Pakistan must beat England and Sri Lanka to reach five points and likely qualify, while any loss could make their chances depend on other results. New Zealand face a similar situation, with wins now crucial to stay in control of their campaign.",
    "fullText": "As a result, both teams shared one point, which has made the race for the T20 World Cup 2026 semi-finals much more complicated.\n\nThis was an important game for both sides because a win would have given them a strong start in the Super 8 stage. \n\nInstead, Pakistan and New Zealand now have only two matches left to push for a top-two finish in their group.\n\nFor Pakistan, the situation is simple but tough. They will next play England and Sri Lanka. If Pakistan manage to win both matches, they will reach five points, which should be enough to book a place in the semi-finals. \n\nHowever, if they lose even one game, their chances become tricky. One win and one loss would leave them on three points, and then they would have to depend on other teams’ results. \n\nIf Pakistan lose both remaining matches, they will be knocked out of the tournament.\n\nNew Zealand are in the same boat. \n\nThe rain has given them a point, but they will still need wins in their upcoming matches to stay in control of their destiny. \n\nAny slip-up could pull them into a tight battle with the other teams in the group.\n\nSince this was the first Super 8 match for both Pakistan and New Zealand, the full picture will only become clear once all teams have played at least one game. \n\nBoth sides were seen as favourites to reach the semi-finals, but the washout has made their path harder and kept the group wide open.",

    "fullText": "The noise is one of the first things that hits you on arrival in India.\n\nThe chatter. The beeping of horns. A thrilling assault on the senses.\n\nEngland have also battled to dampen the noise around their group throughout this T20 World Cup campaign.\n\nShould Brendon McCullum stay on as coach? Is Harry Brook the right man to be captain?\n\nEven after reaching the relative tranquillity of central Sri Lanka, Brook fielded questions about the ongoing situation regarding Pakistan players' involvement in The Hundred.\n\nBrook's pre-prepared answers – he gave it in two separate interviews to different questions – did not say much, but he did at least show support for those involved.\n\nOn another day, Brook's admission that England had \"probably underestimated a couple of the sides\" when scraping through the group stage would have taken the headlines.\n\nIt was honest, but not a great look for a team battling a perception of being loose with their preparation.\n\n\"We obviously didn't know all the players and we had minimal stats on some of them,\" Brook said.\n\n\"That's something that we can definitely improve on in the future, especially in tournaments further down the line - getting your homework done a little bit earlier.\"\n\nEngland's performance in the group stage was undoubtedly unconvincing.\n\nThey were taken to the final ball by Nepal and lost to West Indies in Mumbai, before edging to wins over Italy and Scotland in Kolkata.\n\nBatters got in and got out - Tom Banton's 63 not out the only real match-defining score. Even the ever-reliable Adil Rashid has gone for nine runs per over or \n\nIt means England have shown little to suggest they can threaten late into the tournament to this point.\n\nWithout improvement this will likely be a fourth underwhelming major tournament in a row since they won the T20 World Cup in 2022.\n\nBut Brook's comments also reflect some of the difficulties faced by the major nations at this World Cup – a tournament in which no team has built an entirely compelling case to suggest they will be champions.\n\nPlayers from the lower-ranked teams expressed their keenness to perform, not just to cause an upset but also to prove they are deserving of the greater opportunities they so desperately seek.\n\nThe Test-playing sides, in contrast, had everything to lose. Just ask Mitchell Marsh when he gets off his flight to back to Australia on Saturday.\n\nAnd for all their struggles to finish matches with ease, England were also ahead in all three games against their lower-ranked opponents.\n\nNepal's chase looked to have stalled, Scotland were 127-8 and Italy 1-2 in the first over of their chase.\n\nMost former England captains would not admit it, and maybe Brook has shown he would, but it would only be human to relax in those situations.\n\nMost of all, however, England are hoping familiarity brings an upturn in fortunes.\n\nThey returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, first spending two nights in Colombo before taking the winding drive to Pallekele.\n\nColombo was where Brook stood in front of his team-mates in late January and apologised for his late-night antics in Wellington and the subsequent fallout – an attempt to draw a line under the Ashes defeat.\n\nPallekele was where England won all three T20s against the very same team they now face.\n\nEngland said they were badly prepared for the Ashes and now admit to being underprepared for this group stage. For the next task they could hardly have had better preparation.\n\n\"It's just about reading the pitch and the conditions as quickly as possible and communication's key,\" said Brook, when asked what he learned from beating Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We obviously had that last game where we only got 130, but that ended up being a winning score.\n\n\"You never quite know what's going to happen with the pitch and until you end up playing on it.\"\n\nThe 3-0 win, which concluded less than three weeks ago, took England's winning run in T20s against Sri Lanka to 11.\n\nThere have been six UK prime ministers since England last lost to Sunday's opponents in the shortest format.\n\nSri Lanka's key bowlers Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana have also been ruled out with injury.\n\nAnd after Sri Lanka, England will face Pakistan before a meeting with New Zealand.\n\nThey have won their past three T20 series against Pakistan and beat the Black Caps last year. That was a rain-hit contest but in the one match completed, England racked up 236-4.\n\nThe favourable draw, set by the pre-seedings that have sent the four group winners into the other side of the Super 8 draw, means there will be no excuses should England fail to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nThat was the minimum requirement before this tournament began and relief at avoiding a group-stage exit should not hide that fact.\n\nEngland and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday, with managing director Rob Key to follow on Sunday.\n\nIt is described as a pre-planned trip rather than anything that should ramp up the pressure on coach Brendon McCullum, whose future remains in question after the Ashes debacle.\n\nThese may be three matches for McCullum to save his job – should he want to continue into the summer. Two wins would likely be enough to take England into the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and that noise would only ramp up again.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nI won't bat for myself to correct form - Buttler\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks",

Coach Morne Morkel said there is no talk of dropping him. Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting his game and advised him to build innings patiently. Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said Abhishek showed good form in the nets and should bounce back in the Super 8s.",
    "fullText": "Team India bowling coach Morne Morkel dismissed any talk of dropping him and said, \"Absolutely no discussion on Abhishek Sharma in the group. He is going to deliver, for the team and viewers. He is entertaining. He is hitting the ball well in the nets.\"\n\nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting the 25-year-old batter. He believes Abhishek is trying too hard to hit big shots from the first ball instead of settling in. \n\n“Abhishek Sharma is a lovely guy, but expectations seem to be weighing on him. If he had started well against the USA, it would have been different. Now, the pressure of being the big six-hitter and top batter is showing,\" Gavaskar said.\n\n\"With his shot range, he needs to spend time in the middle. He cannot try to hit a boundary or six on the first ball of his innings. If the big shots come, fine. But he shouldn’t force himself to play the big shots across the line,” he added.\n\nHe also advised Abhishek to start slowly and build his innings. \n\n“Take a single and get off the mark. Even four dot balls don’t matter. He can make up for them later. He needs to play smart. Spend an hour or two settling in, then play his natural game. First, just get off the mark. Every batter wants that first run. Once he gets it, everything will fall into place,” he added.\n\nAssistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate also backed Abhishek and said he showed good form in training after recovering from illness. \n\nHe said Abhishek batted well in the nets and should be fine in the next phase.\n\nWith India reaching the Super 8s, the team hopes Abhishek will regain confidence and perform when it matters most.",

The work is definitely there.\"\n\nAustralia's poor World Cup follows their 4-1 victory over England in the Ashes. They have not lost an Ashes series since 2015. They have won six 50-over World Cups but only one of the 10 men's T20 World Cups.\n\nThey lost bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood to injury before this tournament while left-armer Mitchell Starc has also retired from T20s, but their thinking often appeared muddled throughout the group stage here.\n\n\"The Australian public struggle with the fact they don't get to see much white-ball cricket played,\" said 33-year-old Zampa.\n\n\"We play three to six games in the summer and do a lot of our work away from Australian time.\n\n\"They don't get to see the way we play and prepare for these World Cups.\n\n\"It is disappointing it has ended like this but the work and time is as much as the other formats.\"\n\nZampa said he was \"feeling pretty hollow\" after the win over Oman.\n\nHe took four wickets but said it was the \"worst-feeling four-for I have ever got\".\n\nSeamer Xavier Bartlett bowled Aamir Kaleem with the first ball of the match and the seamer barely celebrated - a clear sign of Australia's disappointment at their early exit.\n\nThough the flat atmosphere continued, Australia were clinical. Wasim Ali's 32 was the highest score for Oman, who depart the tournament with four defeats from four.\n\nCaptain Marsh, seemingly keen to hit through any frustrations at his side's run, then crashed seven fours and four sixes, including two huge hits over the leg side, to wrap up victory in quick time.\n\nOnly 12 runs were needed when left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed dismissed Travis Head for 32. Marsh finished unbeaten on 64 from 33.\n\nAustralia's victory concludes the group stage of the World Cup - this was one of few mismatches between the lower and higher-ranked sides.\n\nThe Super 8s begin on Saturday with a meeting between New Zealand and Pakistan in Colombo.

    "description": "India's dominant T20 World Cup victory over Pakistan shattered digital records, attracting 163 million viewers, the highest ever for an ICC T20 World Cup match. Ishan Kishan's explosive 77 powered India to 175/7, a target Pakistan couldn't chase, falling for 114. This win secured India's Super Eight spot unbeaten.",
    "fullText": "The scintillating performance by the Men in Blue also contributed to a 56% growth in reach over the India-Pakistan clash during the 2024 edition. Fans tuned in for a whopping 20 billion minutes of total watch time across all screens, reflecting immense engagement.\n\nOn the field, India made a ruthless statement, comfortably defeating Pakistan by 61 runs to secure a place in the Super Eight stage unbeaten. After electing to field first, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s surprise move to bowl in the opening over produced an early wicket, dismissing Abhishek Sharma. But Ishan Kishan immediately turned the tide with a power-packed display, asserting dominance from the start. Pulling Shaheen Shah Afridi for a six on the first ball, Kishan continued to attack, supported by Tilak Varma as India racked up 52 for 1 after six overs, Kishan contributing 42 off just 25 balls.\n\nKishan’s blitz extended beyond the powerplay, hitting a 27-ball fifty and ending with a brilliant 77 off 40 balls, before being dismissed by Saim Ayub. Pakistan relied heavily on spin, using six spinners in the innings—the most ever by a team in a T20 World Cup and joint-most by a Full Member in a T20I. Saim Ayub impressed, removing Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya and finishing with 3 wickets for 25 runs, nearly claiming a hat-trick. India closed their innings at 175 for 7, bolstered by contributions from Suryakumar Yadav (32), Shivam Dube (27), and Rinku Singh (11).\n\nPakistan’s chase never gained traction. Hardik Pandya dismissed Shahibzada Farhan for a duck, followed by Saim Ayub and Jasprit Bumrah dismantling the middle order. Even Salman Ali Agha and Babar Azam faltered under pressure, while Usman Khan’s 44 off 34 balls was the only bright spark. India’s bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah (2/17), Axar Patel (2/29), and Varun Chakravarthy (2/16), ensured Pakistan was bowled out for 114 in 17.5 overs, sealing a one-sided victory.\n\nBrief Scores:\nIndia: 175/7 (Ishan Kishan 77, Suryakumar Yadav 32, Shivam Dube 27; Saim Ayub 3/25)\nPakistan: 114 all out (Usman Khan 44; Jasprit Bumrah 2/17, Axar Patel 2/29, Varun Chakravarthy 2/16)",

    "fullText": "England batter Jos Buttler says he will not just bat for himself as he tries to correct a poor run of form at the T20 World Cup.\n\nButtler, arguably England's greatest white-ball batter, was out for three against Scotland and Italy and has not scored a fifty in 14 international innings this winter.\n\nAfter the 35-year-old was dismissed fourth ball looking to clear the infield for the second match in a row against Italy, former captain Nasser Hussain suggested Buttler should take time to build an innings.\n\nBut, speaking on his For the Love of Cricket podcast, external, Buttler said: \"I would love to just bat for 15 overs but I don't want to bat for 15 overs just for myself and ignore the game.\n\n\"You've got to still play the game.\n\n\"There are times I've been out of form in Test cricket and the batting coach might say 'rein it in and bat for an hour'.\n\n\"In T20 you have got to keep playing the scoreboard.\"\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nButtler's last major contribution for England was 83 from 30 balls against South Africa in September but, given his illustrious career, his place in England's XI remains secure.\n\nHe scored 97 not out for Durban Super Giants in the SA20 in January but made 12, 20, 15, 22, three and one in his other innings there.\n\n\"I felt I was playing really well in the SA20 without getting scores,\" Buttler said. \"One thing I always pride myself on in T20 is if you get in, go and make a good contribution.\"\n\nButtler and England trained on Thursday for the first time since their win over Italy on Monday, after travelling to Sri Lanka.\n\nButtler had a lengthy regular net practice and then faced throw-downs from fielding coach Carl Hopkinson with a wet tennis ball on a soaked concrete strip - an apparent attempt to sharpen his reflexes.\n\nTeam-mate Jacob Bethell dismissed any doubts about the opener's form.\n\n\"He's fine,\" Bethell said. \"The options he has taken haven't come off but no one in that side is worried about Jos in terms of performance.\n\n\"He will come good when we need him in the big stages of this tournament.\"\n\nBethell trained with a bandage on a finger on his left hand. He suffered a cut during the defeat by West Indies and it has meant he has been unable to bowl.\n\nThe injury will be assessed again before England play co-hosts Sri Lanka in their first match of the Super 8s phase on Sunday in Pallekele.\n\nThey progressed through the group stage in unconvincing fashion with edgy wins over Italy, Scotland and Nepal, plus a defeat by West Indies, but before the World Cup they beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in a T20 series, with all three matches played in Pallekele.\n\n\"To beat a good Sri Lankan team at home in their conditions 3-0 was a massive confidence boost for us,\" Bethell said.\n\n\"You can feel it within the group the boys are confident coming back here.\n\n\"We know the conditions, we know how a couple of the teams are going to play. We're definitely, definitely very confident about this Super 8s.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Major League Soccer (MLS) kicks off its 31st season this weekend, ushering in another high-stakes campaign in a World Cup year.\n\nLionel Messi leads Inter Miami CF into the new term as they defend their 2025 MLS Cup crown against 29 rivals.\n\nIt has been 32 years since the United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, two years before the launch of MLS in 1996. Now, three decades later, MLS bids to become one of the world’s most exciting leagues.\n\nIn addition to Messi, several other elite stars are chasing the most prestigious piece of silverware in North American football, including LAFC’s Heung-min Son and Vancouver Whitecaps’ Thomas Muller.\n\nBoth are back for their first full season in MLS after making waves in their first campaign across the Atlantic upon arrival last summer.\n\nMLS has undergone profound changes since its inception in 1996, with all ten teams that launched the league towards the end of the 21st century still competing at the highest level.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that each of those ten sides has changed its name, crest, or both over time. MLS has been constantly evolving in recent decades, yet a historic change is on the horizon this time.\n\nMLS will stage its final full season under the traditional spring-to-fall format this year before switching to Europe’s summer-to-spring calendar in the summer of 2027.\n\nTo facilitate the transition, the league will introduce a shortened 14-game campaign from February to May next year before fully adopting the new schedule.\n\nFrom next season onwards, MLS will align its calendar with top European leagues such as the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, marking the beginning of a new era.\n\nOn February 22–23, MLS kicks off its “MLS Is Back” weekend, with all 30 clubs taking the field.\n\nReigning champions Inter Miami could not have imagined a more challenging way to kick off their title defence, as they head to BMO Stadium to take on star-studded LAFC on the opening weekend.\n\nJavier Mascherano’s charges will play their inaugural match at Miami Freedom Park on April 5 against Austin FC.\n\nWith the 2026 World Cup set to unfold on American soil, MLS pause its season from May 26 to July 16 to make room for the world’s most prestigious international tournament.\n\nSince 11 cities will host the event, a number of club training facilities will be taken over by participating national teams, forcing the league officials to schedule a mid-season break.\n\nOn July 17–18, MLS resumes competition with marquee rivalry fixtures, including a mouth-watering derby between Los Angeles Galaxy and LAFC at Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nOn July 30, MLS hosts the MLS All-Star Game in Charlotte.\n\nFinally, on November 7, Decision Day brings the regular season to a close as teams battle to secure play-off positioning.\n\nHistory beckons for Inter Miami as they could become only the third team in MLS history to win back-to-back titles following their maiden triumph last year.\n\nNeedless to say, all eyes will be on eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi, who reigned supreme during Inter’s title-winning campaign, bagging a jaw-dropping 35 goals in 34 league matches.\n\nMessi might be the Herons’ standout star, but Mascherano’s squad also features other high-profile names, like Sergio Busquets, Sergio Reguilon, Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nFurthermore, Inter shelled out $15 million to sign former Atletico Madrid striker German Berterame from CF Monterrey in January, further increasing an already intimidating firepower.\n\nIf there’s a side capable of challenging Inter’s dominance, it’s LAFC.\n\nSon’s arrival from Tottenham Hotspur last summer transformed Marc Dos Santos’ team into one of the deadliest attacking units in North American football, let alone MLS.\n\nThe South Korean megastar has forged a formidable partnership with Denis Bouanga. Together, they accounted for 25 goals and eight assists, emerging as the division’s most prolific duo alongside Messi and Suarez.\n\nBouanga and Son may no longer have to create chances for themselves alone after LAFC secured the services of Stephen Eustaquio from Porto earlier in February.\n\nIndeed, the skilled midfielder has moved to BMO Stadium on a season-long loan and will try to help the Black and Gold win the crown for the first time since 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Vancouver Whitecaps are bidding to replicate Toronto FC’s remarkable 2017 success and become the second Canadian franchise to lift the trophy.\n\nThough in the autumn of his illustrious playing career, Muller proved to be a game-changer for Jesper Sorensen’s side in the second half of last season, adding elite creativity and finishing touch to this exciting roster.\n\nMuller took MLS by storm upon arrival last summer, netting seven goals and adding three assists in seven appearances during the regular season to help his side reach the play-offs.\n\nDespite a 3-1 defeat to Inter in the grand final, the Whitecaps demonstrated they can compete with the league’s elite and will look to turn that painful lesson into fuel for a genuine title push in 2026.\n\nMessi has elevated MLS to another level since leaving Paris Saint-Germain to join Inter in 2023, and the 38-year-old icon looks set to remain the focal point of attention throughout the upcoming campaign.\n\nUnparalleled in his influence and output, La Pulga continues to set the standard across the league, and there’s no doubt that he will be the cornerstone of Inter’s title defence.\n\nWhile many players would settle for leaving in the shadow of Son, Bouanga has often found a way to outshine his more esteemed teammate, emerging as one of the league’s fiercest strikers.\n\nBouanga was unstoppable last season, tallying 26 goals and nine assists in 34 league games, and he will be the one to keep an eye on this year despite Son’s presence.\n\nIt’s a World Cup year, and a player who made his mark on football’s biggest international stage over a decade ago is perfectly poised to make his American soccer debut.\n\nJames Rodriguez is the man in question. The 36-year-old has joined Minnesota United following a lacklustre spell at Leon and will look to roll back the years after rising to global superstardom at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nA landmark change this year sees every MLS match available at no extra charge to Apple TV subscribers in over 100 countries — the standalone MLS Season Pass has been discontinued in favour of inclusion within the base streaming service, with no blackouts for viewers.\n\nOpening weekend highlights include a marquee Walmart Saturday Showdown clash between LAFC and Inter Miami at the iconic LA Memorial Coliseum, with traditional Sunday Night Soccer continuing the primetime slate.\n\nApple’s expanded coverage also introduces enhanced broadcasts and features like dynamic “Shot on iPhone” angles, aiming to deepen engagement across the regular season, Leagues Cup, All-Star Game, and Audi MLS Cup Playoffs, making 2026 a watershed year for global accessibility of MLS.\n\nFor more live streaming information, see our football live streaming page.",

    "fullText": "Clubs across the world are growing frustrated with FIFA over delays in distributing £185 million in promised solidarity payments from last summer’s Club World Cup, per The Guardian.\n\nFIFA had pledged that clubs that did not take part in the expanded tournament would still receive a share of the revenue, ensuring the benefits filtered down beyond the elite.\n\nHowever, more than seven months after the competition concluded, there is still no confirmed timeline for when the money will arrive or clarity on how it will be divided.\n\nThe total solidarity pot stands at £185m. If shared equally, it would equate to roughly £50,000 per top-flight club worldwide.\n\nWhile that figure may seem modest compared to the £740m in prize money distributed, with winners Chelsea earning around £84m, for many smaller clubs it could prove transformative.\n\nIn leagues where television deals are shrinking or even non-existent, a five-figure payment can be the difference between balancing the books and serious financial strain.\n\nExecutives from smaller European leagues say they have repeatedly sought answers from FIFA but have received no clear clarification on when funds will be released.\n\nThere is no suggestion that FIFA will not pay the money. Instead, the delay appears to stem from ongoing discussions over how to split the £185m between the six continental confederations.\n\nRepresentation at the Club World Cup varied, complicating attempts to create a fair formula. Also, several confederations lack established systems for distributing such funds.\n\nIn Europe, UEFA is expected to use a model similar to its existing solidarity payments for clubs that miss out on the group stages of European competition.\n\nBut until final figures are agreed, no distribution can begin.\n\nThe tournament’s last-minute funding arrangements have not helped.\n\nA £787m broadcast deal with DAZN was only finalised months before kick-off, leaving little time to establish a detailed pay-out structure.\n\nFor football’s smaller clubs, the wait continues and patience is wearing thin.",

    "fullText": "England‘s group stage at the T20 World Cup was a mixed bag - some good but overall unconvincing.\n\nSam Curran and Will Jacks have provided reasons to be positive but Jos Buttler‘s tricky start is a concern.\n\nWe have taken a look into the numbers behind his struggles and the other themes of England’s first four matches…\n\nScores of three against both Italy and Scotland mean Buttler made only 53 runs across the group stage – a low return for one of England's key men.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a quiet winter with no fifties in 15 international innings across all formats, though a 97 not out in the SA20 in January casts doubt on those writing him off entirely.\n\nButtler's dismissals against Italy and Scotland were almost identical.\n\nLooking for his first boundary from his fourth ball, he miscued a length ball in the off-stump channel to mid-off.\n\n\"Maybe he is trying too hard to get a score on the board,\" said Buttler's former England team-mate Dawid Malan.\n\n\"The last two innings he has played, he has tried to hit the ball over mid-on.\n\n\"Knowing him and playing with him, his gameplan is generally to look to the off side first and then pick up leg side, so maybe he's just going back to his basics.\n\n\"I don't think we have to worry.\"\n\nAll three of his dismissals against pace, including nicking off against Nepal seamer Nandan Yadav, have come against balls clocked between 75-82mph.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Buttler has struggled against pace bowlers in that bracket more than any other – with an average of 35.8 and a strike-rate of 129.\n\nPerhaps more concerningly, given the tournament now returns to the turning tracks of Sri Lanka, his average against spin in T20 internationals has dropped to 24.1 since 2024 from 61.8 across the two years prior.\n\nButtler's other dismissal in this tournament came against Roston Chase's off-spin.\n\nEven with making 202-7 against Italy, there remains a feeling England's batting is yet to fully fire at this tournament.\n\nThey posted 184-7 against Nepal, were bowled out for 166 by West Indies and wobbled when chasing 153 in their victory over the Scots.\n\nThe problem has not been batters getting in.\n\nEnglishmen have reached 25 runs 14 times so far – the most of any team in the competition – but only four of those knocks have been converted into fifties. No England player has made a score above 75.\n\nWill Jacks rejected the notion this is due to batters failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Responsibility in T20 can be misunderstood,\" he said. \"Sometimes the responsibility is to try and hit 30 off the over.\"\n\nMalan believes The Hundred may be having an impact.\n\n\"There's more emphasis on the first 10 overs now, so if you lose wickets in those first 10 overs then it makes it harder towards the end, but you still need to keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"I used to always worry more about the second 10 overs, so it was about setting things up and then being able to get to that 180 or 190-mark, if the score and wicket dictated it.\n\n\"A lot of these players are playing in The Hundred which is less balls, meaning you have to keep going earlier, and it doesn't really teach you to soak up the pressure for an over or two.\"\n\nCaptain Harry Brook has now got out against spin in three innings in a row after beginning the tournament with 53 against Nepal.\n\nThis is a familiar issue for Brook, who averages 47 against pace in T20 internationals since the start of 2024 but only 23.5 against spin.\n\nBrook's struggles are curious, given his stunning 136 not out on a turning pitch in a one-day international in Sri Lanka last month.\n\nThe return to Sri Lanka for the Super 8s may help Brook because in India he is averaging 20.5 in T20s.\n\nCould Harry Brook struggle in that department then?\n\n“It has probably been his weakness but, saying that, when you bat at four, five or six in T20 cricket and you're walking in at the ninth or 10th over, the majority of balls you are going to face are spin,” Malan said.\n\n“If he is out there for eight overs and he is facing six overs of spin, there is a high chance he's going to get out against spin after starting against spin.\n\n“He changed his technique at the beginning of the year to become better at spin.\n\n“He keeps his bat on the floor for longer whereas he used to stay up.”\n\nOne of the positives of this World Cup so far has been Jacks' promising returns as England's finisher.\n\nHis 39 not out from 18 balls in the four-run win over Nepal was crucial – so too his maiden T20 international fifty against Italy from the tricky position of 101-5.\n\nJacks only took on the finishers' role at the start of last summer but is faring well compared to others before him.\n\nJacks' bowling is more of a concern, however.\n\nWith leg-spinner Adil Rashid, plus two left-arm spinners in Liam Dawson and Jacob Bethell, in the squad, Jacks' bowling role is more significant given he turns the ball in the other direction as an off-spinner.\n\nIt is problematic for England that his six overs have cost 83 runs with two wickets in return.\n\nJacks has struggled most when being swept, conceding 31 runs from eight sweep shots in the group stage.\n\nThough his average amount of turn is only down slightly, 3.5 degrees in the pre-tournament series in Sri Lanka compared to 3.3, Jacks is drifting the ball far less - 1 degree compared to 1.7 degrees in Sri Lanka.\n\nSam Curran came through twice when England were under the most pressure during the group stage.\n\nAgainst Nepal, he successfully defended 10 from the last over.\n\nWhen Italy and Grant Stewart were flying in Monday, Curran stopped the runs and then dismissed the right-hander.\n\nCurran, who was out of favour until September last year, has taken on the role of England's death bowler to good effect.\n\nHe has been especially effective with yorkers – going at 5.07 runs per over with a full length at the death, compared to 14.14 with anything shorter.\n\nCurran is often credited with having a canny mix of slower balls but he has largely kept his pace above 80mph in those crucial final stages.\n\nMore significant has been his control of line…",

Any points for the African side would knock Australia out of the competition.\n\nClearly, no-one told Marsh that when it comes to Irish luck in a cricketing context, rain is never far away. The two sides shared the points after wet weather saw the match abandoned without a ball bowled. Zimababwe through, Australia gone.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, there will not be an Australian side in the Super 8s stage or equivalent. Since winning it in 2021, this edition marks a third consecutive T20 World Cup without Australia in the semi-finals.\n\nLess than a month on from wrapping up a resounding Ashes drubbing, Australia's T20 side has failed to hit similar heights. The failings of this competition, which has seen them play all of their group games in Sri Lanka, alongside a wider slump in this format, does little to discard the notion that T20 cricket is not a priority.\n\nAs always after a difficult tournament, selection is questioned. Steve Smith has long been out of this side, not appearing in almost two years. A century and two 50s in the recent Big Bash were not enough to earn a recall. Not until Marsh was hit in the groin in training prior to Australia's first game against Ireland.\n\nSmith was summoned to acclimatise in Colombo in case he was required. He ultimately was, but not as a replacement for Marsh.\n\nAustralia's Test run machine eventually earned a place in the squad proper when the selectors belatedly named a replacement for Josh Hazlewood, who was ruled out of the competition before a ball was bowled.\n\nAll those moving parts for a player who only made it onto the park as a sub fielder while Australia were still mathematically alive, with Smith powerless to stop Sri Lanka and Pathum Nissanka's charge.\n\nThe decision to drop Matthew Renshaw for that defeat also reads as confusing. His 37 off 33 balls against Ireland was slow, but the Ireland camp highlighted how impressed they were given the tricky nature of the pitch. Next time out, Renshaw's 65 off 44 fell short of match-winning status against Zimbabwe.\n\nDropping him against Sri Lanka backfired. After Travis Head and Marsh's opening partnership of 104 off 8.3 overs, Australia looked well set. They lost the next three wickets for 26 runs, the middle order appearing to lack the stability previously provided by Renshaw.\n\n\"The reaction back home has been rather heavy because I think we've been sold down the stream a little bit in terms of our selection and how we've gone about preparing for this T20 World Cup,\" Australia's two-time 50-over World Cup winner Matthew Hayden told Test Match Special.\n\n\"It sort of smacks of England, and their questions in the Ashes preparation - this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of 'we're OK' and 'no, don't worry'. It's a mix of denial and maybe even just mismanagement.\n\n\"We enjoy coming to countries like Sri Lanka but we just haven't prepared for what we've seen. We've picked power hitters in finesse type conditions.\n\n\"[It's] almost like stubbornness but there is a plan A. And that plan A is called power. And it's a day and age of power. In India, that's certainly the case.\n\n\"These conditions [in Sri Lanka], though, are different. They're not such pure batting surfaces, and that requires methodology. It almost requires a bit more of an old school approach and way of thinking about the game that allows you to stay in the contest.\"\n\nAustralia's fast-bowling depth behind the big three of Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc looks strong in red-ball cricket. Just ask England.\n\nIn white-ball cricket, though, it's a different story. Starc has retired from the format while Cummins and Hazelwood are injured. It says plenty that, instead of calling up a bowler immediately once the latter went down, they waited until mid-tournament to call up Smith, a batter.\n\nWord from within the camp refuses to dwell too much on muddled selection or lack of depth.\n\n\"Looking down our list, honestly, it feels like there's more than enough talent to look after the situations in the games that we're playing,\" said Marsh after the Sri Lanka defeat.\n\n\"As much as we can talk about team line-up and who's in, who's out and that sort of thing, I think if everyone just looks after their role it should help [put] us in good stead.\"\n\nAll-rounder Cameron Green, who became the Indian Premier League's most expensive overseas signing when he was picked up for more than £2m by Kolkata Knight Riders in December, was criticised by Hayden having struggled to make an impact despite batting at number three.\n\n\"Cam Green has just looked awful with the bat,\" said Hayden. \"He looks woody, he looks tinny, he looks like he's just a man with no confidence, and I'd be very surprised if that's not exactly the case.\n\n\"Matt Renshaw has come with no baggage to this tournament. He actually had a really good series back home in Australia in the ODIs. He's been a man that's been very ill treated - there's no doubt he should be in the Test team too.\"\n\nThere is a wider question on Australia's cultural attitudes towards T20.\n\nWhile Big Bash crowds are healthy, this tournament has taken place at a difficult time for fans back home to watch. Only one Australian journalist has travelled to cover the team in Sri Lanka, reflecting how editors view the levels of public interest.\n\nIn that context, it seems easy to question to what extent this competition has been prioritised. Even if injuries ruled out players such as Cummins and Hazlewood, other senior players were told to prioritise the Big Bash finals instead of heading on the warm-up tour to Pakistan prior to this week's failing.\n\n\"Cricket Australia needs to have a look at their schedule, and they need to be able to manage their number one and primary resource, which is cricket talent,\" said Hayden.\n\n\"[They need to] find a way to just be a little more controlled, and a little more destined and built towards the purpose of Australian cricket.\"\n\nBefore that, however, Australia have one match remaining in this competition, against Oman on Friday.\n\nA dead rubber, the kind of match usually more associated with England in the Ashes.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Oli Burke insists he has given little thought to a Scotland recall for the World Cup and is simply focusing on doing well for Union Berlin in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe 28-year-old joined Union on a long-term contract in the summer and has scored four goals this season, including a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\n\"I'm just focused on my football here and what happens, happens really,\" Burke, who earned the last of his 13 caps in 2020, said.\n\n\"I've not really thought too much on it. Obviously, I know there's a World Cup coming up, but I've not really been a part of it recently.\n\n\"I'm not really expecting anything. I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying football again, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n\"If I can, hopefully, do some good performances, score some more goals and hopefully that is catching the eye a little bit and gives me a chance, at least.\n\n\"Obviously, it's an absolute honour to wear the badge and represent your country. It's such a privilege. Obviously, I would really love that again and to have that experience again.\n\n\"I cannot think too much on that. I have to just stay focused and do the best I can here and see what happens.\"\n\nBurke is in his third spell in Germany, having made his first move to the Bundesliga in 2016, when he joined RB Leipzeg from Nottingham Forest for what was then a record fee for a Scottish player of £13m.\n\n\"I was young, the price tag, I didn't really know too much about it,\" he recalled. \"I didn't really understand it so much at that age. As I got older, it started to weigh a little bit.\n\n\"In football, everything happens quickly. You have your good moments and then there can be bad moments.\n\n\"It's been kind of like this throughout my career. Many ups and many downs.\"\n\nBurke, who joined Union from Werder Bremen, says the experience he has in Germany has developed him.\n\n\"I almost feel like a different player, but obviously that comes with maturing,\" he said. \"Knowing your job better and being more effective in your role, defensively as well.\n\n\"It's just about adapting really.\"\n\nIn 2019, Burke had a spell on loan to Celtic, who play Stuttgart on Thursday in the Europa League play-off, and he is predicting a difficult tie for his former club.\n\n\"Stuttgart are not an easy team,\" he said. \"They're doing brilliantly this season.\n\n\"Celtic are an amazing club. I love the club. I still watch here and there.\n\n\"I watched the Kilmarnock game the other day. I was saying to my wife 'they're going to score in the last minute' because it's just Celtic typical.\"\n\nKirkcaldy-born Burke also had a stint with Alaves in Spain after his time with Celtic.\n\n\"When you move abroad, it's also important to try and embed yourself into the culture quickly and become close with your team-mates as fast as you can,\" he added.\n\n\"Create a bond, not just on the pitch but off it as well, so that you feel more comfortable and you feel more at home.\"",

    "fullText": "England captain Leah Williamson returns to the squad for the first time since Euro 2025 as they prepare to begin their 2027 Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWilliamson, 28, missed England's friendly victories over China, Ghana and Australia as well as their defeat by Brazil at the end of 2025 due to a knee injury.\n\nThe Arsenal defender had surgery after lifting England's second successive European title in July and returned to action at the start of December.\n\n\"I'm very happy. It feels really good for her too. She has trained lots and I'm in close contact with her and the club,\" said manager Sarina Wiegman.\n\n\"There are more players who are still building and that is one of the reasons why we went with a bigger squad.\"\n\nSeveral big names return to the squad including Chelsea forward Lauren James, Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\n\nJames, 24, was absent for four months with an ankle injury before returning in November and is now back to full fitness.\n\nShe impressed in Sunday's win over Liverpool and boosts Wiegman's attacking options with Arsenal's Beth Mead out with a fractured shin.\n\nGreenwood, 32, missed the start of the season with a knee injury while Hampton had a thigh issue which ruled her out of the November camp.\n\nThere is a first senior call-up for London City Lionesses defender Poppy Pattinson, while uncapped 20-year-old Freya Godfrey retains her place in the squad.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck also earns a recall, with Manchester City's Khiara Keating dropping out of the squad.\n\n\"[Roebuck] came in the last camp of course because we had some injuries. She has got some minutes [with Villa] so it's really good to see her back, see her happy and being available. She is playing and training fully,\" added Wiegman.\n\n\"Keating will be with the under-23s. We all know she is a very talented goalkeeper. I had big concerns about her playing minutes over this last season.\n\n\"It's a long period of time. There is also competition with the other goalkeepers.\"\n\nGotham FC defender Jess Carter is back after she was given time to recover from the conclusion of the National Women's Soccer League play-offs in November.\n\nEngland are without Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, who is out with a hip injury until the end of March.\n\nBay FC defender Anouk Denton, 22, who made her debut as a late substitute in December, is not included in the squad.\n\nThe Lionesses travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThey are the first competitive games since England's success in Switzerland and they will meet reigning world champions Spain later in their qualifying group.\n\nThere are eight international windows before England hope to travel to Brazil for the World Cup between 24 June and 25 July 2027.\n\n\"It's a new year with new objectives as we start our qualification journey with these two very important fixtures against Ukraine and Iceland,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"This is new opposition for this England team, so that's exciting too. I am looking forward to being back with the squad and getting back to work.\"\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nLondon City Lionesses defender Pattinson has featured for England's youth teams and is the latest to make the jump up to the senior squad.\n\nShe follows in the footsteps of team-mate Godfrey, who is yet to make her debut having been selected for the friendlies against Ghana and China.\n\nWiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to watch Pattinson in London City Lionesses' 2-1 defeat by Manchester United and delivered the news of her England call-up this week.\n\n\"It was a short conversation but she was really happy and really grateful. She can't wait to come in so that was a nice phone call,\" Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"She deserved the call-up because she has played really well. What we have seen the most is that she is very proactive and takes a lot of initiative.\n\n\"She can cover the whole wing on the left side. At the same time, she wants to play forward and is looking for passes forward which I thought was really good.\n\n\"Although she is not the tallest, she does use her body well in defence. Let's see how she relates to the other players we have in the squad.\"\n\nGoalkeepers: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride), Ellie Roebuck (Aston Villa)\n\nDefenders: Lucy Bronze (Chelsea), Jess Carter (Gotham), Grace Fisk (Liverpool), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Manchester United), Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit), Taylor Hinds (Arsenal), Poppy Pattinson (London City Lionesses), Leah Williamson (Arsenal)\n\nMidfielders: Grace Clinton (Manchester City), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Keira Walsh (Chelsea), Laura Blindkilde Brown (Manchester City), Lucia Kendell (Aston Villa)\n\nForwards: Chloe Kelly (Arsenal), Lauren James (Chelsea), Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea), Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Lauren Hemp (Manchester City), Freya Godfrey (London City Lionesses), Jess Park (Manchester United)",

    "fullText": "CHENNAI, India (AP) — Canada won the toss Tuesday and elected to bat against a New Zealand lineup targeting a spot in the Super 8s at the T20 World Cup.\n\nStand-in captain Daryl Mitchell said regular skipper Mitchell Santner is sick and will miss the game because he “had a dodgy burger last night.”\n\nCole McConchie replaced Santner as a like-for-like replacement in the XI.\n\nNew Zealand was forced into another change with Kyle Jamieson coming in for pace bowler Lockie Ferguson, who returned home for the birth of his first child. Ferguson is scheduled to rejoin the team during the Super 8s.\n\nA third win in Group D would seal New Zealand’s place in the next round alongside South Africa, England, West Indies, India and Sri Lanka. New Zealand started the tournament with victories against Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates before losing to South Africa.\n\nCanada has never played a T20 international against New Zealand. But in the one-day international format, the Black Cups have won all three previous matches against Canada.\n\nCanada is last in the group following losses to United Arab Emirates and South Africa and will be knocked out of the tournament if it loses to New Zealand.\n\nLater Tuesday, Zimbabwe is aiming for a win over Ireland that would also knock 2021 champion Australia out in the first round of the tournament for the first time since 2009. Nepal, which has lost all its three group games, is rounding out its T20 World Cup campaign against Scotland.\n\nCanada: Yuvraj Samra, Dilpreet Bajwa (captain), Navneet Dhaliwal, Harsh Thaker, Nicholas Kirton, Shreyas Movva, Saad Bin Zafar, Shivam Sharma, Dilon Heyliger, Jaskaran Singh, Ansh Patel.\n\nNew Zealand: Tim Seifert, Finn Allen, Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Daryl Mitchell (captain), Cole McConchie, James Neesham, Kyle Jamieson, Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy.\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",

    "description": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup begins. So what changes could we see?",
    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "England narrowly avoided a disaster in their final T20 World Cup group match against Italy on Monday.\n\nHarry Brook won the toss and controversially decided to bat first at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\nEngland were 105/5 after a shaky opening 13 overs before Will Jacks rescued the innings with an unbeaten 53 from 22 balls.\n\nItaly then battled back from 22/3 to 135/4 in their run chase, making the England players and fans nervous.\n\nHowever, the Italians ultimately collapsed to 178 all out, and the Three Lions qualified for the Super 8s.\n\nBrook made an interesting comment about England’s performance in his post-match interview, which many will disagree with.\n\nHarry Brook has every reason to be pleased with his team’s progression into the last eight of the competition.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to suggest that England’s performance against Italy was anything to be proud of.\n\nItaly are the 26th-ranked team in the ICC T20I Team Rankings, so it should never have been a close contest.\n\nThat is why it was so surprising to hear Brook’s claim that England bowled well on Monday.\n\n“I thought we fielded excellently, and we bowled nicely as well,” he said. “I never had a doubt at the end with Sam [Curran] and Jamie [Overton]. Sam has been awesome, and he has been throughout this comp so far.\n\n“When Jof is on a heater, you want to get as much out of as possible – he did that today in his first couple of overs.”\n\nWithout question, England will need to bowl much better in the next stage of the tournament if they want to make the semi-finals.\n\nWhile Brook praised England’s bowlers, he did recognise that their batting unit must improve quickly.\n\n“We haven’t played our best cricket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we have made it through, and we’re heading to Sri Lanka, so we can be happy about that.\n\n“A little bit of a trend in this competition. We have not managed to string along the score as we like to do as a batting unit. We have got to keep on being brave and taking our options.”\n\n202 would normally be an excellent T20 score, but England would have hoped for at least 220 against cricket minnows Italy.\n\nBen Stokes finally has a rude awakening about importance of helmets in cricket\n\nMatthew Renshaw’s scathing interview reveals main culprit behind Australia’s disastrous loss vs. Zimbabwe\n\nSir Geoffrey Boycott reignites Joe Root debate after England’s T20 World Cup loss to West Indies",
