If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have played these matches because of this knee problem.\"\n\nInjuries have limited Brazil's all-time top scorer, who has netted 79 goals in 128 appearances, from featuring for the national side since a defeat by Uruguay in October 2023.\n\nIn October this year, Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward must regain full fitness and be in form to be recalled to his squad for next summer's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States.",

    "fullText": "Wales head coach Craig Bellamy is looking forward to renewing his rivalry with Canada counterpart Jesse Marsch if he can lead his team to the World Cup.\n\nIf Wales win their play-off semi-final and final in March, they will be in Group B alongside co-hosts Canada, as well as Switzerland and Qatar at next summer's tournament in North America.\n\nThe opening fixture between Canada and Wales in Toronto will be a grudge match of sorts, after an ill-tempered finish to their friendly in September.\n\nBellamy was unhappy with the way former Leeds United boss Marsch and his coaches celebrated their 1-0 win before the final whistle in Swansea, while the Canadian players and their manager were exuberant in their celebrations afterwards.\n\nBellamy said after the game, \"I hope I see you [Marsch and Canada] at the World Cup\" and, following Friday's extravagant, long-winded draw in Washington DC, he could have his wish next June.\n\n\"I watched a little bit of the World Cup draw but not much. I think I got lost after the first 20 minutes and I think I came back to it about five hours later,\" the former Liverpool and Manchester City forward joked.\n\n\"I always have that on my mind. Just get there first. We've got to get there first but, if that is the case, then we [Marsch and Bellamy] will definitely have a nice conversation before that as well.\n\n\"I've got nothing against that guy, by the way, I think he's got something against the world. There's a part of me that really likes him from afar without really knowing him.\n\n\"But some of the things he says, you see his interviews before the other games after playing us... I think I find him very interesting.\"",

It will be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves,\" said chief tournament officer Manolo Zubiria.\n\n\"Obviously, if there's an injury [stoppage] at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee.\"",
