    "fullText": "The T20 World Cup heads into the final week of group-stage fixtures with six spots in the Super 8s still up for grabs.\n\nWest Indies were the first team to qualify for the next phase, while India joined them with victory over Pakistan later on Sunday.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams need to progress to the next stage.\n\nThe top two teams in each group - A to D - will progress to the Super 8s, which will be made up of two groups of four.\n\nIf any teams are level on points after the four group-stage fixtures, they will be separated by number of wins and then net run-rate.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has pre-determined the Super 8 groups if the eight seeded sides qualify:\n\nX Group: India (X1), Australia (X2), West Indies (X3), South Africa (X4)\n\nY Group: England (Y1), New Zealand (Y2), Pakistan (Y3), Sri Lanka (Y4)\n\nIf any of those sides do not progress, the teams who do in their place will just fill the spot.\n\nEach team plays three more matches in the Super 8s phase, facing each of the other teams in their group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8s group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nRemaining games: Pakistan v Namibia (18 Feb, 09:30) and India v Netherlands (18 Feb, 13:30)\n\nDefending champions India sealed their place in the Super 8s with a comfortable 61-run win over rivals Pakistan.\n\nPakistan slipped to third with that defeat, with their net run-rate taking a heavy hit.\n\nHowever, a win in their final game against Namibia on Wednesday would see them progress.\n\nUSA have played all of their games and are currently second but need Pakistan to lose their final game and for the Netherlands to lose or not overtake their net run-rate if they win.\n\nThe Netherlands must beat India, hope Pakistan lose and then it could come down to net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: Australia v Sri Lanka (16 Feb, 13:30), Ireland v Zimbabwe (17 Feb 09:30 GMT), Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe (19 Feb, 09:30), Australia v Oman (20 Feb, 13:30)\n\nSri Lanka will progress with a win over Australia on Monday. If they lose they would likely need to beat Zimbabwe and then it could come down to net run-rate. Two wins would guarantee progression.\n\nAustralia would be eliminated if they lose to Sri Lanka on Monday and Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday. They may need to win both their remaining games and rely on net run-rate.\n\nZimbabwe will guarantee progression with two wins. One win potentially may be enough but it would come down to net run-rate.\n\nIreland need to win their last match and hope other results go their way because they can only qualify on net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: England v Italy (16 Feb, 09:30), Scotland v Nepal (17 Feb, 13:30), West Indies v Italy (19 Feb, 05:30)\n\nWest Indies secured their progression with a nine-wicket win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\nEngland must beat Italy on Monday to progress. A defeat would likely see them eliminated on net run-rate.\n\nScotland need to beat Nepal and hope Italy beat England but do not overtake their net run-rate.\n\nItaly must beat England but could lose to West Indies and then net run-rate would decide who progresses. Two wins would see them through, as would a win against England and a washed-out game against West Indies.\n\nRemaining games: Afghanistan v UAE (16 Feb, 05:30 GMT), New Zealand v Canada (17 Feb, 05:30 GMT), South Africa v UAE (18 Feb, 05:30 GMT), Afghanistan v Canada (19 Feb, 13:30 GMT)\n\nSouth Africa are in a strong position to progress and their spot could be sealed on Monday if UAE lose to Afghanistan. Regardless of that result, a win against UAE on Wednesday would confirm their progression.\n\nNew Zealand likely need to win and hope that UAE do not win both of their games. If both of those things happen then net run-rate would decide who moves through.\n\nUAE likely need to win both of their remaining games and even then are likely to be relying on net run-rate to progress.\n\nAfghanistan need to win both of their matches, including one against UAE, and hope that neither UAE or New Zealand pick up points in their final game.\n\nCanada need to win both their remaining fixtures and will need other results to go their way.\n\nRun-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nThe winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate.\n\nIn a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game.\n\nIf a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 20 overs in the case of this tournament.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group A, Colombo\n\nIndia 175-7 (20 overs): Kishan 77 (40); Ayub 3-25\n\nPakistan 114 (18 overs): Usman 44 (34); Hardik 2-16, Chakravarthy 2-17, Bumrah 2-17\n\nIndia continued their recent on-field dominance over Pakistan by winning their highly anticipated meeting in Colombo by 61 runs to confirm their place in the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion and doubt over whether the match would even go ahead, India ultimately proved too strong and sealed a ninth successive win in completed matches against their rivals.\n\nAlthough the captains did not shake hands at the toss and there were no exchanges between the players after the final play, the rest of the match passed without any flashpoints amid the ongoing political tensions between the two nations and last year's military conflict.\n\nThe encounter was effectively won by a brutal early assault by India opener Ishan Kishan, who struck 77 from 40 balls on a tricky, turning pitch.\n\nIt gave co-hosts a flying start and meant, even with Pakistan's plethora of spinners slowing the scoring and taking wickets, they still posted 175-7.\n\nThat always felt a challenging total and Hardik Pandya took a wicket in the first over of the chase and Jasprit Bumrah two in the second to all but confirm the result.\n\nUsman Khan struck some blows in making 44 but Pakistan were swept aside - all out for 114 in 18 overs.\n\nWhile India are now certain to progress as they attempt to retain the title won in 2024, Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday to guarantee their place in the Super 8s.\n\nShould they do so, the rivals could yet meet again in this competition in a semi-final or final.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nFor a while it looked like this match would not happen.\n\nPakistan, whose last win against India was at the Asia Cup in 2022, announced a boycott a week before the tournament began, only to reverse their decision at the start of this week after extensive talks.\n\nIt went ahead, in front of a large crowd weighted towards Indian blue, because it is the most lucrative fixture in the world game, providing the funds upon which cricket's ecosystem survives in its current imperfect state.\n\nHow long that remains the case given India's dominance, built from their cricketing and financial might, remains to be seen.\n\nKishan's assault gave India breathing space and their bowlers were ruthless, even if their fielders dropped three catches.\n\nAfter Pakistan's seamers went the distance, Hardik began with a wicket maiden - dismissing right-hander Sahibzada Farhan, who skewed a pull shot high to mid-on.\n\nIn the next over, the majestic Bumrah pinned left-hander Saim Ayub in front with full inswinger, before Pakistan Salman Agha holed out playing a wild slog.\n\nEven Pakistan's biggest name, Babar Azam, was tamely bowled for five attempting a swipe to left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the fifth over, while left-handers Mohammed Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf meekly picked out fielders in the deep.\n\nAfter all of the build-up this was another underwhelming meeting.\n\nKishan's innings was an outlier across the match. He scored at a strike-rate of 192.50 per 100 balls. Only one other batter to face more than five deliveries, Shivam Dube - who made 27 from 17 balls - went at more than 130.\n\nOf the first 88 runs in the match, 77 came off the bat of Kishan as he made his second 50 in a row at this World Cup.\n\nHe was fortunate to chip three swings into gaps but otherwise hit cleanly in all directions until he was bowled by Ayub in the ninth over.\n\nSwitching through six different spinners, Pakistan's fightback came too late with mystery spinner Usman Tariq held back too long.\n\nAyub had Tilak Verma lbw for a stodgy 25 from 24 balls before Hardik hit his next ball to long-off. Had Ayub's hat-trick ball not narrowly missed Dube's edge and stumps after turning sharply, Pakistan may have had a better chance.\n\nTheir decision to bowl first also seemed a misstep, with the ball skidding through later on.\n\nDube was left to push India beyond 150 which was probably a par total in the conditions.\n\nIn truth, little went right for Pakistan.",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses the potential long-term impact of England's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, and the challenge of facing Ireland at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.\n\nI can easily reel off the losses that stuck with me in the Six Nations, as they can take you to a really dark place at times.\n\nScotland 2000, Ireland 2001 and France 2002 - they all still hurt.\n\nI was involved in all those campaigns and came up short of a Grand Slam by one victory three consecutive times.\n\nIt is important now to take stock and remember that defeat will happen again at some point before the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland will lick their wounds after yet another crushing defeat by Scotland, but even if a potential Grand Slam has gone, they still have a championship to play for.\n\nThe chance to win a Grand Slam does not come around very often, and that is the reality.\n\nLast week I said it would be foolish to draw a straight line from the opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider in Paris.\n\nThis tournament is magical for exactly that reason.\n\nTwo wins and England will be in a position to go to Paris and perhaps try to win the championship.\n\nThere is plenty to focus on and be excited about, and that Murrayfield pain will make England a better team.\n\nBig away wins are not easy in the Six Nations, and Saturday is another one that eluded Steve Borthwick.\n\nIt is not just about winning on another pitch as the World Cup is on neutral soil in Australia.\n\nIt is about the different feeling outside the Twickenham environment and home comforts.\n\nAs impressive as the 12-game winning run was, England still need that South African mentality - wherever you go in the world, you are expected to win and be globally successful.\n\nBorthwick is still yet to travel to Scotland, Ireland or France in the Six Nations and win.\n\nMost adversity comes from playing away from home, and Saturday gave the England players more of those scenarios.\n\nIt is very unlikely they will win a World Cup without a statement away victory beforehand.\n\nThere is a lot happening in these high-pressure games, and for high-paced players it is happening more quickly both physically and mentally.\n\nUnfortunately for Henry Arundell, who was being ultra-competitive, you have to read situations like the one when he took out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nEngland found themselves in a position where they were not playing well and were losing the scraps.\n\nIn those situations, you need clarity as well as competitiveness, and a red card obviously does not help to swing the momentum back.\n\nThat decision has cost England dearly and, given how competitive that wing slot is, I am sure Borthwick is going to have to manage that scenario.\n\nHenry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision.\n\nWhat if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game?\n\nYou have to make good decisions under pressure. Being in those situations more often will help players learn.\n\nSix Nations: Scotland regain the Calcutta Cup\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nEngland will be licking their lips at the opportunity to bounce back against Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWe know England can perform with the comfort of home support, so it is not about putting things right - that will come in games in Rome and Paris.\n\nIt is about building on what they did prior to the Scotland game. Sometimes you have to park a game, write it off and move on.\n\nI thought I had seen England drift away from the kick-heavy style and strategy.\n\nScotland put on an attacking masterclass, whereas when England did attack it felt like they were punching for their lives but not actually landing anything.\n\nThey lacked shape, going left and right without making any progress - like a boxer on the ropes punching for their life but not actually hitting anything.\n\nGeorge Ford's failed drop-goal felt like a last-ditch option, which then resulted in what Borthwick described as a 10-point swing.\n\nI do not think you can blame Ford, the sequence was not set up properly and it felt like tired minds all over the place.\n\nDealing with a fast and furious game is, once again, a learning curve to take forward.\n\nTwo years ago there was plenty of talk that Ireland were going to beat England by 30 points at Twickenham.\n\nIt was such a mismatch in terms of where both sides were in their development.\n\nMarcus Smith's late drop-goal denied Ireland a potential Grand Slam, and that was a huge moment in Borthwick's tenure.\n\nNow England come in as favourites - it is amazing how quickly the landscape changes.\n\nHaving lost badly against France and nearly drawn against Italy, Ireland will be annoyed that everyone is writing them off.\n\nThey are a well-motivated team under Andy Farrell and are very well drilled.\n\nIreland will come out and probably play their best game of the campaign.\n\nScotland, in the space of a week, turned their disappointing loss in Rome into a convincing display against England.\n\nThat is how quickly things can change.\n\nDefeat next weekend and the pressure builds on England, with two difficult away fixtures to finish.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win",

They were ultimately punished for not taking advantage of the platform set by captain Richie Berrington's 49, which had his side 113-3 in the 13th over.\n\nAdil Rashid overcame an expensive start to finish with 3-36 for England, while an improved Jofra Archer took two wickets in the powerplay and finished with 2-23.\n\nIt means England will confirm their place in the Super 8s by beating Italy on Monday.\n\nScotland play Nepal in their final group match on Tuesday but may have been eliminated by other results by then.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nHaving been lucky to escape against Nepal and been convincingly beaten by West Indies, England are still searching for a complete performance at this World Cup.\n\nThey have won World Cups before despite group-stage defeats but improvement is needed if they are to threaten the best in this tournament.\n\nScotland's opening bowling consisted of Brandon McMullen and Brad Currie's medium pace. They found far more movement than England's bowlers and Salt and Buttler sliced catches to the off-side ring for two and three respectively.\n\nThere were no boundaries off the bat in the first four overs.\n\nBethell brought some calm with his patient knock but England were ultimately grateful to Banton who had not lived up to his talents in his previous 36 internationals.\n\nUnlike Bethell, who was caught trying to help a scoop over short fine leg, and Brook - dismissed in the same fashion - Banton played straight and as a result looked more comfortable than any other batter.\n\nHe took only six from his first 10 deliveries and did not hit a boundary until his 11th.\n\nCurran hit two sixes to accelerate England towards the finish line and Will Jacks hit the winning runs, but it was Banton who delivered when England needed him most.\n\nThough Scotland's score always looked 20 runs below par, England were troubled at one stage.\n\nThey took three wickets in the powerplay, including Archer having the dangerous George Munsey and number three Brandon McMullen miscuing pulls in a lively opening spell of three overs, but Berrington countered impressively.\n\nBerrington, a good player of slow bowling, was particularly aggressive against England's spinners. He hit Rashid for two fours and a six in his second over and was the aggressor in a partnership of 71 with Tom Bruce.\n\nAt 113-3 in the 13th over, 190 was Scotland's target. Instead, the wicket of Bruce resulted in the innings sliding away.\n\nHe slog-swept Liam Dawson to deep square leg for 24 - one of six batters to wastefully pick out fielders in the deep.\n\nIn the next over Rashid pinned the sweeping Berrington in front as England's leg-spinner, having gone wicketless for 26 runs in his first two overs, took 3-10 in his second spell.\n\nDawson, who took 2-34, added the wicket of Michael Leask, also caught in the deep.\n\nScotland's collapse 5-14 in 3.3 overs ultimately denied them the 30 runs that could have kept them alive in this tournament.",

    "fullText": "Gennaro Gattuso and his coaching staff have been busy speaking and meeting with a long list of players ahead of the World Cup play-offs in March, and according to recent reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, there are currently around 50 players on the Italy national team radar. Here is a look at all of them.\n\nItaly have not yet secured their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America and must go through the play-offs if they are to avoid missing out on the final tournament for the third cycle in a row.\n\nThe Azzurri will play against Northern Ireland in Bergamo on March 26 in the World Cup play-off semi-final, and should they win that game, they will progress to a one-legged play-off final away against either Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina a few days later: A one-off knock-out match for a spot at the World Cup.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 16: Pio Esposito of Italy celebrates scoring his team’s first goal during the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Norway at San Siro Stadium on November 16, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGattuso and his staff had sought to bring the national team squad together once more before the World Cup play-offs in March, given that they have not got together since the end of the November international break.\n\nThis has not been possible, however, largely due to a congested fixture schedule at club level.\n\nInstead, Gattuso and his staff have arranged a series of meetings and dinners with groups of Italy players and national team hopefuls over the last few months in an attempt to keep the squad somewhat together.\n\nHere is the long list of players Gattuso has supposedly spoken to ahead of the World Cup play-offs.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 05: Gianluigi Donnarumma of Italy warms up prior to the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Estonia at Stadio di Bergamo on September 05, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy.

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nIreland 235-5 (20 overs): Tucker 94* (51); Ahmed 3-33\n\nOman 139 all out (18 overs): Kaleem 50 (29); Little 3-16\n\nStand-in captain Lorcan Tucker hit an unbeaten 94 to lead Ireland to a 96-run win over Oman at the T20 World Cup.\n\nHaving lost their opening games against Sri Lanka and Australia, Ireland needed both victory and a boost to their net run-rate to have any hopes of progression.\n\nWhat was to be a first win at the tournament since beating England in 2022 looked in doubt when Tucker came to the crease with his side 25-2, but the wicketkeeper equalled his highest score in the format to power Ireland to 235-5 by the end of their innings.\n\nDespite Aamir Kaleem providing a half-century, Oman wickets fell quickly with Josh Little leading the way for Ireland's bowlers with three wickets for 16 runs.\n\nIreland play Zimbabwe on Tuesday (09:30 GMT) still needing a win and other results to go their way if they are to make the Super 8s.\n\nBrilliant Muzarabani helps Zimbabwe stun Australia\n\nWhile Tucker filled in for the injured Paul Stirling as captain, it was Tim Tector who opened the batting in place of the Belfast man.\n\nIreland's struggles for a top-order partnership, however, continued with Shakeel Ahmed doing the damage.\n\nThe 38-year-old, celebrating wickets in the style of Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, accounted for Tim Tector (5), Ross Adair (14) and Harry Tector (14) during the powerplay with Ireland reeling somewhat on 47-3 after six overs.\n\nWith Curtis Campher, who provided 12 off seven balls, not sticking around either, it was up to all-rounder Gareth Delany to team up with Tucker and give Ireland's innings some much needed momentum.\n\nThe pair's 101-run partnership off 56 balls took Ireland from what was a shaky start to a position that would lead to their highest ever T20 international total.\n\nWhile there were seven boundaries among Delany's 56 off 30 balls, it was Tucker's efforts that were to provide the headline act.\n\nAn inventive knock that featured 10 fours and four sixes, the only scare came when, with Ireland 67-4, Vinayak Shukla appeared to have him stumped only for the third umpire to judge that Oman's wicketkeeper had dislodged the bails without the ball in his hand.\n\nTucker certainly made the most of the reprieve, pressing on for what is the best knock of the tournament so far, eclipsing Tim Seifert's 89 against UAE for New Zealand.\n\nHe would end the innings frustratingly stranded at the non-striker's end, denied the chance for what would have been a first T20 century as George Dockrell, who plundered 35 from nine balls, faced the final three deliveries.\n\nIf 93 runs in the final five overs of Ireland's innings had appeared to leave the result a formality, Heinrich Malan's side will have had improving their net run-rate on the mind too.\n\nOman were 63-2 after the powerplay, and brought up their 100 in the 11th over, both ahead of the pace set by Ireland, but wickets feel too cheaply to ever bring such a target into realistic focus.\n\nAamir Kaleem led the way with the 44-year-old becoming the oldest player in T20 World Cup history to make a half-century, reaching his fifty in 28 deliveries to break the record set by team-mate Muhammad Nadeem against Sri Lanka only on Thursday.\n\nMost encouraging for Ireland's bowlers was the performance of Josh Little.\n\nThe seamer, who had been without a wicket in his past four T20 internationals, finished with figures of 3-16.\n\nThe 26-year-old, whose 4-23 against Sri Lanka at this tournament in 2021 built his reputation as Ireland's most dangerous quick, had been left out of the side for the opening two games this time around.\n\nBowling with a menacing pace throughout, the left-armer was denied a wicket with his fifth delivery when Ireland's struggles in the field at this tournament continued as Delany dropped Aamir in the deep.\n\nHe came back, however, to claim the wickets of Muhammad Nadeem, Jiten Ramanandi, Nadeem Khan to take away any remote hopes of an Oman victory.",

    "fullText": "Brad Currie's biography on social media platform X reads: \"21/22 OR: 1k. 22/23 OR: 1.8k.\"\n\nHe will likely open the bowling for Scotland against England at the T20 World Cup on Saturday, but those numbers do not reference his cricket stats.\n\nInstead, they are Currie's record playing Fantasy Football because online he is known by another name, 'FPL Schofield'.\n\nThere he runs an account with thousands of followers offering tips and tactics on the online football game.\n\n\"My notes page on my iPad is filled with FPL transfers and fixtures rotations,\" Currie tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"My YouTube algorithm is just FPL videos galore. My Twitter is nothing other than football and even my TikTok.\n\n\"My girlfriend absolutely hates it.\"\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nThe Office, Willy Wonka & Denmark at Euro 92 - Scotland's chaotic WC prep\n\nCurrie, 27, was once ranked 30th in the world in a game now played by almost 13 million people.\n\nPlaying a World Cup in India comes with one obvious problem - the five-and-a-half-hour time difference to the UK.\n\nThis week's Premier League matches kicked off in the early hours and the deadlines to make transfers were late at night.\n\n\"I can't figure out a way to get the games on and I am even struggling to see highlights.\n\n\"It has been absolute torture, but thankfully it is the FA Cup this weekend.\"\n\nThough the secret has started to come out, the professional cricket world was initially unaware of Currie's alter ego.\n\nThese days he gets messages from team-mates and opponents asking for advice.\n\n\"[Sussex bowler] Sean Hunt is one,\" Currie says.\n\n\"He messaged me a screenshot before our West Indies game and said: 'I know you have bigger things at play, but what do you think of my team?'\n\n\"The other day he said: 'What do you think of my team? Oh and well bowled.'\"\n\nSo what about a tip for the rest of the FPL season?\n\n\"Chip strategy,\" Currie replies quickly. \"Dead-end into Gameweek 31. Wildcard in 32. Bench boost 33.\n\n\"Triple captain whenever you want.\"\n\nCurrie is the brother of Scott - the Scotland bowler who was called up by England last year.\n\nThey both qualify for Scotland via their Scottish dad, having grown up on England's south coast. Left-armer Brad studied sports psychology at Bournemouth University.\n\nA lifelong fan, Brad was at the Cherries' 3-2 win over Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium - when Amine Adli scored a 95th-minute winner against the Premier League champions - the day he got the call from coach Owen Dawkins to tell him he had made Scotland's World Cup squad.\n\n\"I said to my mate: 'I know exactly what this is, but I can't pick this up because I won't get any signal,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I got to the phone later and Dawks said: 'That was a good result, wasn't it?'\n\n\"I said: 'Yeah, and I hope you're not going to ruin my mood now.'\"\n\nHaving been pipped at qualifying by the Netherlands and Italy, Scotland got a place at this World Cup when Bangladesh opted to boycott the tournament.\n\nThe preceding weeks were uncertain, filled with claims and counterclaims about whether the Tigers would take part and what it would mean for Scotland if they did not. Even the players were not immune.\n\n\"I was at Sussex training in the indoor school and was asking all of the powers that be and the coaching staff,\" Currie says.\n\n\"It was crazy to have people saying we were going. I just thought, 'you know more than me and I am one of the players in the official Scotland group chat'.\"\n\nAs a county pro at Sussex, Currie was fortunate he had been training through the winter.\n\nBowlers' workloads are notoriously important to manage, however, and Scotland's focus switched from the Cricket World Cup League 2 at the end of March to a T20 World Cup in India at the start of February.\n\n\"I don't know what date it officially got announced but the two days after were the weekend and I just did nothing,\" he says.\n\n\"My girlfriend's family were like: 'Should you not be training? Should you not be doing something?'\n\n\"You can't cram in. You just will get injured. It is not like a school test where you can cram in revision.\"\n\nUncertainty also surrounded the availability of the younger Currie brother.\n\nDespite being picked by England for the tour of Ireland last year, he did not make his debut, leaving some to wonder if he could switch back to the Scots.\n\nAs it turned out, one spell as a substitute fielder made him ineligible.\n\n\"I had to text him and ask,\" Brad says.\n\n\"My heart sank because there are loads of brothers out here playing.\n\n\"We have just played the Manentis and the Moscas [against Italy]. There's the Sheikh brothers [Nepal] as well.\n\n\"It probably would have forced Mum and Dad to remortgage the house and get some flights out but there's only one son out here so it's not needed.\n\n\"He is going to try and please Mum and play for England, but I am going to keep Dad sweet and stick to my Scottish genes.\"\n\nEngland's defeat by West Indies effectively means Saturday's encounter is a must-win for both sides.\n\nThey last met at the 2024 T20 World Cup when an impressive Scotland batting performance meant England were faced with a tricky 110 in 10 overs before rain prevented what could have been an intriguing situation.\n\n\"It is something we will never have the answer to,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I have learned to fear no one and go into games expecting to win.\n\n\"I have a fair background in sports psychology and that is the best way to approach these games.\n\n\"They have Adil Rashid [batting] at 11 with 10 first-class hundreds and I haven't got a first-class double-digit score. I am not naive.\n\n\"[But] They have got to play and travel. We have played two games at Eden Gardens.\n\n\"I am just looking forward to it.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The International Cricket Council has been urged to review the rules concerning 12th man duties which denied Scott Currie the chance to play for Scotland at the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nPoole-born Currie, 24, has played three one-day internationals for Scotland having qualified for the Saltires through his Scottish father.\n\nPotentially he could have been lining up to play for Scotland against England in Kolkata on Saturday, alongside brother Brad, only to be deemed ineligible for the tournament because of ICC red tape.\n\nThe Hampshire all-rounder was called up by England for a three-match T20 international series against Ireland last September as a replacement for the injured Saqib Mahmood.\n\nCurrie was not picked in England's playing XI for any of the matches which took place in Malahide, but because he undertook 12th man duties he is now ineligible for Scotland for three years.\n\nSection 2.2 of the ICC's player eligibility regulations state that Currie \"participated\" as a \"non-playing official substitute\".\n\nCricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade said the ICC ruling seems \"quite strange\" compared to other sports.\n\nUnder the rules governing football and rugby union, Currie would have been eligible to play for Scotland having not won an official cap.\n\n\"I don't know when that rule was last looked at, so maybe it is time to have a re-look at that and confirm that what is in place is correct or whether alterations are needed,\" Lindblade told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Is that rule still relevant today in that evolution of our sport where players do move around a lot more from that perspective?\"\n\nUnder ICC regulations players can switch allegiances from associate countries like Scotland to full members like England immediately provided they meet all the other qualification requirements, but they must wait three years the other way.\n\nCurrie declined to comment but has previously spoken of his \"immense pride\" at playing international cricket for Scotland.\n\n\"Taking the field with my brother [Brad], knowing what is means to my old man and his side of the family, is something that always puts a smile on face,\" he said last year.\n\nAn ICC spokesperson told BBC Sport that should a member \"wish to revisit this clause\" then it can be \"raised and discussed, in the first instance, at a men's cricket committee meeting later this month\".\n\nListen to the full interview with Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade broadcast on 31 January on BBC Stumped.\n\nEngland too 'careful' in defeat by Windies - Brook\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Marc Cucurella has been an absolute soldier for Chelsea in the last two years, playing a crazy number of games in a really demanding position.\n\nThe addition of Jorrel Hato this summer was supposed to help him out, but the Dutchman has not proved himself reliable yet, and time again Chelsea have to turn to Cucurella.\n\nThe pressure on his body finally told against Leeds on Tuesday night, when he was taken off with a hamstring problem. In an update in his press conference yesterday, Liam Rosenior said that the club were still awaiting scans to see how bad the damage was.\n\nMarc Cucurella looks sad. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nSigns from Spain aren’t good. Joaquin Marota reports for AS that the Spanish football federation are “worried” about a potential muscular problem, with the World Cup closing in.\n\nThey say that the full back will have an MRI today to discover the full extent of the damage. The Spaniard has already been ruled out of tomorrow’s FA Cup game, and even in the best case it feels likely that he misses the league game a week after that too. That gives him two and a half weeks to try and recover to face Arsenal on March 1st.\n\nAtletico Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Pedro Neto, but at the moment the main transfer sources are saying that’s unlikely. We certainly don’t see the reported £80m price as realistic – although if it was, Chelsea would have a hard time saying no to such a profit.\n\nOne player taking a fair bit of flak recently has been Alejandro Garnacho. Fans want to see more, and Liam Rosenior has even been forced to defender him pretty openly in recent press conferences.",

    "description": "The Nations League does not carry the prestige of other competitions, but Thursday's draw still carries huge importance to Scotland and the Tartan Army.",
    "fullText": "Who needs the Nations League? Now Steve Clarke has ended decades of heartache and taken Scotland to the World Cup, does anything else matter?\n\nUnderstandably, ever since December's gala draw for the summer's finals in North America, every Scotland fan has been consumed with thoughts of facing Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.\n\nThe prospect of partying at the finals for the first time since 1998 has given long-suffering supporters plenty to savour and there's been no need to look beyond, nor anything definite to anticipate.\n\nThat changes the Nations League draw in Belgium on Thursday evening, when Scotland's opponents for matches in the second half of 2026 are confirmed.\n\nCompared to Fifa's festival of football, or even the Euros, it's small potatoes, of course, but these games could hold huge importance for tournaments to come and the development of the national team after their tests in North America.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nAnother plot twist in Scottish title race for the ages\n\nSince being introduced in 2018 in an attempt to add more structure to the international calendar and phase out meaningless friendlies, the competition has followed a familiar format.\n\nNational teams are split into four tiers based on promotion and relegation from the last edition, theoretically putting sides of the same level together.\n\nEach of these tiers are split into groups of four and there's promotion and relegation through the divisions. The best teams in League A then go on into a knock-out finals tournament the following summer with the champions crowned at the end. Simple.\n\nScotland played in the top flight in the last edition back in 2024 but finished in third place in their group behind eventual champions Portugal and Croatia. That put the national team in a play-off to fight for survival and defeat by Greece meant relegation to League B.\n\nRevenge on the Greeks was served in the successful World Cup qualification last year, of course, but Thursday's draw will put Scotland back in familiar territory in the second tier of the Nations League.\n\nScotland are in Pot 1 of the League B draw, but a quick look at the possible opposition puts paid to any ideas that it means an easy draw.\n\nHungary, Poland and Israel are the only sides Scotland cannot face, but with the likes of Switzerland, Republic of Ireland and Sweden as a potential group of opponents, fans won't be taking success for granted. Though do we ever?\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland, Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland, Romania\n\nPot 4: Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Kosovo\n\nScotland will play each opponent home and away, with the fixtures grouped into three double-headers in September, October and November.\n\nGroup winners are promoted automatically, runners-up go into a play-off against a League A side, third faces a relegation play-off and fourth takes a drop straight into League C.\n\nEven eight years after its introduction, the competition does not have the allure of its counterparts, but it is still an important part of the international calendar, especially for Scotland.\n\nHead coach Clarke has spoken repeatedly about how his players need to face strong opposition to keep improving.\n\nThis time around, they will not be playing Europe's elite, but competitive games against sides of a similar level present a good test and strong preparation for the next set of European Championship qualifiers.\n\nPromotion brings prestige, glamour games next time around and prize money, but arguably the real prizes come in how a successful campaign sets Scotland up for the future.\n\nThe seeding for qualification campaigns and finals is always a complicated affair, but there is one simple truth that applies to them all. Winning games pushes a team up the rankings and into a better position - and winning competitive games is more valuable than victory in friendlies.\n\nThere is also the importance of a good Nations League as a lifeline to reach major finals. Four teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup directly have been given a second chance through the play-offs due to their Nations League record.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Scotland's long exodus from a major finals was ended because of a Nations League lifeline – the emotion of the play-off victory in Serbia that sealed a place at Euro 2020 was only possible because of a strong campaign.\n\nIt should not be the case that the national team needs a similar chance to reach Euro 2028, but a horrible set of circumstances could arise that make Nations League success essential.\n\nAs co-hosts of the tournament, the idea of Scotland not making the finals and seeing fans of other nations celebrating at Hampden in unthinkable.\n\nHowever, with four nations hosting the finals, Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland all have to go through the qualification campaign.\n\nIn an ideal world, the national team succeeds there and books a place, with three group games at Hampden guaranteed.\n\nUefa has set aside two places for host nations who fail to qualify in an attempt to make sure all four are in the tournament proper.\n\nHowever, if more than two of the four fail to qualify automatically, it comes down to qualifying ranking and Scotland could conceivably miss out altogether.\n\nIn that specific case, having a play-off place banked from the Nations League would be heaven sent.\n\nThere is one other intriguing footnote to the draw: it could set up the opposition for the next Scotland head coach's first game in charge.\n\nClarke's contract expires after the World Cup and there is no indication if he will carry on in the job, regardless of what happens at the finals.\n\nIf Clarke does leave in the summer, his successor's first matches will be in the Nations League and a new era for the national team will begin when League B kicks off.\n\nBBC Scotland will have live text coverage of the Nations League draw from 17:00 GMT.",

    "description": "Trent Alexander-Arnold endured a difficult start at Real Madrid but his prospects are looking up - and it might earn him a ticket to the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Trent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench in Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Valencia last weekend, there was much anticipation around the former Liverpool right-back's return.\n\nAfter another two months on the sideline, Real supporters had seen very little of the England defender this season.\n\nSince joining the Spanish side in June 2025, he has been limited to just 17 appearances in all competitions.\n\nTwo separate injuries have disrupted his rhythm and denied him the sustained run of games needed to build momentum and a connection with supporters.\n\nThe relationship he built with Xabi Alonso became redundant when the manager was sacked after less than eight months in charge.\n\nNow though, he is fit again and the timing feels significant. The season is entering its decisive stretch and Alexander-Arnold has the opportunity to reassert himself.\n\nWhy are Real Madrid players training in masks?\n\nHasty or a shrewd move? Madrid in shock at swift Arbeloa appointment\n\nAfter a strong Club World Cup, where he started five of Madrid's six matches, Alexander-Arnold began the 2025–26 season sharing right-back duties with Dani Carvajal.\n\nSpanish media praised his early performances, noting he \"showcased his trademark ability to drift inside from full-back\".\n\nBut his campaign was soon disrupted. A hamstring injury in Madrid's opening Champions League game in September put him out for seven weeks and was described by local media as \"a blow to Trent's new chapter\".\n\nHis comeback in November felt particularly poignant as he faced his former club Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nHe subsequently made five more appearances, with Spanish newspaper AS suggesting that \"the initial criticism [of Alexander-Arnold] revealed a lack of understanding of the footballing ability the England international has always possessed\".\n\nMomentum was building and fans were beginning to see the benefits of their star signing, but a thigh injury against Athletic Club in December left him injured and recovering for another two months.\n\nThe 27-year-old admitted he was \"absolutely gutted\".\n\nThat setback kept him out for 14 matches, until his long-awaited return last weekend.\n\nDespite only playing for the final 15 minutes of the match, Alexander-Arnold's return was met with largely positive reaction from supporters.\n\nOn social media, the Madridistas didn't hold back:\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold's minutes against Valencia felt like a prime performance. Our style of play even changed!\"\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold completely changed the game when he came on. Does he deserve to start every match?\"\n\n\"His passes are so satisfying. Football has missed him.\"\n\nThe brief but impressive appearance has raised expectations, especially with the first leg of Real Madrid's Champions League knockout tie against Benfica looming next week.\n\nYet head coach Alvaro Arbeloa was quick to manage the excitement, emphasising that full recovery remains the priority.\n\n\"After being out for a long time, we are taking the same approach with him as with others returning from injury,\" said Arbeloa.\n\n\"We are proceeding cautiously and calmly because what we want is for him to find his rhythm, his best playing form. That's how it will be with Trent.\"\n\nIt was the first time Arbeloa had publicly addressed Alexander-Arnold, and the comments put to rest earlier rumours suggesting he might not feature in his long-term plans - speculation that Real Madrid had carefully shielded the England international from.\n\nThis was a clear signal that Alexander-Arnold remains central to the club's long-term vision. And, as a former Liverpool and Real Madrid right-back himself, Arbeloa may be uniquely placed to help strengthen their relationship off the pitch.\n\nWith Federico Valverde moving back into a central midfield role following Jude Bellingham's recent injury, Real Madrid's right-back picture has shifted, opening the door for Alexander-Arnold to feature more prominently in that position against Benfica and beyond.\n\nArbeloa now has all his options available on that flank: captain Dani Carvajal, Alexander-Arnold (who played ahead of Carvajal against Valencia), Valverde as an emergency option, and academy player David Jimenez, who started in Valencia.\n\nCarvajal's season has been equally frustrating, having battled a series of injuries as well as knee surgery.\n\nDespite now being fit and available, he has barely played any minutes under Arbeloa. In fact, his last start was in September. It's a complex situation given his contract expires in the summer and there appears to have been little progress in renewing it.\n\nThat context places Alexander-Arnold in a strong position to become Madrid's leading option at right-back once fully fit, with Valverde still available as an emergency alternative and Jimenez also impressing when called upon.\n\nWhether Alexander-Arnold will be eased back into the starting XI as he builds fitness, or whether he will leap straight into a key role, given the significance of upcoming fixtures, remains to be seen as Arbeloa manages the reintegration.\n\nIt would be fair to say that, at this stage of the season, Alexander-Arnold's chances of making England's squad for this summer's World Cup appear slim, with his limited minutes at club level the most obvious reason.\n\nInternational selection is usually built on form and fitness, and the England coaching staff are likely to prioritise players who are consistently competing at the highest level.\n\nHe has not had the chance to demonstrate the consistency required to challenge for a place.\n\nHe was omitted from Thomas Tuchel's World Cup qualifying squad in August, with the England coach saying: \"There's no doubt I'm a big fan of Trent, for his talent and his personality. But for this call-up, I've gone with Reece James and Tino Livramento.\n\n\"I know he wanted to be here, which is very important. I just chose others due to competition.\"\n\nEven if Alexander‑Arnold delivers spectacular performances for Real Madrid over the coming weeks, the competition for the England right-back position remains strong.\n\nWith Tuchel preparing to finalise his squad for friendly matches against Uruguay and Japan on 27 and 31 March respectively, selections are likely to prioritise players who have been performing consistently week in, week out.\n\nStill, as Tuchel himself emphasised: \"He's a great player who will always be in contention.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Captain Harry Brook said England's batters were \"too careful\" in their 30-run defeat by West Indies at the T20 World Cup.\n\nEngland reached 74-1 in pursuit of 197 but lost six wickets in succession to spin in the middle overs and were bowled out for 166 in 19 overs.\n\nBrook, who was out caught and bowled for 17, was one of three batters dismissed by spinner Gudakesh Motie.\n\n\"I'd much rather get caught on the boundary than the way I did today,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He was the main threat at that time so I was just trying to knock it into the leg-side and get Sam [Curran] back on strike.\"\n\nEngland spun out by West Indies at T20 World Cup\n\nProteas edge Afghanistan after two super overs\n\nAustralia leave Ireland on brink of World Cup exit\n\nBrook's assessment is a familiar one.\n\nAfter England were bowled out for 131 in a one-day international against South Africa last year, he said his could have \"gone a little bit harder with the bat\".\n\nWhen they lost an ODI in New Zealand before Christmas, Brook asked, \"Can we go harder?\".\n\nAgainst the impressive Windies, Tom Banton also chipped a catch to extra cover pushing a drive off Motie, while Jacob Bethell and Will Jacks were bowled and pinned lbw respectively playing from the crease.\n\n\"Chasing nearly 200 is always a big ask and we thought the pitch would get a little bit better and it would slide on to the bat a little bit more, but that didn't happen,\" Brook said.\n\n\"We were probably a little bit careful, myself included.\"\n\nIn the absence of dew, which makes it harder for bowlers to grip the ball, the pitch at Wankhede Stadium offered more turn than any other at this World Cup so far.\n\nEngland played spin well on their recent tour of Sri Lanka, where they won a T20 series 3-0, but here familiar issues resurfaced.\n\n\"I thought we played spin outstanding in Sri Lanka and we've just had a bad day today,\" Brook said.\n\n\"We didn't manage to get over the line and they bowled well.\"\n\nBrook also backed leading pace bowler Jofra Archer, who conceded 48 runs from his four overs after being hit for 42 in the win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\n\"Everybody knows how good Jof is,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He'll bounce back for sure. He's bowling rapid and I'm sure he'll execute better in the coming games.\"\n\nEngland face Scotland on Saturday before their final Group C match against Italy on Monday, with both games taking place in Kolkata.",

    "fullText": "Wicketkeeper Lorcan Tucker says Ireland have not given up hope of making the Super 8s at the 2026 T20 World Cup despite losing their opening two group games.\n\nA 20-run loss to Sri Lanka was followed on Wednesday by a 67-run defeat at the hands of Australia in Colombo to leave Ireland in a precarious position.\n\nThe Aussies posted 182-6 and, after losing captain Paul Stirling to injury, Ireland slumped to 115 all out in reply.\n\nHeinrich Malan's side need to win their final two Group B matches - against Zimbabwe and Oman on Saturday and Tuesday respectively - and for results elsewhere to go their way to finish in the top two qualifying spots.\n\n\"There's still plenty that can happen - we just have to stay competitive, stay keen and we're not out of this yet,\" said Tucker, who made 24 and stood in as captain after Stirling's retirement.\n\n\"We just have to make sure we rock up for the next game and put in a really positive performance. I think we didn't start the game the way we would have liked - Australia got away from us in the powerplay.\n\n\"Our spinners made a great effort to pull it back, but ultimately they finished off really well before we lost wickets in our own powerplay. We got off to a pretty poor start.\"\n\nStirling took a brilliant catch to dismiss Josh Inglis but it proved costly for Ireland after the opener hobbled off after the first delivery of Ireland's reply.\n\n\"I think he just took a knock on his knee taking the catch - he tried to go out and see our innings off to a good start but he wasn't able to unfortunately,\" added Tucker.\n\n\"It was massively disappointing and I think after that it sort of set a train in motion. Hopefully he'll be back for the next game.\"",

    "fullText": "West Indies 196-6 (20 overs): Rutherford 76* (42); Rashid 2-16\n\nEngland 166 (19 overs): Curran 43* (30); Motie 3-33\n\nEngland's batters were spun out by West Indies in Mumbai as Harry Brook's side fell to a 30-run defeat in their second match at the T20 World Cup.\n\nEngland made a flying start in pursuit of 197 but slipped from 74-1 to 166 all out, with six wickets in succession taken by the Windies' spinners through the middle overs.\n\nGudakesh Motie conjured a spell of 3-33, dismissing Jacob Bethell for 33, Tom Banton for two and Brook for 17, while part-timer Roston Chase chipped in with the wickets of Jos Buttler and Will Jacks.\n\nSam Curran held firm for 43 not out but ran out of partners when Adil Rashid holed out at the end of the penultimate over.\n\nEarlier, England leaked runs - Jofra Archer's one wicket cost 48 runs, while Curran's single victim came at a cost of 36 in three overs - to allow West Indies to post 196-6 at Wankhede Stadium.\n\nSherfane Rutherford was the main beneficiary, scoring 74 from 42 deliveries, while being dropped on 23 and 56.\n\nThere were contributions of 34 from Chase and 33 in 17 balls by Jason Holder as well.\n\nThe defeat is not terminal for England's hopes - victories against Scotland on Saturday and Italy on Monday in Kolkata would likely send them through to the Super 8s - but it leaves them little room for manoeuvre.\n\nProteas edge Afghanistan after two super overs\n\nAustralia leave Ireland on brink of World Cup exit\n\nEngland's struggles against spin are not unique to this latest side. They go back generations.\n\nIf fans hoped this iteration had found a successful method when in Sri Lanka before this tournament, this result - under the pressure that comes with a World Cup chase - suggests otherwise.\n\nWhen the ball was hard and with pace to face, England, who were beaten by West Indies in the final of the 2016 T20 World Cup in India, had no issues.\n\nPhil Salt took 24 from the second over, bowled by Holder, and West Indies' total looked 15 runs below par.\n\nHowever, the game changed when Buttler miscued Chase to long-on for 21.\n\nIt opened the door to Motie, who impressively mixed wrist and finger-spin to have Banton and Brook chipping catches either side of zipping one through Bethell's defence and onto the stumps.\n\nCurran was England's hero with the ball in their final-over win against Nepal but he never really looked like finding the boundaries needed when pace returned at the death.\n\nIt was a fine all-round performance from West Indies, who caught every chance in the field, and now top the group with two wins from two.\n\nThey face Nepal at this venue on Sunday, before playing Italy in Kolkata on Thursday, 19 February.\n\nThough Archer had captain Shai Hope caught in the first over and fellow opener Brandon King slashed Curran to deep point in the second, West Indies were always dangerous given their stacked batting line-up.\n\nEngland continued to take regular wickets but only Adil Rashid, who claimed 2-16, managed to slow the scoring.\n\nWhereas Chase took 2-29 after being brought into the XI, England's part-time off-spinner Will Jacks was hit for 32 in two overs - Brook's decision to give him one over in the powerplay costing 19 runs.\n\nArcher, who also struggled against Nepal on Sunday, was wayward with his lines.\n\nRutherford had his moments. The first chance offered was a leading edge that flew to deep third man, with Rashid unable to take the catch or flick the ball back inside the rope.\n\nThat was a tough chance but Rashid would be disappointed not to take a chance off his own bowling when Rutherford skied a slog sweep in the 18th over.\n\nThe left-hander added another 18 runs from seven balls after that miss while Holder hit four sixes, three of which came in the 18th over bowled by Curran.\n\nWith dew not playing a part in making the ball harder to grip for the West Indies bowlers, it proved too much for England when the ball turned.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - results & fixtures\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "With the 2026 Super League season about to kick off on its 30th anniversary, BBC Sport explains what to look out for during a bumper World Cup year.",
    "fullText": "Four months on since Hull KR wrapped up a clean sweep of trophies in 2025, Super League makes its return as it celebrates its 30th birthday.\n\nThree new clubs join an expanded league, there have been signings aplenty, another trip to Las Vegas coming up and it is a World Cup year too.\n\nBut what should you watch out for as the 'greatest game' makes its comeback for another season?\n\nBBC Sport has taken a look at some things to focus on when the curtain opens on the 2026 campaign on Thursday.\n\nThirty years after the inaugural Super League season got under way with 12 teams, this year the competition has expanded to 14 sides.\n\nIt is the first time since 2014 the league has operated with 14 teams having previously dipped down to 12 from the 2015 season.\n\nWith Salford dropping out at the end of last season, the league will welcome three clubs - two of which have played in the top flight before.\n\nBradford Bulls and Toulouse Olympique have both featured in Super League in the past but newcomers York Knights will make their debut this season as the sport continues to expand outside its traditional heartlands.\n\nKnights, whose women's team York Valkyrie have enjoyed plenty of success in the Women's Super League, were selected to join rugby league's top flight by an independent panel along with Toulouse, who come back to the top table following a one-season stint in 2022.\n\nThe panel judged applications against each club's financial performance in 2025, as well as their financial performance and sustainability forecasts for 2026 to 2028 and their ability to \"field a competitive team in 2026 and beyond\".\n\nHeadlined by the high-profile signing of Paul Vaughan from Warrington, York have ushered in a total of 14 new faces as they aim to hit the ground running in their maiden top-flight campaign.\n\nToulouse, meanwhile, welcome Wigan's Tyler Dupree on a season-long loan, hoping to establish themselves alongside Catalans as the league's French representation.\n\nSuper League to expand to 14 teams from 2026\n\nYork and Toulouse to play in expanded Super League\n\nBradford replace Salford in Super League for 2026\n\nTo those of a certain vintage, Bradford Bulls and Super League success are synonymous.\n\nThe club dominated the early Super League era, clinching four league titles and two Challenge Cups during their late 1990s and early 2000s heyday.\n\nFormerly a dominant force, the club lost their top-flight status in 2015 with Wigan Warriors, Leeds Rhinos and St Helens taking it in turns to dominate after Bradford ran out of steam.\n\nDuring their 11-year absence, the club has been plagued with financial troubles and had a stint in the former third-tier League One but, off the back of last season's grading system, they return to Super League.\n\nIconic head coach Brian Noble came back to the club last season and steered them to third in the Championship but they will enter the 2026 campaign under the stewardship of highly-rated former Salford coach Kurt Haggerty.\n\n\"The work we've done leading to round one has been probably more stressful than what's coming ahead,\" Haggerty told BBC Radio Leeds.\n\n\"We've had a lot of stress before we kicked a ball so if I can remain as calm as I have done up to now, I think we'll be ok and I'll be ok.\n\n\"There's a lot of good people around me like Brian Noble who I can rely on and get advice from if I need it.\"\n\nBradford, Toulouse and York have all had to piece together their respective squads for the 2026 season from October onwards, meaning it has been a mad dash to the line for the newcomers to contest the season.\n\nAsked what his ambition was for the coming campaign, Haggerty added: \"I think if we come away from this year with a load of respect, I'll be happy with that.\"\n\nThe expansion to 14 teams means the previously maligned loop fixtures are no more.\n\nThe format was introduced when the league was reduced to 12 sides and ensured that every team played 27 games over the course of a regular season.\n\nIn order for that to happen, however, four of those matches would be so-called loop fixtures where some clubs would face each other again during the regular season based on the final league table from the previous campaign.\n\nThis structure would occasionally lead to some teams having a pretty lopsided campaign - as was the case with St Helens last season, who virtually had a free hit against a chaotic Salford Red Devils side on three occasions while other clubs arguably had a more difficult run-in.\n\nThis led to criticism from many a coach over many a season but returning to a 14-team set-up means the regular season will now consist of 13 home games, 13 away and one Magic Weekend fixture played at a neutral venue - which this year takes place at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nOne side who will not feature in Super League this term are former Grand Finalists Salford.\n\nThe formerly named Red Devils endured a torrid 2025 campaign due to financial issues and frequently fielded youthful sides who were on the receiving end of some demoralising drubbings.\n\nThe club lost their place in Super League due to the end-of-season gradings and were later placed into liquidation by the High Court in December, which plunged its future into doubt.\n\nHowever, former player Mason Caton-Brown led a consortium to take over the club - now running under the Salford RLFC moniker - as they frantically put together the shell of a side to contest the 2026 Championship season in a matter of weeks after being given the go ahead from the Rugby Football League.\n\nHull KR come into the 2026 season off the back of a campaign which saw them win a clean sweep of Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and the Super League Grand Final.\n\nThat success has shattered the glass ceiling as Willie Peters' side muscled their way in to the northern hemisphere elite, becoming only the fifth club in Super League history to win a Grand Final.\n\nBut will their dominance be tested? After all, Wigan came into last season off the back of a historic quadruple of trophies, yet they could not mount a challenge against Hull KR and came away at the end of the season empty-handed.\n\nSt Helens, Leeds and Leigh Leopards have recruited well as they look to dethrone the Robins, who also have a trip to Las Vegas to face the Rhinos and next week's World Club Challenge against National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos to contend with in a packed calendar in the early part of the season.\n\nThere has been some turnover at the Robins, with Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum retiring after October's showpiece, but the club have kept the spine of what has made them so successful in recent seasons.\n\nTalismanic half-back Mikey Lewis signed a huge five-year deal before the 2025 season ended and balancing the old and new is crucial to inspiring success in the future, KR forward Dean Hadley said.\n\n\"You look at any successful team, whatever sport that might be and they always have a core group of players and people, which includes the staff,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"When you've got a group where the majority have been together, you build relationships and connections and you get used to each other.\n\n\"Off the back of that it's important to bring in a few new additions and new energy. The boys that have come in have been really good and added to it but the majority of us have been together now for two or three years and hopefully we can carry on.\"\n\nWhat adds some extra spice to the season is the fact there is a World Cup at the end of it, as England's best and brightest aim to put themselves in the picture for a spot in the squad that will travel to Australia in October.\n\nWith Peters \"keen\" to have talks for the role of England boss after the departure of Shaun Wane, how many of his KR cohort will be on the plane down under later this year?",

    "fullText": "\"It's all about the fingertips\" replies Crishan Kalugamage with a wink when asked about the similarities between bowling leg-spin and making pizzas.\n\nKalugamage moved from Sri Lanka to Lucca in Tuscany as a 15-year-old and is one of five home-based players in Italy's 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup.\n\nA sporty kid, Kalugamage made friends competing in athletics and then started playing some amateur cricket near his adopted hometown. His natural talent for the game set him apart and he was soon scouted to play for Roma Cricket Club, one of the oldest in the country.\n\nThe now 34-year-old is one of many players in the Italian squad who have known sacrifice to get where they are today, namely playing in front of thousands of people at famous cricketing stadiums such as Kolkata's Eden Gardens and Mumbai's Wankhede. A global audience of millions watching at home.\n\nKalugamage's job as a pizza maker often came second to playing cricket. \"I lost a lot of jobs,\" he says ruefully, \"Sunday is a very busy day, lots of bosses aren't keen on you not working because you are playing cricket.\"\n\n\"Crish is a very dangerous weapon\" Italy's head coach, John Davison, says on a separate call. \"He can spin it sharply both ways and he will have the element of surprise, hardly anyone in the tournament will have ever faced him.\"\n\nDavison knows his rotations - he is also known as 'The Spin Whisperer'. He has spent the last decade and a half as an in-demand spin coach. Nathan Lyon called Davison the \"best spin coach in the world\" and has worked with him since his teens.\n\nHis dough-spinning days behind him, it'll be Kalugamage's fast googly, rather than a Sloppy Giuseppe, that troubles the batters of Group C (England, Scotland, Nepal and West Indies) who are set to face him.\n\nNone of the 15 squad members were born in Italy and only a few are fluent in the language.\n\nSeveral players hold Italian passports or qualify because of a relative, and some people have baulked at the Italian Cricket Federation casting their net so wide rather than concentrating on developing more homegrown players.\n\nSouth African born and South African capped (six ODIs and 16 T20Is between 2017 and 2021) all-rounder JJ Smuts will play for Italy during the tournament by dint of his marriage but has never even stepped foot in the country.\n\n\"People can have their opinion but we've got a real togetherness,\" says captain Wayne Madsen, speaking before his side's opening match against Scotland on Monday, which saw him dislocate his shoulder and his team soundly beaten.\n\nThe 42-year-old South African born batter is club captain at Derbyshire and has a wealth of experience with teams around the globe. Even so, this group of players has had a real effect on him.\n\n\"That heritage and the journeys that guys have gone on to get here, there's a bond which is pretty hard to describe outside of the feeling that we get as a group,\" said Madsen.\n\n\"It really is probably our biggest strength. Everyone's got a story to tell in terms of how they got to this position and everyone's is unique. Whether it is guys who have grown up in Italy or guys with grandparents who moved away many years ago. We've had some really powerful conversations, it has really bonded us.\"\n\nFor Madsen and Davison, success on the pitch in this tournament is part of a wider plan to build on the growing cricketing roots in Italy.\n\n\"We want to win games and we know and believe that we can. If we can finish in the top eight, that'll change the lives of a lot of our cricketers and put Italian cricket on the map\" says Madsen.\n\n\"I think for us, the main thing is leaving a legacy in Italy and the platform to develop the game further in the country.\"\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nFor some of the squad, the prospect of playing in front of a large crowd will be something of an alien prospect. Davison mentions that the players had a training session inside Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium a few days earlier and it was the first time that the Pakistani born and Italian raised left-arm seamer Hassan Ali had stepped foot inside a cricket stadium of any kind.\n\nThe players have been working with Dr Andrew Hooton, Head of the School of Sports and Exercises Science at the University of Derby, in order to prepare themselves. Hooton has worked with Madsen and Micky Arthur at Derbyshire and also with Burton Albion Football Club.\n\n\"Some of the squad definitely haven't had experience of playing in a big stadium, under lights with huge crowds\" says Hooton, \"One of the things I've been working with them on is being able to perform their skills and maintain their basics in this heightened scenario.\n\n\"We've done some work around 'centering'. Like when you see Ronaldo before he takes a free-kick or penalty, he closes his eyes and does a whole body breath. It allows for attentional focus but also helps to guard against nerves and anxiety. It's physical as well as mental.\"\n\nDavison mentions the 33,000 seater Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is sold out for their second game against Nepal.\n\n\"The ICC give us about 75 tickets for friends and family, that leaves a heck of a lot of supporters for us to win over, but we'll be giving it our best shot,\"\n\n\"We have a platform to take cricket further, to take it to another level,\" adds Madsen. \"We've got the players to make that happen and we're dreaming high. We aren't just here to make up the numbers, we can take sides down.\"\n\nSat next to his captain as he says these words, pizza maker Kalugamage smiles and surreptitiously flicks his fingers. The next part of the journey about to begin.\n\nMadsen dislocates shoulder in Italy's World Cup bow\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

She combined playing with a job as a teacher.\n\nConnor, one of the most influential administrators in the game, became the first female president of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 2021-22.\n\nShe became the first woman to sit on the International Cricket Council's (ICC) cricket committee and remains the chair of the governing body's women's cricket committee.\n\nConnor also served as the ECB's interim chief executive between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe Ashes triumph she led in 2005 was the first time England women had beaten Australia for 42 years.\n\nShe retired from playing at the age of 29 and has arguably had an even greater impact on the game in the boardroom than on the field.\n\nIn Connor's time with the ECB, English women's cricket has moved from an amateur game into the professional era, including multiple changes to the domestic structure.\n\nThe decision to depart is a personal one, and Connor's exit will come after the World Cup, which ends with the final at Lord's on 5 July.\n\n\"Helping to grow women's cricket for the past 18 years has been an absolute privilege,\" said Connor.\n\n\"Having fallen in love with the game in a quite different era from the one we are in now, my goals as an administrator have been firmly rooted in making cricket more equal for women and girls.\n\n\"For it to be as normal for a girl to pick up a cricket bat as a boy. For a young woman to know - not just dream - that she can become a professional cricketer.\n\n\"To have played a part in removing some of the barriers that were preventing those things from being possible and to know that cricket is now a more inclusive and more gender balanced sport, is deeply rewarding.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Real Madrid striker Endrick's impact on loan at Lyon has been immediate, and is fuelling the teenager's \"dream\" of playing for Brazil at the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "Even those who do not follow French football in its most granular detail will be aware of the plight that could have befallen Lyon this summer.\n\nSpared from administrative relegation to Ligue 2 just five and a half weeks before the start of the season, the club's future in the French top flight hinged on their capacity to fulfil financial promises.\n\nA firesale of the side's most valuable assets duly ensued, and with it, expectations of a third successive season of European football dwindled.\n\nConstrained by their financial frailties, Les Gones, spearheaded by sporting director Matthieu Louis-Jean, had to work diligently, embarking on an agile recruitment drive.\n\nSpotting talent from lesser-known European leagues became a central tenet of their philosophy.\n\n\"We worked on different markets,\" outlined the former Nottingham Forest right-back in September.\n\nAmid a flurry of moves, Pavel Sulc and Ruben Kluivert arrived on permanent deals from Viktoria Plzen and Casa Pia respectively, while Adam Karabec joined from Sparta Prague on loan.\n\nLouis-Jean has cultivated a burgeoning reputation as a strategic operator, but his most innovative market manoeuvre would have to wait until the winter window.\n\nHaving deviated from their reactive tendencies of the past, Lyon were left without a central striker of note, preferring to secure the temporary services of Martin Satriano on loan.\n\n\"We took a decision on the final day of the transfer window to leave the position of a first-choice striker open,\" said general director Michael Gerlinger.\n\nLouis-Jean, and Lyon's wider recruitment department, were convinced an opportunity would present itself in January. Their intuition soon morphed into prophecy.\n\nHaving amassed just 99 minutes of action for Real Madrid during the first half of the season, Brazil striker Endrick needed an escape. Lyon were more than happy to provide sanctuary for a player and talisman they desperately craved.\n\n\"We had been waiting for a number nine for so long,\" said Louis-Jean upon the 19-year-old's unveiling after joining on loan until the end of the season.\n\nAt a club where strikers are held in such reverence, his impact has been almost divine.\n\nHe scored 42 minutes into his debut against Lille in the last 32 of the French Cup. Another four goals have followed in five games.\n\nThree of those came against Metz, making him the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick for Lyon, surpassing the great Bernard Lacombe, who had held the record for 54 years.\n\nBefore Saturday's match with Nantes, no Lyon player had been directly involved in more goals (six), had more shots on target (14), or completed more dribbles (19) than the Brazilian since his arrival.\n\nEndrick's signing perpetuates a long-held legacy of Brazilians representing the club.\n\nJuninho Pernambucano, Cris and Sonny Anderson are just a few to have spent significant portions of their careers with Lyon, each contributing to the club's unprecedented run of seven successive Ligue 1 crowns between 2002 and 2008.\n\n\"I know there are a lot [of Brazilians] that have played for the club, and many of them have had a fantastic career here,\" said Endrick during his first interview with French newspaper L'Equipe.\n\nLucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes, Brazil team-mates of Endrick, provided counsel prior to his move.\n\n\"Before coming, I spoke with Paqueta and Bruno,\" he said. \"They told me it was a place I could be really happy.\"\n\nPersonal fulfillment, and a chance \"to play football\" with this summer's World Cup looming, he says were driving factors in his decision to join.\n\n\"Obviously it's a dream I have - that won't change. If you don't play well for your club, however, you can't have a chance of playing for Brazil,\" he added.\n\nIf strikers are revered in Lyon, they are held in almost sacred status in Brazil.\n\n\"We don't have that mobile number nine in the Brazil side,\" says former Lyon captain Cris.\n\n\"We have Gabriel Jesus, Richarlison, but there's a space there for him to help the side with his mobility and the way he sees the game.\"\n\nUltimately, Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will be the man who decides if Endrick makes the plane.\n\n\"We had a wonderful conversation,\" said Endrick when asked about whether the Italian had been in contact before his move.\n\n\"He gave me some advice that has stayed with me,\" he added. \"Now, I have to work in order to improve and become a better player.\"\n\nLyon, and Ligue 1, provide the perfect platform for him to do just that.\n\n\"He's very explosive, very quick, very good in one-on-one situations,\" enthused Lyon manager Paulo Fonseca after his debut against Lille.\n\nHis contentious sending-off for two yellow cards against Nantes on Saturday, however, following a petulant kick out after some robust challenges against him, provides a timely reminder of the adjustments Endrick needs to make.\n\n\"When there are players of that calibre, we have to make sure to contain them,\" said Nantes manager Ahmed Kantari in the aftermath.\n\nHerein lies the challenge Endrick will have to confront - at Madrid he was part of a constellation of stars, while here he assumes that mantle almost uniquely.\n\nThat influence transcends the pitch, too - his signing representing a commercial coup as well as a sporting one.\n\n\"It's obvious his notoriety will boost the club's image,\" Gerlinger said during the Brazilian's presentation.\n\nThe results have been tangible. His arrival video, published on the club's official Instagram account, is the club's most-watched on the platform, while highlights of games against Metz, Lille, Brest and Stade Laval - in which Endrick featured - top their YouTube charts.\n\nLyon will hope his impending one-game suspension does not stymie his, or their, seamless progress of late.\n\nPrior to Endrick's arrival, Fonseca's side had recorded a run of four wins in all competitions - subsequently extended to 12.\n\nHaving crafted a favourable route to the Europa League final courtesy of their top-place finish during the league phase, a spot in the quarter-finals of the French Cup secured, and firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification, Endrick's hopes of \"making history\" at the club - like so many compatriots before him - may just come true.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh have requested that Pakistan end their planned boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, opening the door for the fixture to be played on 15 February as scheduled.\n\nThe match, the biggest and most lucrative in cricket, has been in doubt since the Pakistan government advised its team not to take the field against their long-time rivals.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that initial decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, who had a request for their matches to be moved out of India rejected and subsequently pulled out of the tournament.\n\nBut, after talks between officials at the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Lahore on Sunday, BCB president Ameenul Islam requested the match go ahead \"for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem\".\n\n\"We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish,\" he added.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the co-hosts for the tournament with India.\n\nPakistan will forfeit the points from the group-stage match should it not be played but the team's absence from the tournament would also have longer-term consequences for cricket.\n\nIt could lead to disputes over the ICC's current rights deals and continued uncertainty would likely impact future agreements, with the current TV deals set to run out after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nMany of the smaller cricketing nations rely on the money distributed by the ICC, so any cut in revenue would likely hit such countries hardest.\n\n\"Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,\" Islam said.\n\nWhile stopping short of confirming the match will go ahead, the ICC released a statement on Monday evening confirming Bangladesh will not be sanctioned for their boycott.\n\nIt also said Bangladesh will host an ICC event between 2028 and the start of the 2031 World Cup.\n\n\"The ICC, PCB and BCB, along with other members, remain committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport,\" a statement said.\n\n\"All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity.\"\n\nThere were no details on what event Bangladesh would host. All men's events have been confirmed up until 2031, with Bangladesh already scheduled to co-host the 2031 World Cup with India.\n\nThe hosts of women's tournaments have been chosen up to 2027, while the ICC also holds Under-19 World Cups.\n\nThe PCB has been contacted for comment.\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?",

The Sri Lanka team at the end of both innings, that was the difference really.\n\n\"Those 20 runs - they defended well at the back end. We had plenty of wickets in hand, thought we were in good positions the whole way through and they really upped the ante and put the squeeze on.\n\n\"You can sit back and reflect and pick those 20 runs out of anywhere. They were 20 runs better than us throughout the whole match.\"\n\nAustralia are Ireland's next opponents on Wednesday as they chase a top-two finish to secure a place in the Super 8s.\n\nSpin dominated in Sunday's encounter at the R Premadasa Stadium and Stirling believes that could continue in the tournament.\n\n\"I think spin is going to be a challenge in this competition.\n\n\"Certainly, it wasn't coming onto the bat as much as it could have been. Spin is going to be dominating phases of this game.\"",

There was no wild celebration. They had pulled it back from the brink.\n\nDespite all that has happened this winter, they came into this World Cup among the favourites having won 10 of their past 11 T20s.\n\nHad Curran not salvaged the victory, everything - McCullum's future in particular - would have come under the microscope again.\n\nThat is pushed back for another day. England must also be praised for not wilting where other England sides have before.\n\nCurran already appeared to have swung the momentum once.\n\nAfter Nepal reached 124-2, his slower ball stopped Dipendra Singh Airee on 44 as the right-hander was caught at deep over. Captain Rohit Paudel was dismissed by Dawson for 39 in the next over.\n\nBut England's experienced bowlers of Archer and Adil Rashid, who conceded 42 from three overs, struggled, leaving Curran to bowl at the last.\n\nHe did not concede a boundary in the final over, mixing his pace and bowling predominately full.\n\nHe was dropped by England before being recalled at the end of last summer but delivered when needed most.\n\nNepal's players completed a lap of honour in front of their deflated supporters at the end.\n\nThough they have been tipped to cause problems at this World Cup, having beaten West Indies over three matches last year and taken South Africa to the final ball at the 2024 World Cup, they have never beaten a major nation on the world stage.\n\nThey were excellent with the ball too - leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane the pick with 1-25, including the wicket of Tom Banton lbw for two.\n\nOff-spinner Sher Malla had Phil Salt caught off a top edge with his first ball in international cricket and Airee also took two wickets with his off-spin in a fine all-round performance.\n\nJacob Bethell made an entertaining 55 and Brook a well-placed 53 for England, but Nepal's batting was on a par as they swept and scurried.\n\nOn this evidence, and given they play all four matches in Mumbai, they have a real shot at progressing from this group.\n\nAn almighty scare - but are England learning?\n\nMinnows Nepal fall four runs short of shock win over England - as it happened\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - results & fixtures\n\nTMS podcast: England survive World Cup scare against Nepal",

    "description": "Why some subtle signs suggest, despite their scare against Nepal in the T20 World Cup, England might be learning under Harry Brook and Brendon McCullum.",
    "fullText": "England have a recent history of hair-raising starts to World Cups.\n\nThey were pummeled by New Zealand in Ahmedabad in 2023 and smashed around by Scotland at the last T20 World Cup until rain intervened.\n\nIn front of thousands of Nepalese fans at the famous Wankhede Stadium - the ground where England have produced statistically their worst 50-over bowling performance in history and suffered their heaviest T20 defeat - they were one boundary from defeat.\n\nThe impact of a loss to Nepal does not bear thinking about for an England team under the most intense pressure.\n\nThey did not do much wrong when their opponents were seemingly charging towards a seismic victory, with Nepal's inspired batting deserving of huge credit.\n\nBut the tightrope coach Brendon McCullum and captain Harry Brook are walking is so precarious after England's Ashes defeat and Brook's Wellington escapades, a defeat here may have sent them tumbling to new depths.\n\nThe walkie talkie McCullum was seen talking into during Nepal's chase could have become the equivalent of Ruben Amorim's tactics board in the rain during Manchester United's embarrassing Carabao Cup loss at fourth-tier Grimsby Town in August.\n\nInstead, it may be a hint at a coach who is able to change.\n\nReducing McCullum's coaching to its most recognisable image - feet up, sunglasses in place, watching motionless from a balcony somewhere in the world - would always be wrong.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has won more Champions Leagues than Pep Guardiola, no matter how expressive he is or otherwise.\n\nBut McCullum is the coach who has always asked players to rely on instinct.\n\nHe has done most of his work in the background, leaving his players to make the calls in the middle.\n\nHere, he was sending suggestions to his players when the situation squeezed.\n\n\"That's something we've been doing recently - that dressing room to dugout communication,\" said all-rounder Will Jacks afterwards.\n\n\"It is so messages can get run out to the captain or to the guys who are batting in the middle.\n\n\"It's just an easier way of spreading the message.\"\n\nEngland's white-ball outfit appeared too stubborn in their first months under McCullum last year.\n\nWith a bowling attack of Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, they were thrashed by 150 runs in a T20 on this ground a year ago.\n\nThey arrived in India trying to attack with right-arm express pace and that continued through the Champions Trophy where they did not win a game.\n\nSam Curran will never have the pace of Wood nor the height of Overton, but against Nepal, in defending 10 from the final over, he justified his return from the wilderness.\n\nSome will say England were rescued by the man they discarded. You can also credit them for realising the mistake.\n\nBrook gave a hint at England locating their senses when he spoke to the media on Friday.\n\nHe recalled Liam Dawson - another crucial part of this win with his 2-21 aged 35 - in his first move as captain last year.\n\n\"You look at India's side, and they're one of the best sides to play T20 cricket at the minute, and they've got about five spinners,\" said Brook. \"If they're doing that, why don't we have a little bit of a crack at that as well?\"\n\nHe later backtracked, appearing to be wary of the implications of appearing to imitate India, but would it be so bad if England were?\n\nIt was a diversion from previous messaging of always concentrating on themselves.\n\nBrook would probably tell you it is those conversations - dealing with the media and finding the right words - that is the hardest part of captaincy.\n\nIf it was only about the what goes on a cut strip of 22 yards or the green grass around it, there would be no discussion over his future.\n\nOn the field, he has impressed as a young captain and here, not without frights, he came through his toughest test so far.\n\nEngland have often looked leaderless in the field during their sorry recent run at white-ball tournaments - a spell in which they have given up their T20 and 50-over world titles and exited the Champions Trophy without winning - but at the crunch moment here there was little doubt who was in charge.\n\nHe may not have played under him, but Brook referred to the Eoin Morgan book of captaincy by repeatedly holding the ball at the top of a bowler's mark, giving the heart-rate of his player time to settle.\n\nHe also led the conversation in the drinks break late in Nepal's chase, after which they lost two quick wickets.\n\n\"He was very good at keeping level headed,\" admitted Jacks.\n\n\"Jos [Buttler] spoke as well and those experienced guys are crucial when those pressure situations come around.\"\n\nOf course, the caveat remains that with one swing of the bat, one flash off an edge, the story would all have been different.\n\nNepal were hugely impressive, but are still 16th in the world rankings.\n\nTougher tests will come but England teams have crumbled in pressure moments while carrying far less baggage than this one.\n\nThere are just hints, that they may be learning.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 163-6 (20 overs): Kusal Mendis 56* (43); Dockrell 2-17\n\nIreland 143 all out (19.5 overs): Tector 40 (34); Theekshana 3-23\n\nIreland could not overcome a host of errors in the field as they fell 20 runs short of Sri Lanka to lose their T20 World Cup opener.\n\nHaving failed to win a game at this tournament two years ago and never beaten Sri Lanka, Ireland got the desired return from their spinners as the co-hosts were restricted to 104-4 through 16 overs.\n\nGeorge Dockrell was the pick of their bowlers and accounted for the wicket of opener Pathum Nissanka for 24 thanks to a fine catch from skipper Paul Stirling.\n\nThe rest of Ireland's work in the field was not nearly as exemplary, however, with five drops, four of them in the final four overs as Sri Lanka tacked on a further 59 runs, making the chase all the tougher.\n\nDespite an apparent hamstring injury, Wanindu Hasaranga accounted for the key wickets of Ross Adair, Harry Tector and Curtis Campher as Ireland were bowled out for 143 in 19.5 overs.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nSeifert half-century helps NZ beat Afghanistan\n\nEngland deny Nepal in final-ball World Cup thriller\n\nWith Ireland winning the toss and electing to bowl, it was an early test of how the side's spinners would adjust not only to the conditions but superior opposition\n\nThrough a three-match series with Italy and two against the UAE in their preparations, Heinrich Malan's side eventually settled upon a bowling attack missing the out-of-sorts Josh Little.\n\nA change facilitated by the bowling renaissance of Dockrell, the decision to leave out Ireland's most dangerous quick was vindicated as the spinners stymied Sri Lanka in the middle overs.\n\nDockrell led the way with figures of 2-17, ably assisted by Gareth Delany whose one wicket came at the cost of 24 runs. With Sri Lanka 50-1 after the powerplay, eight consecutive overs of spin held them to just 87-4 as they were frustrated.\n\nHaving hit Barry McCarthy's final delivery of the powerplay for four, the co-hosts would not find another boundary until Kamindu Mendis brought up his side's 100 in the 16th over.\n\nWith Sri Lanka having finally saw the back of Delany and Dockrell, the partnership of Kamindu Mendis and Kusal Mendis were belatedly able to accelerate ahead, although they were helped in no small part by Irish errors in the field.\n\nThere were three drops in the space of four 17th-inning deliveries from Matthew Humphreys, who will feel his figures of 0-44 should come with an asterisk.\n\nWith Sri Lanka powering from 104-4 to 163-6 across the final four overs of their innings, Ireland's target was much tougher.\n\nWhile Ross Adair always felt the most likely to open the batting with Paul Stirling, there was still a decision to be made between the 31-year-old and Tim Tector coming into this tournament.\n\nAfter averaging 14 across the five warm-ups at the top of the order, Ireland's faith in the man who hit a T20 century against South Africa in 2024 again appeared wholly justified when, despite some less than aesthetic moments, he quickly motored to 34 thanks to five fours and a six.\n\nBut, after contributing two of those five drops in Sri Lanka's innings, Adair had another moment to forget when taking a wild heave at the bowling of a hobbling Hasaranga and having his stumps uprooted.\n\nWithout the thump of Adair and Stirling, who was earlier out for six after facing 13 balls, Ireland relied upon the running of Lorcan Tucker and Tector to keep the game in the balance.\n\nThe required run-rate was always on the rise though and, as Ireland tried to find the accelerator, miscues followed in their attempts to find the boundaries.\n\nThings get no easier in Group B with Ireland set to face Australia on Wednesday (09:30 GMT), while Sri Lanka are next in action a day later against Oman (05:30 GMT).",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn's Winter Olympic dream ended in screams of pain on Sunday after she crashed out of the women's downhill, failing in her audacious bid to medal in her favoured discipline at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe American star had been trying to claim the fourth Olympic medal of her career despite suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee just over a week ago, but her race ended after just 13 seconds in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nShe cried in anguish and pain after her awful fall high up the course, medical staff surrounding the distraught 41-year-old on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste where has enjoyed much success in the past.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic downhill champion hit the firm snow face first soon after pushing off from the gate.\n\nShe then rolled down the slope with her skis still attached, which could likely cause further serious damage to her knee.\n\nVonn's Olympic dream now lies in tatters after her brave effort to achieve the seemingly impossible, an attempt which ended with her being taken away in a helicopter as fans in the stands saluted her with loud applause.\n\nHer US teammate Breezy Johnson, sitting in the leader's chair, held her face in shock. At the time Vonn crashed, Johnson, the world downhill champion, was in front of Germany's Emma Aicher by just 0.04sec following her powerful run.\n\nJohan Eliasch, the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) who was watching the race in Cortina, said Vonn's crash was \"tragic, but it's ski racing I'm afraid\".\n\n\"And I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport because this race has been the talk of the Games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"I hope she will have a speedy recovery and back on skis very, very soon.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to say she shouldn't have been racing today (with) that type of injury. It's obviously her decision.\"\n\nOne of world sport's most recognisable faces and an alpine skiing icon, Vonn has insisted that she could not only compete but win against the world's best women skiers, some of whom like Aicher are nearly half her age.\n\nVonn said ahead of the Games that she was planning on also competing in the team combined event on Tuesday and the super-G two days later.\n\nBut that now looks unlikely, a potential long lay-off perhaps heralding the end of her comeback to skiing in her early 40s.\n\nVonn retired in 2019 but returned to compeition in November 2024 following surgery to partially replace her right knee to end persistent pain.\n\nHad she not crashed in the last World Cup downhill ahead of the Olympics, in Crans Montana at the end of January, Vonn would have been a serious contender for gold in Cortina.\n\nVonn had finished on the podium in every previous World Cup downhill race this season, including two victories in St. Moritz and Zauchensee, and claimed two more top-three finishes in the super-G.\n\nBut retirement looms for Vonn following a disastrous end to one of the biggest stories of the Winter Olympics.",

    "description": "World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick can learn from France.",
    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales, Tommy Freeman's performance at centre and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick could learn from his France counterpart.\n\nThere was a time, maybe a couple of years ago, when the England shirt used to weigh heavy on the players.\n\nThe pressure seemed to inhibit them. They were not expressing themselves. Everything was safety-first and a bit meek.\n\nNow, that England shirt seems to make the players double in size. They have embraced this team and this stage and are relishing showing the Allianz Stadium crowd what they are capable of.\n\nThey are enjoying their rugby. And we are enjoying watching them.\n\nPerversely, it is because the mood is so good around the team that coach Steve Borthwick and the players can be so focused on the bits and pieces which went wrong in the 48-7 win over Wales to open their Six Nations campaign.\n\nThere were no cartwheels or laps of honour after the final whistle. The players looked like they were happy with the win but focused on the next task - and aware that they will have to be better when they take on a wounded Scotland in Edinburgh on Saturday.\n\nTommy Freeman is rapidly approaching world-class status.\n\nThe package that he brings to Test rugby - the pace, size, aerial ability and appetite for the ball - is pretty special.\n\nHe was a starter for the British and Irish Lions in all three Tests against Australia in the summer and he is inked into this England team as one of those who will always have a place when fit.\n\nHowever, there is a question over which number Borthwick will write next to Freeman's name.\n\nThis was Freeman's 23rd England appearance but only his third as a centre.\n\nConsidering that relatively paltry midfield experience, he was pretty damn good against Wales.\n\nHe hit superb lines, either hitting the ball up bravely into the heart of Wales defence or acting as a decoy, and worked instinctively with Northampton team-mate Fraser Dingwall inside him at 12.\n\nThey are turning into a dangerous and cohesive pairing - and England have been crying out for a midfield combination with those qualities for ages.\n\nWhere once the supply of centres was quite low, there are now a bunch of alternatives.\n\nOllie Lawrence, who is working his way back from a minor knee injury, may be available for Scotland. Max Ojomoh was very impressive against Argentina in the autumn. Seb Atkinson has credit in the bank from his performances on the summer tour of Argentina.\n\nIt means England can mix and match according to the opposition.\n\nDo they want a punch in midfield or the ability to distribute quickly into wide channels? Gas around the outside or the ability to probe behind with kicks?\n\nThe ability to change tactics with different midfield selection is very, very exciting.\n\nSouth Africa - the gold standard for everyone in world rugby at the moment - have the same.\n\nThe mix of Damian de Allende, Jesse Kriel, Canan Moodie, Damian Willemse and even Andre Esterhuizen gives them different ways of playing.\n\nThat adaptability is a fantastic attribute for any team.\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nSame old story for sorry Wales in Six Nations\n\nInevitably, Henry Arundell's first-half hat-trick for England caught the eye against Wales, but it will have been the smaller details that most impressed Borthwick.\n\nDefensively, Arundell has been questioned in the past, but he was strong in that area against Wales.\n\nWhen you see him up close, he is strong and solid, as well as fast. He packs 15st 2lb into a 6ft frame and is physical and intimidating in defence. But he is also canny.\n\nHis positioning was good against Wales. He did not step out of shape and get isolated, as he has done previously.\n\nHis six months or so at Bath, under Johann van Graan and defence coach JP Ferreira, have really brought Arundell's game on in that respect.\n\nLate in the game, with England well over the horizon and the win secure, he also came in off his wing, looking for work and holes to exploit with his pace.\n\nThat is another side of his game that is developing. He is no longer only hanging out on the edge, waiting for the ball to come to him.\n\nAfter France and England's dominant first-round performances, the expectation around their final-round meeting in Paris on 14 March has risen another notch.\n\nBut you would be foolish to draw a straight line from this opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider on the final one.\n\nThere are going to be tougher moments for each side before that. The test will be how they react to being under the pump, away from home in tricky conditions. Scotland showed how hard that can be during their defeat by Italy on Saturday.\n\nBorthwick will not be looking too far ahead, but one lesson he can already take from France is the ability to create competitive internal environments.\n\nOpposite number Fabien Galthie shook up his squad selection for the tournament, leaving out established players Damian Penaud, Gael Fickou and Gregory Alldritt. Perhaps they will come back in for later fixtures. Perhaps not.\n\nBut the new faces - and the sense of playing for your place - pushed France to a great performance against Ireland.\n\nBorthwick now has the depth to be as bold in his team selection. That is a wonderful place to be.",

    "fullText": "With the World Cup four months away, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent on Saturday.\n\nThe Chelsea forward scored a first-half hat-trick as the Blues beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves 3-1 to remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish.\n\nTwo of those goals were penalties, with Palmer displaying his typically ice-cool demeanour to send the goalkeeper the wrong way both times.\n\nPalmer has been dogged by a groin injury this season, and the three goals almost doubled his tally for the campaign - going from four Premier League goals to seven.\n\nThe performance also puts him firmly in the England squad conversation.\n\n\"If he's impacting games, like we know he can, from now to the end of the season, he's a sure thing to be in the squad,\" former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He can play wide, he can play as a 10. He's just so good on the ball and classy and simply doesn't fear anybody.\n\n\"Even if you bring him off the bench, you know he can do unbelievable things. He can win you a game in a heartbeat.\"\n\nPalmer celebrated his opening goal against Wolves by covering his ears - a response, perhaps, to recent reports suggesting he is unsettled in London.\n\nThe former Manchester City player has had a difficult campaign in which injury has seen him in and out of the side, while under new head coach Liam Rosenior he has had his playing minutes carefully managed.\n\nSince Rosenior became Chelsea boss at the start of this year he has often faced questions about Palmer's form, fitness and state of mind.\n\nThis performance provided something of a direct response to those questions, but key for Palmer will be keeping it up.\n\n\"We know what a world-class player he is. He's played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"When he's at his best, he's unstoppable. I'm delighted to be working with him.\"\n\nThis is, after all, a player who scored twice in the Club World Cup final less than six months ago, and across the two seasons prior to this one totted up 37 Premier League goals.\n\nIf Palmer can now build momentum, he will be hitting form at just the right time.\n\nHe was a key player for England at Euro 2024 but has made just one appearance under current boss Thomas Tuchel - in a 1-0 win against Andorra last June.\n\nInjuries have been a factor, but there is also competition for places - with the likes of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham rivalling him for the number 10 role.\n\n\"At the moment it looks like Morgan Rogers and Jude Bellingham will be the two who are ahead of him,\" said former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Final Score.\n\n\"I'd be looking to find a way to get him in the side.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would select Palmer for England, former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton was a little more blunt: \"Not at the minute, no. I'd play Rogers.\"\n\nEngland have two more friendlies lined up before the World Cup - against Uruguay on 27 March and Japan four days later - so that international camp will offer a big chance for players such as Palmer to impress Tuchel.\n\n\"I don't think Cole [Palmer] is at his best yet,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Like a lot of players, when you have had a bad injury and you've had quite a lot of time out, it does take game time to get your rhythm and your sharpness back.\n\n\"He really needs to start playing regularly to force his way into the England squad and team, because at the moment with Morgan Rogers doing what he's doing, and other players playing well, he's got a battle on his hands.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Ireland have a string of disappointing T20 World Cups behind them and will need to repeat their giant-killings of the past to buck the trend in Sri Lanka and India.",
    "fullText": "Whether it be the unforgettable St. Patrick's Day against Pakistan in 2007, or Kevin O'Brien thumping a rapid century to beat England four years later, Ireland's history at World Cups is one built upon giant killings.\n\nBut if those historic days, and a few more besides against the likes of West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, all helped to create a reputation for over-performance at global showpieces, it has been a contrasting story at T20 World Cups.\n\nIndeed, as Ireland prepare to start their 2026 campaign against co-hosts Sri Lanka on Sunday, the presence of Oman in their group is a reminder that in the shorter format, the shoe has more often been on the other foot.\n\nIt was 10 years ago in India that defeat by the tournament debutants first up sent Ireland on their way to one of their six early exits from eight attempts, while it was the same old story in the USA last time around when a 12-run loss to Canada, with an assist from the weather, did the damage.\n\nWith Australia to follow Sri Lanka this time around, before facing Oman and then Zimbabwe in Pool B, if Heinrich Malan's side are to reverse the trend in the coming 10 days, they must ensure they are again the ones administering the shocks rather than finding themselves on the receiving end.\n\nSaturday, 8 February 2026, 13:30 GMT\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text with in-play clips.\n\nWhile Ireland lost three of their six scheduled T20s to the weather during a wholly frustrating home summer in 2025, in the months since they have at least had the benefit of regular cricket.\n\nHarry Tector and Matthew Humphreys led the way for an encouraging T20 win over Bangladesh in November before consecutive losses to surrender the series gave the impression of a side who had run out of steam at the end of the multi-format tour.\n\nA 2-1 series win over Italy followed by a two-game whitewash of the UAE have formed the bulk of preparations for the World Cup, but a final tune-up against Pakistan on Wednesday fell victim to the rain, robbing the side of the chance to step up against the sort of superior opposition they will face in their first two games in Sri Lanka.\n\nAcross the five warm-up games in Dubai, there is the sense that the side have chanced upon their optimum line-up for the conditions in Sri Lanka, although perhaps the solution involved the loss of form one of their leading lights.\n\nTector and Humphreys continue to lead the way with bat and ball respectively, with the former averaging 43 across his past eight T20 internationals to form a strong middle-order with wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker.\n\nRoss Adair, who still has Ireland's most recent T20 century to his name thanks to his knock against South Africa in 2024, appears to have held off the challenge of the younger Tector brother, Tim, to open alongside captain Paul Stirling.\n\nDespite the skipper averaging 20 across the 16 T20s Ireland have played since the last World Cup, the 35-year-old remains the side's best player against the spin bowling they are sure to face in Sri Lankan conditions.\n\nThe bowling resurgence of veteran all-rounder George Dockrell - who took four wickets for 53 runs from 13 overs in the warm-ups - allows for the lengthening of the batting line-up where 23-year-old Ben Calitz will be relied upon to provide some left-handed thump.\n\nIt is all, however, expected to be at the expense of a genuine quick. An out-of-sorts Josh Little did not feature in either match against the UAE after not managing a wicket in two games against both Bangladesh and Italy with an economy rate ranging between 9.50 and 13.50.\n\nThe player who took a memorable T20 World Cup hat-trick against New Zealand in 2022, and indeed had figures of 4-23 against Sunday's opposition a year prior, looks likely to start the tournament outside the starting XI.\n\nWith Mark Adair, Ireland's leading T20 wicket-taker there to shoulder the load in terms of seam, it means Malan's selection can all, in one way or another, take some confidence from their preparations.\n\nWhether that transfers to facing the likes of Sri Lanka and Australia, however, will be the determining factor in Ireland's efforts.\n\nAustralia's Hazlewood ruled out of T20 World Cup\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group C, Kolkata\n\nWest Indies 182-5 (20 overs): Hetmyer 64 (36); Currie 2-23\n\nScotland 147 (18.5 overs): Berrington 42 (24), Shepherd 5-20\n\nScotland began their T20 World Cup campaign with a 35-run defeat by two-time champions West Indies at Eden Gardens, undone by Shimron Hetmyer's blistering half‑century and Romario Shepherd's five-wicket haul.\n\nHaving been drafted into the tournament late following Bangladesh's boycott, the Scots had their moments but ultimately failed to match the quality of their opponents, who were winners in 2012 and 2016.\n\nA fourth-place finish at last summer's Europe Qualifier had looked to have cost Scotland a place at the 2026 edition, but handed a second chance, they proved they were not out of place on the big stage.\n\nChasing 183, the Scots were 37-3 in the sixth over when captain Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce came together in the middle and briefly ignited hopes of an upset.\n\nThe pair added 78 for the fourth wicket, with Berrington leading from the front with 42 from 24 balls but his departure with the score at 115-4 stalled their momentum.\n\nWest Indies then all but sealed the victory as Shepherd took four wickets in the 17th over, including a sensational hat-trick, to finish with 5-20.\n\nOpting to bowl first, Scotland restricted West Indies to 182‑5 - a total they would have gladly accepted going into the final overs after coming under pressure from the brutal hitting of Windies duo Hetmyer and Rovman Powell.\n\nMaking their sixth appearance in the tournament, Scotland held their nerve through the powerplay as West Indies crawled to 33-0 before they struck twice in quick succession through Michael Leask and debutant Oliver Davidson.\n\nOff-spinner Leask made the breakthrough in the ninth over to dismiss Windies skipper Shai Hope before Davidson, the 21-year-old left-armer, accounted for Brandon King, who had settled in well with a 30-ball 35, in the following over.\n\nWest Indies found themselves 66-2 at the halfway stage of their innings but some explosive batting from Hetmyer swung the momentum back in their favour with Powell also joining in with 24 from 14 balls.\n\nHetmyer, meanwhile, raced to his half-century in 22 balls and it needed a fantastic catch from Brandon McMullen at wide long-on to send back the batter in the penultimate over after a quickfire 64 from 36 balls.\n\nBut by then, the Windies were well and truly in command, and despite some tidy death bowling from Brad Currie, who finished with figures of 2‑23, they posted a total that proved out of Scotland's reach.\n\nT20 World Cup: Shepherd takes hat-trick as Windies blow away Scotland - as it happened\n\nScotland may have been late additions to the T20 World Cup but Hetmyer was an even later arrival to India, only reaching Kolkata on the eve of West Indies' opener because of issues with his visa.\n\nBut you would not have known it from his daring innings at Eden Gardens as the 29‑year‑old Guyanese left‑hander showed no hints of jet lag as he went about dismantling Scotland's plans.\n\nHetmyer's 22-ball half-century was the fastest ever by a West Indies player at the T20 World Cup, breaking Chris Gayle's previous record from 23 balls against Australia in 2009.\n\nHe hit 40 of his first 52 runs in boundaries, and with support from Powell and Sherfane Rutherford who powered to a 13-ball 26, guided his team through a blistering middle phase as they went from 66-2 in 10 overs to 138-2 with five overs to go.\n\nHetmyer himself produced a brilliant one-handed catch to dismiss Scotland opener George Munsey early on but it was Shepherd who grabbed the limelight with the ball for the Windies.\n\nWith Scotland on 132-5 and needing 51 off 24, the all-rounder took four wickets in five balls to leave them reeling at 133-9.\n\nShepherd dismissed Matthew Cross, Leask and Davidson for his hat-trick before also picking up Safyaan Sharif's wicket for the first five-for of his T20I career and giving West Indies a platform to build on as they eye a record third title.\n\nThey will next be action against England in Mumbai on Wednesday, 11 February while Scotland meet Italy on Monday, 9 February.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - fixtures\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Bowler Shubham Ranjane, one of five India-born players in USA's XI, was the guilty party low in his follow-through.\n\nThe India captain punished the miss with a brilliant 84 not out from 49 balls, countering the situation perfectly by starting slowly before unfurling thrilling scoops and flicks to drag the hosts to 161-9.\n\nThat denied the underdogs any momentum and India seamers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the first four overs of the chase to reduce the US to 13-3.\n\nAs the required run-rate climbed, the expectant locals grew more comfortable and the US scrapped to 132-8 in their 20 overs without ever threatening to complete the chase.\n\nIt means, after an entertaining opening day in which the Netherlands were a dropped catch away from stunning Pakistan and Scotland threatened West Indies, India set the early pace at the top of Group A as expected in this World Cup.\n\nEngland enter the tournament on Sunday with a fixture against Nepal at 09:30 GMT. Ireland play Sri Lanka in Colombo at 13:30.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nIndia's margin of victory was, in the end, comfortable.\n\nMake no mistake, however. The upset, which would have topped USA's super over win over Pakistan at the last T20 World Cup, was on at one stage.\n\nThe home crowd was quiet and in the 13th over Suryakumar and Axar Patel were at the crease with only three tailenders remaining.\n\nThe US, who have not played a T20 since April amid governance issues and are ranked 18th in the world, bowled superbly.\n\nIndia opener Abhishek Sharma, many people's tip for player of the tournament, slashed his first ball to deep cover and when South Africa-born seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk mixed his pace to take three wickets in the sixth over, including Tilak Verma and Shivam Dube in consecutive deliveries, the hosts were 46-4.\n\nSuryakumar - known by his nickname SKY - defended Van Schalkwyk's hat-trick ball and took only five runs from his first 10 deliveries and 20 from his first 21.\n\nHis team-mates all struggled to time the ball but he took time to feel comfortable, putting on 41 with Axar.\n\nMaking the most of the reprieve by Ranjane, Suryakumar was playing trademark sweeps off seamers for six and tumbling scoops by the end with the US hurt by the loss of Ali Khan to injury with two of his overs unbowled.\n\nIndia's captain took 20 runs from the last over, meaning he ended the innings with 10 runs more than the 74 his team-mates managed combined.\n\nIt was a spectacular and much-needed knock.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Former German World Cup winner Thomas Müller is yet to decide when he will end his glittering playing career.\n\nMüller has a contract at Major League Soccer side Vancouver Whitecaps until the end of the year by when he will be 37. He joined the Canadian side last summer after 25 trophy-laden years at Bayern Munich.\n\n\"As always in my life, I don't commit myself unnecessarily. My\n main motivation for playing football is to enjoy it. The first few months here have been a lot of fun. Now my first full season is coming up,\" Müller told Germany's Welt paper.\n\nMüller named his fitness and health a key criteria, saying: \"How will my body cope with the whole journey? I struggled a bit towards the end of last season. That's another reason why I haven't fully made up my mind yet.\"\n\nMüller, who was speaking from a training camp in the southern Spanish city of Marbella where the Whitecaps are preparing for the new season, said he still enjoys the role of a player.\n\n\"Having the opportunity to decide a home game in the 90th minute with a penalty, feeling that pressure and having the chance to move so many people's emotions with one action when you score – that's still worth going to bed earlier for,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I'll just skip the cocktail and have still water instead.\"\n\nBayern hope that Müller will return to the club in a new capacity once he has ended his playing career but he said that nothing is decided yet.\n\n\"The connection to FC Bayern is still there, both emotionally and in terms of content,\" he said.\n\n\"And we have discussed with the club management that there is a possibility of going down a joint path in the future. There is no letter of intent or even a term sheet yet. I don't want to do my coaching licence now (while still playing) or start a degree.\"\n\nMüller said \"I want to consciously pursue my education\" after the playing career, \"instead of frantically trying to get a certificate on the side.\n\n\"When I do something, I give it one hundred per cent. I don't want to expect myself or anyone else to get anything less than my full passion, energy and attention.\"",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has indicated the knee injury that scuppered Jean-Philippe Mateta's planned move to AC Milan could also thwart the striker's \"dream\" of playing at the World Cup.\n\nMateta was on the verge of joining Milan for £30m on deadline day, but the deal was called off after knee issues emerged over the course of two medical examinations.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been dealing with the injury to his right knee during the first half of the season.\n\n\"We knew and he knew there was an issue. He was not really pleased,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We took a higher risk, that's why he could play in most games, but we rested him for some games and some training sessions.\n\n\"To be honest it was not a big surprise to everyone that he could fail [the medical]. We knew that this can happen and he knew it.\"\n\nFrance international Mateta has yet to decide what his next steps should be, with this summer's World Cup on his mind.\n\n\"There are two ways we can do this: manage the knee like we have until after the World Cup, which is Mateta's dream to play in. The other one is he undergoes surgery,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We don't know how long he would be out. There are a few predictions: it could be two months, three months, six to nine months. There are many opinions, but it is about doing the right thing and we will decide next week.\"\n\nMateta ruptured his meniscus in 2019 when playing for Mainz and spent about six months on the sidelines following surgery. A similar absence this time would end his World Cup hopes, with the tournament just four months away.\n\nMateta faces uncertain future for club and country\n\nPalace criticised over collapse of move for McNeil\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nDespite retaining Mateta, who is Palace's top scorer with eight league goals this season, the Eagles paid a club record fee to sign striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves.\n\nPalace were also on the verge of bringing in Everton winger Dwight McNeil until the deal fell through late on deadline day.\n\nGlasner said he had \"learned to accept situations\" after Palace were also unsuccessful in finding a replacement for captain and centre-back Marc Guehi, who joined Manchester City earlier in the window.\n\n\"At the end of it, the club tried everything with huge offers and huge bids for a Marc Guehi replacement, but clubs said they don't sell on deadline day,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"Credit to the club that without getting any money for Mateta they still spent a big fee on Strand Larsen.\n\n\"On the other side, McNeil was the last one we thought we could finalise, but in the last minutes the terms of the deal changed again and the deal failed. I expected him and planned for him in the next day's training.\"\n\nMcNeil's partner, Megan Sharpley, criticised Crystal Palace on social media for the way they handled the situation.\n\nEverton boss David Moyes said the breakdown had \"nothing to do\" with his club and insists McNeil is \"fine\".\n\n\"He's in and he's training as well, so Dwight's OK,\" Moyes said.\n\n\"We understand exactly where it went wrong, how it broke down. He knows everything about it and there's no problems there.\n\n\"We had given permission for Dwight to go and have a medical and do all of the things required for it, so it was very hard to do much more than we have done.\"\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "With much of the cricketing world apathetic towards this T20 World Cup, England captain Harry Brook and coach Brendon McCullum need it more than most.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-nine days since Sydney and the final ball of the Ashes - barely enough time for some of England's players to return home.\n\nControversy has made no attempt to return to its box over the weeks that have passed. One positive for England is they are not alone in struggling to keep it in check.\n\nAhead stands a World Cup - the 10th in the T20 format and fourth since the Covid-19 pandemic - which few seem to want but one plenty, captain Harry Brook, coach Brendon McCullum and their England team included, need.\n\nThe cricket, which begins on Saturday with Scotland and India among those in action, will be entertaining over the next four weeks, make no mistake.\n\nWatching this sport in India, especially when the home team are involved, is one of the game's thrills.\n\nSri Lanka will offer plenty as co-hosts too and the expansion to 20 teams, which this time allows Italy to make their major tournament bow, was one of the triumphs of the 2024 edition in the Caribbean.\n\nBut this tournament begins under the darkest of clouds.\n\nBangladesh have decided not to be there. Unless there is a late change of heart, Pakistan are not going to play India in Sri Lanka under instruction from their government.\n\nEight months ago, South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen and West Indies' Nicholas Pooran, two of the best and most sought-after batters in the T20 game, called time on their international careers.\n\nAged 33 and 29 respectively, they opted for the franchise world.\n\nWould that happen so close to a major tournament if the draw of a World Cup was as strong as it once was?\n\nA factor in these issues is, in part at least, the oversaturation of cricket's major events.\n\nAdd in the 50-over World Cup in 2023, last year's Champions Trophy and four women's World Cups, there have been 10 such tournaments in little over four years.\n\nBut the wider mess, one absorbing an increasing amount of the subcontinent and which will threaten the future stability of the sport if not resolved, is a result of years of weak management.\n\nPolitical posturing has not crept into cricket slowly over the past three months.\n\nIt has stamped all over it for a decade, all while the International Cricket Council stood and watched.\n\nIndia played the Champions Trophy in Dubai rather than Pakistan as scheduled – an issue predictable from the moment the hosts were selected.\n\nBangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman was then removed from the Indian Premier League without explanation at the start of the year, kicking off this latest crisis.\n\nThe easiest option has been taken at every turn. This is the result.\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?\n\nEngland's issues may not run so deep, but they are no less pressing.\n\nThe talk of the past four weeks has been of nights out, clockings and identifying who was in a New Zealand nightclub and who was not.\n\nWhat happened in Wellington is English cricket's latest drama.\n\nThe controversies also overshadowed an impressive two-week tour of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThey were asked to be smarter after the Ashes and clinched the subsequent T20 series by winning on a road, before sealing a 3-0 whitewash on a slow turner - all in conditions in which they will play their entire Super 8 phase, should they progress through the initial stage of this World Cup.\n\nYet the narrative has remained focused on Brook.\n\nMcCullum said this week his captain's escapades in New Zealand have been spoken about too much. Some supporters may agree.\n\nWhile naive not to expect it to emerge, choosing not to reveal the incident from the start was fair. Brook was punished with a heavy fine in any case.\n\nBut by lying in his apology and those untruths not being immediately corrected afterwards, Brook and England only ensured the spotlight returned to their off-field activities.\n\nThe tight turnaround between the Ashes and World Cup was always one obvious stumbling block for those who would have already sacked Brook and McCullum.\n\nThere was no time for another coach to be found, but after this there are three months before England's men play again - plenty of time for replacement feet to get under the table if results are poor again.\n\nOf course, there is a scenario where McCullum simply sees the break as the time to walk away - though he maintained his desire to stay on earlier this week.\n\nThe New Zealander's takeaway from his only previous white-ball tournament in charge of England - when his side exited the Champions Trophy without winning a match - was that the players cared too much.\n\n\"If anything they are too harsh on themselves,\" he said. \"They need to be able to give themselves a break and be able to let go a little bit so all of that talent can come out.\"\n\nNavigating that, given the scrutiny around a perceived relaxed, care-free environment and his bosses' wish for change, appears a difficult challenge.\n\nFor McCullum and Brook, reaching the semi-finals in the first week of March is the minimum requirement. Having won 10 of their past 11 completed T20s, they should be capable.\n\nDoing so in 2024 was not enough to save the job of McCullum's predecessor as white-ball coach, Australian Matthew Mott, so much will also be about how England play.\n\nWill they, unlike in the Caribbean, truly challenge the best?\n\nThey have been billed as serious contenders once this winter and failed miserably.\n\nWhether to secure futures or merely change the narrative, England must hope those 29 days since Sydney have provided the time to ensure they do not do so again.\n\nTop run-scorer, wicket-taker and champion - T20 World Cup predictions\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "Several Italy internationals moved clubs during the January transfer window, but which ones will be hoping to earn more regular minutes ahead of a potential World Cup campaign in the summer of 2026?\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – JANUARY 25: Giacomo Raspdori of Atalanta celebrates scoring his team’s third goal with teammate Nikola Krstovic of Atalanta during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and Parma Calcio 1913 at Gewiss Stadium on January 25, 2026 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGiacomo Raspadori is back in Serie A after a short-lived, six-month spell in LaLiga with Atletico Madrid. The two-time Scudetto winner struggled to break into Diego Simeone’s first-team plans in the Spanish capital and was limited to just one start from a possible 18 league matches prior to his joining Atalanta.\n\nRaspadori has already featured in two Serie A matches for Atalanta, starting and scoring in their most recent match against Pisa, which ended in a resounding 4-0 victory for La Dea.\n\nHe has already been a regular in Gennaro Gattuso’s Italy national team squad and now just needs a consistent run of games before becoming a sure-fire pick for the 2026 World Cup squad assuming that Italy qualify.\n\nOfficial: Lorenzo Lucca joins Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy from Napoli (picture: www.nottinghamforest.co.uk)\n\nIt had been a disappointing season at Napoli for the towering centre-forward, who has since joined Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy.\n\nNapoli brought in both Lucca and Rasmus Hojlund to strengthen their options at centre-forward over the summer, but even after a serious injury to Romelu Lukaku the week before the season began, Lucca was limited to just four starts in Serie A and none since the end of October.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Lucca will become a regular starter in the Premier League under Sean Dyche, but if he is given regular minutes, he will certainly be an option for Gattuso to consider in Italy’s slightly understocked centre-forward department.\n\nDaniel Maldini wears the Lazio jersey\n\nAnother attacker hoping to impress ahead of the World Cup is Daniel Maldini, who joined Lazio on loan with a potential obligation to buy from Atalanta during the January window.\n\nThe son of Italy legend Paolo Maldini was limited to just three Serie A starts with Atalanta during the first half of the season, but looks set to be handed more consistent opportunities under Maurizio Sarri at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nThere have even been suggestions that Sarri could look to deploy Maldini as a false nine.\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JANUARY 27: Marco Brescianini of ACF Fiorentina battles for the ball with Nico Paz of Como 1907 during the Coppa Italia match between of ACF Fiorentina and of Como 1907 at Stadio Artemio Franchi on January 27, 2026 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)\n\nAnother Italy international who left Atalanta in January was Brescianini, who has joined Fiorentina on loan with an option and potential obligation to buy.\n\nBrescianini has already earned more minutes over his first four games with Fiorentina than he had done in his last four months with Atalanta, earning his first league start since October during La Viola’s recent 2-1 loss against Napoli.\n\nBrescianini still faces a difficult task to break into the Italy midfield department with stiff competition from the likes of Nicolo Barella, Sandro Tonali, Manuel Locatelli, Davide Frattesi, Bryan Cristante and Samuele Ricci.\n\nOfficial: Diego Coppola joins Paris FC from Brighton & Hove Albion (@Diegocoppolass via Instagram)\n\nDiego Coppola has taken the decision to move away from the Premier League after six months on the south coast with Brighton and Hove Albion. He had to wait until December to earn his first starts in the English top flight, and has since joined Paris FC on loan, where he will team up with fellow Italy representatives Ciro Immobile and Luca Koleosho.\n\nCoppola has two Italy caps to his name at the age of 22, and will be hoping for more regular minutes in Ligue 1 to challenge the likes of Alessandro Bastoni, Alessandro Buongiorno, Riccardo Calafiori and Gianluca Mancini for a spot in a potential World Cup squad.",

    "fullText": "It is almost time for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nIndia head into the tournament as defending champions following their success in the Caribbean and United States in 2024.\n\nThey are strong favourites in their home conditions - but the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket makes for an exciting tournament.\n\nHere is a full guide to the 10th edition of the men's 20-over global showpiece.\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup starts on 7 February at 05:30 GMT with Pakistan facing the Netherlands in Colombo.\n\nIt is one of three games on the opening day, with the West Indies v Scotland at 09:30 and India v USA at 15:30.\n\nThe initial 20-team group stage, that sees four groups of five, continues until 20 February, with three games every day at the same times as above, bar the final day when there is just one game at 13:30.\n\nThe Super 8s follow with one or two games a day at 09:30 and 13:30, before the semi-finals across 4 and 5 March.\n\nThe final is on Sunday, 8 March at 13:30 BST in Ahmedabad.\n\nFull T20 World Cup fixture list including start times and venues\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup follows the same format as 2024, which was the tournament's biggest with 20 sides taking part.\n\nAll of the teams are involved from the off in an initial group stage, with each side playing four games and the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nThe Super 8s, which will take place across India and Sri Lanka, will consist of two groups of four, with eight sides seeded to help with the planning and schedule.\n\nThose eight sides are: Australia, India, South Africa, West Indies (Group 1) and England, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Group 2).\n\nShould those sides progress they will go into their respective group based on their seeding, rather than their finishing position in the initial group phase.\n\nIn the Super 8s, the top two teams progress to the semi-finals with the winner of each group facing the runner-up in the other.\n\nThroughout both phases teams are awarded two points for a win, one for a no result and zero for a loss. There's no ties in T20 cricket - more on that below!\n\nAll 12 Test-playing nations have qualified for the tournament after Zimbabwe came through their qualifying stage.\n\nItaly are the only tournament debutants, while Canada are at their first global tournament since 2014.\n\nScotland were a late replacement for Bangladesh, who pulled out of the tournament after the governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), refused to meet their request to play their matches in Sri Lanka rather than India due to safety concerns amid rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nScotland, who were the highest-ranked side to not qualify, took Bangladesh's place in Group C and will fulfill their fixtures as scheduled.\n\nPakistan also considered a full boycott, but their government has decided it can play in the tournament, apart from the game against India on 15 February. The impact of that decision is yet to be communicated by the ICC.\n\nThey will play their games in Sri Lanka as part of an agreement reached in 2024 around India and Pakistan matches not being played in the other country.\n\nThe 20 sides are split into the following four groups in the initial phase:\n\nGroup A: India (X1), Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan (Y3), USA\n\nGroup B: Australia (X2), Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka (Y4), Zimbabwe\n\nGroup C: England (Y1), Italy, Nepal, Scotland, West Indies (X3)\n\nGroup D: Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand (Y2), South Africa (X4), United Arab Emirates\n\nFull squad lists for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup\n\nA total of eight venues are being used - five in India and three in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn India, Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will host games.\n\nR Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground - both in Colombo - and Pallekele Cricket Stadium put on matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium, which holds 132,000 fans and is the biggest cricket venue in the world, is due to host the final, unless Pakistan qualify, with the game then moved to Colombo.\n\nThe tournament is played in a T20 format, so both teams will face 20 overs unless they are bowled out beforehand or the team batting second reaches their target before then.\n\nEach innings will start with a six-over powerplay and there are different fielding restrictions in that phase.\n\nMatches should last three hours and 10 minutes, with each innings allocated one hour and 25 minutes and separated by a 20-minute interval.\n\nIn limited-overs cricket there is a 'stop-clock' meaning the bowling side must be ready to bowl each over within 60 seconds of the previous one finishing.\n\nEach side will be allowed two unsuccessful reviews per innings.\n\nShould the number of runs scored by each team be level after 20 overs, the match will go to a super over (each team will face six balls - highest score wins). If that finishes a tie then super overs will continue to be played until a winner is found.\n\nIn the two group phases a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, but that rises to 10 overs in the semi-finals and final.\n\nIf a match is halted after that point due to weather conditions then DLS (Duckworth Lewis Stern method) will be used to decide the winner.\n\nThe ICC are yet to publish playing conditions around reserve days and extra time allocated to the knockout matches.\n\nIf Pakistan reach the semi-finals, Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium will replace Kolkata as the venue for the first semi-final, while the final would also move if Pakistan qualify.\n\nIf India make the last four and face any side that is not Pakistan, they will play in the second semi-final in Mumbai on 5 March.\n\nGlossary of cricket terms including DLS and powerplay\n\nThere have been six winners of the nine Men's T20 World Cups.

    "fullText": "Under-19 World Cup, final, Harare\n\nIndia 411-9 (50.0 overs): Suryavanshi 175 (80); Minto 3-63\n\nIndia teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a stunning 175 from just 80 balls in the Under-19 World Cup final against England.\n\nThe 14-year-old hammered 15 sixes and 15 fours at a strike rate of 218.75 during a brutal and breathtaking knock at the Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe scored 24 off his first 24 balls, meaning his last 151 runs came off just 56 deliveries.\n\nSuryavanshi's 126-minute stay at the crease was eventually ended by England seamer Manny Lumsden in the 26th over to leave India 251-3.\n\nLumsden took pace off the ball and Suryavanshi gloved an attempted slog sweep to England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew.\n\nA number of England's players shook Suryavanshi's hand as he left the field in recognition of the brilliance of his innings.\n\nIndia finished on 411-9 from their 50 overs - the fifth highest total in U19 World Cup history and a record for a final eclipsing the 253-7 made by Australia against India in the 2024 final.\n\nSuryavanshi's score took his World Cup tally to 439 runs in seven innings at 62.71 - four runs clear of Afghanistan's Faisal Khan as the tournament's leading run-scorer.\n\nSome other notable statistics from Suryavanshi's innings:\n\nIt was the highest score in an Under-19 World Cup final, beating Unmukt Chand's 111* for India in the 2012 final against Australia.\n\nThe innings gives him the ninth highest score in the history of youth ODIs. South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.\n\nIt was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.\n\nHis knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.\n\nHis 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.\n\nThe century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament\n\nIt is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.\n\nHe then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.\n\nIt was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.\n\nHe took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.\n\nFour months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.\n\nListen to ball-by-ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Shovelling snow, finding childcare and a frenetic scramble for plane tickets.\n\nIt's been an unexpectedly stressful few weeks for Scotland's cricketers, who were thrust into action by Bangladesh's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Scots were called up by the International Cricket Council (ICC) by virtue of being the highest-ranked team not already at the tournament, but the players were finding out as everyone else was - via social media and news outlets.\n\n\"It was just so many screenshots of Bangladeshi journalists and all these tweets,\" Scotland spinner Mark Watt told the BBC's No Balls: The Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"All the boys were just flying round saying 'is this true? Is this going to be happening?'\n\n\"It was like that scene in The Office - 'it's happening, it's happening, stay calm'. Cricket Scotland have done really well to get to organise everything so quickly and getting everyone out to India so quickly.\"\n\nNo Balls: Watt's this? Scotland at the T20 World Cup?\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nScotland had failed to reach the World Cup because of a hugely disappointing qualifying campaign in the Netherlands last summer, which included defeats by Italy and Jersey.\n\n\"It's so surreal,\" Watt said. \"I did a chat at a local club and they were saying, 'what are you going to do when the World Cup's on?' And I was like, 'I'm not even going to watch any games because I'm still so gutted that we're not playing in it'.\"\n\nInstead of prepping for subcontinental conditions, players based in Scotland were undergoing fitness programmes and going about their day-to-day lives when the news started to filter through.\n\n\"[Michael Leask] lives in Aberdeen and he was shovelling snow as we were getting all these calls,\" Watt said.\n\n\"We were doing boxing and between sets we're saying 'do you think we're actually going to go?'\n\n\"Not a lot of cricket was going on, it was other things. [Matthew] Cross is trying to build his house at the moment, so he's doing all his DIY.\n\n\"He's been stressed trying to get other people to go in and do the stuff he was going to do.\n\n\"People who have kids were trying to get them minded.\n\n\"I got all my holidays out of the way last year. I was looking forward to a little break, but I'm very happy to be here.\"\n\nThe last-minute nature of Scotland's entry has drawn comparisons to a famous equivalent in the world of football.\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying Denmark [at the Euros] in 1992, because they didn't qualify and won it,\" Watt said. \"Anything's possible. Imagine that?\"\n\nAfter Watt and his team-mates knew they were going to India, they were not sure when they would depart.\n\nFlights were booked in the hope that visas would come through, and when they did the rush to get halfway around the world began.\n\n\"It was like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" Watt said. \"I got my golden ticket and I was like, 'you need to get me on the flight tonight'.\n\n\"Leasky in Aberdeen had to drive two and a half hours to Edinburgh, he got his visa through the same time as me.\n\n\"We're all so excited and so grateful this opportunity came about, but also feel sorry for Bangladesh on the other side of it.\"\n\nScotland are one of five European sides at the competition and one of nine associate ICC members.\n\nAfter warm-up defeats by Afghanistan and Namibia, they take on West Indies in their opening match on Saturday, before games against Italy, England and Nepal in Group C, with the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nWatt says the prospect of seeing different match-ups can only be a positive.\n\n\"Obviously I've got a bit of favouritism for their associates,\" he said.\n\n\"But I just think the more the merrier. You see these Test-playing nations play against each other so often, it's a little bit samey and I think it's really refreshing when the associates come to play against these big teams.\n\n\"Obviously sometimes the results don't go your way, but it's the only way these teams and ourselves are going to learn how to play against them.\n\n\"So it's a great learning curve, but also, we're not there just to learn, but we're there to beat teams.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us.\n\nIndia are defending champions after their 2024 win and have home advantage as co-hosts alongside Sri Lanka.\n\nCan anyone stop them? And who will be the best batters and bowlers?\n\nHere are the Test Match Special team's predictions before it all gets under way on Saturday, 7 February.\n\nFormer England bowler Steven Finn: It is hard to look beyond India, but the romance of South Africa winning after how close they got to winning by reaching the 2024 final is something I would like to see.\n\nI do actually think England are dark horses to win the tournament given how well they played in Sri Lanka and the options they have.\n\nFormer England bowler Alex Hartley: No team has ever won a men's T20 World Cup on home soil, so I'm going India.\n\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills: India will be tough to beat in their own conditions. Obviously all their players are well-accustomed to playing on those decks, so I'll go with India.\n\nEngland and Scotland bowler Kirstie Gordon: It is probably a popular answer but it is hard to look past India in their own conditions. They look incredibly strong and well balanced. I would love to see South Africa give them a scare.\n\nAs for Scotland, it is hard to say given their lack of preparation time, but they have some excellent players and will be keen to show they deserve to be there.\n\nI think they will beat Italy and Nepal but West Indies and England's firepower could be too big a hurdle.\n\nBBC cricket reporter Henry Moeran: India will be hard to beat at home, and having won the last two global white-ball events will be full of confidence.\n\nBut as we saw in the final of 2023, home pressure can sometimes be a hindrance and so many top players from around the world having Indian Premier League experience means knowledge of conditions perhaps will not be as significant.\n\nSouth Africa could be a threat having broken their hoodoo with the Test Championship win.\n\nTMS commentator Prakash Wakankar: While India will be among the favourites, the pressure will be immense.\n\nI would never write off Australia, and South Africa are really well placed with the variety in their bowling and depth in their batting.\n\nIf pressed, I would go for a repeat of the 2023 50-over final between India and Australia, but hopefully with a different result...\n\nTMS commentator Daniel Norcross: India. It is the obvious choice but that is because India come into this World Cup in formidable form and have home advantage.\n\nIn addition, if their match with Pakistan does not go ahead, they will not only pick up two points without playing a game but will also not have to leave India.\n\nTMS commentator Aatif Nawaz: Though both England and Pakistan are heading into the World Cup with strong form, getting the better of India will be a Herculean task.\n\nBBC cricket writer Matthew Henry: I was all set to try and be clever. Like before the 2023 50-over World Cup in India, Australia have lost their past two series.\n\nAt that World Cup, Australia were without Travis Head for the start. This time Josh Hazlewood was set to miss the opening weeks but now he has been ruled out entirely, they surely have little chance.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - fixtures\n\nFinn: England's Phil Salt. He has been outstanding in both the IPL and T20 internationals recently. Opening is the best place to bat in India and expect the top run-scorer to bat in the top two.\n\nHartley: Australia's Ashes hero Travis Head. He's become more consistent over the last 18 months and also plays with complete freedom. He does not care about getting out which will help him push the boundaries.\n\nMills: I'll go with South Africa captain Aiden Markram. He's in good form at the moment and he does well in India too.\n\nGordon: India's Abhishek Sharma. He's got a ridiculous strike-rate and has provided so much firepower at the top of the order for India recently. First World Cup. Home conditions. Are the stars aligned?\n\nMoeran: It might be his debut tournament, but Abhishek is a brilliant player and I think he will do some serious damage to bowling attacks.\n\nNorcross: Abhishek. The Indian opener is in frighteningly good form and will have plenty of opportunity to go big on friendly, run-drenched pitches at home in India.\n\nNawaz: Abhishek is the smart bet. He will open for India and doubtless hit sixes for fun. He stands head (sorry Travis!) and shoulders above everyone else in T20 cricket right now.\n\nWakankar: Head is my pick. He is just so dominant in this format. His hand-eye co-ordination is of a different level. He has been top of the pops for Sunrisers Hyderabad consistently in the IPL and knows the conditions really well.\n\nHenry: India captain Suryakumar Yadav scored 242 runs at 80.66 during the recent series win over New Zealand. One thing that could stop him may be the form of others in India's top order denying him enough time at the crease.\n\nHartley: Sherfane Rutherford. He had a great SA20 campaign with 334 runs and a strike-rate of 165. Nothing beats watching a West Indian when they get going.\n\nMills: South Africa's Dewald Brevis, who I played with recently at the SA20.\n\nObviously people know about him, but he probably hasn't really exploded in terms of international cricket just yet. He played some special innings for us.\n\nFinn: So much has been talked about Brevis from a young age and it finally feels like he has come of age. A fantastic SA20 - 370 runs and a strike-rate of 156.11 - should give him confidence.\n\nGordon: I'm going to go for New Zealand's Finn Allen. He's off the back of a great Big Bash campaign for Perth Scorchers, where he was the leading run-scorer with 466 in 11 innings. It seems like his batting has really matured in the last couple of years.\n\nNorcross: Allen is hit and miss, but if he gets going those small grounds in India won't be able to contain his monstrously destructive hitting.\n\nMoeran: Tom Banton of England looked in excellent touch with an unbeaten 54* in the second T20 in Sri Lanka and feels a very different player to his first iteration in the England side back in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHenry: Brevis is a good shout. England have seen what Pathum Nissanka, now sixth in the world T20 rankings, can do in recent weeks.\n\nNawaz: Let's go for someone a little less obvious. Wayne Madsen. Obviously Italy are unlikely to go past the group stage but the 42 year old's storied career feels like it has one more fairytale chapter in it...\n\nFinn: Kuldeep Yadav. He could clean up in the group stage, looking at India's opponents, and wrist spin is always a potent wicket threat as the tournament wears on.\n\nMills: It is hard to look past Jasprit Bumrah, an outstanding bowler across all formats but particularly within T20 and he'll obviously play a huge part in India's claim to winning the title.\n\nGordon: Australia's Nathan Ellis. A highly skilled T20 bowler who can bowl in all phases but is especially strong at the death.\n\nHe often goes under the radar in a top-quality attack but regularly bowls some of the toughest overs.\n\nMoeran: How can we look past Bumrah? He won India the tournament two years ago in the final against South Africa and will again be key. Few bowlers can do what he does, and his overs at the death will be integral.\n\nHartley: I do not like copying my friends but, as they have said, how do you look past Bumrah? I want to pick a spinner and I want that man to be Varun Chakaravarthy but I'm not sure he will play all the games.\n\nNawaz: I'm certain it will be a spinner. There are so many to chose from, but I'll go with Adam Zampa. He was one of Australia's few positives in their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Pakistan.\n\nWakankar: I expect Hardik Pandya to be that person, fitness being the only challenge. He is the key cog in the India team for sure as their main seam-bowling all-rounder.\n\nNorcross: Abrar Ahmed. A left-field pick maybe but hear me out.\n\nPakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka where the pitches have shown strong signs of favouring spin.\n\nThe bespectacled leg-spinner recently had the Australians in a pickle and has a great chance to bag a hatful of wickets in the opening group stage against weaker teams.\n\nHenry: The leading wicket-takers in the past three editions of the IPL have all been seamers. Always improving, always moving the new ball, I'll go with South Africa's Marco Jansen.\n\nHartley: Pakistan's Usman Tariq - not for the amount of wickets he will or won't get but the hype around his controversial bowling action.\n\nFinn: Tariq was relatively unknown until recently. Mystery spinners who burst on to the scene usually have a good first tournament, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him do well.\n\nGordon: Azmatullah Omarzai. I could have picked one of a few bowlers from Afghanistan, who I think could cause an upset in the group of death which also includes South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nA spinner might have been the common choice but Omarzai has been central to them becoming a more balanced team.\n\nMills: Maybe someone like Noor Ahmad from Afghanistan, the left-arm wrist spinner. Obviously all eyes will be on Rashid Khan but Noor is an excellent bowler in his own right as well.\n\nMoeran: South Africa quick Anrich Nortje is in fine form, taking a stack of wickets in the SA20 for Sunrisers Eastern Cape as they won the tournament. He knows the conditions, knows his game and can bowl economical and rapid spells.\n\nWakankar: I have a nagging suspicion it could be someone like Chakravarthy, given the Indian conditions.\n\nHe is deceptive and has a way of picking up wickets. His mystery element still seems to get batters in the key middle part of the innings.\n\nNawaz: Saim Ayub from Pakistan. He has established himself as a genuine all-rounder over the past 12 months and been very effective in the powerplay.\n\nI know it is a big call to go with an opening batter as bowler to watch - but that's how good he's been.\n\nNorcross: Keshav Maharaj. The South African slow left-armer is in the form of his life.\n\nA complete master of his craft, he will be desperate to go one better after South Africa's loss in the final last time around.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "Sri Lanka have written to the Pakistan Cricket Board asking them to reverse their refusal to face India in their T20 World Cup group.\n\nThe fixture, the biggest and most lucrative in the global game, is due to be played in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo on 15 February but Pakistan's government has said the team will not play the Group A game.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday the decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, whose request for their games to be switched from India was rejected by the International Cricket Council.\n\nBangladesh asked for their games to be moved citing safety concerns amid growing political tensions with India but the ICC said there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\".\n\nThey were subsequently replaced by Scotland in the tournament, which begins with Pakistan facing the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday (05:30 GMT).\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?\n\nPakistan to play at T20 World Cup - but refuse to face India\n\nScotland replace Bangladesh at T20 World Cup\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and had their matches moved to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFollowing that episode it was agreed all India and Pakistan matches would be played at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event going forward.\n\nThat meant Sri Lanka was given the right to host this month's meeting but the likelihood of it doing so has decreased.\n\nThe ICC has asked for Pakistan to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\" but no agreements have been made so far.\n\nThe demand for tickets far outweighed supply for the fixture.\n\nIt is understood the letter to the PCB, signed by the Sri Lankan board president Shamni Silva, outlined the preparatory efforts already made to co-host the tournament and the previous close relationship between Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Hull KR's treble-winning head coach Willie Peters says he is \"keen\" to have talks about taking charge of England for this year's Rugby League World Cup.\n\nThe Australian, 46, is among the contenders to succeed Shaun Wane, who stepped down on 14 January.\n\nPeters led Rovers to their first Super League Grand Final triumph last October, along with the League Leaders' Shield and the Challenge Cup.\n\nHe then joined up with the Australia squad for the Rugby League Ashes series as an assistant to head coach Kevin Walters, helping them to a 3-0 series win over England.\n\nPeters told BBC Sport: \"I'd be keen to have discussions if and when that arose. It'd be a privilege to coach England, that's for sure.\"\n\nFormer Wigan coach Wane, 61, stepped down after just under six years in the role, having led England to a World Cup semi-final in 2022.\n\nWane worked on a full-time basis but the Rugby Football League has said the role is \"expected to revert to a part-time position\".\n\nAsked if he had been approached regarding the role, Peters said: \"No, I haven't spoken to anyone yet.\n\n\"It's a job that many, many people would be interested in and whoever coaches England will have a squad that competes very hard. They show a lot of passion and effort, that's what an England team does.\n\n\"Shaun did that, got them firing in terms of effort and competing.\n\n\"There are probably a few different areas that they need to work on. As I've said openly, the spine is probably an area that needs focus but they're not too far away.\"\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be staged in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea between 15 October and 15 November.\n\nAll of England's matches will be in Australia, with their opener against Tonga in Perth on Saturday, 17 October.\n\nWarrington skipper Williams to leave at end of 2026\n\nEngland head coach Wane steps down in World Cup year\n\nWigan's Matt Peet has ruled himself out of the running.\n\n\"It's not in my thoughts, no,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It's not something I'm interested in doing in the short term. Maybe one day - but now my focus is 100% on Wigan and my family for the next few years.\"\n\nEngland captain George Williams, who announced on Tuesday that he will leave Warrington at the end of 2026 to move to the NRL, said that Wane's replacement needs to bring \"passion\" to the job.\n\nWilliams, who is widely expected to link up with England team-mates Herbie Farnworth and Morgan Knowles at the Dolphins, said: \"I was disappointed that Waney lost his job and I think a lot of players would say the same thing.\n\n\"Whoever comes in, I'm sure they're passionate and keen to get us moving forward.\n\n\"If you're coaching England, you're going to be good at your job. That's automatic. But I think the passion is a big one.\n\n\"You're getting an elite group of players that pretty much half-coaches itself. It's probably now about bringing some passion and some drive behind the team.\"",
