    "fullText": "Bangladesh's cricketers have begun a boycott of all forms of cricket in response to comments made by a national cricket board director, which have led to his removal.\n\nBoth of Thursday's matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) have been postponed, while the national side's participation in February's T20 World Cup is in doubt.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced it has removed M Nazmul Islam from his position as chair of its financial committee after he suggested players should shoulder the financial burden if Bangladesh were to withdraw from the World Cup.\n\nThe comments came amid political tensions between Bangladesh and host nation India.\n\nThe BCB has formally requested that all Bangladesh's matches are staged elsewhere in order to participate in the tournament.\n\nAll of Pakistan's fixtures are to be played in Sri Lanka, with the BCB seeking a similar arrangement.\n\nAsked about the financial implications should Bangladesh be required to withdraw, Islam said: \"Why [would there be]? Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.\n\n\"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?\n\n\"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?\"\n\nOne Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over £60,000.\n\nIslam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).\n\n\"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable,\" Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow.\"\n\nNeither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.\n\nThe BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: \"Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.\n\n\"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt said all cricketers should \"display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game\" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.\n\nBangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.",

Fans will be informed on February 5 at the earliest if they were successful in a random draw.\n\nThose unsuccessful in this phase will have another opportunity to purchase tickets in a second sales phase, which runs until the end of the tournament.\n\n\"Half a billion ticket requests in just over a month is more than demand – it's a global statement,\" FIFA President Gianni Infantino said.\n\nDuring the sales period, FIFA introduced a new ticket category for \"loyal fans\" in response to global protests over high prices. The new \"Supporter Entry Tier\" category applies to all 48 World Cup teams and all matches across Canada, Mexico and the US from June 11 to July 19.\n\nHowever, the lower-priced tickets are limited. FIFA allocates 8% of tickets per match to each participating team's supporters through their national associations, with only 10% of that allocation in the new ticket category.",

    "fullText": "Joao Pedro’s window at Chelsea is closing, and the next few games will tell us a lot about his short term future.\n\nHe came in with a big impact at the Club World Cup, and gave everyone the hope that Chelsea’s striker troubles were over. But as time has passed, it’s become clear that he prefers to play as a number ten.\n\nThat’s all well and good. The problem is that Chelsea already have plenty of number tens. There’s an argument they have too many, even without the Brazil star. Meanwhile, they’re pretty short up front.\n\nLiam Delap has missed most of the season injured, and has only just scored his first Premier League goal a week ago. Yet as far as we can see, he’s ahead of JP in the pecking order for Liam Rosenior. Delap may not score, but he puts himself about. That’s more than you can say for Joao Pedro at the moment.\n\nJoao Pedro protests a decision against Arsenal. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Cole Palmer and even Estevao Willian pushing for minutes at 10, and Delap a better option up top, JP is looking a little lost right now. Rotation and injuries will always mean he’s in line for fairly regular action, especially off the bench where he provides a good option.\n\nBut right now, it’s hard to imagine him being considered first choice. He’s got 18 Premier League starts and 3 sub appearances, so he’s featured in every game so far this season. We doubt that record is going to continue.\n\nWest Ham are circling around the drain of the Premier League, and are getting desperate for solutions. They’re now sniffing around a player who Chelsea don’t even use.\n\nCole Palmer had his annus mirabilis under Mauricio Pochettino rather than Enzo Maresca and the stats show it clearly – but how much of that was actually down to the coaches?",

    "fullText": "Alan Rothenberg has a story he wants to tell you. A lot of stories actually; enough to fill a book.\n\nBut that’s not the first memorable work he’s authored. As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, still the most successful in history, Rothenberg has arguably had more to do with writing the story of U.S. Soccer in the modern era than anyone.\n\nAnd you can draw a straight line from that chapter to the one that will be written this summer when the World Cup returns to the U.S.\n\n“The turning point really was the Olympics,” he said last month over brunch in a crowded Sherman Oaks diner. “That soccer was so successful in the Olympics, that’s when FIFA thought maybe we could bring our crown jewel to the United States and not be embarrassed.\n\n“So ‘84 Olympics. That’s a crucial part of the story. I doubt that we would be where we are now but for that.”\n\nThat story’s in “The Big Bounce: The Surge That Shaped the Future of U.S. Soccer,” which is available Feb. 10. In fact, the book starts there.\n\nBut Rothenberg’s career did not. Before changing the face of U.S. Soccer, he first altered the landscape of sports in his adopted hometown, playing instrumental roles in bringing the Clippers to Los Angeles, in negotiating the trade that made Kareem Abdul-Jabbar a Laker and in settling the Kings at the Forum.\n\nAs a lawyer who started his career as the in-house counsel for Jack Kent Cooke when Cooke owned the Lakers, the Kings, the then-Washington Redskins and was launching the Wolves of the nascent NASL, Rothenberg was involved in some of the most consequential events in four sports during a career that’s nearing the end of its sixth decade. Yet he knew little about soccer when Peter Ueberroth, chair of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee, put him in charge of the sport for the 1984 Games.\n\n“Peter assumed with that background I must know a lot about soccer,” Rothenberg writes. “That was wrong.”\n\nWhat he lacked in soccer knowledge he more than made up for in creativity and organization skills, however, and the Olympic tournament proved to be one of the most successful in history, with the final at the Rose Bowl drawing a crowd of 104,098, a U.S. record for a soccer game that stood for 30 years.\n\nBut his name will forever be synonymous with the World Cup.\n\nThe 1994 tournament was the first to be played in a country without a first-division league and there were widespread fears it would be a disaster. Instead, it drew an average of 69,174 fans to each of the 52 games, an attendance record that still stands. It also generated a surplus of more than $50 million — also a record — money that went to the U.S. Soccer Foundation to promote the growth of the sport in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, Major League Soccer kicked off; 30 years later it’s the sixth-most-valuable soccer league in the world.\n\n“Everything flowed from ‘94,” Rothenberg said. “If ‘94 had not been successful, including if our [U.S.] team hadn’t been credible, I’m not sure how quickly things would have developed. Certainly we wouldn’t have been able to start Major League Soccer at that time if the World Cup wasn’t successful.”\n\nAnother rarely discussed — but hugely important — legacy of that tournament is the foundation it created in terms of experience and expertise. The U.S. had never staged a major standalone soccer competition before 1994 and the learning curve was steep. Among those who worked under Rothenberg and went on to great success in the sport were Sunil Gulati, a three-term president of U.S. Soccer; Nelson Rodriguez, now MLS executive vice-president; Marla Messing, who headed the organizing committee for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and was later interim commissioner of the NWSL; Tom King, U.S. Soccer’s longtime managing director of administration; Kathy Carter, the former executive vice-president of Soccer United Marketing and chief executive officer of U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Properties; and Charlie Stillitano, a former MLS general manager who pioneered the idea of inviting major European clubs to play summer friendlies in the U.S.\n\n“It's not just that the event [came] off. Look what came out of it,” said Scott LeTellier, who as managing director and chief operating officer had responsibility for day-to-day operations of the World Cup organizing committee for 1994. “All the people who worked on our committee, who had some role that now are general managers of MLS teams. The league itself that came out of it. The number of soccer facilities. We didn't have a single soccer specific-stadium in the country.\n\n“You can argue that the ‘94 World Cup was really the linchpin to that entire explosion in the sport.”\n\nThat tournament was ahead of its time in other ways too. It was the first to stage fan fests in host cities, the first to include musical performers at the final and the first to offer hospitality packages with the price of a ticket. It also featured a lavish opening ceremony, one that featured Diana Ross, Oprah Winfrey and President Clinton, turning what was just a soccer tournament into a global spectacle.\n\nThe World Cup hasn’t been the same since, with FIFA’s revenue growing to a projected $13 billion for the 2026 cycle. There are more than 40 countries that don’t have an economy that large.\n\nAs Rothenberg notes in his book, FIFA originally pushed back on many of the innovations he proposed, including a halftime show at the final, only to eventually adopt the ideas as their own. Rothenberg also wanted to charge $1,000 a ticket for the final in 1994, arguing that fans would pay that on the secondary market, so why let the scalpers make the profit?\n\n“They were horrified,” he said. “You realize what a dramatic statement it would make if you had a $100-million gate?”\n\nThey do now; the cheapest regular tickets for the final of this summer’s tournament start at $2,000.\n\nRothenberg said he’s still thinking of other ways to improve the tournament, such as expanding the field to 64 teams and doing away with the group stage, making the World Cup like the NCAA basketball tournament.\n\n“I know I’m off the charts on this one,” he said. “Single elimination. It’s exciting start to finish.”\n\nAt 86, Rothenberg is still active, making regular trips to his office at 1st Century Bank, the community bank he founded in 2004 at an age when most people were entering retirement. And he promises to be a presence at this summer’s World Cup.\n\nAs for whether he gets the credit he deserves for making that tournament possible, Rothenberg demurs.\n\n“I didn’t do it for credit,” he says, speaking about both the World Cup and the book that explains how it happened. “All I can say is I’m proud of what I did.”\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

I don’t have a clear memory of why this goal has stayed with me since I was very young, through my entire life,” Baggio told Forbes Italia via Gazzetta.\n\n“I have always considered myself an ordinary person.

This did not match the television pictures of the game.\n\nFifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters.\n\nThe technology was tested in Fifa's Intercontinental Cup, with Flamengo and Pyramids FC players scanned ahead of their match in December.\n\nFifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored.

    "fullText": "PDC Q-School 2026: Storied names survive the early skirmishes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer World Champion and all round darts legend Steve Beaton has safely navigated the opening minefield at the PDC's Q-School 2026, booking his passage to the final stage after storming into the last 16 on day one. The Bronzed Adonis, still chiselled, still unflustered, still very much alive in the fight, can now exhale. What lies ahead from Thursday onward will be infinitely more punishing – but for now, the popular veteran, who reversed a decision to step off the main tour in 2024, has earned a brief ceasefire.\n\nKeeping him company in the hotel lounge is former World Cup winner John Henderson. The experienced Scot has done exactly what was required, nothing more, nothing less. Job done. Feet up. A couple of days’ rest secured, safe in the knowledge that when the real party starts, it’s always more fun when Hendo is invited.\n\nTHE PDC Q-SCHOOL: How to win a Pro Tour golden ticket\n\nFourteen other hopefuls have joined them in this early sanctuary, all punching their tickets to the final phase with days to spare – a priceless luxury in a week where energy, nerve and sanity are finite resources. They are:\n\nLloyd Walker (ENG), James Howard Jones (ENG), Jamie Kelling (ENG), Damien Grimes (IRE), James Evans-Bradford (ENG), Daniel Ayres (ENG), Killian McCormack (IRE), Jake Eichen (ENG), Joe Croft (ENG), Joseph Heywood (ENG), Paul Lewis (ENG), Charlie Large (ENG), Keelan Kay (ENG) and Jamie Tiley (SCO).\n\nMeanwhile, across the Channel in Germany, the same pattern is emerging. Among the early qualifiers in Kalkar is Brian Raman, the 2022 WDF World Championship quarter-finalist and former PDC Tour Card holder, who will be eyeing a swift return to the professional circuit after falling away at the end of 2024.\n\nStanding alongside him is a name that once sent shockwaves through the elite – Jeffrey de Zwaan. The Black Cobra. Two-time Players Championship winner. Former World Matchplay semi-finalist. Those achievements may sit almost a decade in the rear-view mirror, but at just 29, time has not yet closed its fist. There is still venom left.\n\nCompleting the European batch who earned passage to the final stage on day one: Sietse Lap (NED), Jeffrey Keen (NED), Dennis Van Bergen (NED), Jarno Bottenberg (NED), Jose Justicia (ESP), Gilbert van der Meijden (NED), Michael Hurtz (GER), Michael Van De Ven (NED), Michael De Mayer (BEL), Tomislav Rosandic (CRO), Mitja Gustorf (GER), Kris Mievis (BEL), Jiri Brejcha (CZE) and Luitsen Elzinga (NED).\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

Both games kick off at 23:00 GMT.\n\nSwinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.\n\nThe Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.\n\nBut an extra holiday may be a pragmatic response to the situation some businesses may face on the morning after Scotland's opening World Cup game. How many might want to stay up late and then take the day off?\n\nDecisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.\n\nIn general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.\n\nEmployment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.\n\nNor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.\n\nEven the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.\n\nSchool holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.\n\n'Scotland qualifying for the World Cup put me in hospital'\n\nScots celebrate reaching first World Cup in nearly 30 years",

    "fullText": "Switzerland's Camille Rast said she was racing for the victims of the New Year's Eve fire in her hometown of Crans-Montana as she ended Mikaela Shiffrin's winning start to the World Cup slalom season.\n\nRast, 26, produced a stunning second run in Sunday's slalom in Kranjska Gora to pip Shiffrin by 0.14 seconds, following up Saturday's debut World Cup giant slalom victory at the same Slovenian resort.\n\nUS star Shiffrin, 30, had won the opening five slalom events which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\n\"I gave it everything I had this weekend - achieving the double [slalom and giant slalom] was extraordinary,\" said Rast, who added: \"I think about all those families - we raced for them this weekend.\"\n\nA devastating fire at Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski resort killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others.\n\nBodies continue to be identified and a criminal investigation is under way.\n\n\"We can't imagine how it is, but it's for sure terribly hard,\" Rast told BBC's Ski Sunday.\n\n\"I hope they will find the support with their family and everybody around. And I hope that the sport will bring a little smile on their face.\"\n\nRast finished a close second to Shiffrin in the previous World Cup slalom event in Austria but was not to be denied a second time, making sure the World Cup's greatest skier could not add to her record tally of 106 wins in all disciplines.\n\nShiffrin was just 0.1 seconds behind leader Rast after the first run, but set an imposing time in the second that opened a 1.69secs lead over the rest of the field.\n\nBut Rast went even faster to beat Shiffrin into second place.\n\n\"I know Shiffrin is really fast and I had to be really, really fast to beat her. I saw her start and I was like 'mmm, OK, that's good, that's really good', but I just tried to give my best, and it worked,\" she said.\n\nThere are two more World Cup slalom events - in Flachau, Austria, on 13 January, and Spindleruv Mlyn in the Czech Republic on 25 January - before the Winter Olympics begin in Milan-Cortina on 6 February.\n\nWatch Rast's victory and interview in the latest edition of Ski Sunday from 17:50 GMT on 4 January.\n\nGreat Britain had two cross-country skiers finish in the top 10 of a World Cup event for the first time in Val di Fiemme, Italy, on Sunday.\n\nBritain's Joe Davies, 24, was sixth - his best World Cup finish - while team-mate Andrew Musgrave, 35, was eighth in the men's 10km mass start free, more commonly known as the 'Final Climb'.\n\nMusgrave finished 15th and Davies 16th in the overall Tour de Ski standings - the first time the British team has had two skiers in the top 20.\n\nDavies told BBC Sport: \"To have the results we've had this Tour de Ski means so much to us all. It's not only a testament to the work we've put in, but also to the belief that British skiing belongs at the top.\"\n\nThe British cross country team for the 2026 Winter Olympics is expected to be announced on 23 January.\n\nMeanwhile, Great Britain narrowly missed out on a first World Cup podium of the season in the men's four-man bobsleigh, finishing fourth in Winterberg, Germany.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from AS, Real Madrid scouts will closely monitor Kees Smit over the next six months before the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIt is known that the AZ Alkmaar youngster is being followed as part of Madrid’s wider plan to identify a midfield orchestrator capable of leading the team into the next cycle.\n\nAs mentioned many times in the past, Real Madrid are preparing to reinforce their midfield in the summer of 2026.\n\nWith that objective in mind, Smit has emerged as a profile that fits many of the club’s requirements.\n\nOver recent weeks, his name has gathered serious traction among scouts, not just in Spain but across Europe.\n\nCompetition for Smit’s signature is expected to be fierce.\n\nSeveral top clubs are aware of his rapid development, but Real Madrid believe their sporting project and global pull could be decisive if they choose to make a concrete move.\n\nThe club see him as a player who is young enough to grow, yet already mature enough to handle responsibility at the highest level.\n\nReal Madrid will keep an eye on Kees Smit. (Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)\n\nAt just 19 years old, Smit has already taken important steps forward in his career. He has made his debut for the Dutch national team under Ronald Koeman, who is counting on him as part of his plans heading into the World Cup.\n\nKoeman’s faith has been telling, and comparisons to Pedri only underline the type of midfielder Smit is becoming.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid’s interest is not new. Club scouts were first drawn to Smit during a Youth League match in the 2022–23 season, when AZ Alkmaar convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0.\n\nThat performance sparked sustained monitoring of his progress, and since then, his development has only reinforced the initial impressions.\n\nFrom now until the end of the season, the evaluation process will intensify. Madrid intend to observe him continuously, analysing not only his performances but also his consistency, personality, and response to pressure.\n\nHowever, under contract until 2028, AZ Alkmaar currently value him at around €60 million.\n\nIt is already a hefty figure for a player who turns 20 on January 21, but one that could climb even higher with strong international exposure.",

    "fullText": "A fan group says \"alarm bells should be ringing at Fifa\" over the fact England supporters have not taken up their full ticket allocation for next summer's World Cup final and semi-final.\n\nSo far the number of allocated tickets to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) exceeds the number of applications received, meaning everyone who has applied for a ticket to the final and semi-final is guaranteed one.\n\nThe pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with about 90% of tickets for the final made available to ESTC members costing £3,094.\n\nThat led to Fifa introducing a limited number of tickets at £45, but the Football Supporters' Association's Fans' Embassy says England fans not taking up their allocation should be a concern.\n\n\"Whilst unsurprisingly the group games are oversubscribed, as well as the possible glamour tie in Mexico City in the round of 16, the numbers for the semi-final and final speak for themselves,\" the group said in a statement.\n\n\"The numbers are reflective of a fan base that has been priced out, and some of the most loyal supporters of the international game feel completely let down.\n\n\"Alarm bells should be ringing whenever participating member allocations, meant for the most loyal fans, are not sold out for any game at a World Cup.\"\n\nFifa has been criticised for group stage tickets for next year's World Cup costing up to three times those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nEarlier this week Fifa president Gianni Infantino defended the prices, saying they reflect the public's \"absolutely crazy\" demand for tickets.\n\n\"We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,\" Infantino said.\n\n\"So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.\"",

    "fullText": "Whether it was underdog heroics in World Cup qualifying, England winning Euro 2025, or United States President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino becoming best buds, international football played a big role in 2025 — and a men’s World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is just 165 days away.\n\nIn the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins.\n\nBut away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.\n\nHere, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O’Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year.\n\nJames: Wimbledon, 1988. You can’t snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.\n\nAnka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.\n\nO’Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d’Or. \n\nFeringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.\n\nMiller: I don’t think I’ll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.\n\nMiller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I’ll never forget.\n\nO’Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.\n\nFeringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.\n\nJames: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.\n\nAnka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.\n\nMiller: Scott McTominay. One of football’s great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.\n\nO’Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.\n\nFeringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else’s villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.\n\nJames: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.\n\nForest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn’t expect anything.”\n\nAnka: The two biggest games of McTominay’s 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland’s qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nI undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.\n\nAlso, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don’t think there’s a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men’s game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he’s always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.\n\n“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz\n\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025\n\nMiller: It won’t do to overcomplicate these things, so it’s a toss-up between two.\n\nEither Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.\n\nOr Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.\n\nFeringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports’ Halo and Joey Barton.\n\nJames: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there’s plenty in between, too.\n\nAnka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.\n\nMiller: Troy Parrott’s miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can’t remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.\n\nO’Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England’s Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.\n\nFeringa: Gotham’s victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That’s silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.\n\nJames: Well, I certainly didn’t expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah’s outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.\n\nAnka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.\n\nMiller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.\n\nO’Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…\n\nFeringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don’t know why everyone kept panicking. You don’t come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.\n\nJames: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.\n\nAnka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.\n\nMiller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.\n\nO’Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.\n\nFeringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women’s Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).\n\nJames: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA’s decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.\n\nUEFA’s judgement was harsh but I wouldn’t go that far.\n\nAnyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I’ll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.\n\nYeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.\n\nAnka: The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria’s Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco’s federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.\n\nMiller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser in the final men’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.\n\nThe latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) February 15, 2025\n\nO’Neill: I wasn’t there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.\n\nIt came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.\n\nFeringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.\n\nAitana's turn for the goal 🥵 #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/WbwTRCbyfJ\n\n— UEFA Women's EURO (@WEURO2025) July 23, 2025\n\nClose second: Jack Grealish’s first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I’d be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.\n\nJames: Paris Saint-Germain’s third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele’s backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.\n\nThe results are in for the best play of the year!\n\nThe winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!\n\nThank you for voting, the fun doesn’t stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Stay… pic.twitter.com/4SVAEDoPZg\n\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 26, 2025\n\nJosh Tymon’s volley, for Snoop’s Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too.

Amad’s edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.\n\nOutrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) November 1, 2025\n\nWatching live on the telly? Declan Rice’s perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.\n\nMiller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I’m going to be like that. I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”\n\nIt’s hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.\n\nO’Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women’s football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.\n\n“I spent some time playing men’s football. But it really wasn’t my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I’ve never looked back. It’s changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence.\n\n“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don’t care about the news. It’s my escape, and the fact that it’s trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”\n\nFeringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.\n\nJames: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”\n\nSurely Salah’s post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don’t say things like that.\n\nAs for No 2, I’ll go for Amorim’s assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.\n\n“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”\n\nIf only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.\n\nAnka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.\n\n“People might think I’m an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”\n\nMiller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they’ve served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.\n\nO’Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It’s just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this’?\n\nFeringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.\n\nJames: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.\n\nAnka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners’ medal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton, Nottingham Forest, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, SSC Napoli, Premier League, Champions League, International Football, Serie A, Championship, Women's Soccer, FIFA Men's World Cup, League One, League Two, National League\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "title": "Nearly a century ago, the first World Cup went off with many hitches",
    "description": "When the 1930 tournament was staged in Uruguay, some nations could not afford the trip, players did not take it seriously and fights were common. What has changed since then.",
    "fullText": "Next summer’s World Cup will be the largest, most complex and most lucrative sporting event in history, with 48 teams playing 104 games in three countries. The tournament is expected to draw a global TV audience of nearly 5 billion and FIFA, the event’s organizer, is hoping for revenues of between $10 billion-$14 billion — which is why lower-bowl tickets for Iran-New Zealand at SoFi Stadium cost nearly $700.\n\nAll that seemed unlikely after the first tournament in 1930, when the idea of a soccer World Cup was nearly killed in the cradle, the victim from lack of planning, lack of money and lack of interest. That the competition survived, much less thrived, is nothing short of a miracle, says English writer and podcaster Jonathan Wilson, author of the deeply researched “The Power and Glory: The History of the World Cup.”\n\n“1930, it’s incredibly amateurish in many ways,” Wilson said. “It’s got that sort of almost like a school sports day feel to it.”\n\nOnly 13 countries took part in the first tournament; it was supposed to be 16 but the Egyptian team missed its boat to Uruguay while Japan and Siam (now Thailand) couldn’t afford the travel costs and pulled out. England, meanwhile, not only refused to play, but the British press ignored the event, as did much of Europe.\n\nThat seemed like a wise decision at the time since the first two matches of the inaugural tournament were affected by snow, with one of the opening games drawing just 4,444 fans. The smallest crowd in World Cup history, estimated at about 300, showed up for another first-round game between Romania and Peru and the TV audience … well, there was none since TV had yet to be invented.\n\nThe officiating was beyond suspect — Romania’s manager, Constantin Radulescu, also worked two games as a linesman — and the U.S. trainer, Jack Coll, had to be stretchered off the field during his team’s semifinal — yes, the U.S. made the semifinals! — with Argentina when he lost consciousness after inhaling the fumes from a bottle of chloroform that shattered in his pocket.\n\nIn another game, the penalty spots were mistakenly marked 16 yards from goal instead of the regulation 12 — and nobody noticed.\n\n“Some of the details don’t make sense,” Wilson said. “The whole thing is so sort of low grade compared to today.”\n\nWhen Argentine captain Nolo Ferreira left the tournament and returned home to take his law exams his replacement, Guillermo Stábile, scored a tournament-high eight goals in four games — then never played for the national team again (although he did coach it, leading the La Albiceleste to six South American titles and the 1958 World Cup).\n\nGiven the farcical nature of the 1930 World Cup, the tournament probably should have ended right there. Instead, 1930 has become the foundation on which next year’s competition was built.\n\nThe origins of the tournament, however, actually make sense. Before 1930, FIFA recognized the winner of the Olympic competition as the world champion. But that event was for amateurs, a point on which the International Olympic Committee would not budge.\n\nWith professional soccer growing in popularity, FIFA decided to stage its own breakaway event and play it in Uruguay, the country that had won the last two Olympic titles.\n\nThat quickly proved to be a big mistake. The growing effects of the Great Depression left many countries unable to afford the long, slow steamship trip to South America. The first tournament was open to any country that wanted to play, yet two months before the first game no European teams had agreed to come.\n\n“It was taken very seriously by Uruguay and Argentina,” Wilson said, but not by many others.\n\nThat changed shortly after Romania’s King Carol II, who ascended to the throne in a coup that deposed his son, personally selected his country’s World Cup roster and sent it on its way. France quickly agreed to go too, entering a makeshift team under pressure from FIFA president Jules Rimet, a Frenchman. Belgium also buckled under FIFA pressure and all three teams boarded the same ship for the trip to Uruguay, working out together on the 15-day voyage aboard the SS Conte Verde, an Italian ocean liner.\n\n“Even the four European nations who go it’s not entirely clear how seriously they took it,” Wilson said. “The French and Romanians, they kept diaries. They seem to have regarded this as a laugh. We’ll try to win but it doesn’t really matter.”\n\nThings didn’t really get loony until the tournament began. The Bolivian team, for example, played in berets, as did an Argentine midfielder, while the 15 referees who worked the games, some of whom had traveled and socialized with the players on the long boat ride from Europe, dressed formally in knickers, long-sleeve shirts, blazers and ties.\n\nThe well-dressed officials spent much of the tournament working with police to break up fights; play was so violent at least two players sustained broken legs and the U.S.-Argentina semifinal descended into a full-out brawl, with one American having four teeth knocked out and another hospitalized with injuries to his stomach.\n\nThe tournament finally finished with the hosts beating Argentina 4-2, after which the Argentines broke off diplomatic relations with their neighbor and an angry mob in Buenos Aires stoned the Uruguayan embassy.\n\n“It ended,” Wilson said of the tournament, “with everybody sort of fighting each other.”\n\nFew disagreed with the Argentine magazine El Gráfico, which seemed to predict there was little future for the fledgling event. “The World Cup is over,” it wrote. “The development of this competition brought not only an unpleasant atmosphere, but also an ungrateful one.”\n\nYet nearly a century later, the World Cup is still here. And that, too, was foretold in 1930 in the story of Romanian midfielder Alfred Eisenbeisser (who was also known as Fredi Fieraru because, why not?).\n\nOn the journey home from the first World Cup, Eisenbeisser contracted pneumonia and a priest was called to administer the last rites. The ship eventually docked in Genoa and he was taken to a sanatorium while the rest of the team continued on to Romania.\n\nAssuming her son had perished in Italy, Eisenbeisser’s mother arranged a wake — only to have her son stroll into the ceremony very much alive, causing the woman to faint. Eisenbeisser would play 12 more years of professional soccer and compete in figure skating in the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he finished 13th in the pairs competition.\n\nTurns out the reports of Eisenbeisser’s demise, like those of the World Cup, were greatly exaggerated.\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

Wyatt sits in sixth place, 62 points behind Yin.\n\nColtman's third-placed finish, behind Belgium's Kim Meylemans and Anna Fernstadt of the Czech Republic, was her best result of the season and only the second World Cup medal of her career after gold in PyeongChang last year.\n\nWeston and Wyatt race again in Sigulda on Saturday before taking a Christmas break, from which they will return to action in Winterberg, Germany on 2 January.",

The catch is that, as England head coach, he hasn't seen much more of Palmer at international level - just 64 minutes in the World Cup qualifier win against Andorra in June.\n\nA lingering groin problem meant that, against Everton, Palmer was making only his fourth Premier League start of the season, scoring his first goal since September. And in his absence, Tuchel's options for the number 10 role have expanded.\n\nTuchel may have given a clue to his future thinking with the way he voted in that Fifa Best poll, placing England captain Harry Kane as top choice, followed by Palmer and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele.\n\nPalmer offers England the X-factor.

We are saying it was fraudulent.\"\n\nThe NFF says it has submitted supporting documents and legal arguments to world football's governing body.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Fifa for comment and is waiting to hear back.\n\nFecofa, however, has branded the petition as an attempt to \"win via the back door\".\n\n\"The World Cup must be played with dignity and confidence. Not with lawyers' tricks,\" said a post on the Leopards' official social media, external.\n\nThe message also described Nigeria as \"bad losers\" and dismissed the complaint as poor sportsmanship.",

    "description": "WORLD CUP 2026: Comment: Fifa’s extortionate prices have led to accusations of ‘betrayal’ and Miguel Delaney argues that The FA must flex its power now to save fans and potentially enhance England’s chances on the pitch",
    "fullText": "The Fifa leadership travel to Doha on Monday, for a series of meetings around “The Best” awards, where certain sources are anticipating at least some tension. And not over who wins.\n\nA number of national associations remain aggravated by the astronomical World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and want to directly raise it. The Football Association says it will relay fan concerns to Fifa, but the Football Supporters’ Association expects more. They expect the FA to actually push on this, and display proper support.\n\nIf it doesn’t, there will be uproar and potential escalation of the latest controversy surrounding Fifa and the World Cup.\n\nThe story should already be bringing much more scrutiny on the conduct of the FA – and other major federations – in football’s power structure.\n\nSources within such federations generally insist that they must maintain a diplomatic stance when dealing with the top brass of Fifa and Uefa, due to the risk of political ostracisation, given that both federations are top-down executive president models with little scope for dissent.\n\nSo, they generally say very little that is challenging, as they attempt to keep some influence.\n\nExcept, what is the point of any of that if you say nothing and have absolutely no influence when it matters most?\n\nThe FA’s first obligation, after all, is to the football public of England. To its constituents.\n\nYou may as well be politically ostracised if you can’t serve them in something like this.\n\nAnd what is going to happen anyway? It’s not like Fifa or Uefa are going to cut off Forward or HatTrick funding.\n\nBoth federations absolutely love Wembley, knowing how much more lucrative it is than any other European stadium. That means little to no risk of losing major fixtures.\n\nFA lobbyists may point to the bid for the Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035, but there’s no competition there.\n\nAnd, in any case, do they really have a mandate to secure a tournament at any cost – like that to their fans?\n\nThe refusal to publicly speak on this would be utterly spineless.\n\nSuch an approach is all the more surprising right now, given that there is constant tension between football’s various stakeholders – from the Premier League to European Football Clubs (the new name for the European Club Association) – and you need sharp elbows to secure your space in the calendar. You need a sense of fight.\n\nMany of those same stakeholders often declare themselves shocked at the meekness of the major federations, from the FA to the associations of France, Germany and Spain. There’s a feeling that they absolutely waste their potential power, and that they should be moral guardians of the game.\n\nInstead, various sources describe them as “the most complicit in the preservation of football’s system” due to the refusal to flex their greater muscle and, worse, “patsies”.\n\nFifa and Uefa have allowed the game to be taken over by greater power, with virtually no challenge. And this has far greater future risks.\n\nThe great frustration with this ticket crisis – even though you could have said this about any of Fifa’s controversies over the last few weeks – is that a potential outlet for dissent is so obvious and powerful.\n\nIf the 10-15 wealthiest federations coordinated action, or even put out a joint statement, it would “rattle” Fifa president Gianni Infantino on this, according to insiders. It would be dissent he is not used to.\n\nSo simple, so potentially effective in this controversy.\n\nIf Fifa still doesn’t budge on prices, and a position in this patronage system is apparently so valuable to the federations, there is another option.\n\nThe national associations can use the ample money they receive from Fifa and Uefa to subsidise the tickets of regular match-going fans.\n\nMany of the latter are already talking of having to make very hard decisions on whether to attend next summer’s tournament. It could be reasonably argued that full support is all the more valuable, given that this looks like England’s best chance of winning a World Cup in decades.\n\nBut, really, there is something deeper here.\n\nThere is a moral and political argument.\n\nThe member associations, most of all the FA, should do much more for their constituents. As was reported on these pages on Saturday, FA chair Debbie Hewitt is ideally placed as Fifa chair.\n\n“I’m not known for being a silent observer,” she said on taking that role.\n\nThere’s never been a more important moment to prove that.",

He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.\n\nNot that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.\n\nSpeak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.\n\nUnder Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.\n\nAs the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.\n\nLeft, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.\n\n\"He's a very smart player,\" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. \"He's really technical.\n\n\"Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.\"\n\nAmorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.\n\nNo-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.\n\nBut staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.\n\nTraining-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.\n\nHe is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.\n\nMount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.\n\nThese traits are all positives on a human scale.\n\nHowever, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.\n\nOutstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.\n\nGoals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.\n\nThe idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.\n\nMount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.\n\nDespite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.\n\nMount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.\n\nThe player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nMount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.\n\nHe clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.\n\nJust as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The cheapest ticket to attend the USA's opening 2026 World Cup match against Paraguay is $1,120 — a steep jump from initial estimates shared in 2018.",
    "fullText": "It's been over 30 years since Americans have had the chance to watch their national soccer team play on their home turf.\n\nThey'll get another chance next year, but it'll cost them.\n\nFans could pay over $2,700 for a ticket to watch the USA's first match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Paraguay, which is scheduled to take place in June at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nThat far exceeds the estimated ticket prices included in the original joint bid submitted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the World Cup.\n\nFIFA, which sets ticket prices, says it is using variable pricing to determine ticket costs, and \"may adjust ticket prices throughout the sales phases based on a review of demand and availability for each match.\"\n\nThe organization said it isn't using dynamic pricing — when ticket prices change in real time based on demand and other factors — for the 2026 World Cup. In addition to third-party sites like StubHub, which sell tickets, FIFA offers a resale and exchange marketplace for fans.\n\nFIFA launched its third phase of ticketing last week. Soon after the portal opened, fans took to social media, expressing shock over what they described as steep prices.\n\nWorld Cup tickets are divided into four categories, with Category 1 selling the most expensive tickets and Category 4 the cheapest options.\n\nAs of Saturday, there are no available Category 4 tickets for the USA's opening match against Paraguay on June 12. Instead, the cheapest ticket is selling for $1,120 under Category 3. The most expensive ticket costs $2,735, followed by $1,940.\n\nThe most expensive ticket for Mexico's opening match against South Africa costs $2,355, and Canada's opening match costs $2,170. Neither of those matches is offering Category 4 tickets.\n\nAs the tournament continues, ticket prices drop but are typically still far above original estimates.\n\nWhen the USA faces off against Australia on June 19, the most affordable ticket is $265, while the most expensive is selling for $700. When the USA plays on June 25, fans will have to pay between $910 and $340.\n\nThose prices are a far cry from what the United States, Canada, and Mexico estimated in their bid to host the tournament. The countries submitted a combined bid — dubbed the \"United bid\" — and were selected in 2018.\n\nIn their pitch, the countries estimated that a Category 1 ticket for an opening match would cost $774, followed by $614 for Category 2, $320 for Category 3, and $60 for Category 4.\n\nTickets for the final match were estimated to cost between $1,550 and $128. Under FIFA, the current final match prices — held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — start at $4,185. The most costly ticket is $8,680.\n\nDespite the hefty price, fans eager to snag tickets in this phase can purchase them now until January 13.\n\nThe 23rd edition of the tournament will take place this summer in 16 cities across North America. The first game kicks off on June 11, and teams will play until the final match on July 19.",

    "fullText": "On a weekend when Phil Foden and Cole Palmer helped Manchester City and Chelsea to vital Premier League victories, Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers showed just why he retains a firm grip on the number 10 position in Thomas Tuchel's England set-up.\n\nVilla's eight-match winning run in all competitions appeared under serious threat at the midway point of Sunday's game at third-bottom West Ham, who led 2-1 at the break against a side who appeared jaded and short of inspiration after Thursday's Europa League victory at Basel.\n\nIn the second half, however, Rogers decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored his first of the afternoon five minutes into the second half, making it 2-2 from close range after West Ham had failed to clear Youri Tielemans' low cross into the box.\n\nThen, with the final 10 minutes approaching, Rogers collected a loose ball 30 yards from goal and was given time and space to slam a powerful, swerving strike into the top right corner of Alphonse Areola's goal and clinch a ninth straight victory for Unai Emery's third-placed team.\n\nThat magnificent effort capped a fine all-round performance from Rogers and reaffirmed his status as England's first-choice number 10 at next summer's World Cup - despite world-class competition from Foden, Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.\n\n\"He scored two fantastic goals and, for me, he is not just going to be in the squad next summer,\" said former England forward and Match of the Day pundit Theo Walcott. \"He is a dead cert to be a starter for England at the World Cup - 100%.\n\n\"He does everything, he's not just a goal threat. I like all [the contenders for the number 10 position], but one of them is going to have to miss out on the squad itself - and Rogers, for me, has to start.\"",

    "title": "FA set to take action as fans lash out at Fifa’s ‘scandalous’ World Cup ticket prices",
    "description": "The eye-watering prices for World Cup tickets were revealed on Thursday",
    "fullText": "Football fans have voiced outrage over \"scandalous\" World Cup ticket prices, prompting the Football Association (FA) to raise concerns with Fifa, though there is little optimism within English football's governing body for a reversal.\n\nThe pricing structure for members of national team travel clubs and loyalty schemes, unveiled on Thursday, includes eye-watering figures, with the cheapest ticket for the 19 July final exceeding £3,000.\n\nThe Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) has urged the FA to challenge World Cup organiser Fifa on these costs, which the FSA branded \"scandalous\" and a \"laughable insult\" to the average fan.\n\nIt is understood that the FA will formally convey fans’ discontent to Fifa through appropriate channels. However, sources close to the governing body are not hopeful that this will lead to any changes.\n\nThe FA is deeply sympathetic to England supporters, who also face significant travel and accommodation expenses. The association had no input in setting the prices and reportedly only learned of the detailed pricing plan on Thursday.\n\nIn contrast, FA bosses Mark Bullingham and Debbie Hewitt have already pledged that affordable tickets will be available for Euro 2028 – which England will co-host with the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales – and that dynamic pricing, seen in earlier rounds of World Cup ticket sales, will not be implemented.\n\nDespite this, the FA has no influence over World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and there is a prevailing sense of realism that while concerns can be voiced, Fifa is unlikely to alter its course.\n\nShould England reach the final in July, fans wishing to purchase tickets through the FA’s allocation would need to spend more than £5,000 on tickets alone to attend all matches, even for the lowest-priced category.\n\nA statement from the FSA, published on Friday morning, declared: \"We back Football Supporters Europe in calling for a halt in ticket sales and we are calling on the Football Association to work with fellow FAs to directly challenge these disgraceful prices.\"\n\nThe FSA described the prices proposed to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) as \"scandalous\" and \"a step too far for many supporters who passionately and loyally follow their national sides at home and abroad\".\n\nThe statement further criticised Fifa’s approach: \"Everything we feared about the direction in which FIFA wants to take the game was confirmed – Gianni Infantino only sees supporter loyalty as something to be exploited for profit.\n\n“This is a tournament that is supposed to be celebrated by the world, where fans of all nations come together for the love of football. Fifa have decided to make it all about the money and the elite who can afford it.\n\n“For Fifa, loyalty is not the hard-working fan travelling thousands of miles in support of their team at qualifiers around the continent. A game that should be for all is now only for those who can afford it.\"\n\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE) estimates that fans will pay five times more to follow their team from the first game to the final at the 2026 World Cup compared to the last tournament in Qatar in 2022.\n\nTickets for the final in the participant member association (PMA) allocations begin at 4,185 US dollars (£3,130). Following England from first game to last buying the cheapest tickets would cost 7,020 US dollars (£5,250), before factoring in travel and accommodation.\n\nThe FSA also highlighted that ESTC members are being asked to pay for tickets through to the final, rather than just for the group games England are guaranteed to play.\n\n\"If England are knocked out before the final they’ll then return (the money), minus an admin fee of course. They are beyond shameless,\" the statement added.\n\nScotland fans, who have qualified for their first finals since 1998, face similarly high prices. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) has called on national associations to \"hold FIFA to account\" over the ticket costs.\n\nJohn MacLean, CEO of the SFSA, noted that Scottish Football Association president Mike Mulraney – recently appointed chair of FIFA’s finance committee – is ideally positioned \"to express the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar\".\n\nBoth the FA and Fifa have been contacted for comment.",

Last month she said that she was opposed to dynamic ticket pricing, and has vowed that it will not be used at Euro 2028, which the UK and Ireland is hosting.\n\nDespite mounting pressure, Fifa has also not yet made any public comment on its ticket price policies.\n\nThat may change if a number of national football associations jointly raise concerns, but with the Home Nations FAs hoping to host the 2035 Women's World Cup, they (and the UK government) may also be wary of upsetting Fifa.\n\nBBC Sport has been told that Fifa is waiting to see how many people have entered the ballot, but that it is expecting strong demand.\n\nPrivately, Fifa insiders say that while tickets will seem expensive to many, the governing body has a duty to set prices with the US market in mind, grow the game around the world, and to use its revenues to develop men's, women's and youth football.\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino has also promised to achieve record revenues, and the most lucrative sports event in history will do no harm to his re-election hopes in 2027.\n\nThe huge increase in the price of tickets was revealed on Thursday when Fifa released allocation details for the official supporters' groups of each country.\n\nAt the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, group stage fixtures all had set prices of £68.50, £164.50 or £219.\n\nBut for England v Croatia and Scotland v Brazil next year, tickets cost around £198, £373 or £523.\n\nThe cost ramps up considerably in the latter stages.\n\nQuarter-finals for all teams are £507, £757 and £1,073, with the semi-finals £686, £1,819 and £2,363.\n\nThe cheapest tickets for the final are £3,119, seven times more expensive than in Qatar.\n\nThere are no concessions across any of its tickets for children or other groups.",

There is no advantage to applying early - all fixtures remain available throughout the entire period.\n\nOnce the window closes, Fifa will run a lottery to decide which applications are successful.\n\nFans will be notified by email in February and, if they have been allocated tickets, will be charged automatically.\n\nDynamic pricing - or \"variable pricing\" as Fifa calls it - will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales.\n\nHowever, the governing body has confirmed that it will not apply during the main ballot. The price you see at the start of the window will be the same at the end.\n\nPrices will still be set based on expected demand for each fixture, with high-profile games likely to cost more.\n\nFor now, Fifa hasn't published any official price lists. It is expected people will know the price of tickets they ballot for on Thursday when it opens.\n\nAt present, the best guide we have comes from fans who tracked prices during the earlier sale phase.\n\nFifa has promoted Category 4 tickets as \"an accessible entry point to the tournament\".\n\nBut their stadium maps suggest the amount of Category 4 seating is extremely limited, and Football Supporters Europe said \"their very existence is still subject to caution\".\n\nIn most venues, the bulk of the seating appears to fall into the more expensive Category 1 and 2 sections.\n\nEach participating nation receives 8% of the tickets for its matches to distribute to its own supporters.\n\nFor England and Scotland, these will be made available to members of the England Supporters Travel Club and the Scotland Supporters Club. Both groups will receive an email with an access code for a Fifa portal, where they can apply from 15 December to 13 January.\n\nThese tickets are allocated via a ballot weighted towards members with the highest loyalty points.\n\nPrices are likely to be in line with the main ballot, but FA allocation tickets cannot be resold.\n\nAllocations for teams that progress through the play-offs are expected be released after those ties are completed in March.\n\nFifa has created its own official platform where fans can resell tickets bought through other phases of the ticketing process.\n\nSellers can list at whatever price they choose, and Fifa takes a 15% fee from both the seller and the buyer.\n\nFifa says these fees are \"aligned with North American industry trends across various sports\" and insists all revenue will be \"reinvested to fuel the growth of the game\".\n\nIt has also warned supporters against using unofficial resale sites, saying tickets bought elsewhere \"may be subject to cancellation without notice\".\n\nOn the unofficial secondary market, the cheapest tickets for England and Scotland's group games are already listed at more than £450.\n\nFans looking for guaranteed tickets - and not concerned about cost - can opt for official hospitality packages.\n\nThese typically cost thousands of pounds and include premium seating, lounge access and upmarket dining.\n\nThe most exclusive option is Platinum Access. Pricing for this tier is only available on request and details are sparse, although promotional material does feature an image of a private jet.\n\nCloser to the tournament, any remaining ticket inventory will be released on a first-come, first-served basis, operating much like a standard online ticket sale.\n\nThis phase is expected to utilise dynamic or variable pricing, though unlike other industries, Fifa will manually alter prices based on demand rather than using an algorithm.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa,\" said United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.\n\nIndeed, simply being a ticket holder does not guarantee entry to any of the host countries, Canada, Mexico or the US.\n\nFans planning to travel to the US should apply for either the Visa Waiver Programme (commonly known as an ESTA) or a Visitor Visa (B1/B2) depending on their nationality. UK citizens are normally eligible for an ESTA.\n\nCanada requires most visitors to obtain a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), while Mexico offers visa-free entry to many nationalities, including UK travellers.\n\nUS embassies are giving priority appointments to World Cup ticket holders but are still encouraging fans to apply as soon as possible.\n\nIt is unclear how ticket holders from countries whose citizens are mostly banned from travelling to the US will fare.\n\nSeveral members of the Iranian delegation were refused entry to the country for the World Cup draw last week.",

    "fullText": "Italy’s failure to qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup inevitably sparked plenty of debate across this once-proud footballing nation.\n\nLosing home and away to Norway consigned Italy to the play-offs and left them facing the prospect of missing out on the tournament for the third consecutive time.\n\nHead coach Gennaro Gattuso inevitably resorted to deflection tactics towards the end of European qualifying, bemoaning the revised system that seemingly favors other continents.\n\n“In my day, the best group runners-up went straight to the World Cup, now the rules have changed,” Gattuso said.\n\n“Italy’s record of six wins? You’d have to ask the people who make the groups and the rules. In 1990 and 1994, there were two African teams, now there are nine. It’s not a controversy, but there are difficulties, and we know it well.\n\n“If we look at South America, where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh heads into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets and a certain sadness. That is the disappointment. The system needs to change in Europe.”\n\nPutting aside the fact there are some factual inaccuracies in Gattuso’s comments, the 2020 European champions have only themselves to blame for their current situation.\n\nItaly were the top seeds in a relatively easy group, yet failed to get the job done. However, you flower it up, losing to Norway by a combined 7-1 scoreline is unacceptable.\n\nThe decision to appoint Gattuso to replace Luciano Spalletti looked questionable when it was announced, and subsequent events have done little to dispel that notion.\n\nGattuso was a fine player – a combative midfielder who helped AC Milan win the Champions League twice and Italy lift their last World Cup trophy in 2006.\n\nHowever, his managerial record at club level was hugely underwhelming and Italy’s decision to place him in charge may yet have a catastrophic ending.\n\n“When I heard Gattuso was online it just seemed to demonstrate the giant collapse of Italy,” Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told the Euro Leagues podcast.\n\n“There were so many clips going around on social media about that Italy team just before they won the World Cup and you are talking about Paolo Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, [Alessandro] Nesta, [Francesco] Totti, [Alessandro] Del Piero and it was just an embarrassment of riches.\n\n“Now when you look at Italy over the last few seasons, even though they won the Euros, there was just a fall – but the one thing you could rely on was that Italy created these great coaches. Yet none of these great coaches were called up or have succeeded.”\n\nPlay-off draw offers Italy hope\n\nItaly’s hopes of progressing to the World Cup were boosted after they were handed a relatively favorable draw in the play-offs.\n\nThey will host Northern Ireland in the semi-final, with the winners of that game visiting either Wales or Bosnia & Herzegovina in the final.\n\nThe last four tie against Northern Ireland should hold little fear for Italy. They suffered defeats at Germany and Slovakia in the group stage and generally don’t travel too well.\n\nHaving won seven and drawn three of their previous 11 meetings, Italy have little to fear from a team ranked 69th in the latest FIFA rankings.\n\nOn paper, Wales are the biggest threat to Italy. They are ranked 32nd in the world and are generally tough to beat on their own patch.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that they have never defeated Bosnia & Herzegovina in four previous attempts. The visitors will fancy their chances of enhancing that record.\n\nUltimately, given that Italy are currently ranked 12th in the world, they should be able to successfully navigate through the play-offs.\n\nThey have lost just twice to Wales in ten previous meetings and once to Bosnia & Herzegovina in six matches. If Italy fail to progress, they have no excuses.\n\nWhile suggesting that Italy could mount a challenge for the World Cup next summer is a little fanciful, stranger things have happened in football.\n\nThey demonstrated their credentials by winning the 2020 European Championship title and can draw inspiration from what they achieved on that occasion.\n\nAside from Spain and France, none of the other so-called main contenders for the World Cup are significantly better than Italy.\n\nIf they safely navigate the play-offs and land a favorable draw next summer, Italy are perfectly capable of making a deep run in the tournament.",

    "fullText": "Enzo Maresca is still dividing opinion at Chelsea. Despite a Club World Cup win and a top 4 finish last year, as well as an overall bright start to this campaign, there are a lot of doubters about the Italian coach.\n\nChelsea icon Gianfranco Zola speaking on the pitch at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOne person who isn’t in any doubt about him is club legend Gianfranco Zola. He claims he saw the coach’s talent before he had even come to Stamford Bridge.\n\n“I didn’t know him personally before he came to Chelsea, but I had followed what he did at Leicester and could see that we were dealing with a serious coach,” Zola said.\n\n“He’s worked with and for [Arrigo] Sacchi, Manuel Pellegrini, [Pep] Guardiola. He’s had an excellent grounding.”\n\nThere are a lot of positives about Maresca which nobody can dispute – he seems to have a lot of respect from the players and as Zola says, he’s got a great background in terms of people he’s worked under.\n\nHowever many Blues fans still aren’t delighted with the football he has his teams playing, and there are other gripes about his rotation policy and team selection in general. There’s also a sense he doesn’t get the best out of our star player, Cole Palmer.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see how feelings change through the course of the coach’s second year in charge.\n\nChelsea’s social media silence over one player this week was very notable – it doesn’t look like things are getting sorted out in this case anytime soon.\n\nChelsea managed to get a player into the Premier League team of the week in the week just gone – but it’s not the sort of player you want to see in there. Read this article and it will all make sense…",

It's not only about sport - it's about everything that surrounds sport: the values, the excitement, the community.\n\n\"I'm very motivated, very excited, and eager to share this new chapter.\"\n\nIniesta, who scored the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup and won two European Championships, before retiring last year, formed Never Say Never - a sports and entertainment management company - with businessman Joel Borras in 2018.\n\nThe cycling team is the latest addition to the stable after funding from Stoneweg - a Swiss investment firm.\n\nAs a statement of intent, NSN last week signed one of the hottest talents on road cycling's UCI World Tour in Eritrea's Biniam Girmay, who won the Tour de France's prestigious green jersey in 2024.\n\n\"I'm excited to dive deeper into cycling, learn more, and appreciate the huge amount of work behind every rider,\" added Iniesta.\n\n\"The goal for the team is simple: keep growing, enjoy the journey, and show what a united team can achieve – because, in the end, only one rider wins, but the collective effort is what will define us.\"\n\nNSN are expected to contest cycling's biggest races - including the Tour de France - next year after acquiring a World Tour licence as part of the deal to take over Israel Premier Tech, who were set to return to the World Tour next season.\n\nThe team also has five British riders on its roster, including one-day specialists Stevie Williams, Jake Stewart and sprinter Ethan Vernon.\n\nBritain's Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome was released last month.",
