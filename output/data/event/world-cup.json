Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament.

Fulham have so far shown the strongest interest from the Premier League.\n\nHaving energised his career at AZ, though, Parrott is understood to want to be very considerate about his next steps. While the forward does want to return to the Premier League at some point - he initially came through the Tottenham Hotspur system - any English move would have to fully make sense for both his current position and future prospects, which is why he is happy to stay in Europe.\n\nThe Bundesliga is an appealing option, particularly with the way the competition has proven so successful in developing young talent.\n\nAway from his prolific run for his country, Parrott has hit nine goals in 13 Eredivisie games, with 10 more goals this term in Conference League qualifiers and the KNVB Cup.\n\nParrott is tied fourth in the Eredivisie top scorer standings, with Ayase Ueda clear with 18 goals in as many games for Feyenoord.",

    "fullText": "The Africa Cup of Nations reaches its climax on Sunday with a showdown between host nation Morocco, looking to win the title for the first time in 50 years, and Sadio Mane's powerful Senegal side.\n\nThe final kicks off at 1900 GMT at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where almost all the 69,000 spectators will be backing Morocco, captained by African player of the year Achraf Hakimi.\n\nThe first AFCON ever to start in one year and end in another could be the second in a row to be won by the host nation, with the Atlas Lions aiming to follow in the footsteps of Ivory Coast, crowned champions on home soil in 2024.\n\nWalid Regragui's Morocco have established themselves in recent years as Africa's pre-eminent national team, becoming the first from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final, in 2022, and climbing to 11th place in the world rankings.\n\nHowever, they have long been AFCON underachievers, with their only title to date coming in 1976. This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.\n\nSenegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mane scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaounde.\n\n\"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it,\" Regragui told reporters on Saturday.\n\nHe has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.\n\n\"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final,\" he added.\n\n\"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history.\"\n\nHe added: \"Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable.\"\n\nMorocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence which has conceded only once.\n\nBeing at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.\n\nThe Senegalese Football Federation complained about a \"lack of adequate security\" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans \"which put the players and staff at risk\".\n\nIt also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Sale.\n\n\"What happened was not normal,\" said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nMane, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.\n\nBut Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree,\" said Thiaw.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible,\" added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.\n\nOff the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs, the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.",

    "title": "Trump 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to US",
    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "fullText": "Scottish Cup, fourth round: Dunfermline Athletic v Hibernian\n\nVenue: East End Park, Dunfermline Date: Saturday, 17 January Time: 12:30 GMT\n\nCoverage: Watch on BBC One Scotland & iPlayer, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app\n\nWhen Kieron Bowie takes to the field against Dunfermline Athletic on Saturday, it will be a reminder to one of Fife's finest talents of where his blossoming football career began in the humblest of surroundings.\n\nThe 23-year-old Hibernian and Scotland striker started at Dunfermline's biggest local rivals, Raith Rovers, with whom he says he owes a great debt of gratitude to current Falkirk manager John McGlynn.\n\nBowie was playing public park football in his home town of Kirkcaldy before McGlynn was alerted to the teenager and instantly took him to Stark's Park when he was in charge there.\n\n\"Until I was 16, I was just playing with my mates and stuff - and then Fife League was a thing at the time,\" he recalls when anticipating the Scottish Cup fourth-round tie at East End Park.\n\n\"I was only there for a few months and then John McGlynn and [assistant] Paul Smith went in at Raith and it sort of caught their eye a little bit.\"\n\nBowie admits he was \"a raw 16-year-old\" when he was told \"right, you can come in twice a week from school\".\n\n\"I'd done that for the rest of the season and then, in the summer, I was like, am I going to play? Because there was no reserves or anything - and then that season I played and done all right.\"\n\nLennon on 'huge loss' of father & meeting Hibs in cup\n\nTop-flight tie, Nygren & Leven in focus in Scottish Cup\n\nClarke open to new players but loyal to 'core group'\n\nBowie, who won his first two Scotland caps last year, was a late bloomer.\n\n\"I played for a team called Real Fife from 10 - I think I started playing quite late, nine, 10 and then, after that, I went on to Glenrothes Strollers, who a few of my mates played for, and one of their dads took the team,\" he says.\n\n\"It was different, to be honest. At Real Fife in Kirkcaldy, we just played up the park. Literally.\n\n\"Everyone has their own pathway to make it in the game and it's different to other people. People go through pro-youth academies and stuff, people go through grassroots clubs like myself.\n\n\"Everyone has a different way and, if everyone made it the same way, it'd be boring, wouldn't it?\"\n\nBowie's route to the top also took a detour to London and a time on the wings before only really making the striker role his own after his move to Hibs 18 months ago.\n\nAfter leaving Rovers for Fulham in 2020, he was loaned out to Northampton Town, where he was playing out of position.\n\n\"I was never an out-and-out striker,\" Bowie explains. \"I played on the wing when I was at Northampton on loan for two seasons, which I played almost 100 games. Imagine me on the wing, this tall lad just running about.\n\n\"Then I came here and they were like, we see you as a number nine. Just to put that belief into me, to play as a number nine and obviously I'm still young, fairly young, learning my trade. So hopefully I can just do as much as I can and progress.\"\n\nA wonder goal against Partizan Belgrade in Conference League qualifying in August brought Bowie greater attention and that has continued as he has notched up nine goals in 28 appearances so far this term.\n\nHis strength and prowess has led to speculation about interest from Celtic, Rangers and top clubs in England.\n\nHowever, in this World Cup year, the Hibs striker has only one goal - and that is to try to convince national head coach Steve Clarke he is worthy of a place on the plane to the Americas.\n\n\"Anyone that's been involved with Scotland over the last year, they're lying if they don't say 'I want to be there',\" Bowie says.\n\n\"Obviously I want to be there, but I just need to focus on now and what I'm doing here and hopefully that'll lead me to getting on that flight.\n\n\"Last summer, it was different, because it was just friendly matches. But it just sort of shows you're not that far away.\n\n\"Obviously the level of some of the players in there, you go in and you're like 'oh no, am I good enough' and you question it.

    "title": "The peril ‘true fans’ now face after Fifa’s World Cup ticket deadline",
    "description": "Many England fans have had to commit to World Cup tickets after Fifa’s deadline for initial applications passed on Tuesday, though how much they’ll have to pay – whether $60 or $7,000 - is still unknown",
    "fullText": "The deadline for initial World Cup ticket applications passed on Tuesday, with many England fans having no idea what they’ll end up paying, despite having to commit. The difference could end up being thousands of dollars, but they now can’t cancel.\n\nSome fans eligible for the limited $60 (£44.75) “category 4” tickets will still be sitting near relatives in the same section, facing thousands of dollars in difference. There have been many similar stories. A number of supporters naturally rushed to book already expensive hotels and flights when the schedule was confirmed on 6 December, only to make the difficult decision to cancel once prices were actually announced a few days later. A new system, which represents an inexplicable shift from all recent tournaments, has ensured some tickets have gone up to five times the price of Qatar. The initial backlash forced Fifa into a minor climbdown, where 10 per cent of tickets for all qualified teams – the Participating Member Associations (PMA) – were brought into a fixed $60 “category 4”. There’s an immense jump to category 3.\n\nDiscussion groups involving members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) feature comments like “obscene”, “blatant exploitation”, a “preying on loyalty and the feeling this is priceless”, and ultimately: “Fifa can stick it. They’ve ruined the best tournament in the world.”\n\nAll of which represents a doubt and uncertainty that cuts a very different tone to Fifa’s bombastic press release about “500 million ticket requests” and how this set “a new benchmark for demand in the history of world sport”.\n\nSupporter groups have nevertheless expressed cynicism at those figures, and the manner in which they escalated over the 33-day application period, despite Fifa stating that unique credit card data has been used for validation.\n\nSuch claims don’t mesh with experience on the ground. Data from Football Supporters Europe (FSE) – who represent fan groups across the continent – suggests that the level of interest is comparable with Qatar. That tournament barely saw any major fan group travel outside Argentina, Mexico, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. That might end up a concern given that Fifa said on Tuesday the highest number of applications outside the hosts came from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nIt is certainly a concern as regards how this tournament will feel, look and sound, and whether there will be enough emotionally invested fans to create the atmosphere that really amplifies a World Cup. Essentially, what Argentina brought to 2014 and 2022.\n\nFans who actually have confirmed orders laugh wryly at the Fifa sign-off – typically underneath figures reaching around $7,000, potentially breaching many credit limits before hotels and flights – that reads: “Thanks for being a true fan!”\n\nSuch marketing speak was echoed by president Gianni Infantino in Tuesday’s statement: “I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response. Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums.”\n\nExcept, this gratitude is apparently expressed in prices that ensure only a certain tax band can actually afford to be welcomed inside the stadiums, in a system that doesn’t seem to truly recognise this “meaning”.\n\nAs written in The Independent before, the entire story articulates a central tension in 2026 football, which is that between its cultural importance and the will to make it a mere entertainment commodity. Fifa, officially a not-for-profit charity, seems to very much be leaning towards the latter.\n\nDuly, there is a deepening anger at the lack of attention to a genuine social issue within this. The Independent has already reported how the normally protected accessibility tickets are appearing on Fifa’s own resale site at six times the price, amid the controversy that carers will also be charged in a decision that goes against the body’s own statutes on human rights.\n\nThose within Fifa privately stress that the US hosting has thrown up more legal complications than any previous World Cup, especially with how legislation prevents requests for proof of disability, leading to the current system.\n\nFan groups counter that this is another case of “a pinch of truth being expanded to justify the whole ticketing policy”. They argue that Fifa knew all of this years in advance, so could have come up with multiple different solutions or guardrails, and that there’s nothing to prevent making a companion ticket free of charge or putting accessibility in the cheapest category.\n\nThey proffer that the same applies to the ongoing debate over the US “secondary market” – in other words, legalised touting – that Fifa insiders say “throws up completely new challenges than anything we’ve faced before”.\n\nAgain, multiple proactive solutions were possible, including protecting PMA tickets from transfer. There’s instead a feeling that Fifa is just seeking to earn resale differences themselves rather than tackle the issue.\n\nThat runs alongside ongoing frustration that the FA are not more outspoken on behalf of England fans. The body’s general stance is that the idiosyncratic top-down nature of football politics means they can be most effective in raising issues behind the scenes. It’s understood the FA did relay concerns to Fifa amid the initial backlash, and that this played a part in the creation of category 4 tickets.\n\nHowever, the highly limited number has created a headache for the FA, as travelling fans who fall just outside the caps needed for $60 tickets face ballots to see whether they are in the much more expensive category 2 rather than 3. Such fans pay £70 every two years to be a member of the ESTC and generally go to at least 11 away games over four years, in the hope that such loyalty will be rewarded, only to be faced with what they feel is “exploitation”.\n\nThat has fostered further frustration with the FA strategy, and questions like “what results can they actually point to?” Ultimately, the big nations have never even tried to properly challenge Infantino’s Fifa as a bloc.\n\nFor the FA’s part, they have been more proactive than many of their counterparts, amid a lament that the initial backlash has waned. Belgium and Denmark have instead parroted Fifa’s lines about raising money for the global game and the need to conform to the US market.\n\nSuch responses also cut to the core of all this, Fifa’s power structure, and how it was decided. Pricing ultimately came from those close to Infantino, with very little information dispersed – even to the Fifa Council.\n\nWhen pressed, insiders ultimately resort to those same justifications: raising money for the game, and “demand”.\n\nThat’s despite Fifa’s immense surpluses coming from the old pricing system, and the key point that they just do not have to concern themselves with demand. What’s more, no previous World Cup has conformed to the host market.\n\nBut what of the future? As one senior official said, “the sad part is that it’s probably done”. In other words, the prices are set for this tournament. Just one of many further questions is what happens if it’s a commercial success.",

    "fullText": "Zoe Stratford took two weeks to bask in England's Women's Rugby World Cup glory.\n\nShortly after lifting the world title in front of nearly 82,000 people at Twickenham, the England captain and her club and country team-mate Natasha Hunt were picking up something else - the keys to a new business venture.\n\nWhile each of the Red Roses earned a World Cup-winning bonus of £20,000 and the most lucrative of their central contracts are worth just short of £50,000, all of England's squad have to make plans for life after rugby.\n\nWing Abby Dow, 28, retired after the tournament to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. Hooker May Campbell combines her rugby with working at a crypto payment company. Amy Cokayne is a police officer in the Royal Air Force.\n\nLock Stratford and scrum-half Hunt have chosen a different route, opening a coffee shop together.\n\nThe pair have premises close to Kingsholm, where they run out for PWR side Gloucester-Hartpury.\n\n\"It's been incredibly fun renovating it, putting our ideas into it,\" said Stratford.\n\n\"With rugby we had so much intensity coming into the World Cup. Afterwards we were a bit exhausted with it, so this gave us a new lease of life.\n\n\"We didn't just have rugby, we could put our energy into this coffee shop and making it ours.\"\n\nTheir shop is called 'MoZo' - an amalgamation of Stratford's first name and Hunt's nickname 'Mo'.\n\nStratford says that the venture has given her a valuable distraction from sport, allowing her to switch off when she is away from the pitch.\n\n\"It is super important to have these other interests,\" she added.\n\n\"I think the reason so many of the girls are successful is because they have interests besides rugby. The coffee shop give us that release.\"\n\nBoth Stratford and Hunt have been getting stuck in on the shop floor working shifts, including on the day of Gloucester men's match against Castres in early December.\n\n\"I am terrible at coffee art,\" Stratford said when asked about the skill of making patterns and pictures in the frothy top of drinks.\n\n\"I stick to the till. Mo is very good though. Sometimes I mess the stock up and she is pulling her hair out with me, but it is cool.\n\n\"It is something we have wanted to do and hopefully we will grow it.\"\n\nThree-time defending champions Gloucester-Hartpury have won all seven of their PWR games this season, while both Stratford and Hunt were named in a 47-strong England training camp this month.\n\nEngland begin the defence of their Women's Six Nations title against Ireland at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham on 11 April.",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh's cricketers have begun a boycott of all forms of cricket in response to comments made by a national cricket board director, which have led to his removal.\n\nBoth of Thursday's matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) have been postponed, while the national side's participation in February's T20 World Cup is in doubt.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced it has removed M Nazmul Islam from his position as chair of its financial committee after he suggested players should shoulder the financial burden if Bangladesh were to withdraw from the World Cup.\n\nThe comments came amid political tensions between Bangladesh and host nation India.\n\nThe BCB has formally requested that all Bangladesh's matches are staged elsewhere in order to participate in the tournament.\n\nAll of Pakistan's fixtures are to be played in Sri Lanka, with the BCB seeking a similar arrangement.\n\nAsked about the financial implications should Bangladesh be required to withdraw, Islam said: \"Why [would there be]? Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.\n\n\"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?\n\n\"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?\"\n\nOne Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over £60,000.\n\nIslam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).\n\n\"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable,\" Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow.\"\n\nNeither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.\n\nThe BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: \"Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.\n\n\"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt said all cricketers should \"display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game\" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.\n\nBangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.",

    "fullText": "Joao Pedro’s window at Chelsea is closing, and the next few games will tell us a lot about his short term future.\n\nHe came in with a big impact at the Club World Cup, and gave everyone the hope that Chelsea’s striker troubles were over. But as time has passed, it’s become clear that he prefers to play as a number ten.\n\nThat’s all well and good. The problem is that Chelsea already have plenty of number tens. There’s an argument they have too many, even without the Brazil star. Meanwhile, they’re pretty short up front.\n\nLiam Delap has missed most of the season injured, and has only just scored his first Premier League goal a week ago. Yet as far as we can see, he’s ahead of JP in the pecking order for Liam Rosenior. Delap may not score, but he puts himself about. That’s more than you can say for Joao Pedro at the moment.\n\nJoao Pedro protests a decision against Arsenal. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Cole Palmer and even Estevao Willian pushing for minutes at 10, and Delap a better option up top, JP is looking a little lost right now. Rotation and injuries will always mean he’s in line for fairly regular action, especially off the bench where he provides a good option.\n\nBut right now, it’s hard to imagine him being considered first choice. He’s got 18 Premier League starts and 3 sub appearances, so he’s featured in every game so far this season. We doubt that record is going to continue.\n\nWest Ham are circling around the drain of the Premier League, and are getting desperate for solutions. They’re now sniffing around a player who Chelsea don’t even use.\n\nCole Palmer had his annus mirabilis under Mauricio Pochettino rather than Enzo Maresca and the stats show it clearly – but how much of that was actually down to the coaches?",

    "title": "As 2026 World Cup nears, Alan Rothenberg reflects on U.S. soccer's transformation",
    "description": "As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, Alan Rothenberg arguably had more to do with writing the story of modern U.S. Soccer than anyone.",
    "fullText": "Alan Rothenberg has a story he wants to tell you. A lot of stories actually; enough to fill a book.\n\nBut that’s not the first memorable work he’s authored. As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, still the most successful in history, Rothenberg has arguably had more to do with writing the story of U.S. Soccer in the modern era than anyone.\n\nAnd you can draw a straight line from that chapter to the one that will be written this summer when the World Cup returns to the U.S.\n\n“The turning point really was the Olympics,” he said last month over brunch in a crowded Sherman Oaks diner. “That soccer was so successful in the Olympics, that’s when FIFA thought maybe we could bring our crown jewel to the United States and not be embarrassed.\n\n“So ‘84 Olympics. That’s a crucial part of the story. I doubt that we would be where we are now but for that.”\n\nThat story’s in “The Big Bounce: The Surge That Shaped the Future of U.S. Soccer,” which is available Feb. 10. In fact, the book starts there.\n\nBut Rothenberg’s career did not. Before changing the face of U.S. Soccer, he first altered the landscape of sports in his adopted hometown, playing instrumental roles in bringing the Clippers to Los Angeles, in negotiating the trade that made Kareem Abdul-Jabbar a Laker and in settling the Kings at the Forum.\n\nAs a lawyer who started his career as the in-house counsel for Jack Kent Cooke when Cooke owned the Lakers, the Kings, the then-Washington Redskins and was launching the Wolves of the nascent NASL, Rothenberg was involved in some of the most consequential events in four sports during a career that’s nearing the end of its sixth decade. Yet he knew little about soccer when Peter Ueberroth, chair of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee, put him in charge of the sport for the 1984 Games.\n\n“Peter assumed with that background I must know a lot about soccer,” Rothenberg writes. “That was wrong.”\n\nWhat he lacked in soccer knowledge he more than made up for in creativity and organization skills, however, and the Olympic tournament proved to be one of the most successful in history, with the final at the Rose Bowl drawing a crowd of 104,098, a U.S. record for a soccer game that stood for 30 years.\n\nBut his name will forever be synonymous with the World Cup.\n\nThe 1994 tournament was the first to be played in a country without a first-division league and there were widespread fears it would be a disaster. Instead, it drew an average of 69,174 fans to each of the 52 games, an attendance record that still stands. It also generated a surplus of more than $50 million — also a record — money that went to the U.S. Soccer Foundation to promote the growth of the sport in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, Major League Soccer kicked off; 30 years later it’s the sixth-most-valuable soccer league in the world.\n\n“Everything flowed from ‘94,” Rothenberg said. “If ‘94 had not been successful, including if our [U.S.] team hadn’t been credible, I’m not sure how quickly things would have developed. Certainly we wouldn’t have been able to start Major League Soccer at that time if the World Cup wasn’t successful.”\n\nAnother rarely discussed — but hugely important — legacy of that tournament is the foundation it created in terms of experience and expertise. The U.S. had never staged a major standalone soccer competition before 1994 and the learning curve was steep. Among those who worked under Rothenberg and went on to great success in the sport were Sunil Gulati, a three-term president of U.S. Soccer; Nelson Rodriguez, now MLS executive vice-president; Marla Messing, who headed the organizing committee for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and was later interim commissioner of the NWSL; Tom King, U.S. Soccer’s longtime managing director of administration; Kathy Carter, the former executive vice-president of Soccer United Marketing and chief executive officer of U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Properties; and Charlie Stillitano, a former MLS general manager who pioneered the idea of inviting major European clubs to play summer friendlies in the U.S.\n\n“It's not just that the event [came] off. Look what came out of it,” said Scott LeTellier, who as managing director and chief operating officer had responsibility for day-to-day operations of the World Cup organizing committee for 1994. “All the people who worked on our committee, who had some role that now are general managers of MLS teams. The league itself that came out of it. The number of soccer facilities. We didn't have a single soccer specific-stadium in the country.\n\n“You can argue that the ‘94 World Cup was really the linchpin to that entire explosion in the sport.”\n\nThat tournament was ahead of its time in other ways too. It was the first to stage fan fests in host cities, the first to include musical performers at the final and the first to offer hospitality packages with the price of a ticket. It also featured a lavish opening ceremony, one that featured Diana Ross, Oprah Winfrey and President Clinton, turning what was just a soccer tournament into a global spectacle.\n\nThe World Cup hasn’t been the same since, with FIFA’s revenue growing to a projected $13 billion for the 2026 cycle. There are more than 40 countries that don’t have an economy that large.\n\nAs Rothenberg notes in his book, FIFA originally pushed back on many of the innovations he proposed, including a halftime show at the final, only to eventually adopt the ideas as their own. Rothenberg also wanted to charge $1,000 a ticket for the final in 1994, arguing that fans would pay that on the secondary market, so why let the scalpers make the profit?\n\n“They were horrified,” he said. “You realize what a dramatic statement it would make if you had a $100-million gate?”\n\nThey do now; the cheapest regular tickets for the final of this summer’s tournament start at $2,000.\n\nRothenberg said he’s still thinking of other ways to improve the tournament, such as expanding the field to 64 teams and doing away with the group stage, making the World Cup like the NCAA basketball tournament.\n\n“I know I’m off the charts on this one,” he said. “Single elimination. It’s exciting start to finish.”\n\nAt 86, Rothenberg is still active, making regular trips to his office at 1st Century Bank, the community bank he founded in 2004 at an age when most people were entering retirement. And he promises to be a presence at this summer’s World Cup.\n\nAs for whether he gets the credit he deserves for making that tournament possible, Rothenberg demurs.\n\n“I didn’t do it for credit,” he says, speaking about both the World Cup and the book that explains how it happened. “All I can say is I’m proud of what I did.”\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "fullText": "Italy legend Roberto Baggio still carries a ‘weight’ for missing a decisive penalty kick against Brazil in the 1994 World Cup Final: ‘I lost three World Cups on penalties, not easy to digest.’\n\nItaly legend Baggio said his penalty kick miss in the 1994 World Cup Final was “the greatest bitterness of my football career.”\n\n“I grew up with the dream of a World Cup Final against Brazil. I don’t have a clear memory of why this goal has stayed with me since I was very young, through my entire life,” Baggio told Forbes Italia via Gazzetta.\n\n“I have always considered myself an ordinary person. Just like everyone else. I never saw myself as special. I only had this uncontrollable passion for football. A passion that stirs something inside you from morning to night. I slept with the ball.\n\nItalian former football player Roberto Baggio (R) and Argentine-born Italian former football player, David Trezeguet (L) gesture before the beginning of the Argentina 2023 U-20 World Cup final match between Uruguay and Italy at the Estadio Unico Diego Armando Maradona stadium in La Plata, Argentina, on June 11, 2023. (Photo by Alejandro PAGNI / AFP) (Photo by ALEJANDRO PAGNI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“I would have given up everything else to win that World Cup. I was representing Italy. It was the goal I was always chasing. The last thought before going to sleep was how to win that World Cup. Maybe by scoring a bicycle kick.\n\n“Then it turned out in a way I never would have imagined, and I will never be able to forget it. Just one step away from the finish line. The greatest bitterness of my football career, an unbelievable personal tragedy, I still carry that weight inside me.”\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JUNE 03: Roberto Baggio looks on during a press conference at Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano on June 03, 2024 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Claudio Villa/Getty Images)\n\nBaggio took part in three World Cups. The Azzurri finished third in 1990, runners-up in 1994 and were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners France in 1998.\n\n“I played in three World Cups. In Italy [1990], we finished third, winning six matches and drawing one. I lost three World Cups on penalties, not easy to digest,” he concluded.",

Fifa says it cannot guarantee that they will get a seat next to the disabled fan they have taken to the game.\n\nThere is also uncertainty over how many tickets will be made available to wheelchair users and the number of easy access spaces.\n\nLevel Playing Field says it \"raised serious and legitimate concerns\" with Fifa more than three weeks ago but has not received a response.\n\nIt has now written to national governing bodies and the secretary of state for culture, media and sport.\n\n\"This ongoing uncertainty over accessible ticketing is unacceptable,\" said Tony Taylor, the chair of Level Playing Field.\n\n\"The current situation appears to expect disabled fans to gamble on cost and access.\n\n\"Planning, personal assistants and pricing are vital considerations for disabled fans, as repeatedly shown in Level Playing Field Annual Fan Survey data.\n\n\"Restricting access to the lowest pricing tiers and charging for personal assistants, add unavoidable, additional, disability-related costs to attending.\n\n\"Instead of addressing the issue and communicating with supporters effectively, the current response has only been to delay and ignore.\"\n\nFifa has been approached for comment.\n\nWorld football's governing body has been heavily criticised for its high pricing structure at this summer's event in the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nIt eventually bowed to pressure by releasing a small number of \"more affordable\" $60 (£45) tickets to general fans for all 104 matches. But there has been no such flexibility for disabled fans.\n\nEngland supporters have not taken up their full general ticket allocation for the final and semi-final because of the cost. Around 90% of tickets for the final made available to the FA cost £3,094.",

This did not match the television pictures of the game.\n\nFifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters.\n\nThe technology was tested in Fifa's Intercontinental Cup, with Flamengo and Pyramids FC players scanned ahead of their match in December.\n\nFifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored.

    "fullText": "Slovenian Domen Prevc matched his brother's feat 10 years ago by clinching his first Four Hills title after finishing second in the final leg of the prestigious ski-jumping competition on Tuesday.\n\nThe World Cup leader jumped last in the first round on the Bischofshofen large hill but showed no signs of nerves to top the halfway rankings with 138 metres.\n\nA second jump of 138.5m for a combined 299.8 points meant he was nudged into second by last year's Four Hills winner and defending World Cup champion Daniel Tschofenig, who managed 137m and 140.5m for 303.9 in front of cheering home fans in Austria.\n\nThree-times Four Hills champion Ryoyu Kobayashi was third on the night.\n\nPrevc still triumphed over the four events, having won the German legs in Oberstdorf and Garmisch-Partenkirchen as part of seven victories in eight World Cup meets.\n\n\"You feel super blessed, you feel super amazing, super overwhelming,\" he told ARD.\n\n\"I'm super proud of my work, finally things came together at the right moment, at the right time. Winning the Golden Eagle is a childhood dream, a childhood dream that came true. I was dreaming about this moment.\"\n\nHe narrowly lost out to Ren Nikaido in Innsbruck at the weekend to end his hopes of a rare Four Hills clean sweep. Overall Prevc scored 1,195.6 in the Four Hills ahead of Austrian duo Jan Hörl and Stephan Embacher.\n\nThe 26-year-old world champion looks the favourite for Winter Olympic glory in Milan/Cortina next month and is part of the first sibling duo to win ski jumping's famed prize.\n\nDomen's older brother Peter Prevc won the Four Hills in 2016 and there is a further reason for a big party in the Prevc household.\n\nIn the women's World Cup, Domen's sister Nika Prevc wrapped up back-to-back wins in Austria's Villach as she extended her lead in the overall standings - having recently also won the women's Two Nights Tour.\n\nThe 2024 and 2025 World Cup champion edged Austrian Lisa Eder by 0.6 points, with Germany's Agnes Reisch picking up her first podium of the season on the normal hill.\n\nThe next World Cup ski-jumping action for the men is a super team event on the Zakopane large hill in Poland on Saturday, when the women take to the normal hill in Slovenia's Ljubno.",

    "fullText": "PDC Q-School 2026: Storied names survive the early skirmishes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer World Champion and all round darts legend Steve Beaton has safely navigated the opening minefield at the PDC's Q-School 2026, booking his passage to the final stage after storming into the last 16 on day one. The Bronzed Adonis, still chiselled, still unflustered, still very much alive in the fight, can now exhale. What lies ahead from Thursday onward will be infinitely more punishing – but for now, the popular veteran, who reversed a decision to step off the main tour in 2024, has earned a brief ceasefire.\n\nKeeping him company in the hotel lounge is former World Cup winner John Henderson. The experienced Scot has done exactly what was required, nothing more, nothing less. Job done. Feet up. A couple of days’ rest secured, safe in the knowledge that when the real party starts, it’s always more fun when Hendo is invited.\n\nTHE PDC Q-SCHOOL: How to win a Pro Tour golden ticket\n\nFourteen other hopefuls have joined them in this early sanctuary, all punching their tickets to the final phase with days to spare – a priceless luxury in a week where energy, nerve and sanity are finite resources. They are:\n\nLloyd Walker (ENG), James Howard Jones (ENG), Jamie Kelling (ENG), Damien Grimes (IRE), James Evans-Bradford (ENG), Daniel Ayres (ENG), Killian McCormack (IRE), Jake Eichen (ENG), Joe Croft (ENG), Joseph Heywood (ENG), Paul Lewis (ENG), Charlie Large (ENG), Keelan Kay (ENG) and Jamie Tiley (SCO).\n\nMeanwhile, across the Channel in Germany, the same pattern is emerging. Among the early qualifiers in Kalkar is Brian Raman, the 2022 WDF World Championship quarter-finalist and former PDC Tour Card holder, who will be eyeing a swift return to the professional circuit after falling away at the end of 2024.\n\nStanding alongside him is a name that once sent shockwaves through the elite – Jeffrey de Zwaan. The Black Cobra. Two-time Players Championship winner. Former World Matchplay semi-finalist. Those achievements may sit almost a decade in the rear-view mirror, but at just 29, time has not yet closed its fist. There is still venom left.\n\nCompleting the European batch who earned passage to the final stage on day one: Sietse Lap (NED), Jeffrey Keen (NED), Dennis Van Bergen (NED), Jarno Bottenberg (NED), Jose Justicia (ESP), Gilbert van der Meijden (NED), Michael Hurtz (GER), Michael Van De Ven (NED), Michael De Mayer (BEL), Tomislav Rosandic (CRO), Mitja Gustorf (GER), Kris Mievis (BEL), Jiri Brejcha (CZE) and Luitsen Elzinga (NED).\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "A public holiday will mark Scotland's men's national team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.\n\nScotland will face Haiti in Boston at 02:00 GMT on Sunday 14 June, before taking on Morocco and Brazil in their remaining group fixtures in the United States.\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney has proposed that 15 June is designated as a national bank holiday - though the move will only affect staff directly employed by the Scottish government.\n\nLike the St Andrews' Day bank holiday, other employers would not be compelled to observe it.\n\nThe proposal will be formally confirmed once it has been rubber-stamped by the King.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Glasgow, Swinney said: \"The whole nation will come to a standstill in June - even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.\n\n\"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion.\"\n\nHe added: \"That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years, and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.\"\n\nScotland is able to set distinct bank holidays from the rest of the UK.\n\nA day can be appointed as a bank holiday in Scotland by royal proclamation.\n\nThe first minister is able to advise the Privy Council - an advisory board to the monarch - on proclamations for Scotland, which are formally signed off by the King.\n\nScotland face Morocco in Boston on 19 June, and Brazil in Miami on 24 June. Both games kick off at 23:00 GMT.\n\nSwinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.\n\nThe Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.\n\nBut an extra holiday may be a pragmatic response to the situation some businesses may face on the morning after Scotland's opening World Cup game. How many might want to stay up late and then take the day off?\n\nDecisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.\n\nIn general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.\n\nEmployment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.\n\nNor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.\n\nEven the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.\n\nSchool holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.\n\n'Scotland qualifying for the World Cup put me in hospital'\n\nScots celebrate reaching first World Cup in nearly 30 years",

I saw her start and I was like 'mmm, OK, that's good, that's really good', but I just tried to give my best, and it worked,\" she said.\n\nThere are two more World Cup slalom events - in Flachau, Austria, on 13 January, and Spindleruv Mlyn in the Czech Republic on 25 January - before the Winter Olympics begin in Milan-Cortina on 6 February.\n\nWatch Rast's victory and interview in the latest edition of Ski Sunday from 17:50 GMT on 4 January.\n\nGreat Britain had two cross-country skiers finish in the top 10 of a World Cup event for the first time in Val di Fiemme, Italy, on Sunday.\n\nBritain's Joe Davies, 24, was sixth - his best World Cup finish - while team-mate Andrew Musgrave, 35, was eighth in the men's 10km mass start free, more commonly known as the 'Final Climb'.\n\nMusgrave finished 15th and Davies 16th in the overall Tour de Ski standings - the first time the British team has had two skiers in the top 20.\n\nDavies told BBC Sport: \"To have the results we've had this Tour de Ski means so much to us all. It's not only a testament to the work we've put in, but also to the belief that British skiing belongs at the top.\"\n\nThe British cross country team for the 2026 Winter Olympics is expected to be announced on 23 January.\n\nMeanwhile, Great Britain narrowly missed out on a first World Cup podium of the season in the men's four-man bobsleigh, finishing fourth in Winterberg, Germany.",

    "fullText": "Australian teen sensation Indra Brown announced herself as one of the potential stars of next month's Winter Olympics as she continued a remarkable start to her World Cup career with a maiden victory in the women's freeski halfpipe.\n\nThe 15-year-old maintained a run of World Cup podium finishes in her first three events by making it on to the top step for the first time at the Canadian resort of Calgary.\n\nBrown matched a World Cup mark set by 15-year-old Swede Jennie-Lee Burmansson, who claimed podium finishes in her first three slopestyle starts in the 2017-18 season.\n\n\"I'm just full of joy, super happy that I was able to land a run and ski how I did today in these conditions,\" said Brown, who earned a score of 85.20 for her first run, that no other skier was able to match.\n\nChina's Zhang Kexin, 23, was second with 84.20 and American Svea Irving, also 23, third with 83.20.\n\n\"I'm really happy and stoked, and excited for more,\" added Brown, who finished third on her World Cup debut in Secret Garden, China, in early December and second in the US resort of Copper Mountain before the Christmas break.\n\nShe became the youngest Australian to claim a World Cup victory and the first from her country to earn three World Cup podiums.\n\nBrown's maiden win in Canada moved her top of the women's freeski halfpipe standings on 240 points, 55 points clear of Zhang in second place.\n\nShe is yet to be confirmed in the Australian team for the Winter Olympics, which begin in Milan and Cortina, in Italy, on 6 February.\n\nA selection will be made after the final World Cup event before the Games, which takes place in the US resort of Aspen from 8-10 January.",

    "fullText": "According to a report from AS, Real Madrid scouts will closely monitor Kees Smit over the next six months before the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIt is known that the AZ Alkmaar youngster is being followed as part of Madrid’s wider plan to identify a midfield orchestrator capable of leading the team into the next cycle.\n\nAs mentioned many times in the past, Real Madrid are preparing to reinforce their midfield in the summer of 2026.\n\nWith that objective in mind, Smit has emerged as a profile that fits many of the club’s requirements.\n\nOver recent weeks, his name has gathered serious traction among scouts, not just in Spain but across Europe.\n\nCompetition for Smit’s signature is expected to be fierce.\n\nSeveral top clubs are aware of his rapid development, but Real Madrid believe their sporting project and global pull could be decisive if they choose to make a concrete move.\n\nThe club see him as a player who is young enough to grow, yet already mature enough to handle responsibility at the highest level.\n\nReal Madrid will keep an eye on Kees Smit. (Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)\n\nAt just 19 years old, Smit has already taken important steps forward in his career. He has made his debut for the Dutch national team under Ronald Koeman, who is counting on him as part of his plans heading into the World Cup.\n\nKoeman’s faith has been telling, and comparisons to Pedri only underline the type of midfielder Smit is becoming.\n\nMeanwhile, Real Madrid’s interest is not new. Club scouts were first drawn to Smit during a Youth League match in the 2022–23 season, when AZ Alkmaar convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0.\n\nThat performance sparked sustained monitoring of his progress, and since then, his development has only reinforced the initial impressions.\n\nFrom now until the end of the season, the evaluation process will intensify. Madrid intend to observe him continuously, analysing not only his performances but also his consistency, personality, and response to pressure.\n\nHowever, under contract until 2028, AZ Alkmaar currently value him at around €60 million.\n\nIt is already a hefty figure for a player who turns 20 on January 21, but one that could climb even higher with strong international exposure.",

    "fullText": "World Cup leader Domen Prevc claimed his second triumph at the Four Hills Tournament with a win in the large hill in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany on Thursday.\n\nIn the second event of the tournament, the Slovenian soared 143 metres and 141 metres to a total of 303.1 points.\n\nJan Hörl of Austria was 15.4 points behind in second and team-mate Stephan Embacher was third.\n\nIn the qualification round on Wednesday, Embacher broke the hill record in Garmisch-Partenkirchen with a jump of 145.5m.\n\nDefending Four Hills Tournament champion Daniel Tschofenig of Austria was ninth.\n\nPrevc has the chance of becoming only the fourth ski jumper in history to take the title by winning all four events. Only Germany's Sven Hannawald, Poland's Kamil Stoch, and Japan's Ryoyu Kobayashi have ever achieved this milestone.\n\n\"I had super jumps. Actually, I didn’t celebrate New Year's (Eve) as I was so tired. I just went to sleep at eleven o'clock (2200 GMT Wednesday). I didn't hear the fireworks, so I think I had (some sort) of advantage today,\" Prevc said.\n\n\"I was really well rested and in super shape. Combining all of that led to a super performance. It is amazing, I hope to keep it going.\"\n\nThe next event is in Innsbruck, Austria on Sunday.\n\nPrevc's team-mate Timi Zajc was disqualified for a second consecutive time at the Four Hills Tournament due to an irregularity with his suit.\n\nZajc's suit deviated from the standard by four millimetres and he received a red card before the first jump on Thursday.\n\nIn the first stop of the tournament in Oberstdorf, Zajc was eliminated due to the same infraction. He had originally finished joint second.\n\n\"It can happen but when it happens a second time, I have to say: this shouldn't happen. This is of course very frustrating for the athlete,\" German ski jumper Karl Geiger said.",

    "fullText": "FIFA has had “cooling breaks” for a while now to give players some time to hydrate when the temperature during a match is excesive. This started during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, when a Brazilian court ordered FIFA breaks near the 30th minute mark for the players to hydrate when temperatures reached 32 degrees Celsius (via ESPN).\n\nSince then, certain leagues such as the MLS and Spanish LaLiga have adopted similar breaks, with each league using different parameters for the interruption of play.\n\nNow, per a report from The Athletic’s Henry Bushnell, the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature ‘three-minute hydration breaks’ in each half of every game:\n\nIn 2026, for the first time at a World Cup, they’ll pause no matter what, around 22 minutes into each half.\n\n“There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,” FIFA said in a release posted online late Sunday night.\n\nThe report also mentions that the breaks have commercial implications, which can surely be translated as an opportunity for FIFA to sell pricey ad spots to increase the World Cup revenue — something which might not surprise anyone at this point.",

    "fullText": "Fifa president Gianni Infantino has defended the cost of World Cup tickets by saying they reflect the public's \"absolutely crazy\" demand for next summer's tournament.\n\nThe pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) describing it as \"scandalous\".\n\nGroup stage tickets are up to three times the price of those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, while the cheapest ticket for the final in New Jersey is £3,119.\n\nBut Infantino says the level of demand far outstrips supply.\n\n\"We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,\" Infantino said at the World Sports Summit in Dubai on Monday.\n\n\"So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.",

    "fullText": "One goal in his first 10 Premier League appearances this season had many questioning whether Dominic Calvert-Lewin's best days were behind him.\n\nBut, only four weeks on, he's the most talked-about striker in England after scoring seven goals in six games.\n\nHis latest goal, in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland, took his tally to eight for the season, making him the leading English scorer in the Premier League this campaign.\n\nThe 28-year-old signed for the Whites on a free transfer in the summer after a nine-year spell with Everton, which ended with a series of injuries hampering his final seasons.\n\nBut the numbers behind his resurgence in Daniel Farke's new counter-attacking 3-5-2 formation are impressive.\n\nHis six-game streak places him in elite company as only the 11th English player to score in six or more consecutive Premier League appearances.\n\nTo put that into perspective, even England captain Harry Kane never managed a run this long - his best stands at two separate five-match streaks.\n\nAnd the only English striker to better Calvert-Lewin in recent memory is Jamie Vardy, who went on an eight-game scoring spree for Leicester City in 2019.\n\nSo could Calvert-Lewin yet force his way into Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup?",

    "fullText": "Whether it was underdog heroics in World Cup qualifying, England winning Euro 2025, or United States President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino becoming best buds, international football played a big role in 2025 — and a men’s World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is just 165 days away.\n\nIn the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins.\n\nBut away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.\n\nHere, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O’Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year.\n\nJames: Wimbledon, 1988. You can’t snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.\n\nAnka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.\n\nO’Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d’Or. \n\nFeringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.\n\nMiller: I don’t think I’ll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.\n\nMiller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I’ll never forget.\n\nO’Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.\n\nFeringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.\n\nJames: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.\n\nAnka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.\n\nMiller: Scott McTominay. One of football’s great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.\n\nO’Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.\n\nFeringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else’s villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.\n\nJames: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.\n\nForest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn’t expect anything.”\n\nAnka: The two biggest games of McTominay’s 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland’s qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nI undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.\n\nAlso, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don’t think there’s a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men’s game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he’s always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.\n\n“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz\n\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025\n\nMiller: It won’t do to overcomplicate these things, so it’s a toss-up between two.\n\nEither Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.\n\nOr Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.\n\nFeringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports’ Halo and Joey Barton.\n\nJames: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there’s plenty in between, too.\n\nAnka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.\n\nMiller: Troy Parrott’s miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can’t remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.\n\nO’Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England’s Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.\n\nFeringa: Gotham’s victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That’s silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.\n\nJames: Well, I certainly didn’t expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah’s outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.\n\nAnka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.\n\nMiller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.\n\nO’Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…\n\nFeringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don’t know why everyone kept panicking. You don’t come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.\n\nJames: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.\n\nAnka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.\n\nMiller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.\n\nO’Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.\n\nFeringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women’s Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).\n\nJames: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA’s decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.\n\nUEFA’s judgement was harsh but I wouldn’t go that far.\n\nAnyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I’ll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.\n\nYeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.\n\nAnka: The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria’s Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco’s federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.\n\nMiller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser in the final men’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.\n\nThe latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) February 15, 2025\n\nO’Neill: I wasn’t there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.\n\nIt came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.\n\nFeringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.\n\nAitana's turn for the goal 🥵 #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/WbwTRCbyfJ\n\n— UEFA Women's EURO (@WEURO2025) July 23, 2025\n\nClose second: Jack Grealish’s first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I’d be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.\n\nJames: Paris Saint-Germain’s third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele’s backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.\n\nThe results are in for the best play of the year!\n\nThe winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!\n\nThank you for voting, the fun doesn’t stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Stay… pic.twitter.com/4SVAEDoPZg\n\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 26, 2025\n\nJosh Tymon’s volley, for Snoop’s Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Postage stamp.\n\nAnka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so…\n\nIn real life? Amad’s edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.\n\nOutrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) November 1, 2025\n\nWatching live on the telly? Declan Rice’s perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.\n\nMiller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I’m going to be like that. I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”\n\nIt’s hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.\n\nO’Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women’s football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.\n\n“I spent some time playing men’s football. But it really wasn’t my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I’ve never looked back. It’s changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence.\n\n“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don’t care about the news. It’s my escape, and the fact that it’s trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”\n\nFeringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.\n\nJames: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”\n\nSurely Salah’s post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don’t say things like that.\n\nAs for No 2, I’ll go for Amorim’s assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.\n\n“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”\n\nIf only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.\n\nAnka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.\n\n“People might think I’m an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”\n\nMiller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they’ve served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.\n\nO’Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It’s just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this’?\n\nFeringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.\n\nJames: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.\n\nAnka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners’ medal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton, Nottingham Forest, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, SSC Napoli, Premier League, Champions League, International Football, Serie A, Championship, Women's Soccer, FIFA Men's World Cup, League One, League Two, National League\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "When the 1930 tournament was staged in Uruguay, some nations could not afford the trip, players did not take it seriously and fights were common. What has changed since then.",
    "fullText": "Next summer’s World Cup will be the largest, most complex and most lucrative sporting event in history, with 48 teams playing 104 games in three countries. The tournament is expected to draw a global TV audience of nearly 5 billion and FIFA, the event’s organizer, is hoping for revenues of between $10 billion-$14 billion — which is why lower-bowl tickets for Iran-New Zealand at SoFi Stadium cost nearly $700.\n\nAll that seemed unlikely after the first tournament in 1930, when the idea of a soccer World Cup was nearly killed in the cradle, the victim from lack of planning, lack of money and lack of interest. That the competition survived, much less thrived, is nothing short of a miracle, says English writer and podcaster Jonathan Wilson, author of the deeply researched “The Power and Glory: The History of the World Cup.”\n\n“1930, it’s incredibly amateurish in many ways,” Wilson said. “It’s got that sort of almost like a school sports day feel to it.”\n\nOnly 13 countries took part in the first tournament; it was supposed to be 16 but the Egyptian team missed its boat to Uruguay while Japan and Siam (now Thailand) couldn’t afford the travel costs and pulled out. England, meanwhile, not only refused to play, but the British press ignored the event, as did much of Europe.\n\nThat seemed like a wise decision at the time since the first two matches of the inaugural tournament were affected by snow, with one of the opening games drawing just 4,444 fans. The smallest crowd in World Cup history, estimated at about 300, showed up for another first-round game between Romania and Peru and the TV audience … well, there was none since TV had yet to be invented.\n\nThe officiating was beyond suspect — Romania’s manager, Constantin Radulescu, also worked two games as a linesman — and the U.S. trainer, Jack Coll, had to be stretchered off the field during his team’s semifinal — yes, the U.S. made the semifinals! — with Argentina when he lost consciousness after inhaling the fumes from a bottle of chloroform that shattered in his pocket.\n\nIn another game, the penalty spots were mistakenly marked 16 yards from goal instead of the regulation 12 — and nobody noticed.\n\n“Some of the details don’t make sense,” Wilson said. “The whole thing is so sort of low grade compared to today.”\n\nWhen Argentine captain Nolo Ferreira left the tournament and returned home to take his law exams his replacement, Guillermo Stábile, scored a tournament-high eight goals in four games — then never played for the national team again (although he did coach it, leading the La Albiceleste to six South American titles and the 1958 World Cup).\n\nGiven the farcical nature of the 1930 World Cup, the tournament probably should have ended right there. Instead, 1930 has become the foundation on which next year’s competition was built.\n\nThe origins of the tournament, however, actually make sense. Before 1930, FIFA recognized the winner of the Olympic competition as the world champion. But that event was for amateurs, a point on which the International Olympic Committee would not budge.\n\nWith professional soccer growing in popularity, FIFA decided to stage its own breakaway event and play it in Uruguay, the country that had won the last two Olympic titles.\n\nThat quickly proved to be a big mistake. The growing effects of the Great Depression left many countries unable to afford the long, slow steamship trip to South America. The first tournament was open to any country that wanted to play, yet two months before the first game no European teams had agreed to come.\n\n“It was taken very seriously by Uruguay and Argentina,” Wilson said, but not by many others.\n\nThat changed shortly after Romania’s King Carol II, who ascended to the throne in a coup that deposed his son, personally selected his country’s World Cup roster and sent it on its way. France quickly agreed to go too, entering a makeshift team under pressure from FIFA president Jules Rimet, a Frenchman. Belgium also buckled under FIFA pressure and all three teams boarded the same ship for the trip to Uruguay, working out together on the 15-day voyage aboard the SS Conte Verde, an Italian ocean liner.\n\n“Even the four European nations who go it’s not entirely clear how seriously they took it,” Wilson said. “The French and Romanians, they kept diaries. They seem to have regarded this as a laugh. We’ll try to win but it doesn’t really matter.”\n\nThings didn’t really get loony until the tournament began. The Bolivian team, for example, played in berets, as did an Argentine midfielder, while the 15 referees who worked the games, some of whom had traveled and socialized with the players on the long boat ride from Europe, dressed formally in knickers, long-sleeve shirts, blazers and ties.\n\nThe well-dressed officials spent much of the tournament working with police to break up fights; play was so violent at least two players sustained broken legs and the U.S.-Argentina semifinal descended into a full-out brawl, with one American having four teeth knocked out and another hospitalized with injuries to his stomach.\n\nThe tournament finally finished with the hosts beating Argentina 4-2, after which the Argentines broke off diplomatic relations with their neighbor and an angry mob in Buenos Aires stoned the Uruguayan embassy.\n\n“It ended,” Wilson said of the tournament, “with everybody sort of fighting each other.”\n\nFew disagreed with the Argentine magazine El Gráfico, which seemed to predict there was little future for the fledgling event. “The World Cup is over,” it wrote. “The development of this competition brought not only an unpleasant atmosphere, but also an ungrateful one.”\n\nYet nearly a century later, the World Cup is still here. And that, too, was foretold in 1930 in the story of Romanian midfielder Alfred Eisenbeisser (who was also known as Fredi Fieraru because, why not?).\n\nOn the journey home from the first World Cup, Eisenbeisser contracted pneumonia and a priest was called to administer the last rites. The ship eventually docked in Genoa and he was taken to a sanatorium while the rest of the team continued on to Romania.\n\nAssuming her son had perished in Italy, Eisenbeisser’s mother arranged a wake — only to have her son stroll into the ceremony very much alive, causing the woman to faint. Eisenbeisser would play 12 more years of professional soccer and compete in figure skating in the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he finished 13th in the pairs competition.\n\nTurns out the reports of Eisenbeisser’s demise, like those of the World Cup, were greatly exaggerated.\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "fullText": "Nigeria are hoping to revive their chances of reaching next year's World Cup after submitting a complaint to Fifa which alleges that the Democratic Republic of Congo fielded ineligible players in last month's African play-off final.\n\nDR Congo beat the Super Eagles on penalties to book their place in March's intercontinental qualifier, which will allocate the final two places up for grabs for the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n\nBut Nigeria's claim of \"fraud\" centres on a group of players who recently switched their international allegiance to their opponents.\n\nThe Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) believes players such as Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Tuanzebe, both of whom featured in the game in Morocco, were ineligible because Congolese law does not allow dual citizenship.\n\nBut the Congolese Football Federation (Fecofa) has rejected the NFF's challenge.\n\n\"Our contention is that Fifa was deceived into clearing them,\" said NFF general secretary Mohammed Sanusi.\n\n\"The Congolese rule (law) says you cannot have dual nationality, but some of their players have European and French passports.\n\n\"There is what we consider to be a breach of (Fifa's) regulations. We are saying it was fraudulent.\"\n\nThe NFF says it has submitted supporting documents and legal arguments to world football's governing body.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Fifa for comment and is waiting to hear back.\n\nFecofa, however, has branded the petition as an attempt to \"win via the back door\".\n\n\"The World Cup must be played with dignity and confidence. Not with lawyers' tricks,\" said a post on the Leopards' official social media, external.\n\nThe message also described Nigeria as \"bad losers\" and dismissed the complaint as poor sportsmanship.",

    "description": "WORLD CUP 2026: Comment: Fifa’s extortionate prices have led to accusations of ‘betrayal’ and Miguel Delaney argues that The FA must flex its power now to save fans and potentially enhance England’s chances on the pitch",
    "fullText": "The Fifa leadership travel to Doha on Monday, for a series of meetings around “The Best” awards, where certain sources are anticipating at least some tension. And not over who wins.\n\nA number of national associations remain aggravated by the astronomical World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and want to directly raise it. The Football Association says it will relay fan concerns to Fifa, but the Football Supporters’ Association expects more. They expect the FA to actually push on this, and display proper support.\n\nIf it doesn’t, there will be uproar and potential escalation of the latest controversy surrounding Fifa and the World Cup.\n\nThe story should already be bringing much more scrutiny on the conduct of the FA – and other major federations – in football’s power structure.\n\nSources within such federations generally insist that they must maintain a diplomatic stance when dealing with the top brass of Fifa and Uefa, due to the risk of political ostracisation, given that both federations are top-down executive president models with little scope for dissent.\n\nSo, they generally say very little that is challenging, as they attempt to keep some influence.\n\nExcept, what is the point of any of that if you say nothing and have absolutely no influence when it matters most?\n\nThe FA’s first obligation, after all, is to the football public of England. To its constituents.\n\nYou may as well be politically ostracised if you can’t serve them in something like this.\n\nAnd what is going to happen anyway? It’s not like Fifa or Uefa are going to cut off Forward or HatTrick funding.\n\nBoth federations absolutely love Wembley, knowing how much more lucrative it is than any other European stadium. That means little to no risk of losing major fixtures.\n\nFA lobbyists may point to the bid for the Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035, but there’s no competition there.\n\nAnd, in any case, do they really have a mandate to secure a tournament at any cost – like that to their fans?\n\nThe refusal to publicly speak on this would be utterly spineless.\n\nSuch an approach is all the more surprising right now, given that there is constant tension between football’s various stakeholders – from the Premier League to European Football Clubs (the new name for the European Club Association) – and you need sharp elbows to secure your space in the calendar. You need a sense of fight.\n\nMany of those same stakeholders often declare themselves shocked at the meekness of the major federations, from the FA to the associations of France, Germany and Spain. There’s a feeling that they absolutely waste their potential power, and that they should be moral guardians of the game.\n\nInstead, various sources describe them as “the most complicit in the preservation of football’s system” due to the refusal to flex their greater muscle and, worse, “patsies”.\n\nFifa and Uefa have allowed the game to be taken over by greater power, with virtually no challenge. And this has far greater future risks.\n\nThe great frustration with this ticket crisis – even though you could have said this about any of Fifa’s controversies over the last few weeks – is that a potential outlet for dissent is so obvious and powerful.\n\nIf the 10-15 wealthiest federations coordinated action, or even put out a joint statement, it would “rattle” Fifa president Gianni Infantino on this, according to insiders. It would be dissent he is not used to.\n\nSo simple, so potentially effective in this controversy.\n\nIf Fifa still doesn’t budge on prices, and a position in this patronage system is apparently so valuable to the federations, there is another option.\n\nThe national associations can use the ample money they receive from Fifa and Uefa to subsidise the tickets of regular match-going fans.\n\nMany of the latter are already talking of having to make very hard decisions on whether to attend next summer’s tournament. It could be reasonably argued that full support is all the more valuable, given that this looks like England’s best chance of winning a World Cup in decades.\n\nBut, really, there is something deeper here.\n\nThere is a moral and political argument.\n\nThe member associations, most of all the FA, should do much more for their constituents. As was reported on these pages on Saturday, FA chair Debbie Hewitt is ideally placed as Fifa chair.\n\n“I’m not known for being a silent observer,” she said on taking that role.\n\nThere’s never been a more important moment to prove that.",

He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.\n\nNot that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.\n\nSpeak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.\n\nUnder Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.\n\nAs the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.\n\nLeft, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.\n\n\"He's a very smart player,\" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. \"He's really technical.\n\n\"Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.\"\n\nAmorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.\n\nNo-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.\n\nBut staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.\n\nTraining-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.\n\nHe is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.\n\nMount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.\n\nThese traits are all positives on a human scale.\n\nHowever, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.\n\nOutstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.\n\nGoals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.\n\nThe idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.\n\nMount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.\n\nDespite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.\n\nMount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.\n\nThe player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nMount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.\n\nHe clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.\n\nJust as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The cheapest ticket to attend the USA's opening 2026 World Cup match against Paraguay is $1,120 — a steep jump from initial estimates shared in 2018.",
    "fullText": "It's been over 30 years since Americans have had the chance to watch their national soccer team play on their home turf.\n\nThey'll get another chance next year, but it'll cost them.\n\nFans could pay over $2,700 for a ticket to watch the USA's first match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Paraguay, which is scheduled to take place in June at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nThat far exceeds the estimated ticket prices included in the original joint bid submitted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the World Cup.\n\nFIFA, which sets ticket prices, says it is using variable pricing to determine ticket costs, and \"may adjust ticket prices throughout the sales phases based on a review of demand and availability for each match.\"\n\nThe organization said it isn't using dynamic pricing — when ticket prices change in real time based on demand and other factors — for the 2026 World Cup. In addition to third-party sites like StubHub, which sell tickets, FIFA offers a resale and exchange marketplace for fans.\n\nFIFA launched its third phase of ticketing last week. Soon after the portal opened, fans took to social media, expressing shock over what they described as steep prices.\n\nWorld Cup tickets are divided into four categories, with Category 1 selling the most expensive tickets and Category 4 the cheapest options.\n\nAs of Saturday, there are no available Category 4 tickets for the USA's opening match against Paraguay on June 12. Instead, the cheapest ticket is selling for $1,120 under Category 3. The most expensive ticket costs $2,735, followed by $1,940.\n\nThe most expensive ticket for Mexico's opening match against South Africa costs $2,355, and Canada's opening match costs $2,170. Neither of those matches is offering Category 4 tickets.\n\nAs the tournament continues, ticket prices drop but are typically still far above original estimates.\n\nWhen the USA faces off against Australia on June 19, the most affordable ticket is $265, while the most expensive is selling for $700. When the USA plays on June 25, fans will have to pay between $910 and $340.\n\nThose prices are a far cry from what the United States, Canada, and Mexico estimated in their bid to host the tournament. The countries submitted a combined bid — dubbed the \"United bid\" — and were selected in 2018.\n\nIn their pitch, the countries estimated that a Category 1 ticket for an opening match would cost $774, followed by $614 for Category 2, $320 for Category 3, and $60 for Category 4.\n\nTickets for the final match were estimated to cost between $1,550 and $128. Under FIFA, the current final match prices — held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — start at $4,185. The most costly ticket is $8,680.\n\nDespite the hefty price, fans eager to snag tickets in this phase can purchase them now until January 13.\n\nThe 23rd edition of the tournament will take place this summer in 16 cities across North America. The first game kicks off on June 11, and teams will play until the final match on July 19.",
