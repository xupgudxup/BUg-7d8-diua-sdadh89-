    "description": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday with 'record high' prices for fans.",
    "fullText": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday.\n\nIt's the first opportunity for fans to secure tickets since the draw was made and the full match schedule announced last week.\n\nFifa's pricing model has been criticised, with Football Supporters Europe warning of \"record high prices\" and \"huge financial risks\" to follow their teams.\n\nFrom an earlier phase, the price of tickets ranged from £45 to £5,915.\n\nSo what do we know about the tournament's controversial ticketing operation - and how can you secure tickets?\n\nFrom 16:00 GMT on Thursday, fans can apply for tickets on Fifa's website for the matches of their choice.\n\nEach household can request up to four tickets per match and a maximum of 40 across the tournament.\n\nThe application window runs until 13 January 2026. There is no advantage to applying early - all fixtures remain available throughout the entire period.\n\nOnce the window closes, Fifa will run a lottery to decide which applications are successful.\n\nFans will be notified by email in February and, if they have been allocated tickets, will be charged automatically.\n\nDynamic pricing - or \"variable pricing\" as Fifa calls it - will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales.\n\nHowever, the governing body has confirmed that it will not apply during the main ballot. The price you see at the start of the window will be the same at the end.\n\nPrices will still be set based on expected demand for each fixture, with high-profile games likely to cost more.\n\nFor now, Fifa hasn't published any official price lists. It is expected people will know the price of tickets they ballot for on Thursday when it opens.\n\nAt present, the best guide we have comes from fans who tracked prices during the earlier sale phase.\n\nFifa has promoted Category 4 tickets as \"an accessible entry point to the tournament\".\n\nBut their stadium maps suggest the amount of Category 4 seating is extremely limited, and Football Supporters Europe said \"their very existence is still subject to caution\".\n\nIn most venues, the bulk of the seating appears to fall into the more expensive Category 1 and 2 sections.\n\nEach participating nation receives 8% of the tickets for its matches to distribute to its own supporters.\n\nFor England and Scotland, these will be made available to members of the England Supporters Travel Club and the Scotland Supporters Club. Both groups will receive an email with an access code for a Fifa portal, where they can apply from 15 December to 13 January.\n\nThese tickets are allocated via a ballot weighted towards members with the highest loyalty points.\n\nPrices are likely to be in line with the main ballot, but FA allocation tickets cannot be resold.\n\nAllocations for teams that progress through the play-offs are expected be released after those ties are completed in March.\n\nFifa has created its own official platform where fans can resell tickets bought through other phases of the ticketing process.\n\nSellers can list at whatever price they choose, and Fifa takes a 15% fee from both the seller and the buyer.\n\nFifa says these fees are \"aligned with North American industry trends across various sports\" and insists all revenue will be \"reinvested to fuel the growth of the game\".\n\nIt has also warned supporters against using unofficial resale sites, saying tickets bought elsewhere \"may be subject to cancellation without notice\".\n\nOn the unofficial secondary market, the cheapest tickets for England and Scotland's group games are already listed at more than £450.\n\nFans looking for guaranteed tickets - and not concerned about cost - can opt for official hospitality packages.\n\nThese typically cost thousands of pounds and include premium seating, lounge access and upmarket dining.\n\nThe most exclusive option is Platinum Access. Pricing for this tier is only available on request and details are sparse, although promotional material does feature an image of a private jet.\n\nCloser to the tournament, any remaining ticket inventory will be released on a first-come, first-served basis, operating much like a standard online ticket sale.\n\nThis phase is expected to utilise dynamic or variable pricing, though unlike other industries, Fifa will manually alter prices based on demand rather than using an algorithm.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa,\" said United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.\n\nIndeed, simply being a ticket holder does not guarantee entry to any of the host countries, Canada, Mexico or the US.\n\nFans planning to travel to the US should apply for either the Visa Waiver Programme (commonly known as an ESTA) or a Visitor Visa (B1/B2) depending on their nationality. UK citizens are normally eligible for an ESTA.\n\nCanada requires most visitors to obtain a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), while Mexico offers visa-free entry to many nationalities, including UK travellers.\n\nUS embassies are giving priority appointments to World Cup ticket holders but are still encouraging fans to apply as soon as possible.\n\nIt is unclear how ticket holders from countries whose citizens are mostly banned from travelling to the US will fare.\n\nSeveral members of the Iranian delegation were refused entry to the country for the World Cup draw last week.",

At the end of the day, sport is sport. It demands heart, sacrifice and teamwork.\"\n\nCamel racing is a traditional sport which is particularly popular in the Middle East.\n\nPogba set to make first appearance since doping ban\n\nWhy Monaco have gambled on 'wildcard' Pogba\n\n\"People might not realise it, but sport always connects in some way,\" added Frenchman Pogba.\n\n\"Whether it's football, camel racing, boxing - the foundations are similar. You need determination, you need focus, you need discipline and grit. That's what makes champions at the end of the day.\"\n\nPogba, who became the world's most expensive player when he joined Manchester United from Juventus in 2016 for £89m, added: \"Being the world's most expensive footballer was an honour, but it also came with a lot of hard work, pressure and responsibility.\n\n\"Owning the world's most expensive camel one day would be a beautiful full-circle moment - something fun, something meaningful and something that excites me. Maybe one day we make it happen.\"\n\nAl Haboob, founded by entrepreneurs Omar Almaeena and Safwan Modir, is the world's first modern camel racing team to compete internationally.\n\n\"Paul's involvement is transformational,\" said Almaeena.\n\n\"His influence, leadership, and passion for cultural storytelling reflect exactly what Al Haboob stands for. This partnership is about more than racing; it is about sharing a heritage that deserves global recognition.\"\n\nPogba made his long-awaited return to professional football on 22 November after coming on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 Ligue 1 defeat by Rennes.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner had not played since featuring for Juventus against Empoli in September 2023, following an original four-year doping ban, that was cut to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nPogba maintained it was a mistake and he was given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Italy’s failure to qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup inevitably sparked plenty of debate across this once-proud footballing nation.\n\nLosing home and away to Norway consigned Italy to the play-offs and left them facing the prospect of missing out on the tournament for the third consecutive time.\n\nHead coach Gennaro Gattuso inevitably resorted to deflection tactics towards the end of European qualifying, bemoaning the revised system that seemingly favors other continents.\n\n“In my day, the best group runners-up went straight to the World Cup, now the rules have changed,” Gattuso said.\n\n“Italy’s record of six wins? You’d have to ask the people who make the groups and the rules. In 1990 and 1994, there were two African teams, now there are nine. It’s not a controversy, but there are difficulties, and we know it well.\n\n“If we look at South America, where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh heads into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets and a certain sadness. That is the disappointment. The system needs to change in Europe.”\n\nPutting aside the fact there are some factual inaccuracies in Gattuso’s comments, the 2020 European champions have only themselves to blame for their current situation.\n\nItaly were the top seeds in a relatively easy group, yet failed to get the job done. However, you flower it up, losing to Norway by a combined 7-1 scoreline is unacceptable.\n\nThe decision to appoint Gattuso to replace Luciano Spalletti looked questionable when it was announced, and subsequent events have done little to dispel that notion.\n\nGattuso was a fine player – a combative midfielder who helped AC Milan win the Champions League twice and Italy lift their last World Cup trophy in 2006.\n\nHowever, his managerial record at club level was hugely underwhelming and Italy’s decision to place him in charge may yet have a catastrophic ending.\n\n“When I heard Gattuso was online it just seemed to demonstrate the giant collapse of Italy,” Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told the Euro Leagues podcast.\n\n“There were so many clips going around on social media about that Italy team just before they won the World Cup and you are talking about Paolo Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, [Alessandro] Nesta, [Francesco] Totti, [Alessandro] Del Piero and it was just an embarrassment of riches.\n\n“Now when you look at Italy over the last few seasons, even though they won the Euros, there was just a fall – but the one thing you could rely on was that Italy created these great coaches. Yet none of these great coaches were called up or have succeeded.”\n\nPlay-off draw offers Italy hope\n\nItaly’s hopes of progressing to the World Cup were boosted after they were handed a relatively favorable draw in the play-offs.\n\nThey will host Northern Ireland in the semi-final, with the winners of that game visiting either Wales or Bosnia & Herzegovina in the final.\n\nThe last four tie against Northern Ireland should hold little fear for Italy. They suffered defeats at Germany and Slovakia in the group stage and generally don’t travel too well.\n\nHaving won seven and drawn three of their previous 11 meetings, Italy have little to fear from a team ranked 69th in the latest FIFA rankings.\n\nOn paper, Wales are the biggest threat to Italy. They are ranked 32nd in the world and are generally tough to beat on their own patch.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that they have never defeated Bosnia & Herzegovina in four previous attempts. The visitors will fancy their chances of enhancing that record.\n\nUltimately, given that Italy are currently ranked 12th in the world, they should be able to successfully navigate through the play-offs.\n\nThey have lost just twice to Wales in ten previous meetings and once to Bosnia & Herzegovina in six matches. If Italy fail to progress, they have no excuses.\n\nWhile suggesting that Italy could mount a challenge for the World Cup next summer is a little fanciful, stranger things have happened in football.\n\nThey demonstrated their credentials by winning the 2020 European Championship title and can draw inspiration from what they achieved on that occasion.\n\nAside from Spain and France, none of the other so-called main contenders for the World Cup are significantly better than Italy.\n\nIf they safely navigate the play-offs and land a favorable draw next summer, Italy are perfectly capable of making a deep run in the tournament.",

    "fullText": "Enzo Maresca is still dividing opinion at Chelsea. Despite a Club World Cup win and a top 4 finish last year, as well as an overall bright start to this campaign, there are a lot of doubters about the Italian coach.\n\nChelsea icon Gianfranco Zola speaking on the pitch at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOne person who isn’t in any doubt about him is club legend Gianfranco Zola. He claims he saw the coach’s talent before he had even come to Stamford Bridge.\n\n“I didn’t know him personally before he came to Chelsea, but I had followed what he did at Leicester and could see that we were dealing with a serious coach,” Zola said.\n\n“He’s worked with and for [Arrigo] Sacchi, Manuel Pellegrini, [Pep] Guardiola. He’s had an excellent grounding.”\n\nThere are a lot of positives about Maresca which nobody can dispute – he seems to have a lot of respect from the players and as Zola says, he’s got a great background in terms of people he’s worked under.\n\nHowever many Blues fans still aren’t delighted with the football he has his teams playing, and there are other gripes about his rotation policy and team selection in general. There’s also a sense he doesn’t get the best out of our star player, Cole Palmer.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see how feelings change through the course of the coach’s second year in charge.\n\nChelsea’s social media silence over one player this week was very notable – it doesn’t look like things are getting sorted out in this case anytime soon.\n\nChelsea managed to get a player into the Premier League team of the week in the week just gone – but it’s not the sort of player you want to see in there.

    "fullText": "Neymar is set to have knee surgery after playing in pain to help boyhood club Santos avoid relegation from Brazil's Serie A.\n\nThe 33-year-old played the full 90 minutes as Santos claimed a 3-0 win over Cruzeiro on Sunday to avoid an immediate return to the second tier after promotion last season.\n\nHe did not give any any details on his expected recovery, adding: \"I need to rest and then I will have this knee surgery.\"\n\nNeymar returned to Brazil in January after making just seven appearances over 18 months for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal.\n\nHe has played a crucial role in Santos' survival by scoring five goals in their last four matches of the season.\n\n\"I came for this, to try to help in the best way I can,\" said Neymar. \"These have been tough weeks for me.\n\n\"I thank those who were with me to lift me up. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have played these matches because of this knee problem.\"\n\nInjuries have limited Brazil's all-time top scorer, who has netted 79 goals in 128 appearances, from featuring for the national side since a defeat by Uruguay in October 2023.\n\nIn October this year, Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward must regain full fitness and be in form to be recalled to his squad for next summer's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States.",

    "fullText": "Wales head coach Craig Bellamy is looking forward to renewing his rivalry with Canada counterpart Jesse Marsch if he can lead his team to the World Cup.\n\nIf Wales win their play-off semi-final and final in March, they will be in Group B alongside co-hosts Canada, as well as Switzerland and Qatar at next summer's tournament in North America.\n\nThe opening fixture between Canada and Wales in Toronto will be a grudge match of sorts, after an ill-tempered finish to their friendly in September.\n\nBellamy was unhappy with the way former Leeds United boss Marsch and his coaches celebrated their 1-0 win before the final whistle in Swansea, while the Canadian players and their manager were exuberant in their celebrations afterwards.\n\nBellamy said after the game, \"I hope I see you [Marsch and Canada] at the World Cup\" and, following Friday's extravagant, long-winded draw in Washington DC, he could have his wish next June.\n\n\"I watched a little bit of the World Cup draw but not much. I think I got lost after the first 20 minutes and I think I came back to it about five hours later,\" the former Liverpool and Manchester City forward joked.\n\n\"I always have that on my mind. Just get there first. We've got to get there first but, if that is the case, then we [Marsch and Bellamy] will definitely have a nice conversation before that as well.\n\n\"I've got nothing against that guy, by the way, I think he's got something against the world. There's a part of me that really likes him from afar without really knowing him.\n\n\"But some of the things he says, you see his interviews before the other games after playing us... I think I find him very interesting.\"",

It will be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves,\" said chief tournament officer Manolo Zubiria.\n\n\"Obviously, if there's an injury [stoppage] at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee.\"",
