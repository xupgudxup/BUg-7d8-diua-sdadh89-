We are saying it was fraudulent.\"\n\nThe NFF says it has submitted supporting documents and legal arguments to world football's governing body.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Fifa for comment and is waiting to hear back.\n\nFecofa, however, has branded the petition as an attempt to \"win via the back door\".\n\n\"The World Cup must be played with dignity and confidence. Not with lawyers' tricks,\" said a post on the Leopards' official social media, external.\n\nThe message also described Nigeria as \"bad losers\" and dismissed the complaint as poor sportsmanship.",

    "fullText": "Fifa has announced record prize money for next summer’s World Cup amid the escalating row over ticket prices for the tournament.\n\nWhile the World Cup champions will win $50m (£37.5m), an increase on the £34.6m won by Argentina when they defeated France in Qatar in 2022, Fifa confirmed that a total of $727m (£545m) would be paid out to teams as the number of participating countries rises from 32 to 48.\n\nIt represents a 50 per cent increase on the total prize fund paid out to teams at the last World Cup in Qatar, and comes as tickets for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico are up to five times more expensive for fans than they were in 2022.\n\nAmid a fierce backlash, Fifa subsequently announced a new category of $60 (£45) tickets that will be available for every game, but with those tickets available for just 10 per cent of the eight per cent allocation for Participating Member Associations, only a lucky few will benefit while the remainder of supporters will have to pay up to £5,000 if they follow their country through to the final.\n\nA statement from Football Supporters Europe said: “Following significant pressure from supporters, Fifa has partially relented on its ticket price structuring.\n\n“This shows that Fifa’s ticketing policy is not set in stone, was decided in a rush, and without proper consultation – including with Fifa’s own member associations.\n\n“While we welcome Fifa’s seeming recognition of the damage its original plans were to cause, the revisions do not go far enough to reconcile.\n\n“Based on the allocations publicly available, this would mean that at best a few hundred fans per match and team would be lucky enough to take advantage of the $60 prices, while the vast majority would still have to pay extortionate prices, way higher than at any tournament before.”\n\nAs well as the record prize money for the World Cup, Fifa said that all participating nations will receive $1.5m each to cover preparation costs.\n\nWorld Cup 2026 prize money (per team)",

    "description": "WORLD CUP 2026: Comment: Fifa’s extortionate prices have led to accusations of ‘betrayal’ and Miguel Delaney argues that The FA must flex its power now to save fans and potentially enhance England’s chances on the pitch",
    "fullText": "The Fifa leadership travel to Doha on Monday, for a series of meetings around “The Best” awards, where certain sources are anticipating at least some tension. And not over who wins.\n\nA number of national associations remain aggravated by the astronomical World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and want to directly raise it. The Football Association says it will relay fan concerns to Fifa, but the Football Supporters’ Association expects more. They expect the FA to actually push on this, and display proper support.\n\nIf it doesn’t, there will be uproar and potential escalation of the latest controversy surrounding Fifa and the World Cup.\n\nThe story should already be bringing much more scrutiny on the conduct of the FA – and other major federations – in football’s power structure.\n\nSources within such federations generally insist that they must maintain a diplomatic stance when dealing with the top brass of Fifa and Uefa, due to the risk of political ostracisation, given that both federations are top-down executive president models with little scope for dissent.\n\nSo, they generally say very little that is challenging, as they attempt to keep some influence.\n\nExcept, what is the point of any of that if you say nothing and have absolutely no influence when it matters most?\n\nThe FA’s first obligation, after all, is to the football public of England. To its constituents.\n\nYou may as well be politically ostracised if you can’t serve them in something like this.\n\nAnd what is going to happen anyway? It’s not like Fifa or Uefa are going to cut off Forward or HatTrick funding.\n\nBoth federations absolutely love Wembley, knowing how much more lucrative it is than any other European stadium. That means little to no risk of losing major fixtures.\n\nFA lobbyists may point to the bid for the Fifa Women’s World Cup 2035, but there’s no competition there.\n\nAnd, in any case, do they really have a mandate to secure a tournament at any cost – like that to their fans?\n\nThe refusal to publicly speak on this would be utterly spineless.\n\nSuch an approach is all the more surprising right now, given that there is constant tension between football’s various stakeholders – from the Premier League to European Football Clubs (the new name for the European Club Association) – and you need sharp elbows to secure your space in the calendar. You need a sense of fight.\n\nMany of those same stakeholders often declare themselves shocked at the meekness of the major federations, from the FA to the associations of France, Germany and Spain. There’s a feeling that they absolutely waste their potential power, and that they should be moral guardians of the game.\n\nInstead, various sources describe them as “the most complicit in the preservation of football’s system” due to the refusal to flex their greater muscle and, worse, “patsies”.\n\nFifa and Uefa have allowed the game to be taken over by greater power, with virtually no challenge. And this has far greater future risks.\n\nThe great frustration with this ticket crisis – even though you could have said this about any of Fifa’s controversies over the last few weeks – is that a potential outlet for dissent is so obvious and powerful.\n\nIf the 10-15 wealthiest federations coordinated action, or even put out a joint statement, it would “rattle” Fifa president Gianni Infantino on this, according to insiders. It would be dissent he is not used to.\n\nSo simple, so potentially effective in this controversy.\n\nIf Fifa still doesn’t budge on prices, and a position in this patronage system is apparently so valuable to the federations, there is another option.\n\nThe national associations can use the ample money they receive from Fifa and Uefa to subsidise the tickets of regular match-going fans.\n\nMany of the latter are already talking of having to make very hard decisions on whether to attend next summer’s tournament. It could be reasonably argued that full support is all the more valuable, given that this looks like England’s best chance of winning a World Cup in decades.\n\nBut, really, there is something deeper here.\n\nThere is a moral and political argument.\n\nThe member associations, most of all the FA, should do much more for their constituents. As was reported on these pages on Saturday, FA chair Debbie Hewitt is ideally placed as Fifa chair.\n\n“I’m not known for being a silent observer,” she said on taking that role.\n\nThere’s never been a more important moment to prove that.",

He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.\n\nNot that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.\n\nSpeak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.\n\nUnder Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.\n\nAs the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.\n\nLeft, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.\n\n\"He's a very smart player,\" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. \"He's really technical.\n\n\"Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.\"\n\nAmorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.\n\nNo-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.\n\nBut staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.\n\nTraining-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.\n\nHe is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.\n\nMount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.\n\nThese traits are all positives on a human scale.\n\nHowever, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.\n\nOutstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.\n\nGoals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.\n\nThe idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.\n\nMount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.\n\nDespite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.\n\nMount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.\n\nThe player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nMount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.\n\nHe clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.\n\nJust as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The cheapest ticket to attend the USA's opening 2026 World Cup match against Paraguay is $1,120 — a steep jump from initial estimates shared in 2018.",
    "fullText": "It's been over 30 years since Americans have had the chance to watch their national soccer team play on their home turf.\n\nThey'll get another chance next year, but it'll cost them.\n\nFans could pay over $2,700 for a ticket to watch the USA's first match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Paraguay, which is scheduled to take place in June at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nThat far exceeds the estimated ticket prices included in the original joint bid submitted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the World Cup.\n\nFIFA, which sets ticket prices, says it is using variable pricing to determine ticket costs, and \"may adjust ticket prices throughout the sales phases based on a review of demand and availability for each match.\"\n\nThe organization said it isn't using dynamic pricing — when ticket prices change in real time based on demand and other factors — for the 2026 World Cup. In addition to third-party sites like StubHub, which sell tickets, FIFA offers a resale and exchange marketplace for fans.\n\nFIFA launched its third phase of ticketing last week. Soon after the portal opened, fans took to social media, expressing shock over what they described as steep prices.\n\nWorld Cup tickets are divided into four categories, with Category 1 selling the most expensive tickets and Category 4 the cheapest options.\n\nAs of Saturday, there are no available Category 4 tickets for the USA's opening match against Paraguay on June 12. Instead, the cheapest ticket is selling for $1,120 under Category 3. The most expensive ticket costs $2,735, followed by $1,940.\n\nThe most expensive ticket for Mexico's opening match against South Africa costs $2,355, and Canada's opening match costs $2,170. Neither of those matches is offering Category 4 tickets.\n\nAs the tournament continues, ticket prices drop but are typically still far above original estimates.\n\nWhen the USA faces off against Australia on June 19, the most affordable ticket is $265, while the most expensive is selling for $700. When the USA plays on June 25, fans will have to pay between $910 and $340.\n\nThose prices are a far cry from what the United States, Canada, and Mexico estimated in their bid to host the tournament. The countries submitted a combined bid — dubbed the \"United bid\" — and were selected in 2018.\n\nIn their pitch, the countries estimated that a Category 1 ticket for an opening match would cost $774, followed by $614 for Category 2, $320 for Category 3, and $60 for Category 4.\n\nTickets for the final match were estimated to cost between $1,550 and $128. Under FIFA, the current final match prices — held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — start at $4,185. The most costly ticket is $8,680.\n\nDespite the hefty price, fans eager to snag tickets in this phase can purchase them now until January 13.\n\nThe 23rd edition of the tournament will take place this summer in 16 cities across North America. The first game kicks off on June 11, and teams will play until the final match on July 19.",

    "fullText": "On a weekend when Phil Foden and Cole Palmer helped Manchester City and Chelsea to vital Premier League victories, Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers showed just why he retains a firm grip on the number 10 position in Thomas Tuchel's England set-up.\n\nVilla's eight-match winning run in all competitions appeared under serious threat at the midway point of Sunday's game at third-bottom West Ham, who led 2-1 at the break against a side who appeared jaded and short of inspiration after Thursday's Europa League victory at Basel.\n\nIn the second half, however, Rogers decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored his first of the afternoon five minutes into the second half, making it 2-2 from close range after West Ham had failed to clear Youri Tielemans' low cross into the box.\n\nThen, with the final 10 minutes approaching, Rogers collected a loose ball 30 yards from goal and was given time and space to slam a powerful, swerving strike into the top right corner of Alphonse Areola's goal and clinch a ninth straight victory for Unai Emery's third-placed team.\n\nThat magnificent effort capped a fine all-round performance from Rogers and reaffirmed his status as England's first-choice number 10 at next summer's World Cup - despite world-class competition from Foden, Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.\n\n\"He scored two fantastic goals and, for me, he is not just going to be in the squad next summer,\" said former England forward and Match of the Day pundit Theo Walcott. \"He is a dead cert to be a starter for England at the World Cup - 100%.\n\n\"He does everything, he's not just a goal threat. I like all [the contenders for the number 10 position], but one of them is going to have to miss out on the squad itself - and Rogers, for me, has to start.\"",

    "title": "FA set to take action as fans lash out at Fifa’s ‘scandalous’ World Cup ticket prices",
    "description": "The eye-watering prices for World Cup tickets were revealed on Thursday",
    "fullText": "Football fans have voiced outrage over \"scandalous\" World Cup ticket prices, prompting the Football Association (FA) to raise concerns with Fifa, though there is little optimism within English football's governing body for a reversal.\n\nThe pricing structure for members of national team travel clubs and loyalty schemes, unveiled on Thursday, includes eye-watering figures, with the cheapest ticket for the 19 July final exceeding £3,000.\n\nThe Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) has urged the FA to challenge World Cup organiser Fifa on these costs, which the FSA branded \"scandalous\" and a \"laughable insult\" to the average fan.\n\nIt is understood that the FA will formally convey fans’ discontent to Fifa through appropriate channels. However, sources close to the governing body are not hopeful that this will lead to any changes.\n\nThe FA is deeply sympathetic to England supporters, who also face significant travel and accommodation expenses. The association had no input in setting the prices and reportedly only learned of the detailed pricing plan on Thursday.\n\nIn contrast, FA bosses Mark Bullingham and Debbie Hewitt have already pledged that affordable tickets will be available for Euro 2028 – which England will co-host with the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales – and that dynamic pricing, seen in earlier rounds of World Cup ticket sales, will not be implemented.\n\nDespite this, the FA has no influence over World Cup 2026 ticket prices, and there is a prevailing sense of realism that while concerns can be voiced, Fifa is unlikely to alter its course.\n\nShould England reach the final in July, fans wishing to purchase tickets through the FA’s allocation would need to spend more than £5,000 on tickets alone to attend all matches, even for the lowest-priced category.\n\nA statement from the FSA, published on Friday morning, declared: \"We back Football Supporters Europe in calling for a halt in ticket sales and we are calling on the Football Association to work with fellow FAs to directly challenge these disgraceful prices.\"\n\nThe FSA described the prices proposed to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) as \"scandalous\" and \"a step too far for many supporters who passionately and loyally follow their national sides at home and abroad\".\n\nThe statement further criticised Fifa’s approach: \"Everything we feared about the direction in which FIFA wants to take the game was confirmed – Gianni Infantino only sees supporter loyalty as something to be exploited for profit.\n\n“This is a tournament that is supposed to be celebrated by the world, where fans of all nations come together for the love of football. Fifa have decided to make it all about the money and the elite who can afford it.\n\n“For Fifa, loyalty is not the hard-working fan travelling thousands of miles in support of their team at qualifiers around the continent. A game that should be for all is now only for those who can afford it.\"\n\nFootball Supporters Europe (FSE) estimates that fans will pay five times more to follow their team from the first game to the final at the 2026 World Cup compared to the last tournament in Qatar in 2022.\n\nTickets for the final in the participant member association (PMA) allocations begin at 4,185 US dollars (£3,130). Following England from first game to last buying the cheapest tickets would cost 7,020 US dollars (£5,250), before factoring in travel and accommodation.\n\nThe FSA also highlighted that ESTC members are being asked to pay for tickets through to the final, rather than just for the group games England are guaranteed to play.\n\n\"If England are knocked out before the final they’ll then return (the money), minus an admin fee of course. They are beyond shameless,\" the statement added.\n\nScotland fans, who have qualified for their first finals since 1998, face similarly high prices. The Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA) has called on national associations to \"hold FIFA to account\" over the ticket costs.\n\nJohn MacLean, CEO of the SFSA, noted that Scottish Football Association president Mike Mulraney – recently appointed chair of FIFA’s finance committee – is ideally positioned \"to express the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar\".\n\nBoth the FA and Fifa have been contacted for comment.",

Last month she said that she was opposed to dynamic ticket pricing, and has vowed that it will not be used at Euro 2028, which the UK and Ireland is hosting.\n\nDespite mounting pressure, Fifa has also not yet made any public comment on its ticket price policies.\n\nThat may change if a number of national football associations jointly raise concerns, but with the Home Nations FAs hoping to host the 2035 Women's World Cup, they (and the UK government) may also be wary of upsetting Fifa.\n\nBBC Sport has been told that Fifa is waiting to see how many people have entered the ballot, but that it is expecting strong demand.\n\nPrivately, Fifa insiders say that while tickets will seem expensive to many, the governing body has a duty to set prices with the US market in mind, grow the game around the world, and to use its revenues to develop men's, women's and youth football.\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino has also promised to achieve record revenues, and the most lucrative sports event in history will do no harm to his re-election hopes in 2027.\n\nThe huge increase in the price of tickets was revealed on Thursday when Fifa released allocation details for the official supporters' groups of each country.\n\nAt the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, group stage fixtures all had set prices of £68.50, £164.50 or £219.\n\nBut for England v Croatia and Scotland v Brazil next year, tickets cost around £198, £373 or £523.\n\nThe cost ramps up considerably in the latter stages.\n\nQuarter-finals for all teams are £507, £757 and £1,073, with the semi-finals £686, £1,819 and £2,363.\n\nThe cheapest tickets for the final are £3,119, seven times more expensive than in Qatar.\n\nThere are no concessions across any of its tickets for children or other groups.",

    "fullText": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday.\n\nIt's the first opportunity for fans to secure tickets since the draw was made and the full match schedule announced last week.\n\nFifa's pricing model has been criticised, with Football Supporters Europe warning of \"record high prices\" and \"huge financial risks\" to follow their teams.\n\nFrom an earlier phase, the price of tickets ranged from £45 to £5,915.\n\nSo what do we know about the tournament's controversial ticketing operation - and how can you secure tickets?\n\nFrom 16:00 GMT on Thursday, fans can apply for tickets on Fifa's website for the matches of their choice.\n\nEach household can request up to four tickets per match and a maximum of 40 across the tournament.\n\nThe application window runs until 13 January 2026. There is no advantage to applying early - all fixtures remain available throughout the entire period.\n\nOnce the window closes, Fifa will run a lottery to decide which applications are successful.\n\nFans will be notified by email in February and, if they have been allocated tickets, will be charged automatically.\n\nDynamic pricing - or \"variable pricing\" as Fifa calls it - will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales.\n\nHowever, the governing body has confirmed that it will not apply during the main ballot. The price you see at the start of the window will be the same at the end.\n\nPrices will still be set based on expected demand for each fixture, with high-profile games likely to cost more.\n\nFor now, Fifa hasn't published any official price lists. It is expected people will know the price of tickets they ballot for on Thursday when it opens.\n\nAt present, the best guide we have comes from fans who tracked prices during the earlier sale phase.\n\nFifa has promoted Category 4 tickets as \"an accessible entry point to the tournament\".\n\nBut their stadium maps suggest the amount of Category 4 seating is extremely limited, and Football Supporters Europe said \"their very existence is still subject to caution\".\n\nIn most venues, the bulk of the seating appears to fall into the more expensive Category 1 and 2 sections.\n\nEach participating nation receives 8% of the tickets for its matches to distribute to its own supporters.\n\nFor England and Scotland, these will be made available to members of the England Supporters Travel Club and the Scotland Supporters Club. Both groups will receive an email with an access code for a Fifa portal, where they can apply from 15 December to 13 January.\n\nThese tickets are allocated via a ballot weighted towards members with the highest loyalty points.\n\nPrices are likely to be in line with the main ballot, but FA allocation tickets cannot be resold.\n\nAllocations for teams that progress through the play-offs are expected be released after those ties are completed in March.\n\nFifa has created its own official platform where fans can resell tickets bought through other phases of the ticketing process.\n\nSellers can list at whatever price they choose, and Fifa takes a 15% fee from both the seller and the buyer.\n\nFifa says these fees are \"aligned with North American industry trends across various sports\" and insists all revenue will be \"reinvested to fuel the growth of the game\".\n\nIt has also warned supporters against using unofficial resale sites, saying tickets bought elsewhere \"may be subject to cancellation without notice\".\n\nOn the unofficial secondary market, the cheapest tickets for England and Scotland's group games are already listed at more than £450.\n\nFans looking for guaranteed tickets - and not concerned about cost - can opt for official hospitality packages.\n\nThese typically cost thousands of pounds and include premium seating, lounge access and upmarket dining.\n\nThe most exclusive option is Platinum Access. Pricing for this tier is only available on request and details are sparse, although promotional material does feature an image of a private jet.\n\nCloser to the tournament, any remaining ticket inventory will be released on a first-come, first-served basis, operating much like a standard online ticket sale.\n\nThis phase is expected to utilise dynamic or variable pricing, though unlike other industries, Fifa will manually alter prices based on demand rather than using an algorithm.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa,\" said United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.\n\nIndeed, simply being a ticket holder does not guarantee entry to any of the host countries, Canada, Mexico or the US.\n\nFans planning to travel to the US should apply for either the Visa Waiver Programme (commonly known as an ESTA) or a Visitor Visa (B1/B2) depending on their nationality. UK citizens are normally eligible for an ESTA.\n\nCanada requires most visitors to obtain a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), while Mexico offers visa-free entry to many nationalities, including UK travellers.\n\nUS embassies are giving priority appointments to World Cup ticket holders but are still encouraging fans to apply as soon as possible.\n\nIt is unclear how ticket holders from countries whose citizens are mostly banned from travelling to the US will fare.\n\nSeveral members of the Iranian delegation were refused entry to the country for the World Cup draw last week.",

At the end of the day, sport is sport. It demands heart, sacrifice and teamwork.\"\n\nCamel racing is a traditional sport which is particularly popular in the Middle East.\n\nPogba set to make first appearance since doping ban\n\nWhy Monaco have gambled on 'wildcard' Pogba\n\n\"People might not realise it, but sport always connects in some way,\" added Frenchman Pogba.\n\n\"Whether it's football, camel racing, boxing - the foundations are similar. You need determination, you need focus, you need discipline and grit. That's what makes champions at the end of the day.\"\n\nPogba, who became the world's most expensive player when he joined Manchester United from Juventus in 2016 for £89m, added: \"Being the world's most expensive footballer was an honour, but it also came with a lot of hard work, pressure and responsibility.\n\n\"Owning the world's most expensive camel one day would be a beautiful full-circle moment - something fun, something meaningful and something that excites me. Maybe one day we make it happen.\"\n\nAl Haboob, founded by entrepreneurs Omar Almaeena and Safwan Modir, is the world's first modern camel racing team to compete internationally.\n\n\"Paul's involvement is transformational,\" said Almaeena.\n\n\"His influence, leadership, and passion for cultural storytelling reflect exactly what Al Haboob stands for. This partnership is about more than racing; it is about sharing a heritage that deserves global recognition.\"\n\nPogba made his long-awaited return to professional football on 22 November after coming on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 Ligue 1 defeat by Rennes.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner had not played since featuring for Juventus against Empoli in September 2023, following an original four-year doping ban, that was cut to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nPogba maintained it was a mistake and he was given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Italy’s failure to qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup inevitably sparked plenty of debate across this once-proud footballing nation.\n\nLosing home and away to Norway consigned Italy to the play-offs and left them facing the prospect of missing out on the tournament for the third consecutive time.\n\nHead coach Gennaro Gattuso inevitably resorted to deflection tactics towards the end of European qualifying, bemoaning the revised system that seemingly favors other continents.\n\n“In my day, the best group runners-up went straight to the World Cup, now the rules have changed,” Gattuso said.\n\n“Italy’s record of six wins? You’d have to ask the people who make the groups and the rules. In 1990 and 1994, there were two African teams, now there are nine. It’s not a controversy, but there are difficulties, and we know it well.\n\n“If we look at South America, where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh heads into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets and a certain sadness. That is the disappointment. The system needs to change in Europe.”\n\nPutting aside the fact there are some factual inaccuracies in Gattuso’s comments, the 2020 European champions have only themselves to blame for their current situation.\n\nItaly were the top seeds in a relatively easy group, yet failed to get the job done. However, you flower it up, losing to Norway by a combined 7-1 scoreline is unacceptable.\n\nThe decision to appoint Gattuso to replace Luciano Spalletti looked questionable when it was announced, and subsequent events have done little to dispel that notion.\n\nGattuso was a fine player – a combative midfielder who helped AC Milan win the Champions League twice and Italy lift their last World Cup trophy in 2006.\n\nHowever, his managerial record at club level was hugely underwhelming and Italy’s decision to place him in charge may yet have a catastrophic ending.\n\n“When I heard Gattuso was online it just seemed to demonstrate the giant collapse of Italy,” Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told the Euro Leagues podcast.\n\n“There were so many clips going around on social media about that Italy team just before they won the World Cup and you are talking about Paolo Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, [Alessandro] Nesta, [Francesco] Totti, [Alessandro] Del Piero and it was just an embarrassment of riches.\n\n“Now when you look at Italy over the last few seasons, even though they won the Euros, there was just a fall – but the one thing you could rely on was that Italy created these great coaches. Yet none of these great coaches were called up or have succeeded.”\n\nPlay-off draw offers Italy hope\n\nItaly’s hopes of progressing to the World Cup were boosted after they were handed a relatively favorable draw in the play-offs.\n\nThey will host Northern Ireland in the semi-final, with the winners of that game visiting either Wales or Bosnia & Herzegovina in the final.\n\nThe last four tie against Northern Ireland should hold little fear for Italy. They suffered defeats at Germany and Slovakia in the group stage and generally don’t travel too well.\n\nHaving won seven and drawn three of their previous 11 meetings, Italy have little to fear from a team ranked 69th in the latest FIFA rankings.\n\nOn paper, Wales are the biggest threat to Italy. They are ranked 32nd in the world and are generally tough to beat on their own patch.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that they have never defeated Bosnia & Herzegovina in four previous attempts. The visitors will fancy their chances of enhancing that record.\n\nUltimately, given that Italy are currently ranked 12th in the world, they should be able to successfully navigate through the play-offs.\n\nThey have lost just twice to Wales in ten previous meetings and once to Bosnia & Herzegovina in six matches. If Italy fail to progress, they have no excuses.\n\nWhile suggesting that Italy could mount a challenge for the World Cup next summer is a little fanciful, stranger things have happened in football.\n\nThey demonstrated their credentials by winning the 2020 European Championship title and can draw inspiration from what they achieved on that occasion.\n\nAside from Spain and France, none of the other so-called main contenders for the World Cup are significantly better than Italy.\n\nIf they safely navigate the play-offs and land a favorable draw next summer, Italy are perfectly capable of making a deep run in the tournament.",

    "fullText": "Enzo Maresca is still dividing opinion at Chelsea. Despite a Club World Cup win and a top 4 finish last year, as well as an overall bright start to this campaign, there are a lot of doubters about the Italian coach.\n\nChelsea icon Gianfranco Zola speaking on the pitch at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOne person who isn’t in any doubt about him is club legend Gianfranco Zola. He claims he saw the coach’s talent before he had even come to Stamford Bridge.\n\n“I didn’t know him personally before he came to Chelsea, but I had followed what he did at Leicester and could see that we were dealing with a serious coach,” Zola said.\n\n“He’s worked with and for [Arrigo] Sacchi, Manuel Pellegrini, [Pep] Guardiola. He’s had an excellent grounding.”\n\nThere are a lot of positives about Maresca which nobody can dispute – he seems to have a lot of respect from the players and as Zola says, he’s got a great background in terms of people he’s worked under.\n\nHowever many Blues fans still aren’t delighted with the football he has his teams playing, and there are other gripes about his rotation policy and team selection in general. There’s also a sense he doesn’t get the best out of our star player, Cole Palmer.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see how feelings change through the course of the coach’s second year in charge.\n\nChelsea’s social media silence over one player this week was very notable – it doesn’t look like things are getting sorted out in this case anytime soon.\n\nChelsea managed to get a player into the Premier League team of the week in the week just gone – but it’s not the sort of player you want to see in there.

It's not only about sport - it's about everything that surrounds sport: the values, the excitement, the community.\n\n\"I'm very motivated, very excited, and eager to share this new chapter.\"\n\nIniesta, who scored the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup and won two European Championships, before retiring last year, formed Never Say Never - a sports and entertainment management company - with businessman Joel Borras in 2018.\n\nThe cycling team is the latest addition to the stable after funding from Stoneweg - a Swiss investment firm.\n\nAs a statement of intent, NSN last week signed one of the hottest talents on road cycling's UCI World Tour in Eritrea's Biniam Girmay, who won the Tour de France's prestigious green jersey in 2024.\n\n\"I'm excited to dive deeper into cycling, learn more, and appreciate the huge amount of work behind every rider,\" added Iniesta.\n\n\"The goal for the team is simple: keep growing, enjoy the journey, and show what a united team can achieve – because, in the end, only one rider wins, but the collective effort is what will define us.\"\n\nNSN are expected to contest cycling's biggest races - including the Tour de France - next year after acquiring a World Tour licence as part of the deal to take over Israel Premier Tech, who were set to return to the World Tour next season.\n\nThe team also has five British riders on its roster, including one-day specialists Stevie Williams, Jake Stewart and sprinter Ethan Vernon.\n\nBritain's Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome was released last month.",

If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have played these matches because of this knee problem.\"\n\nInjuries have limited Brazil's all-time top scorer, who has netted 79 goals in 128 appearances, from featuring for the national side since a defeat by Uruguay in October 2023.\n\nIn October this year, Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward must regain full fitness and be in form to be recalled to his squad for next summer's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States.",

    "fullText": "Wales head coach Craig Bellamy is looking forward to renewing his rivalry with Canada counterpart Jesse Marsch if he can lead his team to the World Cup.\n\nIf Wales win their play-off semi-final and final in March, they will be in Group B alongside co-hosts Canada, as well as Switzerland and Qatar at next summer's tournament in North America.\n\nThe opening fixture between Canada and Wales in Toronto will be a grudge match of sorts, after an ill-tempered finish to their friendly in September.\n\nBellamy was unhappy with the way former Leeds United boss Marsch and his coaches celebrated their 1-0 win before the final whistle in Swansea, while the Canadian players and their manager were exuberant in their celebrations afterwards.\n\nBellamy said after the game, \"I hope I see you [Marsch and Canada] at the World Cup\" and, following Friday's extravagant, long-winded draw in Washington DC, he could have his wish next June.\n\n\"I watched a little bit of the World Cup draw but not much. I think I got lost after the first 20 minutes and I think I came back to it about five hours later,\" the former Liverpool and Manchester City forward joked.\n\n\"I always have that on my mind. Just get there first. We've got to get there first but, if that is the case, then we [Marsch and Bellamy] will definitely have a nice conversation before that as well.\n\n\"I've got nothing against that guy, by the way, I think he's got something against the world. There's a part of me that really likes him from afar without really knowing him.\n\n\"But some of the things he says, you see his interviews before the other games after playing us... I think I find him very interesting.\"",

It will be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves,\" said chief tournament officer Manolo Zubiria.\n\n\"Obviously, if there's an injury [stoppage] at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee.\"",
