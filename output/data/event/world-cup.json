    "description": "By scoring a first-half hat-trick against Wolves on Saturday, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent, putting himself firmly in the England conversation.",
    "fullText": "With the World Cup four months away, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent on Saturday.\n\nThe Chelsea forward scored a first-half hat-trick as the Blues beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves 3-1 to remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish.\n\nTwo of those goals were penalties, with Palmer displaying his typically ice-cool demeanour to send the goalkeeper the wrong way both times.\n\nPalmer has been dogged by a groin injury this season, and the three goals almost doubled his tally for the campaign - going from four Premier League goals to seven.\n\nThe performance also puts him firmly in the England squad conversation.\n\n\"If he's impacting games, like we know he can, from now to the end of the season, he's a sure thing to be in the squad,\" former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He can play wide, he can play as a 10. He's just so good on the ball and classy and simply doesn't fear anybody.\n\n\"Even if you bring him off the bench, you know he can do unbelievable things. He can win you a game in a heartbeat.\"\n\nPalmer celebrated his opening goal against Wolves by covering his ears - a response, perhaps, to recent reports suggesting he is unsettled in London.\n\nThe former Manchester City player has had a difficult campaign in which injury has seen him in and out of the side, while under new head coach Liam Rosenior he has had his playing minutes carefully managed.\n\nSince Rosenior became Chelsea boss at the start of this year he has often faced questions about Palmer's form, fitness and state of mind.\n\nThis performance provided something of a direct response to those questions, but key for Palmer will be keeping it up.\n\n\"We know what a world-class player he is. He's played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"When he's at his best, he's unstoppable. I'm delighted to be working with him.\"\n\nThis is, after all, a player who scored twice in the Club World Cup final less than six months ago, and across the two seasons prior to this one totted up 37 Premier League goals.\n\nIf Palmer can now build momentum, he will be hitting form at just the right time.\n\nHe was a key player for England at Euro 2024 but has made just one appearance under current boss Thomas Tuchel - in a 1-0 win against Andorra last June.\n\nInjuries have been a factor, but there is also competition for places - with the likes of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham rivalling him for the number 10 role.\n\n\"At the moment it looks like Morgan Rogers and Jude Bellingham will be the two who are ahead of him,\" said former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Final Score.\n\n\"I'd be looking to find a way to get him in the side.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would select Palmer for England, former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton was a little more blunt: \"Not at the minute, no. I'd play Rogers.\"\n\nEngland have two more friendlies lined up before the World Cup - against Uruguay on 27 March and Japan four days later - so that international camp will offer a big chance for players such as Palmer to impress Tuchel.\n\n\"I don't think Cole [Palmer] is at his best yet,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Like a lot of players, when you have had a bad injury and you've had quite a lot of time out, it does take game time to get your rhythm and your sharpness back.\n\n\"He really needs to start playing regularly to force his way into the England squad and team, because at the moment with Morgan Rogers doing what he's doing, and other players playing well, he's got a battle on his hands.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "India captain Suryakumar Yadav led ‌by example as the tournament co-hosts began their Twenty20 World Cup title defence with a 29-run victory against the United States in a group A contest on Saturday.\n\nIndia recovered from a dire 77-6 to post a decent 161-9 with Suryakumar hitting a scintillating 84 not out off 49 balls.\n\nThe US managed 132-8 in reply, putting up a decent fight but never really coming ⁠close to chasing down the target.\n\nEarlier, the predominantly Indian fans at the Wankhede Stadium probably expected sixes and fours to rain down after US captain Monank Patel elected to field.\n\nInstead, it was a long procession of India’s top-order batters returning to the pavilion after a spectacular meltdown of the world’s top-ranked T20 team.\n\nOpener Abhishek Sharma, currently the world’s number one T20 batter, fell for a first-ball duck in perhaps an inkling of what was in ⁠store for the home side.\n\nThe real nightmare unfolded in the final Powerplay over when Shadley van Schalkwyk claimed three wickets in five deliveries to leave India reeling on 46-4.\n\nIshan Kishan (20) and Tilak Varma (25) could not convert their starts, while Shivam Dube departed with a golden duck against his name in that eventful over from van Schalkwyk.\n\nIt could easily have been worse, but bowler Shubham Ranjane could not hold onto a return catch from Suryakumar when the batter was on 15.\n\nWickets kept tumbling at the other end though.\n\nRinku Singh, Hardik Pandya and ‌Axar Patel perished trying to swing their way out of trouble.\n\nSuryakumar responded to the crisis with a captain’s knock as he raced to a 36-ball fifty before plundering 21 runs from the final over from Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nIndia’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah missed ‌the match due to illness, and they were also forced into replacing Harshit Rana, who was ruled out of the tournament barely 24 hours before ‌their opening match with a thigh injury.\n\nMohammed Siraj (3-29) vindicated his last-minute ⁠inclusion as Rana’s replacement with a two-wicket burst, while Arshdeep Singh also tasted success as they reduced the US to 31-3 in the six Powerplay overs.\n\nSanjay Krishnamurthi (37) and Milind Kumar (34) defied India for a while with a 58-run stand, but once the partnership ‌ended, India were firmly in charge.\n\nIn Colombo, the Netherlands nearly pulled off a major upset before Faheem Ashraf’s breezy cameo secured Pakistan’s nervy three-wicket win with three balls to spare in another group A contest.\n\nIn a group C match in Kolkata, West Indies fast bowler Romario Shepherd claimed four wickets in five balls, including a hat-trick, as the twice champions thumped Scotland by 35 runs.",

    "description": "Ireland have a string of disappointing T20 World Cups behind them and will need to repeat their giant-killings of the past to buck the trend in Sri Lanka and India.",
    "fullText": "Whether it be the unforgettable St. Patrick's Day against Pakistan in 2007, or Kevin O'Brien thumping a rapid century to beat England four years later, Ireland's history at World Cups is one built upon giant killings.\n\nBut if those historic days, and a few more besides against the likes of West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, all helped to create a reputation for over-performance at global showpieces, it has been a contrasting story at T20 World Cups.\n\nIndeed, as Ireland prepare to start their 2026 campaign against co-hosts Sri Lanka on Sunday, the presence of Oman in their group is a reminder that in the shorter format, the shoe has more often been on the other foot.\n\nIt was 10 years ago in India that defeat by the tournament debutants first up sent Ireland on their way to one of their six early exits from eight attempts, while it was the same old story in the USA last time around when a 12-run loss to Canada, with an assist from the weather, did the damage.\n\nWith Australia to follow Sri Lanka this time around, before facing Oman and then Zimbabwe in Pool B, if Heinrich Malan's side are to reverse the trend in the coming 10 days, they must ensure they are again the ones administering the shocks rather than finding themselves on the receiving end.\n\nSaturday, 8 February 2026, 13:30 GMT\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text with in-play clips.\n\nWhile Ireland lost three of their six scheduled T20s to the weather during a wholly frustrating home summer in 2025, in the months since they have at least had the benefit of regular cricket.\n\nHarry Tector and Matthew Humphreys led the way for an encouraging T20 win over Bangladesh in November before consecutive losses to surrender the series gave the impression of a side who had run out of steam at the end of the multi-format tour.\n\nA 2-1 series win over Italy followed by a two-game whitewash of the UAE have formed the bulk of preparations for the World Cup, but a final tune-up against Pakistan on Wednesday fell victim to the rain, robbing the side of the chance to step up against the sort of superior opposition they will face in their first two games in Sri Lanka.\n\nAcross the five warm-up games in Dubai, there is the sense that the side have chanced upon their optimum line-up for the conditions in Sri Lanka, although perhaps the solution involved the loss of form one of their leading lights.\n\nTector and Humphreys continue to lead the way with bat and ball respectively, with the former averaging 43 across his past eight T20 internationals to form a strong middle-order with wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker.\n\nRoss Adair, who still has Ireland's most recent T20 century to his name thanks to his knock against South Africa in 2024, appears to have held off the challenge of the younger Tector brother, Tim, to open alongside captain Paul Stirling.\n\nDespite the skipper averaging 20 across the 16 T20s Ireland have played since the last World Cup, the 35-year-old remains the side's best player against the spin bowling they are sure to face in Sri Lankan conditions.\n\nThe bowling resurgence of veteran all-rounder George Dockrell - who took four wickets for 53 runs from 13 overs in the warm-ups - allows for the lengthening of the batting line-up where 23-year-old Ben Calitz will be relied upon to provide some left-handed thump.\n\nIt is all, however, expected to be at the expense of a genuine quick. An out-of-sorts Josh Little did not feature in either match against the UAE after not managing a wicket in two games against both Bangladesh and Italy with an economy rate ranging between 9.50 and 13.50.\n\nThe player who took a memorable T20 World Cup hat-trick against New Zealand in 2022, and indeed had figures of 4-23 against Sunday's opposition a year prior, looks likely to start the tournament outside the starting XI.\n\nWith Mark Adair, Ireland's leading T20 wicket-taker there to shoulder the load in terms of seam, it means Malan's selection can all, in one way or another, take some confidence from their preparations.\n\nWhether that transfers to facing the likes of Sri Lanka and Australia, however, will be the determining factor in Ireland's efforts.\n\nAustralia's Hazlewood ruled out of T20 World Cup\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Bowler Shubham Ranjane, one of five India-born players in USA's XI, was the guilty party low in his follow-through.\n\nThe India captain punished the miss with a brilliant 84 not out from 49 balls, countering the situation perfectly by starting slowly before unfurling thrilling scoops and flicks to drag the hosts to 161-9.\n\nThat denied the underdogs any momentum and India seamers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj took three wickets in the first four overs of the chase to reduce the US to 13-3.\n\nAs the required run-rate climbed, the expectant locals grew more comfortable and the US scrapped to 132-8 in their 20 overs without ever threatening to complete the chase.\n\nIt means, after an entertaining opening day in which the Netherlands were a dropped catch away from stunning Pakistan and Scotland threatened West Indies, India set the early pace at the top of Group A as expected in this World Cup.\n\nEngland enter the tournament on Sunday with a fixture against Nepal at 09:30 GMT.

The upset, which would have topped USA's super over win over Pakistan at the last T20 World Cup, was on at one stage.\n\nThe home crowd was quiet and in the 13th over Suryakumar and Axar Patel were at the crease with only three tailenders remaining.\n\nThe US, who have not played a T20 since April amid governance issues and are ranked 18th in the world, bowled superbly.\n\nIndia opener Abhishek Sharma, many people's tip for player of the tournament, slashed his first ball to deep cover and when South Africa-born seamer Shadley van Schalkwyk mixed his pace to take three wickets in the sixth over, including Tilak Verma and Shivam Dube in consecutive deliveries, the hosts were 46-4.\n\nSuryakumar - known by his nickname SKY - defended Van Schalkwyk's hat-trick ball and took only five runs from his first 10 deliveries and 20 from his first 21.\n\nHis team-mates all struggled to time the ball but he took time to feel comfortable, putting on 41 with Axar.\n\nMaking the most of the reprieve by Ranjane, Suryakumar was playing trademark sweeps off seamers for six and tumbling scoops by the end with the US hurt by the loss of Ali Khan to injury with two of his overs unbowled.\n\nIndia's captain took 20 runs from the last over, meaning he ended the innings with 10 runs more than the 74 his team-mates managed combined.\n\nIt was a spectacular and much-needed knock.\n\nT20 World Cup: India seal opening-day win over USA - reaction\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Captain Scott Edwards top-scored with a battling 37.\n\nThe Netherlands made a positive start to their innings at the Sinhalese Sports Club after they were asked to bat first as opener Michael Levitt thumped 24 off 15 balls.\n\nBas de Leede continued the momentum with a composed 25-ball 30 and, at 105-3 with De Leede and Edwards at the crease, the Netherlands looked set to post a competitive total.\n\nBut the Associate nation lost their last six wickets for 20 runs as Mohammad Nawaz, Abrar Ahmed and Saim Ayub picked up two wickets apiece.\n\nSahibzada Farhan's classy 47 off 31 balls guided Pakistan to 98-2 before he slapped Aryan Dutt to cover to start a Pakistan collapse as Roelof van der Merwe and Paul van Meekeren bowled tightly.\n\nAshraf spared their blushes, though, when he hammered three sixes and a four off the penultimate over from Logan van Beek, the Netherlands missing a chance to dismiss him on seven when Max O'Dowd shelled a catch at long-off.\n\nWith five needed from the final over Ashraf got himself on strike then thrashed De Leede through cover for four to prevent a shock.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Netherlands are a good side, but we want to execute our plans.”\n\nThe Netherlands has a history of surprising stronger opposition in T20 World Cups, including beating South Africa in 2022 in Australia which cleared the way for Pakistan to qualify for the semifinals.\n\nCaptain Scott Edwards said his team had got used to the conditions after spending more than a month in India and Sri Lanka.\n\n“For us, it’s a big game, so are the other three,” Edwards said.\n\nIn the two other games on Saturday, Scotland, which replaced Bangladesh in Group C, will meet two-time champion West Indies in Kolkata while co-host and defending champion India plays against the U.S. at Mumbai in a Group A match.\n\nNetherlands: Michael Levitt, Max O’Dowd, Bas de Leede, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards (captain), Zach Lion-Cachet, Logan van Beek, Roelof van der Merwe, Aryan Dutt, Kyle Klein, Paul van Meekeren.\n\nPakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Babar Azam, Usman Khan, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",

    "fullText": "Former German World Cup winner Thomas Müller is yet to decide when he will end his glittering playing career.\n\nMüller has a contract at Major League Soccer side Vancouver Whitecaps until the end of the year by when he will be 37. He joined the Canadian side last summer after 25 trophy-laden years at Bayern Munich.\n\n\"As always in my life, I don't commit myself unnecessarily. My\n main motivation for playing football is to enjoy it. The first few months here have been a lot of fun. Now my first full season is coming up,\" Müller told Germany's Welt paper.\n\nMüller named his fitness and health a key criteria, saying: \"How will my body cope with the whole journey? I struggled a bit towards the end of last season. That's another reason why I haven't fully made up my mind yet.\"\n\nMüller, who was speaking from a training camp in the southern Spanish city of Marbella where the Whitecaps are preparing for the new season, said he still enjoys the role of a player.\n\n\"Having the opportunity to decide a home game in the 90th minute with a penalty, feeling that pressure and having the chance to move so many people's emotions with one action when you score – that's still worth going to bed earlier for,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I'll just skip the cocktail and have still water instead.\"\n\nBayern hope that Müller will return to the club in a new capacity once he has ended his playing career but he said that nothing is decided yet.\n\n\"The connection to FC Bayern is still there, both emotionally and in terms of content,\" he said.\n\n\"And we have discussed with the club management that there is a possibility of going down a joint path in the future. There is no letter of intent or even a term sheet yet. I don't want to do my coaching licence now (while still playing) or start a degree.\"\n\nMüller said \"I want to consciously pursue my education\" after the playing career, \"instead of frantically trying to get a certificate on the side.\n\n\"When I do something, I give it one hundred per cent. I don't want to expect myself or anyone else to get anything less than my full passion, energy and attention.\"",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has indicated the knee injury that scuppered Jean-Philippe Mateta's planned move to AC Milan could also thwart the striker's \"dream\" of playing at the World Cup.\n\nMateta was on the verge of joining Milan for £30m on deadline day, but the deal was called off after knee issues emerged over the course of two medical examinations.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been dealing with the injury to his right knee during the first half of the season.\n\n\"We knew and he knew there was an issue. He was not really pleased,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We took a higher risk, that's why he could play in most games, but we rested him for some games and some training sessions.\n\n\"To be honest it was not a big surprise to everyone that he could fail [the medical]. We knew that this can happen and he knew it.\"\n\nFrance international Mateta has yet to decide what his next steps should be, with this summer's World Cup on his mind.\n\n\"There are two ways we can do this: manage the knee like we have until after the World Cup, which is Mateta's dream to play in. The other one is he undergoes surgery,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"We don't know how long he would be out. There are a few predictions: it could be two months, three months, six to nine months. There are many opinions, but it is about doing the right thing and we will decide next week.\"\n\nMateta ruptured his meniscus in 2019 when playing for Mainz and spent about six months on the sidelines following surgery. A similar absence this time would end his World Cup hopes, with the tournament just four months away.\n\nMateta faces uncertain future for club and country\n\nPalace criticised over collapse of move for McNeil\n\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\n\nDespite retaining Mateta, who is Palace's top scorer with eight league goals this season, the Eagles paid a club record fee to sign striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves.\n\nPalace were also on the verge of bringing in Everton winger Dwight McNeil until the deal fell through late on deadline day.\n\nGlasner said he had \"learned to accept situations\" after Palace were also unsuccessful in finding a replacement for captain and centre-back Marc Guehi, who joined Manchester City earlier in the window.\n\n\"At the end of it, the club tried everything with huge offers and huge bids for a Marc Guehi replacement, but clubs said they don't sell on deadline day,\" Glasner said.\n\n\"Credit to the club that without getting any money for Mateta they still spent a big fee on Strand Larsen.\n\n\"On the other side, McNeil was the last one we thought we could finalise, but in the last minutes the terms of the deal changed again and the deal failed. I expected him and planned for him in the next day's training.\"\n\nMcNeil's partner, Megan Sharpley, criticised Crystal Palace on social media for the way they handled the situation.\n\nEverton boss David Moyes said the breakdown had \"nothing to do\" with his club and insists McNeil is \"fine\".\n\n\"He's in and he's training as well, so Dwight's OK,\" Moyes said.\n\n\"We understand exactly where it went wrong, how it broke down. He knows everything about it and there's no problems there.\n\n\"We had given permission for Dwight to go and have a medical and do all of the things required for it, so it was very hard to do much more than we have done.\"\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "With much of the cricketing world apathetic towards this T20 World Cup, England captain Harry Brook and coach Brendon McCullum need it more than most.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-nine days since Sydney and the final ball of the Ashes - barely enough time for some of England's players to return home.\n\nControversy has made no attempt to return to its box over the weeks that have passed. One positive for England is they are not alone in struggling to keep it in check.\n\nAhead stands a World Cup - the 10th in the T20 format and fourth since the Covid-19 pandemic - which few seem to want but one plenty, captain Harry Brook, coach Brendon McCullum and their England team included, need.\n\nThe cricket, which begins on Saturday with Scotland and India among those in action, will be entertaining over the next four weeks, make no mistake.\n\nWatching this sport in India, especially when the home team are involved, is one of the game's thrills.\n\nSri Lanka will offer plenty as co-hosts too and the expansion to 20 teams, which this time allows Italy to make their major tournament bow, was one of the triumphs of the 2024 edition in the Caribbean.\n\nBut this tournament begins under the darkest of clouds.\n\nBangladesh have decided not to be there. Unless there is a late change of heart, Pakistan are not going to play India in Sri Lanka under instruction from their government.\n\nEight months ago, South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen and West Indies' Nicholas Pooran, two of the best and most sought-after batters in the T20 game, called time on their international careers.\n\nAged 33 and 29 respectively, they opted for the franchise world.\n\nWould that happen so close to a major tournament if the draw of a World Cup was as strong as it once was?\n\nA factor in these issues is, in part at least, the oversaturation of cricket's major events.\n\nAdd in the 50-over World Cup in 2023, last year's Champions Trophy and four women's World Cups, there have been 10 such tournaments in little over four years.\n\nBut the wider mess, one absorbing an increasing amount of the subcontinent and which will threaten the future stability of the sport if not resolved, is a result of years of weak management.\n\nPolitical posturing has not crept into cricket slowly over the past three months.\n\nIt has stamped all over it for a decade, all while the International Cricket Council stood and watched.\n\nIndia played the Champions Trophy in Dubai rather than Pakistan as scheduled – an issue predictable from the moment the hosts were selected.\n\nBangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman was then removed from the Indian Premier League without explanation at the start of the year, kicking off this latest crisis.\n\nThe easiest option has been taken at every turn. This is the result.\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?\n\nEngland's issues may not run so deep, but they are no less pressing.\n\nThe talk of the past four weeks has been of nights out, clockings and identifying who was in a New Zealand nightclub and who was not.\n\nWhat happened in Wellington is English cricket's latest drama.\n\nThe controversies also overshadowed an impressive two-week tour of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThey were asked to be smarter after the Ashes and clinched the subsequent T20 series by winning on a road, before sealing a 3-0 whitewash on a slow turner - all in conditions in which they will play their entire Super 8 phase, should they progress through the initial stage of this World Cup.\n\nYet the narrative has remained focused on Brook.\n\nMcCullum said this week his captain's escapades in New Zealand have been spoken about too much. Some supporters may agree.\n\nWhile naive not to expect it to emerge, choosing not to reveal the incident from the start was fair. Brook was punished with a heavy fine in any case.\n\nBut by lying in his apology and those untruths not being immediately corrected afterwards, Brook and England only ensured the spotlight returned to their off-field activities.\n\nThe tight turnaround between the Ashes and World Cup was always one obvious stumbling block for those who would have already sacked Brook and McCullum.\n\nThere was no time for another coach to be found, but after this there are three months before England's men play again - plenty of time for replacement feet to get under the table if results are poor again.\n\nOf course, there is a scenario where McCullum simply sees the break as the time to walk away - though he maintained his desire to stay on earlier this week.\n\nThe New Zealander's takeaway from his only previous white-ball tournament in charge of England - when his side exited the Champions Trophy without winning a match - was that the players cared too much.\n\n\"If anything they are too harsh on themselves,\" he said. \"They need to be able to give themselves a break and be able to let go a little bit so all of that talent can come out.\"\n\nNavigating that, given the scrutiny around a perceived relaxed, care-free environment and his bosses' wish for change, appears a difficult challenge.\n\nFor McCullum and Brook, reaching the semi-finals in the first week of March is the minimum requirement. Having won 10 of their past 11 completed T20s, they should be capable.\n\nDoing so in 2024 was not enough to save the job of McCullum's predecessor as white-ball coach, Australian Matthew Mott, so much will also be about how England play.\n\nWill they, unlike in the Caribbean, truly challenge the best?\n\nThey have been billed as serious contenders once this winter and failed miserably.\n\nWhether to secure futures or merely change the narrative, England must hope those 29 days since Sydney have provided the time to ensure they do not do so again.\n\nTop run-scorer, wicket-taker and champion - T20 World Cup predictions\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "Several Italy internationals moved clubs during the January transfer window, but which ones will be hoping to earn more regular minutes ahead of a potential World Cup campaign in the summer of 2026?\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – JANUARY 25: Giacomo Raspdori of Atalanta celebrates scoring his team’s third goal with teammate Nikola Krstovic of Atalanta during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and Parma Calcio 1913 at Gewiss Stadium on January 25, 2026 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGiacomo Raspadori is back in Serie A after a short-lived, six-month spell in LaLiga with Atletico Madrid. The two-time Scudetto winner struggled to break into Diego Simeone’s first-team plans in the Spanish capital and was limited to just one start from a possible 18 league matches prior to his joining Atalanta.\n\nRaspadori has already featured in two Serie A matches for Atalanta, starting and scoring in their most recent match against Pisa, which ended in a resounding 4-0 victory for La Dea.\n\nHe has already been a regular in Gennaro Gattuso’s Italy national team squad and now just needs a consistent run of games before becoming a sure-fire pick for the 2026 World Cup squad assuming that Italy qualify.\n\nOfficial: Lorenzo Lucca joins Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy from Napoli (picture: www.nottinghamforest.co.uk)\n\nIt had been a disappointing season at Napoli for the towering centre-forward, who has since joined Nottingham Forest on loan with an option to buy.\n\nNapoli brought in both Lucca and Rasmus Hojlund to strengthen their options at centre-forward over the summer, but even after a serious injury to Romelu Lukaku the week before the season began, Lucca was limited to just four starts in Serie A and none since the end of October.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Lucca will become a regular starter in the Premier League under Sean Dyche, but if he is given regular minutes, he will certainly be an option for Gattuso to consider in Italy’s slightly understocked centre-forward department.\n\nDaniel Maldini wears the Lazio jersey\n\nAnother attacker hoping to impress ahead of the World Cup is Daniel Maldini, who joined Lazio on loan with a potential obligation to buy from Atalanta during the January window.\n\nThe son of Italy legend Paolo Maldini was limited to just three Serie A starts with Atalanta during the first half of the season, but looks set to be handed more consistent opportunities under Maurizio Sarri at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nThere have even been suggestions that Sarri could look to deploy Maldini as a false nine.\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JANUARY 27: Marco Brescianini of ACF Fiorentina battles for the ball with Nico Paz of Como 1907 during the Coppa Italia match between of ACF Fiorentina and of Como 1907 at Stadio Artemio Franchi on January 27, 2026 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)\n\nAnother Italy international who left Atalanta in January was Brescianini, who has joined Fiorentina on loan with an option and potential obligation to buy.\n\nBrescianini has already earned more minutes over his first four games with Fiorentina than he had done in his last four months with Atalanta, earning his first league start since October during La Viola’s recent 2-1 loss against Napoli.\n\nBrescianini still faces a difficult task to break into the Italy midfield department with stiff competition from the likes of Nicolo Barella, Sandro Tonali, Manuel Locatelli, Davide Frattesi, Bryan Cristante and Samuele Ricci.\n\nOfficial: Diego Coppola joins Paris FC from Brighton & Hove Albion (@Diegocoppolass via Instagram)\n\nDiego Coppola has taken the decision to move away from the Premier League after six months on the south coast with Brighton and Hove Albion. He had to wait until December to earn his first starts in the English top flight, and has since joined Paris FC on loan, where he will team up with fellow Italy representatives Ciro Immobile and Luca Koleosho.\n\nCoppola has two Italy caps to his name at the age of 22, and will be hoping for more regular minutes in Ligue 1 to challenge the likes of Alessandro Bastoni, Alessandro Buongiorno, Riccardo Calafiori and Gianluca Mancini for a spot in a potential World Cup squad.",

    "fullText": "It is almost time for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nIndia head into the tournament as defending champions following their success in the Caribbean and United States in 2024.\n\nThey are strong favourites in their home conditions - but the unpredictable nature of T20 cricket makes for an exciting tournament.\n\nHere is a full guide to the 10th edition of the men's 20-over global showpiece.\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup starts on 7 February at 05:30 GMT with Pakistan facing the Netherlands in Colombo.\n\nIt is one of three games on the opening day, with the West Indies v Scotland at 09:30 and India v USA at 15:30.\n\nThe initial 20-team group stage, that sees four groups of five, continues until 20 February, with three games every day at the same times as above, bar the final day when there is just one game at 13:30.\n\nThe Super 8s follow with one or two games a day at 09:30 and 13:30, before the semi-finals across 4 and 5 March.\n\nThe final is on Sunday, 8 March at 13:30 BST in Ahmedabad.\n\nFull T20 World Cup fixture list including start times and venues\n\nThe 2026 Men's T20 World Cup follows the same format as 2024, which was the tournament's biggest with 20 sides taking part.\n\nAll of the teams are involved from the off in an initial group stage, with each side playing four games and the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nThe Super 8s, which will take place across India and Sri Lanka, will consist of two groups of four, with eight sides seeded to help with the planning and schedule.\n\nThose eight sides are: Australia, India, South Africa, West Indies (Group 1) and England, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Group 2).\n\nShould those sides progress they will go into their respective group based on their seeding, rather than their finishing position in the initial group phase.\n\nIn the Super 8s, the top two teams progress to the semi-finals with the winner of each group facing the runner-up in the other.\n\nThroughout both phases teams are awarded two points for a win, one for a no result and zero for a loss. There's no ties in T20 cricket - more on that below!\n\nAll 12 Test-playing nations have qualified for the tournament after Zimbabwe came through their qualifying stage.\n\nItaly are the only tournament debutants, while Canada are at their first global tournament since 2014.\n\nScotland were a late replacement for Bangladesh, who pulled out of the tournament after the governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), refused to meet their request to play their matches in Sri Lanka rather than India due to safety concerns amid rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nScotland, who were the highest-ranked side to not qualify, took Bangladesh's place in Group C and will fulfill their fixtures as scheduled.\n\nPakistan also considered a full boycott, but their government has decided it can play in the tournament, apart from the game against India on 15 February. The impact of that decision is yet to be communicated by the ICC.\n\nThey will play their games in Sri Lanka as part of an agreement reached in 2024 around India and Pakistan matches not being played in the other country.\n\nThe 20 sides are split into the following four groups in the initial phase:\n\nGroup A: India (X1), Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan (Y3), USA\n\nGroup B: Australia (X2), Ireland, Oman, Sri Lanka (Y4), Zimbabwe\n\nGroup C: England (Y1), Italy, Nepal, Scotland, West Indies (X3)\n\nGroup D: Afghanistan, Canada, New Zealand (Y2), South Africa (X4), United Arab Emirates\n\nFull squad lists for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup\n\nA total of eight venues are being used - five in India and three in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn India, Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi will host games.\n\nR Premadasa Stadium and Sinhalese Sports Club Ground - both in Colombo - and Pallekele Cricket Stadium put on matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium, which holds 132,000 fans and is the biggest cricket venue in the world, is due to host the final, unless Pakistan qualify, with the game then moved to Colombo.\n\nThe tournament is played in a T20 format, so both teams will face 20 overs unless they are bowled out beforehand or the team batting second reaches their target before then.\n\nEach innings will start with a six-over powerplay and there are different fielding restrictions in that phase.\n\nMatches should last three hours and 10 minutes, with each innings allocated one hour and 25 minutes and separated by a 20-minute interval.\n\nIn limited-overs cricket there is a 'stop-clock' meaning the bowling side must be ready to bowl each over within 60 seconds of the previous one finishing.\n\nEach side will be allowed two unsuccessful reviews per innings.\n\nShould the number of runs scored by each team be level after 20 overs, the match will go to a super over (each team will face six balls - highest score wins). If that finishes a tie then super overs will continue to be played until a winner is found.\n\nIn the two group phases a minimum of five overs per side must be played to constitute a result, but that rises to 10 overs in the semi-finals and final.\n\nIf a match is halted after that point due to weather conditions then DLS (Duckworth Lewis Stern method) will be used to decide the winner.\n\nThe ICC are yet to publish playing conditions around reserve days and extra time allocated to the knockout matches.\n\nIf Pakistan reach the semi-finals, Colombo's R. Premadasa Stadium will replace Kolkata as the venue for the first semi-final, while the final would also move if Pakistan qualify.\n\nIf India make the last four and face any side that is not Pakistan, they will play in the second semi-final in Mumbai on 5 March.\n\nGlossary of cricket terms including DLS and powerplay\n\nThere have been six winners of the nine Men's T20 World Cups. They are:\n\nThere will be ball-by-ball commentary of all 55 matches across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nOur commentary team includes Henry Moeran, Prakash Wakankar, Aatif Nawaz, Daniel Norcross, Simon Mann, Nikesh Rughani, Kevin Howells and Melissa Story.\n\nExpert analysis will come from multiple Ashes winner Steven Finn, World Cup winner Alex Hartley, T20 World Cup champion Dawid Malan, Scotland and England T20 World Cup spinner Kirstie Gordon, former Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien and Big Bash winner Michael Carberry.\n\nThe BBC Sport website and app will have live text commentary on selected group-stage matches then every match from the Super 8s onwards.\n\nThere will be daily reports and score updates alongside in-play and post-match video highlights, alongside regular coverage on the BBC Cricket Instagram, external account.\n\nThe tournament is available to watch live in the UK on Sky Sports.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Under-19 World Cup, final, Harare\n\nIndia 411-9 (50.0 overs): Suryavanshi 175 (80); Minto 3-63\n\nIndia teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a stunning 175 from just 80 balls in the Under-19 World Cup final against England.\n\nThe 14-year-old hammered 15 sixes and 15 fours at a strike rate of 218.75 during a brutal and breathtaking knock at the Harare Sports Club in Zimbabwe.\n\nHe scored 24 off his first 24 balls, meaning his last 151 runs came off just 56 deliveries.\n\nSuryavanshi's 126-minute stay at the crease was eventually ended by England seamer Manny Lumsden in the 26th over to leave India 251-3.\n\nLumsden took pace off the ball and Suryavanshi gloved an attempted slog sweep to England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew.\n\nA number of England's players shook Suryavanshi's hand as he left the field in recognition of the brilliance of his innings.\n\nIndia finished on 411-9 from their 50 overs - the fifth highest total in U19 World Cup history and a record for a final eclipsing the 253-7 made by Australia against India in the 2024 final.\n\nSuryavanshi's score took his World Cup tally to 439 runs in seven innings at 62.71 - four runs clear of Afghanistan's Faisal Khan as the tournament's leading run-scorer.\n\nSome other notable statistics from Suryavanshi's innings:\n\nIt was the highest score in an Under-19 World Cup final, beating Unmukt Chand's 111* for India in the 2012 final against Australia.\n\nThe innings gives him the ninth highest score in the history of youth ODIs. South Africa's Jorich van Schalkwyk (215 vs Zimbabwe) is the only player to make a double century.\n\nIt was the sixth-highest individual score in the history of all matches played at U19 World Cups.\n\nHis knock included the record for most sixes (15) in a youth ODI innings, beating his own record of 14 against the United Arab Emirates at last year's U19 Asia Cup.\n\nHis 15 sixes is the highest number in an Under-19 World Cup innings. Only two other players have managed double digits.\n\nThe century off 55 balls is the second fastest in U19 World Cups, behind Will Malajczuk's 51-ball hundred for Australia against Japan earlier in this year's tournament\n\nIt is the latest achievement for Suryavanshi, who shot to global fame in April last year when he smashed his first ball in the Indian Premier League for six.\n\nHe then became the youngest player to hit a century in men's T20s when he made a 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.\n\nIt was also the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind Chris Gayle's 30-ball ton in 2013.\n\nIn July 2025, he struck what was then the fastest recorded century in a youth ODI, making 143 from 78 balls as India beat England by 55 runs at Worcester.\n\nHe took 52 balls to reach three figures, bettering Kamran Ghulam's 53-ball effort for Pakistan against England in 2013.\n\nFour months later, he struck a 32-ball century in India A's victory against the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match. He was eventually dismissed for 144 from 42 balls.\n\nListen to ball-by-ball commentary of the final on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Shovelling snow, finding childcare and a frenetic scramble for plane tickets.\n\nIt's been an unexpectedly stressful few weeks for Scotland's cricketers, who were thrust into action by Bangladesh's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Scots were called up by the International Cricket Council (ICC) by virtue of being the highest-ranked team not already at the tournament, but the players were finding out as everyone else was - via social media and news outlets.\n\n\"It was just so many screenshots of Bangladeshi journalists and all these tweets,\" Scotland spinner Mark Watt told the BBC's No Balls: The Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"All the boys were just flying round saying 'is this true? Is this going to be happening?'\n\n\"It was like that scene in The Office - 'it's happening, it's happening, stay calm'. Cricket Scotland have done really well to get to organise everything so quickly and getting everyone out to India so quickly.\"\n\nNo Balls: Watt's this? Scotland at the T20 World Cup?\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nScotland had failed to reach the World Cup because of a hugely disappointing qualifying campaign in the Netherlands last summer, which included defeats by Italy and Jersey.\n\n\"It's so surreal,\" Watt said. \"I did a chat at a local club and they were saying, 'what are you going to do when the World Cup's on?' And I was like, 'I'm not even going to watch any games because I'm still so gutted that we're not playing in it'.\"\n\nInstead of prepping for subcontinental conditions, players based in Scotland were undergoing fitness programmes and going about their day-to-day lives when the news started to filter through.\n\n\"[Michael Leask] lives in Aberdeen and he was shovelling snow as we were getting all these calls,\" Watt said.\n\n\"We were doing boxing and between sets we're saying 'do you think we're actually going to go?'\n\n\"Not a lot of cricket was going on, it was other things. [Matthew] Cross is trying to build his house at the moment, so he's doing all his DIY.\n\n\"He's been stressed trying to get other people to go in and do the stuff he was going to do.\n\n\"People who have kids were trying to get them minded.\n\n\"I got all my holidays out of the way last year. I was looking forward to a little break, but I'm very happy to be here.\"\n\nThe last-minute nature of Scotland's entry has drawn comparisons to a famous equivalent in the world of football.\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying Denmark [at the Euros] in 1992, because they didn't qualify and won it,\" Watt said. \"Anything's possible. Imagine that?\"\n\nAfter Watt and his team-mates knew they were going to India, they were not sure when they would depart.\n\nFlights were booked in the hope that visas would come through, and when they did the rush to get halfway around the world began.\n\n\"It was like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" Watt said. \"I got my golden ticket and I was like, 'you need to get me on the flight tonight'.\n\n\"Leasky in Aberdeen had to drive two and a half hours to Edinburgh, he got his visa through the same time as me.\n\n\"We're all so excited and so grateful this opportunity came about, but also feel sorry for Bangladesh on the other side of it.\"\n\nScotland are one of five European sides at the competition and one of nine associate ICC members.\n\nAfter warm-up defeats by Afghanistan and Namibia, they take on West Indies in their opening match on Saturday, before games against Italy, England and Nepal in Group C, with the top two progressing to the Super 8s.\n\nWatt says the prospect of seeing different match-ups can only be a positive.\n\n\"Obviously I've got a bit of favouritism for their associates,\" he said.\n\n\"But I just think the more the merrier. You see these Test-playing nations play against each other so often, it's a little bit samey and I think it's really refreshing when the associates come to play against these big teams.\n\n\"Obviously sometimes the results don't go your way, but it's the only way these teams and ourselves are going to learn how to play against them.\n\n\"So it's a great learning curve, but also, we're not there just to learn, but we're there to beat teams.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Who will win? Who will be the top run-scorers and wicket-takers? The Test Match Special team make their T20 World Cup predictions.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us.\n\nIndia are defending champions after their 2024 win and have home advantage as co-hosts alongside Sri Lanka.\n\nCan anyone stop them? And who will be the best batters and bowlers?\n\nHere are the Test Match Special team's predictions before it all gets under way on Saturday, 7 February.\n\nFormer England bowler Steven Finn: It is hard to look beyond India, but the romance of South Africa winning after how close they got to winning by reaching the 2024 final is something I would like to see.\n\nI do actually think England are dark horses to win the tournament given how well they played in Sri Lanka and the options they have.\n\nFormer England bowler Alex Hartley: No team has ever won a men's T20 World Cup on home soil, so I'm going India.\n\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills: India will be tough to beat in their own conditions. Obviously all their players are well-accustomed to playing on those decks, so I'll go with India.\n\nEngland and Scotland bowler Kirstie Gordon: It is probably a popular answer but it is hard to look past India in their own conditions. They look incredibly strong and well balanced. I would love to see South Africa give them a scare.\n\nAs for Scotland, it is hard to say given their lack of preparation time, but they have some excellent players and will be keen to show they deserve to be there.\n\nI think they will beat Italy and Nepal but West Indies and England's firepower could be too big a hurdle.\n\nBBC cricket reporter Henry Moeran: India will be hard to beat at home, and having won the last two global white-ball events will be full of confidence.\n\nBut as we saw in the final of 2023, home pressure can sometimes be a hindrance and so many top players from around the world having Indian Premier League experience means knowledge of conditions perhaps will not be as significant.\n\nSouth Africa could be a threat having broken their hoodoo with the Test Championship win.\n\nTMS commentator Prakash Wakankar: While India will be among the favourites, the pressure will be immense.\n\nI would never write off Australia, and South Africa are really well placed with the variety in their bowling and depth in their batting.\n\nIf pressed, I would go for a repeat of the 2023 50-over final between India and Australia, but hopefully with a different result...\n\nTMS commentator Daniel Norcross: India. It is the obvious choice but that is because India come into this World Cup in formidable form and have home advantage.\n\nIn addition, if their match with Pakistan does not go ahead, they will not only pick up two points without playing a game but will also not have to leave India.\n\nTMS commentator Aatif Nawaz: Though both England and Pakistan are heading into the World Cup with strong form, getting the better of India will be a Herculean task.\n\nBBC cricket writer Matthew Henry: I was all set to try and be clever. Like before the 2023 50-over World Cup in India, Australia have lost their past two series.\n\nAt that World Cup, Australia were without Travis Head for the start. This time Josh Hazlewood was set to miss the opening weeks but now he has been ruled out entirely, they surely have little chance.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nTrends and tactics to look for at 2026 T20 World Cup\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - fixtures\n\nFinn: England's Phil Salt. He has been outstanding in both the IPL and T20 internationals recently. Opening is the best place to bat in India and expect the top run-scorer to bat in the top two.\n\nHartley: Australia's Ashes hero Travis Head. He's become more consistent over the last 18 months and also plays with complete freedom. He does not care about getting out which will help him push the boundaries.\n\nMills: I'll go with South Africa captain Aiden Markram. He's in good form at the moment and he does well in India too.\n\nGordon: India's Abhishek Sharma. He's got a ridiculous strike-rate and has provided so much firepower at the top of the order for India recently. First World Cup. Home conditions. Are the stars aligned?\n\nMoeran: It might be his debut tournament, but Abhishek is a brilliant player and I think he will do some serious damage to bowling attacks.\n\nNorcross: Abhishek. The Indian opener is in frighteningly good form and will have plenty of opportunity to go big on friendly, run-drenched pitches at home in India.\n\nNawaz: Abhishek is the smart bet. He will open for India and doubtless hit sixes for fun. He stands head (sorry Travis!) and shoulders above everyone else in T20 cricket right now.\n\nWakankar: Head is my pick. He is just so dominant in this format. His hand-eye co-ordination is of a different level. He has been top of the pops for Sunrisers Hyderabad consistently in the IPL and knows the conditions really well.\n\nHenry: India captain Suryakumar Yadav scored 242 runs at 80.66 during the recent series win over New Zealand. One thing that could stop him may be the form of others in India's top order denying him enough time at the crease.\n\nHartley: Sherfane Rutherford. He had a great SA20 campaign with 334 runs and a strike-rate of 165. Nothing beats watching a West Indian when they get going.\n\nMills: South Africa's Dewald Brevis, who I played with recently at the SA20.\n\nObviously people know about him, but he probably hasn't really exploded in terms of international cricket just yet. He played some special innings for us.\n\nFinn: So much has been talked about Brevis from a young age and it finally feels like he has come of age. A fantastic SA20 - 370 runs and a strike-rate of 156.11 - should give him confidence.\n\nGordon: I'm going to go for New Zealand's Finn Allen. He's off the back of a great Big Bash campaign for Perth Scorchers, where he was the leading run-scorer with 466 in 11 innings. It seems like his batting has really matured in the last couple of years.\n\nNorcross: Allen is hit and miss, but if he gets going those small grounds in India won't be able to contain his monstrously destructive hitting.\n\nMoeran: Tom Banton of England looked in excellent touch with an unbeaten 54* in the second T20 in Sri Lanka and feels a very different player to his first iteration in the England side back in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHenry: Brevis is a good shout. England have seen what Pathum Nissanka, now sixth in the world T20 rankings, can do in recent weeks.\n\nNawaz: Let's go for someone a little less obvious. Wayne Madsen. Obviously Italy are unlikely to go past the group stage but the 42 year old's storied career feels like it has one more fairytale chapter in it...\n\nFinn: Kuldeep Yadav. He could clean up in the group stage, looking at India's opponents, and wrist spin is always a potent wicket threat as the tournament wears on.\n\nMills: It is hard to look past Jasprit Bumrah, an outstanding bowler across all formats but particularly within T20 and he'll obviously play a huge part in India's claim to winning the title.\n\nGordon: Australia's Nathan Ellis. A highly skilled T20 bowler who can bowl in all phases but is especially strong at the death.\n\nHe often goes under the radar in a top-quality attack but regularly bowls some of the toughest overs.\n\nMoeran: How can we look past Bumrah? He won India the tournament two years ago in the final against South Africa and will again be key. Few bowlers can do what he does, and his overs at the death will be integral.\n\nHartley: I do not like copying my friends but, as they have said, how do you look past Bumrah? I want to pick a spinner and I want that man to be Varun Chakaravarthy but I'm not sure he will play all the games.\n\nNawaz: I'm certain it will be a spinner. There are so many to chose from, but I'll go with Adam Zampa. He was one of Australia's few positives in their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Pakistan.\n\nWakankar: I expect Hardik Pandya to be that person, fitness being the only challenge. He is the key cog in the India team for sure as their main seam-bowling all-rounder.\n\nNorcross: Abrar Ahmed. A left-field pick maybe but hear me out.\n\nPakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka where the pitches have shown strong signs of favouring spin.\n\nThe bespectacled leg-spinner recently had the Australians in a pickle and has a great chance to bag a hatful of wickets in the opening group stage against weaker teams.\n\nHenry: The leading wicket-takers in the past three editions of the IPL have all been seamers. Always improving, always moving the new ball, I'll go with South Africa's Marco Jansen.\n\nHartley: Pakistan's Usman Tariq - not for the amount of wickets he will or won't get but the hype around his controversial bowling action.\n\nFinn: Tariq was relatively unknown until recently. Mystery spinners who burst on to the scene usually have a good first tournament, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him do well.\n\nGordon: Azmatullah Omarzai. I could have picked one of a few bowlers from Afghanistan, who I think could cause an upset in the group of death which also includes South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nA spinner might have been the common choice but Omarzai has been central to them becoming a more balanced team.\n\nMills: Maybe someone like Noor Ahmad from Afghanistan, the left-arm wrist spinner. Obviously all eyes will be on Rashid Khan but Noor is an excellent bowler in his own right as well.\n\nMoeran: South Africa quick Anrich Nortje is in fine form, taking a stack of wickets in the SA20 for Sunrisers Eastern Cape as they won the tournament. He knows the conditions, knows his game and can bowl economical and rapid spells.\n\nWakankar: I have a nagging suspicion it could be someone like Chakravarthy, given the Indian conditions.\n\nHe is deceptive and has a way of picking up wickets. His mystery element still seems to get batters in the key middle part of the innings.\n\nNawaz: Saim Ayub from Pakistan. He has established himself as a genuine all-rounder over the past 12 months and been very effective in the powerplay.\n\nI know it is a big call to go with an opening batter as bowler to watch - but that's how good he's been.\n\nNorcross: Keshav Maharaj. The South African slow left-armer is in the form of his life.\n\nA complete master of his craft, he will be desperate to go one better after South Africa's loss in the final last time around.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.",

    "fullText": "Hull KR's treble-winning head coach Willie Peters says he is \"keen\" to have talks about taking charge of England for this year's Rugby League World Cup.\n\nThe Australian, 46, is among the contenders to succeed Shaun Wane, who stepped down on 14 January.\n\nPeters led Rovers to their first Super League Grand Final triumph last October, along with the League Leaders' Shield and the Challenge Cup.\n\nHe then joined up with the Australia squad for the Rugby League Ashes series as an assistant to head coach Kevin Walters, helping them to a 3-0 series win over England.\n\nPeters told BBC Sport: \"I'd be keen to have discussions if and when that arose. It'd be a privilege to coach England, that's for sure.\"\n\nFormer Wigan coach Wane, 61, stepped down after just under six years in the role, having led England to a World Cup semi-final in 2022.\n\nWane worked on a full-time basis but the Rugby Football League has said the role is \"expected to revert to a part-time position\".\n\nAsked if he had been approached regarding the role, Peters said: \"No, I haven't spoken to anyone yet.\n\n\"It's a job that many, many people would be interested in and whoever coaches England will have a squad that competes very hard. They show a lot of passion and effort, that's what an England team does.\n\n\"Shaun did that, got them firing in terms of effort and competing.\n\n\"There are probably a few different areas that they need to work on. As I've said openly, the spine is probably an area that needs focus but they're not too far away.\"\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be staged in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea between 15 October and 15 November.\n\nAll of England's matches will be in Australia, with their opener against Tonga in Perth on Saturday, 17 October.\n\nWarrington skipper Williams to leave at end of 2026\n\nEngland head coach Wane steps down in World Cup year\n\nWigan's Matt Peet has ruled himself out of the running.\n\n\"It's not in my thoughts, no,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It's not something I'm interested in doing in the short term. Maybe one day - but now my focus is 100% on Wigan and my family for the next few years.\"\n\nEngland captain George Williams, who announced on Tuesday that he will leave Warrington at the end of 2026 to move to the NRL, said that Wane's replacement needs to bring \"passion\" to the job.\n\nWilliams, who is widely expected to link up with England team-mates Herbie Farnworth and Morgan Knowles at the Dolphins, said: \"I was disappointed that Waney lost his job and I think a lot of players would say the same thing.\n\n\"Whoever comes in, I'm sure they're passionate and keen to get us moving forward.\n\n\"If you're coaching England, you're going to be good at your job. That's automatic. But I think the passion is a big one.\n\n\"You're getting an elite group of players that pretty much half-coaches itself. It's probably now about bringing some passion and some drive behind the team.\"",

    "description": "The story of Afghan refugee Zainullah Ihsan, who is going to the T20 World Cup with Scotland three years after his first net session.",
    "fullText": "Three-and-a-half years ago, a teenager peered over a fence on Glasgow's Crow Road and told those training at GHK Cricket Club: \"I like cricket\".\n\nZainullah Ihsan had only ever played tapeball cricket - which uses a tennis ball tightly wrapped in electrical tape - in the park at that point.\n\nHowever after 10 minutes of his first GHK net session, more people were watching the young tearaway than were following the match taking place on the adjacent ground.\n\nNow, the 19-year-old is part of Scotland's squad for the T20 World Cup in India.\n\nHis story is remarkable, a tale of hardship and strength that started with him leaving Afghanistan as a 13-year-old before crossing Asia and Europe to join his older brother in Scotland two years later.\n\nIt is striking how grounded the seamer is, given his age, and he is determined to make the most of the opportunity before him.\n\nThe word 'kismet' was mentioned to me by those who know him best. It literally translates as 'luck' or 'fate', but carries more weight than that. It is the idea that certain things are meant to be and that the stars align to make it happen.\n\nIhsan missed the cut-off to qualify for the Under-19 World Cup that is taking place in Zimbabwe, but his absence there opened the door for him to travel with the senior team to India after Scotland's own late call-up.\n\n\"When Bangladesh boycotted the World Cup, I kept my eyes on my phone - all day it was in my hand and then [head coach] Owen Dawkins called me,\" Ihsan recalls about his selection.\n\n\"He said 'congratulations' and I can't explain how I felt, I was very excited.\n\n\"It was a surprise. My first selection. Every cricketer dreams to play in a World Cup and I didn't expect it.\n\n\"Straight away I called my older brother. I spoke to my Mum and Dad back in Afghanistan too. They are very excited.\"\n\nScotland pick uncapped Ihsan in World Cup squad\n\nNo sponsor, kit on order & visa wait - Scotland embrace late World Cup call\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nHis dramatic rise to full international honours has been swift, but has not been without its challenges.\n\nAs an unaccompanied refugee, Ihsan was supported by Aberlour Children's Charity through a service called Guardianship Scotland.\n\nGHK members also helped him get to training and matches around the country, while also providing him with the necessary kit.\n\nIt is not just Ihsan either. A number of children housed all over Scotland have found cricket clubs thanks to Guardianship Scotland, with many of them viewing Ihsan as a role model.\n\nAnd yet, apart from his brother, his family were unaware of his rising stock.\n\nFor many who settle in the United Kingdom from the Asian subcontinent, there is a responsibility on them to financially support family back home.\n\nIhsan played regional cricket and represented Scotland Under-17s off the back of impressive performances for GHK, but it was not until he played for Scotland A last year that he told his parents about his achievements.\n\n\"I told my parents just that I'm studying,\" he said. \"After I was selected for the A team I told my Mum and Dad and they told me to work hard and go for my dreams.\n\n\"I have the biggest dreams. The first dream was to be selected and now the dreams are higher, to be one of the top bowlers in the world and play in leagues around the world.\"\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nThroughout our interview, Ihsan kept coming back to his determination to do his best and leave no stone unturned.\n\nThere is no arrogance about him, just a steely confidence and a drive that is built into his psyche.\n\nIhsan, along with team-mate Safyaan Sharif, received their visas after the rest of the travelling Scotland party and so were unable to play in the Scots' first warm-up match against Afghanistan.\n\nDespite that disappointment, he still took the opportunity to pick the brains of Hamid Hassan - former Afghanistan opening bowler and now coach - and one of the sport's most experienced campaigners in Mohammad Nabi.\n\nGlobal superstar Rashid Khan also came over for a chat before the game.\n\nThese are some of Ihsan's heroes, but there are no split loyalties.\n\n\"Scotland gave me respect and believed in me,\" he said. \"I was born in Afghanistan but my country is Scotland.\"\n\nHe experienced his first taste of international cricket on Wednesday, taking 1-49 as Scotland were narrowly beaten by Namibia in a high-scoring game.\n\nThe teams then played a practice super over, with Ihsan trusted to bowl for Scotland.\n\n\"He's got decent pace, he's able to deliver a yorker, slower balls and a bouncer, which in T20s are good commodities to have,\" assistant coach Gordon Drummond said.\n\n\"He played his first game and it showed if you're off the mark a little bit you can get punished. The more experience he has, the more he will develop.\n\n\"He's going to learn a lot from the guys we've got out here and he really enjoyed having conversations with the Afghanistan players the other day.\n\n\"He's quite a grounded individual and the really nice thing from [the Namibia game] was he came off the park and was annoyed at how he bowled. That shows how much character he has and his willingness to learn.\n\n\"We can't predict the future, but there's not been a huge amount of input from Cricket Scotland staff.

    "fullText": "Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend has played down a report that he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the World Cup.\n\nTownsend already has a part-time consultancy role with Newcastle but the Daily Telegraph has reported, external that he will take over full time - most likely as a director of rugby - when his Scottish Rugby Union contract expires in 2027.\n\nTownsend advises Newcastle on strategy and philosophy and several of his key allies have already been recruited by the ambitious club, which was taken over by the energy drinks manufacturer last year.\n\nHe is under pressure as Scotland coach as he prepares for the Six Nations following a disappointing autumn series that included his side being booed off at Murrayfield after surrendering a 21-0 lead against Argentina.\n\nHowever the former Scotland stand-off, who took over as head coach of the national team in 2017, has denied he has put pen to paper on a deal with Newcastle.\n\n\"It's pure speculation, I've not signed a contract beyond the World Cup with anybody,\" Townsend said as he announced his team for their Six Nations opener against Italy.\n\n\"It's a story that is being put out there to try to disrupt before the Italy game or next week's game against England.\n\n\"It's just something that comes out, things like these, before the England game in particular.\n\n\"There's no truth I've signed the contract beyond the World Cup and my focus is on the Scotland team right now and hopefully up to the World Cup.\"\n\nNewcastle have signed 16 players for next season, including England scrum-half Raffi Quirke from Sale Sharks, New Zealand forward Hoskins Sotutu and Fiji winger Joji Nasova.\n\nScotland leave out Van der Merwe, Kinghorn & Graham\n\nAnalysis by BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English\n\n\"Speculation\" is an interesting word for Gregor Townsend to use regarding the report in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nHe hasn't signed a deal with anybody, he says. And it's all a tactic to disrupt Scotland before the Six Nations.\n\nSorry, but I'm not sure anybody is buying that one. Has he committed to signing a deal?\n\nHe hasn't exactly blown this story out of the water with \"speculation\" and obfuscation. There's probably a reason for that.\n\nThe report in the Daily Telegraph just supports everything we have heard on the grapevine.\n\nBut if Scotland start well in the Six Nations then what he does in 2027 is not going to have much of an impact. Nobody will care.\n\nIf they start badly then all sorts will get thrown at him in the here and now - distracted by his links with Red Bull and Newcastle and so on.\n\nScotland's rising star poised for sliding doors moment\n\n'Uncage the gorilla' - Schoeman knows what Scots must improve\n\nTownsend said form was behind the surprise selections in his back three for the Italy game in Rome on Saturday.\n\nDuhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham - Scotland's top two try-scorers - as well as British and Irish Lions Test full-back Blair Kinghorn have been omitted.\n\nTom Jordan will play at full-back with Glasgow Warriors wingers Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie on the flanks.\n\n\"Blair, Duhan and Darcy have had some terrific games for us and they're very proud playing for Scotland. But there is competition in that back three area as there is in other positions,\" said Townsend.\n\n\"We feel Jamie, Kyle, and Tom deserve their starts given how well they've been playing.\n\n\"Selection is about giving players opportunities and they've earned it. All three of them individually have taken games to the opposition, worked really hard at areas really important at Test level.\n\n\"But the three that weren't selected are quality players. How they've trained over the last few weeks will be positive for the future if and when they get back into the team.\"",

    "description": "With the T20 World Cup beginning on Saturday, BBC Sport looks at the trends and tactics from the global game that may play a part in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team explains what is behind the tensions at the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "fullText": "Merino is facing a prolonged spell on the sidelines after suffering a foot injury that requires surgery, with the length of his expected absence still unclear.\n\nSpeaking after Arsenal’s Carabao Cup semi final win over Chelsea on Tuesday night, Mikel Arteta confirmed the seriousness of the issue, telling beIN SPORTS, “With Merino, yeah, he’s going to be out for months unfortunately, with a foot injury.”\n\nWhile Arsenal have indicated they remain hopeful Merino could return before the end of the season, Zubimendi’s remarks following the same match suggested the situation may be more uncertain.\n\nSpeaking about his international team mate, he said, “Well, he’s in pain. He’s a very professional person, who takes care of himself and always thinks about what’s best for the club. I know he’s the one who’s most hurt, but the damage his injury has done to the club is significant.”\n\nZubimendi went on to acknowledge the challenge Merino faces in trying to recover in time for international duty. He said, “Well, he seems fine, but everyone’s different when they get home. I understand it’s harder than it looks. I know he’ll do everything he can to make it [to the national team], and if he doesn’t, it’ll be a real shame. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nWith the World Cup due to begin on 11 June, just over two weeks after the Premier League season ends on 24 May and six days after the Champions League final, the margin for recovery is tight.\n\nZubimendi’s comments underline concerns that Merino’s campaign may already be over, despite Arsenal’s hope that he could yet return before the season concludes.",

The French world champion is now indeed moving to Fenerbahçe. \"Giving up is not an option for us,\" the club initially tweeted before the transfer was officially announced two hours later.\n\nAfter the Turkish club had announced at noon that the deal had failed (you can read it again here), the transfer chaos is now complete. However, since the transfer window in Turkey is open longer, the transfer can still go through.\n\nKanté signs a contract until 2028 and is part of a swap deal. In return, Youssef En-Nesyri moves to Kanté's former club Al Ittihad. According to media reports, the Saudis are paying 15 million euros, and Kanté is moving to Istanbul on a free transfer.\n\nThe Frenchman is said to have previously refused to participate in training at Al Ittihad to force his transfer. He has now succeeded in doing so.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇩🇪 here.\n\n📸 Franco Arland - 2025 Getty Images",

    "fullText": "Earlier today, FC Barcelona officially announced that they were entering the bidding process to host the 2029 UEFA Champions League final at the renovated Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nSoon after, reports emerged claiming that the Blaugrana were also working behind the scenes to secure the hosting rights for the 2030 FIFA World Cup final at their stadium.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid are also in the race as they push to have the grand finale of the tournament played at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nNow, according to SPORT, Barcelona might have an edge over Real Madrid in their bid to host the 2030 World Cup final at the Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nThe 2030 World Cup will be jointly hosted by Portugal, Spain and Morocco. FIFA is currently assessing three main options for the final: Santiago Bernabeu, Spotify Camp Nou, and Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca, and will ultimately select one of these stadiums.\n\nIn this context, the Mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, reaffirmed the Catalan capital’s determination to compete to host the decisive match of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nBarcelona offers many attractions for FIFA and, although the Bernabeu appears to be the favourite, the city believes it has strong arguments to remain in contention.\n\nOne of the main elements boosting Barcelona’s chances is economic. Once the renovation is completed, the Spotify Camp Nou will have a capacity of 105,000 spectators, compared to the 84,000 seats at the Bernabeu, home of Real Madrid.\n\nThis represents a significant difference of 21,000 additional spectators. Ticket prices for major events have risen sharply in recent years. In the United States, for example, prices for the final at the MetLife Stadium on 19 July later this year have exceeded €3,000 per ticket.\n\nBased on average projections, FIFA believes it could generate more than €20 million in additional revenue if the final were held at Barcelona’s stadium rather than in Madrid. This is a substantial difference and one that could prove decisive in tipping the balance.\n\nCasablanca, for its part, is seen as less well-positioned due to the lack of the historical footballing weight associated with venues such as the Camp Nou or the Bernabeu.\n\nBarcelona and Madrid also enjoy advantages over Casablanca in terms of infrastructure and the location of their stadiums within the urban environment. The Hassan II Stadium is expected to be spectacular, but it will be located far from the city centre.\n\nHowever, Spanish cities are well established in hosting major international events, offering simpler and more reliable logistics.\n\nAdded to this is a strong footballing tradition, which FIFA is keen to highlight after recent World Cups awarded to emerging football nations such as Qatar and the United States.\n\nThe final decision will still take time, but Barcelona’s bid remains firm, as made clear by its mayor. The Catalan capital is not giving up, even if the spotlight currently appears to be focused on the Bernabeu.",

    "fullText": "Ireland captain Gaby Lewis says qualifying for the 2026 T20 World Cup means \"so much\" to the side after missing out on the tournament two years ago.\n\nLloyd Tennant's side booked their place at the global qualifiers in Nepal on Sunday thanks to their 62-run win over Thailand.\n\n\"We're all absolutely thrilled. Obviously there were some scars there from not qualifying for the last one,\" said Lewis\n\n\"That was tough for the girls, so there were a lot of nerves coming into the competition, but we felt really prepared. It obviously means so much.\"\n\nLewis was named batter of the tournament in Nepal after averaging 39 across Ireland's seven matches with her best knock 73 in a loss to Bangladesh.\n\nWhile much of Ireland's T20 successes in recent seasons have been anchored by the batting of the so-called 'Big Three' of Lewis, Orla Prendergast and Amy Hunter, World Cup qualification owed plenty to a bowling attack that limited the Netherlands and Thailand to 45 and 59 runs respectively in their Super Six wins.\n\n\"It was brilliant. You've got some great bowlers in our squad,\" added Lewis.\n\n\"It was brilliant to see different bowlers stand up in different games, it wasn't just the same bowler all through the tournament. It was a brilliant, all-round squad performance.\"",

I was nervous at the end but I backed the bowlers, that's what they train for - to nail those yorkers at the back end under pressure.\"\n\nEngland have won the U19 World Cup once - in 1998 - and were beaten finalists in 2022.

    "title": "Want to Support the Fight Against Fascism? Boycott Trump’s World Cup",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s Justice correspondent urges soccer lovers to stay away, takes on the attacks on Alex Pretti, and warns of a dangerous anti-voting bill.\n\nPeople are finally beginning to call for other countries to boycott Donald Trump’s upcoming World Cup—and not just usual suspects like me and The Nation’s Dave Zirin. Oke Göttlich, a powerful German soccer administrator, said that, in the wake of the execution of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the time has come to talk seriously about boycotting the tournament. Sepp Blatter, the former head of FIFA (the international governing committee of global soccer) suggested that fans shouldn’t travel to the tournament because of rising safety concerns in the United States.\n\nThis is going to sound weird to non–sports fans, but boycotting the World Cup is one of the most significant sanctions members of the international community can take against the United States right now. The World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world. The US has been begging to host a tournament for decades. This World Cup, which runs from early June through mid-July, is a perfect opportunity for the world to stand against this country’s fascist regime.\n\nIndeed, the fates have aligned to make this World Cup the perfect one to make a statement—for two reasons. The first is that more countries are involved: The tournament has expanded to 48 teams this year, up from 32 in previous years, which means that more people than ever will be involved in the proceedings—and possible protests. The second reason is that those 48 countries wouldn’t actually have to boycott the entire World Cup, because this year’s tournament is also being hosted by two other countries—Canada and Mexico. Teams could refuse to play in the US while happily playing in Canada or Mexico. It would be a powerful statement.\n\nThat statement won’t come from FIFA, however. FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations in the entire world, and its current president, Gianni Infantino, was last seen licking Trump’s boots and handing him a “peace prize.” Nor is it likely to come from the powerful soccer-playing countries in Western Europe. If France, Germany, and Great Britain were to pull out of the US portions of the tournament, many other countries would follow—but, sadly, the leaders of those nations appear eager to play Neville Chamberlain to Trump’s Hitler.\n\nTeams from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia could take a moral stand, but there are complications. Some of the teams involved are also run by repressive authoritarians. Others are financially dependent on FIFA and the World Cup to fund their soccer federations, while still others have entire economies beholden to the United States. On the other hand, a lot of those countries damn well know that if they did what the US is doing, they’d be boycotted and sanctioned and probably invaded by white people promising to restore “freedom” in exchange for all their oil and minerals. So it’s at least possible that some of them could take a moral stand. South Africa is in the tournament, and South Africa knows how to handle white people like Elon Musk.\n\nA boycott by all or some of the South American teams would make the whole tournament a joke. We know that the defending World Cup champion, Argentina, with its fascist-curious Trump-puppet president will show up (as will Ecuador, whose president is also friendly with our reigning despot), but some of the other nations that made the field—Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay—could be a different story. Their fans arguably face a real risk if they attend the matches. Could an American fan of, say, Colombia even go to a game without fear of being detained and deported by ICE, regardless of their actual citizenship status? Would a fan of Brazil feel safe traveling to the United States? The US is a clear and present danger to those people. If these soccer federations think about their fans, and the fact that their fans could be targeted by racist DHS agents, they might be convinced to do the right thing and boycott the US portions of the tournament.\n\nThe United States is an international pariah. It should be treated like one. Boycotting the World Cup is the obvious place to start.\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Ho Chi Minh\n\nThe New York Times released a video that purports to show an altercation between ICE and Alex Pretti a week before his murder. The video shows Pretti smashing the taillight of an ICE vehicle before the agents beat him up.\n\nThe Times (and right-wing cultists) seems to think this video proves that Pretti was a violent man who deserved to be executed without trial. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, who wrote the story for the Times, played the role of ICE water-carrier when he wrote, “The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse.”\n\nNo, you fascist-sympathizing fuck, the footage adds to what we know about ICE. In a court of law, that footage could be evidence of the motive behind ICE’s murder of that man. It could be evidence of premeditation. It potentially shows that Pretti was targeted by ICE for retribution and death. If federal agents had a preexisting “beef” with Pretti, if Pretti were known to people in the field and then they killed him, that’s compelling evidence that the killing was intentional.\n\nIt is common in our media to prosecute the victim. That’s what the Times (and Fox and the whole right-wing media echosphere) is trying to do now. But the people who should be on trial here are ICE. You show me a video where violent individuals had a prior altercation with a man, and then days later that man ends up getting shot in the back of the head, and I’m going to tell you that video is evidence of premeditated murder in the first degree.\n\nPerhaps I should tell The New York Times “thank you.” In their effort to smear Pretti, they may have just aggravated the charges against his murderers.\n\nI wrote about how Trump flinched in Minnesota, and that shows that the people are more powerful than the law or the opposition party ever will be.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLet me be clear, I do not want another social media platform. I can’t handle it. You young people have no idea how hard it is to keep switching up platforms. I’m old, so very old. I can barely frost the thermoplastic polyurethane on my screen protector.\n\nThat said, I will probably UpScrolled is the new competitor to TikTok that has been surging in popularity since TikTok’s US operations were formally taken over by Trump-adjacent business interests this week. It was created by Issam Hijazi, whom Al Jazeera describes as a “Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian entrepreneur.” That’s a pretty big demographic contrast to Larry Ellison, the Benjamin Netanyahu buddy (and, you know, founder of Oracle and one of the three richest people alive) who acquired a large stake in TikTok once it was forced into US hands.\n\nTikTok users are (rightly) worried about censorship on the new TikTok, and a silencing of any views that don’t support fascism and genocide. It’s a valid concern, considering what Elon Musk has done to Twitter. UpScrolled is to TikTok as BlueSky is to Twitter, or so the story goes.\n\nSo I’ll probably join. But I really don’t want to. I don’t want to join anything else. Goddamnit, I miss my Tumblr account.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "As marauding state agents fill US streets, a leading German soccer official says countries should consider what was once unthinkable: skipping the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThis week, a leading German soccer official, Oke Göttlich, said that the time has come to consider the unthinkable: a boycott of the World Cup to protest Donald J. Trump’s United States. The most watched sporting event on earth is due to be played this year in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and Göttlich said in a Friday interview, before a federal agent murdered Minneapolis VA nurse Alex Pretti, that “the time has come” to “seriously consider and discuss this.” Göttlich was responding not only to state agents marauding US streets but also to Trump’s military threats against Greenland and the people of Europe, which have shattered old alliances. However specious these alliances may have been, the alternative that Trump is advancing is a new world order of unchecked US aggression, where the ghoulish Stephen Miller feels free to call for occupation and bloodshed.\n\nGöttlich is no lightweight. He is one of the German federation’s 10 vice presidents and the president of the Bundesliga club St. Pauli. Folks may know St. Pauli as a proudly left-wing, openly anti-fascist team whose fans generally align with what Göttlich is putting forward, although calling for a boycott goes beyond what any European soccer power broker has done. It moves the “Overton window” as to where this discussion could go. Göttlich was pressed by a reporter about the St. Pauli players on the German national team and whether he felt like he was undercutting their personal and national ambitions. Göttlich replied, “The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host. What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”\n\nIt is actually past time to have this discussion. Ten long months ago, I wrote a piece with Jules Boykoff titled, “With ICE Out of Control, How Can the US Cohost the 2026 World Cup?” It was a call for countries outside of the United States to boycott. We did not know at the time that the US would threaten war on European soil, abduct world leaders, blow fisher-folk out of the ocean, kidnap 5-year-olds, and execute US citizens in the streets. And yet even 10 months ago, in the aftermath of the ICE kidnappings of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk and the revelations that the US was sending people to labor camps in El Salvador, it was clear that the direction of this country would be toward fascist violence.\n\nOur argument was that countries were being deeply irresponsible by not warning their citizens that traveling to the United States would be perilous and not just for them: players, coaches, and their families would all be at risk. Now even FIFA former chief, that monument to corruption Sepp Blatter, is saying that it could be dangerous for fans to travel to the United States. But Göttlich is taking it to the next level by challenging nations to stay home. FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, has witnessed its chief, Gianni Infantino, affect a weak and bent posture when in Trump’s presence. During Trump’s second term, Infantino has visited the White House more than any foreign leader and presented Trump with that tacky FIFA Peace Prize. Infantino might feel like a world leader when paraded around by Trump like a hairless poodle, but his subservience to Trump has created an opportunity for Göttlich to be a real leader.\n\n“As organizations and society, we’re forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values,” Göttlich said. “Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from [German soccer chief] Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.”\n\nWhile Göttlich cited the 1980 Olympic boycott of Moscow following their invasion of Afghanistan, a far better historical comparison comes from his own backyard: the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler used these games to normalize his Nazi regime and project himself as a leader among world leaders. We can, of course, look back at that Olympics and revel in classic sports moments like Jesse Owens winning four gold medals and ruining Hitler’s dreams of Aryan supremacy.\n\nBut the deeper story of those games is the shameful decision of countries to travel to Berlin to play for the entertainment of their fascist hosts in the first place. This is not hindsight. There were explosive debates across the globe, particularly the United States, about competing in a Germany already imprisoning dissidents and Jews, burning books, and building a military arsenal for territorial expansion. Organizations like the NAACP agitated for a US boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union, by a sliver of a vote, ignored their pleas as well as the arguments of others and sent US athletes to compete. These decisions now look obscene. Göttlich is offering countries a way to avoid being depicted as cowards, quislings, or villains in the eyes of history. Countries should boycott the World Cup games scheduled to be played in the United States. Ten months ago, they needed to do it for the safety of their own fans. Now they must act for the safety of the rest of us.\n\nOne last note: I went to college in the Twin Cities. I still have many friends in the area. My anger at watching Trump send killers to fill the streets of Minneapolis is personal, but the people there have bravely shown that such state violence will be met with a response. Minnesotans aren’t Gianni Infantino. Their backs are not bent, and if you ask them to kiss Trump’s ring, they will bite that finger to the bone.",

    "fullText": "In the months after England finally achieved their World Cup dream, centre Meg Jones wondered what challenges remained in her rugby career.\n\nJones, who was the team's vice-captain, was nominated for the player of the tournament award after a series of standout displays in the Red Roses' march to an emotional triumph.\n\n\"After the World Cup, I thought that was it, like I've won it now, I've won rugby. What more is there to do?\" Jones told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The comedown was surreal. Obviously there was good stuff, but you also get massively overwhelmed. It's crazy the adrenaline and all the highs you're on.\n\n\"So I was a bit like, what's going to make me drive, and what's going to create the spark again?\"\n\nIn January, at the Red Roses' first get-together since lifting the World Cup in September, head coach John Mitchell provided that spark.\n\nThe New Zealander challenged his World Cup winners to take their games to new levels to give themselves the best possible chance of making the squad for the historic British and Irish Lions women's tour in 2027.\n\n\"Mitch is unbelievable the way he thinks,\" added Jones, who was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours list. \"The passion and drive just radiates off him.\n\n\"I'm feeling more motivated now, that there's something that we can keep pushing on for.\n\n\"I'm only 29 and it's given a bit of spring to my step.\n\n\"Playing for the Lions is not something I've ever dreamed of really. I've played for Great Britain at the Olympics so I understand that whole camaraderie, bringing all the nations together, and I love that side of things. It's exciting, for sure.\"\n\nEngland have dominated the Women's Six Nations, winning 21 of the 30 editions, and will start their bid for a fifth successive Grand Slam in April.\n\nBut the Red Roses have only won three World Cups to New Zealand's six and have never won two in a row, something Mitchell wants his players to rectify.\n\n\"We had a lot of young girls in that squad who were probably going 'wow, I'm feeling fresh' but the rest of the girls were like 'we've just won a World Cup, we've never done back to back, so what's going to really drive us to do that?' said Jones.\n\n\"Even just looking at the trophy, the amount of times New Zealand's name is on there, you're like, 'I want to override that a little bit'. I want to be part of that legacy.\"",

    "fullText": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed a proposed fan boycott of World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad.\n\nBlatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability of the United States as a host country. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported Mark Pieth's comments in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.\n\nPieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.\n\nIn his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, “If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”\n\nIn his X post, Blatter quoted Pietha and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.\n\nThe international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis.\n\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.\n\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "description": "The International Football Association Board plan to introduce a couple of major refereeing changes at this summer’s World Cup, according to a report.Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty ImagesThe Internatio...",
    "fullText": "The International Football Association Board (IFAB) held their annual business meeting earlier this week, and they approved a few ideas for implementation at the World Cup this summer.\n\nMany of the changes focus on timewasting, with the BBC reporting that IFAB plan to introduce a countdown for goal-kicks and throw-ins, similar to the countdown that currently exists when goalkeepers have the ball in their hands.\n\nJust like with the current rule, if a player fails to put the ball back into play before the countdown ends, possession will switch to the opponent. Goal-kicks will become corners, a throw-in for one team will become a throw-in for the other. But it’s unclear exactly how long the countdown will last.\n\nIn another rule change, substituted players must leave the pitch in 10 seconds, otherwise their replacement won’t be able to come on immediately and the team making the sub will have to temporarily play with 10 players.\n\nA third change is that players who leave the field with an injury will also have to stay off for an extended period. Again, it’s not yet clear exactly how long, with the Premier League currently requiring a 30-second absence and the MLS requiring two minutes.\n\nThe last major changes are to VAR. Firstly, all corners will be reviewed by VAR at the World Cup, with IFAB believing the checks will almost always be complete before the kick is taken.\n\nSecondly, VAR can overturn a second yellow card if one is clearly incorrectly awarded (but it can’t recommend giving a second yellow if the referee doesn’t award one on-field).\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case that all of these changes will make it into domestic football next season. The VAR system itself was introduced at the 2018 World Cup, but it wasn’t brought in by the Premier League until 2019/20.\n\nBut any changes that work well on football’s biggest stage will undoubtedly lead to calls for the Premier League to implement them too.",

    "description": "The partnership with the tech giant speaks to a push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind",
    "fullText": "Partnership with tech giant speaks to push to engage younger fans but also has wider strategic goals in mind\n\nIn this World Cup year, Fifa has come out of the blocks quickly. In the past few weeks any number of initiatives have been announced or activated, from a data partnership with Opta to facilitate more betting, to the Fifa Pass for speeding up visa applications for the US this summer, to the unveiling of the official Lego World Cup trophy. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament.\n\nIn Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok’s global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can’t get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable for TikTok users.\n\nIn choosing TikTok as its preferred platform Fifa is catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. The NFL has integrated creators (quick definition: online personalities who make their living from posting on social media) into coverage of the Super Bowl since the turn of the decade. But the full possibilities of the creator economy are only beginning to be explored by sports organisations.\n\nLast summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa’s Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to the Chelsea v Palmeiras game on time.\n\n“It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. “We searched through people who had strong organic followings on places like Instagram and TikTok, and who had a history of a high volume of posting consistency around not just the sport of soccer, but also the culture of it. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.”\n\nFrom there, Caporoso’s team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. Dazn and Whistle tracked the performance of each post, monitored the traffic that went back to Dazn’s coverage, and discussed the outcomes with TikTok.\n\nThis is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. It gives a clue to one reason why creators are coming to the fore in sports coverage. Not only are they generally younger, part of a demographic sports leaders are anxious to attract, not only are they trusted by their audience due to a perceived authenticity, but creators are comfortable working in a media environment where the demands of the client come first. Their productivity can be off the charts. They perform, they shoot, they edit, they strike promotional deals, they post regularly and often. They are, in Caporoso’s words, “one-person companies”.\n\nTikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn’s service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. It could be a way of expanding the reach of sponsorship deals Fifa has elsewhere. It establishes a relationship with a tech giant who may yet be tempted into paying for broadcast rights more broadly. Finally, the new platform could also provide a means for shaping the way the World Cup is talked about.\n\nInstead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It’s a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. A Maga enthusiast and marketer of Trump Derangement Syndrome merchandise, she flattered the US president and Fifa while celebrating the success of the tournament.\n\nCreators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. “In our data, we see that the viewership of traditional TV by the 16-to-34 age group has collapsed over the past 10 years, but not in sports,” he says. “That’s because sports is unique. It’s live, and there’s no alternative.”\n\nReports in the US have suggested the picture is complicated somewhat by traditional broadcasters having acquired the rights Fifa wants to share with influencers. According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. In the UK the BBC and ITV jointly hold rights to linear and digital broadcasts. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations.\n\nGodard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn). Whatever the outcome, it may be just that creators have the power to disrupt the media environment that has made Fifa decide to embrace them.",

    "fullText": "Maybe Fifa president Gianni Infantino just thought he was making a light-hearted quip.\n\nReferencing concerns about this year's World Cup in north America and criticism in the build-up to Qatar 2022, Infantino said: \"For the first time in history, also, no Brit was arrested during a World Cup.\"\n\nTo laughter at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, he added: \"Imagine. This is something really, really special.\"\n\nUnderstandably the comments angered the Football Supporters' Association, which accused Infantino of making \"cheap jokes\" about England fans.\n\nThe terminology \"Brits\" may well have annoyed fans from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland too.\n\nA lot has been done to try to repair England's name at major tournaments after it hit one of its lowest points on the international stage at Euro 2000. That was after a long history of hooliganism.\n\nSo what do the World Cup statistics show? Was the lack of arrests in Qatar unusual? Was this how England fans are still seen internationally or just a low blow?",

That shouldn't be forgotten,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Did we have a drink when we were allowed to? Yes. Did we work hard and train when it was scheduled? Of course.\"\n\nKiely also questioned the idea that the team were left to train without footballs.\n\n\"We definitely had footballs, because otherwise we wouldn't have got sessions done.\"\n\nAlthough Kiely remembers that the facilities could have been better, he said they were \"definitely not Sunday league level\".",

    "fullText": "World Cup 2026 ticket holders can now access priority visa appointments for travel to the United States - but doubt remains whether fans from every country to have qualified will be able to enter.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System - or Fifa Pass - announced by US President Donald Trump in November, went live on Tuesday.\n\nIt was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament.\n\nBut the US State Department has stressed that a Fifa Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, with all ticket holders having to \"undergo thorough security screening and vetting\".\n\nMost citizens of countries under the US visa waiver programme, which covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days, so do not need to use the Fifa Pass. Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament. America's safety and the security of our borders will always come first.\"",

    "fullText": "Fulham are battling Wolfsburg and Real Betis in the race to sign Troy Parrott following his huge impact in the Republic of Ireland’s quest to qualify for the World Cup 2026.\n\nSo far, the trio are the clubs that have gone in strongest in what is expected to be a wide race for the AZ Alkmaar forward over the next few months.\n\nThe 23-year-old's profile exploded after the five goals against Portugal and Hungary that sent Heimir Hallgrimsson’s side into a World Cup play-off.\n\nBut that was only on the back of burgeoning development that had made a series of clubs around the Premier League and European football take note of his impact in the Netherlands.\n\nWolfsburg have talked about a €20m (£17.4m) deal, but it is understood that AZ would want even more. Fulham have so far shown the strongest interest from the Premier League.\n\nHaving energised his career at AZ, though, Parrott is understood to want to be very considerate about his next steps. While the forward does want to return to the Premier League at some point - he initially came through the Tottenham Hotspur system - any English move would have to fully make sense for both his current position and future prospects, which is why he is happy to stay in Europe.\n\nThe Bundesliga is an appealing option, particularly with the way the competition has proven so successful in developing young talent.\n\nAway from his prolific run for his country, Parrott has hit nine goals in 13 Eredivisie games, with 10 more goals this term in Conference League qualifiers and the KNVB Cup.\n\nParrott is tied fourth in the Eredivisie top scorer standings, with Ayase Ueda clear with 18 goals in as many games for Feyenoord.",

This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.\n\nSenegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mane scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaounde.\n\n\"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it,\" Regragui told reporters on Saturday.\n\nHe has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.\n\n\"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final,\" he added.\n\n\"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history.\"\n\nHe added: \"Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable.\"\n\nMorocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence which has conceded only once.\n\nBeing at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.\n\nThe Senegalese Football Federation complained about a \"lack of adequate security\" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans \"which put the players and staff at risk\".\n\nIt also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Sale.\n\n\"What happened was not normal,\" said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nMane, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.\n\nBut Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree,\" said Thiaw.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible,\" added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.\n\nOff the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs, the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",
