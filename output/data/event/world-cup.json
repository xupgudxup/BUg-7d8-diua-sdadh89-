    "description": "Muddled selection and the lack of a plan B - how Australia's T20 World Cup campaign was derailed in Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "After Monday's resounding defeat by Sri Lanka took World Cup fate out of his side's hands, Australia captain Mitchell Marsh asked for the luck of the Irish to kick in.\n\nThe following day, Ireland were due to take on Zimbabwe in Pallekele. Any points for the African side would knock Australia out of the competition.\n\nClearly, no-one told Marsh that when it comes to Irish luck in a cricketing context, rain is never far away. The two sides shared the points after wet weather saw the match abandoned without a ball bowled. Zimababwe through, Australia gone.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, there will not be an Australian side in the Super 8s stage or equivalent. Since winning it in 2021, this edition marks a third consecutive T20 World Cup without Australia in the semi-finals.\n\nLess than a month on from wrapping up a resounding Ashes drubbing, Australia's T20 side has failed to hit similar heights. The failings of this competition, which has seen them play all of their group games in Sri Lanka, alongside a wider slump in this format, does little to discard the notion that T20 cricket is not a priority.\n\nAs always after a difficult tournament, selection is questioned. Steve Smith has long been out of this side, not appearing in almost two years. A century and two 50s in the recent Big Bash were not enough to earn a recall. Not until Marsh was hit in the groin in training prior to Australia's first game against Ireland.\n\nSmith was summoned to acclimatise in Colombo in case he was required. He ultimately was, but not as a replacement for Marsh.\n\nAustralia's Test run machine eventually earned a place in the squad proper when the selectors belatedly named a replacement for Josh Hazlewood, who was ruled out of the competition before a ball was bowled.\n\nAll those moving parts for a player who only made it onto the park as a sub fielder while Australia were still mathematically alive, with Smith powerless to stop Sri Lanka and Pathum Nissanka's charge.\n\nThe decision to drop Matthew Renshaw for that defeat also reads as confusing. His 37 off 33 balls against Ireland was slow, but the Ireland camp highlighted how impressed they were given the tricky nature of the pitch. Next time out, Renshaw's 65 off 44 fell short of match-winning status against Zimbabwe.\n\nDropping him against Sri Lanka backfired. After Travis Head and Marsh's opening partnership of 104 off 8.3 overs, Australia looked well set. They lost the next three wickets for 26 runs, the middle order appearing to lack the stability previously provided by Renshaw.\n\n\"The reaction back home has been rather heavy because I think we've been sold down the stream a little bit in terms of our selection and how we've gone about preparing for this T20 World Cup,\" Australia's two-time 50-over World Cup winner Matthew Hayden told Test Match Special.\n\n\"It sort of smacks of England, and their questions in the Ashes preparation - this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of 'we're OK' and 'no, don't worry'. It's a mix of denial and maybe even just mismanagement.\n\n\"We enjoy coming to countries like Sri Lanka but we just haven't prepared for what we've seen. We've picked power hitters in finesse type conditions.\n\n\"[It's] almost like stubbornness but there is a plan A. And that plan A is called power. And it's a day and age of power. In India, that's certainly the case.\n\n\"These conditions [in Sri Lanka], though, are different. They're not such pure batting surfaces, and that requires methodology. It almost requires a bit more of an old school approach and way of thinking about the game that allows you to stay in the contest.\"\n\nAustralia's fast-bowling depth behind the big three of Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc looks strong in red-ball cricket. Just ask England.\n\nIn white-ball cricket, though, it's a different story. Starc has retired from the format while Cummins and Hazelwood are injured. It says plenty that, instead of calling up a bowler immediately once the latter went down, they waited until mid-tournament to call up Smith, a batter.\n\nWord from within the camp refuses to dwell too much on muddled selection or lack of depth.\n\n\"Looking down our list, honestly, it feels like there's more than enough talent to look after the situations in the games that we're playing,\" said Marsh after the Sri Lanka defeat.\n\n\"As much as we can talk about team line-up and who's in, who's out and that sort of thing, I think if everyone just looks after their role it should help [put] us in good stead.\"\n\nAll-rounder Cameron Green, who became the Indian Premier League's most expensive overseas signing when he was picked up for more than £2m by Kolkata Knight Riders in December, was criticised by Hayden having struggled to make an impact despite batting at number three.\n\n\"Cam Green has just looked awful with the bat,\" said Hayden. \"He looks woody, he looks tinny, he looks like he's just a man with no confidence, and I'd be very surprised if that's not exactly the case.\n\n\"Matt Renshaw has come with no baggage to this tournament. He actually had a really good series back home in Australia in the ODIs. He's been a man that's been very ill treated - there's no doubt he should be in the Test team too.\"\n\nThere is a wider question on Australia's cultural attitudes towards T20.\n\nWhile Big Bash crowds are healthy, this tournament has taken place at a difficult time for fans back home to watch. Only one Australian journalist has travelled to cover the team in Sri Lanka, reflecting how editors view the levels of public interest.\n\nIn that context, it seems easy to question to what extent this competition has been prioritised. Even if injuries ruled out players such as Cummins and Hazlewood, other senior players were told to prioritise the Big Bash finals instead of heading on the warm-up tour to Pakistan prior to this week's failing.\n\n\"Cricket Australia needs to have a look at their schedule, and they need to be able to manage their number one and primary resource, which is cricket talent,\" said Hayden.\n\n\"[They need to] find a way to just be a little more controlled, and a little more destined and built towards the purpose of Australian cricket.\"\n\nBefore that, however, Australia have one match remaining in this competition, against Oman on Friday.\n\nA dead rubber, the kind of match usually more associated with England in the Ashes.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Ireland and Australia have both been eliminated from the T20 World Cup as rain prevented play in the Group B game between the Irish and Zimbabwe at Pallekele Cricket Stadium in Kandy.\n\nZimbabwe's shock victory over Australia left them needing just a point on Tuesday to advance to the Super 8s with the match being a must-win for Ireland to retain any hope of advancing.\n\nAustralia, who suffered an eight-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka on Monday, were also banking on a win for Ireland to remain in the hunt for the next phase.\n\nBut with the rain unrelenting in Kandy the match was abandoned with both Ireland and Zimbabwe taking a point apiece.\n\nThat left Zimbabwe on five points and Ireland - whose four-game campaign is complete - on three, with Australia sitting on two and just one game remaining against Oman on Friday (13:30 GMT) which is now a dead rubber.\n\n\"It's very disappointing to go out in this fashion but it's completely uncontrollable,\" said Ireland stand-in skipper Lorcan Tucker.\n\n\"It looked like we were building momentum with the Oman win but unfortunately it came too late.\n\n\"I think when we look back there were moments, especially in the first game against Sri Lanka, which we didn't get quite right. It just wasn't to be - we started a bit slower than we wanted.\n\n\"Our group gained great experience from the tournament, for many it was their first World Cup. It's really competitive and shows the pressure elite cricketers are under.\n\n\"Those big moments, it's how you deal with them and process them. We hope to have big moments in the next couple of years and prepare well for the next tournament.\"\n\nZimbabwe will take on Sri Lanka in Colombo on Thursday (09:30 GMT) with the winner topping Group B, but they are both guaranteed a place in the next phase of the tournament.",

    "fullText": "Oli Burke insists he has given little thought to a Scotland recall for the World Cup and is simply focusing on doing well for Union Berlin in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe 28-year-old joined Union on a long-term contract in the summer and has scored four goals this season, including a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\n\"I'm just focused on my football here and what happens, happens really,\" Burke, who earned the last of his 13 caps in 2020, said.\n\n\"I've not really thought too much on it. Obviously, I know there's a World Cup coming up, but I've not really been a part of it recently.\n\n\"I'm not really expecting anything. I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying football again, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n\"If I can, hopefully, do some good performances, score some more goals and hopefully that is catching the eye a little bit and gives me a chance, at least.\n\n\"Obviously, it's an absolute honour to wear the badge and represent your country. It's such a privilege. Obviously, I would really love that again and to have that experience again.\n\n\"I cannot think too much on that. I have to just stay focused and do the best I can here and see what happens.\"\n\nBurke is in his third spell in Germany, having made his first move to the Bundesliga in 2016, when he joined RB Leipzeg from Nottingham Forest for what was then a record fee for a Scottish player of £13m.\n\n\"I was young, the price tag, I didn't really know too much about it,\" he recalled. \"I didn't really understand it so much at that age. As I got older, it started to weigh a little bit.\n\n\"In football, everything happens quickly. You have your good moments and then there can be bad moments.\n\n\"It's been kind of like this throughout my career. Many ups and many downs.\"\n\nBurke, who joined Union from Werder Bremen, says the experience he has in Germany has developed him.\n\n\"I almost feel like a different player, but obviously that comes with maturing,\" he said. \"Knowing your job better and being more effective in your role, defensively as well.\n\n\"It's just about adapting really.\"\n\nIn 2019, Burke had a spell on loan to Celtic, who play Stuttgart on Thursday in the Europa League play-off, and he is predicting a difficult tie for his former club.\n\n\"Stuttgart are not an easy team,\" he said. \"They're doing brilliantly this season.\n\n\"Celtic are an amazing club. I love the club. I still watch here and there.\n\n\"I watched the Kilmarnock game the other day. I was saying to my wife 'they're going to score in the last minute' because it's just Celtic typical.\"\n\nKirkcaldy-born Burke also had a stint with Alaves in Spain after his time with Celtic.\n\n\"When you move abroad, it's also important to try and embed yourself into the culture quickly and become close with your team-mates as fast as you can,\" he added.\n\n\"Create a bond, not just on the pitch but off it as well, so that you feel more comfortable and you feel more at home.\"",

    "fullText": "England captain Leah Williamson returns to the squad for the first time since Euro 2025 as they prepare to begin their 2027 Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWilliamson, 28, missed England's friendly victories over China, Ghana and Australia as well as their defeat by Brazil at the end of 2025 due to a knee injury.\n\nThe Arsenal defender had surgery after lifting England's second successive European title in July and returned to action at the start of December.\n\n\"I'm very happy. It feels really good for her too. She has trained lots and I'm in close contact with her and the club,\" said manager Sarina Wiegman.\n\n\"There are more players who are still building and that is one of the reasons why we went with a bigger squad.\"\n\nSeveral big names return to the squad including Chelsea forward Lauren James, Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\n\nJames, 24, was absent for four months with an ankle injury before returning in November and is now back to full fitness.\n\nShe impressed in Sunday's win over Liverpool and boosts Wiegman's attacking options with Arsenal's Beth Mead out with a fractured shin.\n\nGreenwood, 32, missed the start of the season with a knee injury while Hampton had a thigh issue which ruled her out of the November camp.\n\nThere is a first senior call-up for London City Lionesses defender Poppy Pattinson, while uncapped 20-year-old Freya Godfrey retains her place in the squad.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck also earns a recall, with Manchester City's Khiara Keating dropping out of the squad.\n\n\"[Roebuck] came in the last camp of course because we had some injuries. She has got some minutes [with Villa] so it's really good to see her back, see her happy and being available. She is playing and training fully,\" added Wiegman.\n\n\"Keating will be with the under-23s. We all know she is a very talented goalkeeper. I had big concerns about her playing minutes over this last season.\n\n\"It's a long period of time. There is also competition with the other goalkeepers.\"\n\nGotham FC defender Jess Carter is back after she was given time to recover from the conclusion of the National Women's Soccer League play-offs in November.\n\nEngland are without Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, who is out with a hip injury until the end of March.\n\nBay FC defender Anouk Denton, 22, who made her debut as a late substitute in December, is not included in the squad.\n\nThe Lionesses travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThey are the first competitive games since England's success in Switzerland and they will meet reigning world champions Spain later in their qualifying group.\n\nThere are eight international windows before England hope to travel to Brazil for the World Cup between 24 June and 25 July 2027.\n\n\"It's a new year with new objectives as we start our qualification journey with these two very important fixtures against Ukraine and Iceland,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"This is new opposition for this England team, so that's exciting too. I am looking forward to being back with the squad and getting back to work.\"\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nLondon City Lionesses defender Pattinson has featured for England's youth teams and is the latest to make the jump up to the senior squad.\n\nShe follows in the footsteps of team-mate Godfrey, who is yet to make her debut having been selected for the friendlies against Ghana and China.\n\nWiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to watch Pattinson in London City Lionesses' 2-1 defeat by Manchester United and delivered the news of her England call-up this week.\n\n\"It was a short conversation but she was really happy and really grateful. She can't wait to come in so that was a nice phone call,\" Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"She deserved the call-up because she has played really well. What we have seen the most is that she is very proactive and takes a lot of initiative.\n\n\"She can cover the whole wing on the left side. At the same time, she wants to play forward and is looking for passes forward which I thought was really good.\n\n\"Although she is not the tallest, she does use her body well in defence. Let's see how she relates to the other players we have in the squad.\"\n\nGoalkeepers: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride), Ellie Roebuck (Aston Villa)\n\nDefenders: Lucy Bronze (Chelsea), Jess Carter (Gotham), Grace Fisk (Liverpool), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Manchester United), Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit), Taylor Hinds (Arsenal), Poppy Pattinson (London City Lionesses), Leah Williamson (Arsenal)\n\nMidfielders: Grace Clinton (Manchester City), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Keira Walsh (Chelsea), Laura Blindkilde Brown (Manchester City), Lucia Kendell (Aston Villa)\n\nForwards: Chloe Kelly (Arsenal), Lauren James (Chelsea), Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea), Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Lauren Hemp (Manchester City), Freya Godfrey (London City Lionesses), Jess Park (Manchester United)",

    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

    "fullText": "England narrowly avoided a disaster in their final T20 World Cup group match against Italy on Monday.\n\nHarry Brook won the toss and controversially decided to bat first at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.\n\nEngland were 105/5 after a shaky opening 13 overs before Will Jacks rescued the innings with an unbeaten 53 from 22 balls.\n\nItaly then battled back from 22/3 to 135/4 in their run chase, making the England players and fans nervous.\n\nHowever, the Italians ultimately collapsed to 178 all out, and the Three Lions qualified for the Super 8s.\n\nBrook made an interesting comment about England’s performance in his post-match interview, which many will disagree with.\n\nHarry Brook has every reason to be pleased with his team’s progression into the last eight of the competition.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to suggest that England’s performance against Italy was anything to be proud of.\n\nItaly are the 26th-ranked team in the ICC T20I Team Rankings, so it should never have been a close contest.\n\nThat is why it was so surprising to hear Brook’s claim that England bowled well on Monday.\n\n“I thought we fielded excellently, and we bowled nicely as well,” he said. “I never had a doubt at the end with Sam [Curran] and Jamie [Overton]. Sam has been awesome, and he has been throughout this comp so far.\n\n“When Jof is on a heater, you want to get as much out of as possible – he did that today in his first couple of overs.”\n\nWithout question, England will need to bowl much better in the next stage of the tournament if they want to make the semi-finals.\n\nWhile Brook praised England’s bowlers, he did recognise that their batting unit must improve quickly.\n\n“We haven’t played our best cricket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we have made it through, and we’re heading to Sri Lanka, so we can be happy about that.\n\n“A little bit of a trend in this competition. We have not managed to string along the score as we like to do as a batting unit. We have got to keep on being brave and taking our options.”\n\n202 would normally be an excellent T20 score, but England would have hoped for at least 220 against cricket minnows Italy.\n\nBen Stokes finally has a rude awakening about importance of helmets in cricket\n\nMatthew Renshaw’s scathing interview reveals main culprit behind Australia’s disastrous loss vs. Zimbabwe\n\nSir Geoffrey Boycott reignites Joe Root debate after England’s T20 World Cup loss to West Indies",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Pallekele\n\nAustralia 181 all out (20 overs): Head 56 (29); Hemantha 3-37\n\nSri Lanka 184-2 (18 overs): Nissanka 100* (52), Kusal Mendis 51 (38)\n\nAustralia's hopes of reaching the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup are all but over after Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka hit a brilliant unbeaten 100 to condemn them to an eight-wicket defeat in Pallekele.\n\nStunned by Zimbabwe in their second outing on Friday, Australia needed a win to keep their qualification fate in their own hands but it is Sri Lanka who march into the next round.\n\nFor Australia to sneak through as the second-placed team from their group, they now need Zimbabwe to lose both of their remaining matches against Ireland and Sri Lanka and then to defeat Oman themselves which would bring net run-rate into play.\n\nAustralia's predicament came from their inability to convert a good start from their openers Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh as they set the home side a target of 182 after a collapse in the second half of their innings.\n\nDespite the feeling Sri Lanka could have a complicated chase on their hands because of a pitch which was slowing down, they eased to victory with the Australian bowling attack lacking any bite in the absence of injured Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.\n\nAnd the Sri Lanka duo of Nissanka and Kusal Mendis took full advantage.\n\nWith wicketkeeper Mendis providing perfect support with a composed 51 from 38 balls, Nissanka brought up his century in 52 balls to take his side past the finish line with an innings that blended brute power and finesse.\n\nAustralia had Marsh return after recovering from a groin injury that forced him out of the first two matches and the returning skipper gave his side a solid platform batting alongside Head, who hit a long-overdue half-century off 27 balls.\n\nThey powered Australia to 104-0 in 8.2 overs before Head departed for 59 and it marked the beginning of dramatic downturn.\n\nMarsh followed him shortly after with a brisk 54 as they unravelled alarmingly to be bundled out for 181, losing their final five wickets in the space of just seven runs and 14 balls.\n\nWith Sri Lanka chasing down the target with ease, the Australians are left clinging to only the slimmest mathematical hope and will watch nervously as Zimbabwe face Ireland on Tuesday.\n\nIt looked as though Sri Lanka's chase of 182 might slip away early when Kusal Perera fell to Marcus Stoinis only eight balls in.\n\nBut it became clear almost immediately Nissanka was operating on an entirely different level in Pallekele, playing \"an innings for the ages,\" as Test Match Special commentator Daniel Norcross labelled it.\n\nNissanka raced to 38 off 20 balls to lift Sri Lanka to 61‑1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nKusal Mendis then picked up the pace against Australia's spinners, bringing up his third consecutive half-century of this T20 World Cup in 35 balls before Nissanka joined him, reaching his fifty in just 32 deliveries.\n\nAustralia would have hoped for a way back after Mendis departed in the 13th over with Sri Lanka on 105‑2, and though Pavan Rathnayake walked in, he only needed to play second fiddle to Nissanka, who effortlessly took Sri Lanka past the target.\n\nThe 27‑year‑old Sri Lanka opener was outstanding in manipulating the leg‑side field all game, scoring 26 runs through mid‑wicket and another 20 through square leg.\n\nBut he mixed brutal hitting with plenty of finesse too, guiding 15 runs down to third with some deft late cuts.\n\nAdding extra sweetness to Nissanka's day was an extraordinary catch he took to dismiss Glenn Maxwell and keep Australia at bay in the closing stages of their innings.\n\nHaving dropped Maxwell in the previous over, Nissanka more than made up for it with a brilliant flying catch at backward point to send back the Australia all-rounder, who had looked dangerous.\n\nThough there will be concern for pacer Matheesha Pathirana, who walked off with an injury, Sri Lanka will fancy their chances of putting on a good show in the Super 8s and making it to the semi-finals, with both Nissanka and Mendis in good form.\n\nAustralia captain Mitchell Marsh: \"I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark but with the start we had, maybe a few short. Well played to Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We know that at our best we can make big scores but we lost our way a little bit at the end and Sri Lanka bowled well. Not much more to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us.\n\n\"It's a devastated group. We are in the lap of gods now. We haven't been at our best. We will watch the Zimbabwe vs Ireland game and hope.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka: \"One of the best performances in the recent times. Really happy with how the proceedings went.\n\n\"We were still very positive after losing [Pathirana] in the powerplay. We had the confidence and knew about the wicket. Each and every one showed a good body language today. And everyone wanted to contribute somehow.\n\n\"We hope to continue like this in the tournament. It's wonderful to qualify after many years. It's a good team. We should go to the next round and hopefully make to the semis. Thanks to the massive crowd today.\"\n\nNissanka's century leads Sri Lanka to victory and puts Australia on brink - as it happened\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers",

    "fullText": "England remain just as confident they can win the T20 World Cup despite their unconvincing group-stage performances, says batter Will Jacks.\n\nHarry Brook's side qualified for the Super 8 stage by beating Italy on Monday but were again pushed by a lower-ranked side.\n\nThey began their tournament edging past Nepal in a final-ball finish and then lost to West Indies before coming through a nervy encounter with Scotland.\n\n\"Winning like that can only be good for you,\" said Jacks, whose 53 not out was crucial in lifting England to 202-7.\n\n\"We've got a lot of stuff we can get better at but coming into today, my own personal expectation and desire is we want to win easily. We don't want it to be that close and feel those nerves.\n\n\"But, going forward, it's more experience and we can never have enough of that.\"\n\nEngland progress at World Cup despite Italy scare\n\n'England have no chance at T20 World Cup if they do not improve'\n\nJofra Archer took two wickets in the first over of Italy's chase but Ben Menenti smashed 60 from 25 balls and Grant Stewart 45 from 22 to give Italy real hope.\n\nWith Stewart at the crease, the tournament's lowest-ranked side needed 30 runs from the final two overs for an almighty upset.\n\nThat England came through is obviously a positive. Sam Curran, who also defended 10 from the last over against Nepal, dismissed Stewart in the penultimate over.\n\nHe admitted there have been nerves throughout the initial group stage.\n\n\"It's actually just a tricky stage in a World Cup,\" Curran told the BBC.\n\n\"You're nervous, you've got all kinds of nerves and expectation.\n\n\"I had a little chat with Morgs [former England captain Eoin Morgan] before the toss and said these are the hardest games because we want to get there so badly.\n\n\"Now we've done it it's [about] enjoying it. This is our first aim and now we focus on the teams that we know will be in our group.\"\n\nEngland will play their entire Super 8s phase in Sri Lanka, where they recently beat the co-hosts 3-0 in a T20 series.\n\nTheir opponents are yet to be confirmed. If it goes to seeding then it will be Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand with the top two progressing to the semi-finals.\n\nJacks said he remains as confident in England as when the group left Sri Lanka at the start of the month.\n\n\"Going back to Sri Lanka, we feel confident there,\" he said. \"That experience is good for us.\n\n\"We've obviously done it the hard way, we've not made it easy. But the most important thing is we are on to the Super 8s.\"",

    "fullText": "It has been a miserable season for Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has made only three appearances for Barcelona and Girona. The 33-year-old missed almost the entire first half of the season as he was recovery from back surgery, and after moving to Montilivi, he featured twice before tearing his hamstring.\n\nThere is little chance of ter Stegen returning to action before April, which means he would have a matter of weeks to get himself up to speed ahead of this summer’s World Cup. He has hopes of being Germany’s starter at a major tournament for the very first time, although his injury woes have left these in tatters.\n\nRecent comments by Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann have appeared to back this up. As per Sempre Barca, he has admitted that ter Stegen’s current situation makes it difficult for him to be called up for the World Cup.\n\n“There are three things to consider regarding the goalkeeper position. It’s a tragic injury (for ter Stegen), which I deeply regret. I will never rule him out completely because it is his turn. We have to make the right decision for him and for us. And at the moment, the situation is not favourable.”\n\nGiven that he is 33 years of age, ter Stegen will not have too many years left in football – especially consider his recent injury woes. This summer’s World Cup would have been the perfect time for him to be a starter for Germany at a major tournament, and at this stage, it appears that it will pass him by.\n\nGermany have a number of talented younger goalkeepers rising through the ranks, such as Bayern Munich’s Jonas Urbig and Freiburg’s Noah Atubolu. Both will fancy their chances of ousting ter Stegen in the coming years, and especially before the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco.",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

If they lose they would likely need to beat Zimbabwe and then it could come down to net run-rate. Two wins would guarantee progression.\n\nAustralia would be eliminated if they lose to Sri Lanka on Monday and Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday. They may need to win both their remaining games and rely on net run-rate.\n\nZimbabwe will guarantee progression with two wins. One win potentially may be enough but it would come down to net run-rate.\n\nIreland need to win their last match and hope other results go their way because they can only qualify on net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: England v Italy (16 Feb, 09:30), Scotland v Nepal (17 Feb, 13:30), West Indies v Italy (19 Feb, 05:30)\n\nWest Indies secured their progression with a nine-wicket win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\nEngland must beat Italy on Monday to progress. A defeat would likely see them eliminated on net run-rate.\n\nScotland need to beat Nepal and hope Italy beat England but do not overtake their net run-rate.\n\nItaly must beat England but could lose to West Indies and then net run-rate would decide who progresses. Two wins would see them through, as would a win against England and a washed-out game against West Indies.\n\nRemaining games: Afghanistan v UAE (16 Feb, 05:30 GMT), New Zealand v Canada (17 Feb, 05:30 GMT), South Africa v UAE (18 Feb, 05:30 GMT), Afghanistan v Canada (19 Feb, 13:30 GMT)\n\nSouth Africa are in a strong position to progress and their spot could be sealed on Monday if UAE lose to Afghanistan. Regardless of that result, a win against UAE on Wednesday would confirm their progression.\n\nNew Zealand likely need to win and hope that UAE do not win both of their games. If both of those things happen then net run-rate would decide who moves through.\n\nUAE likely need to win both of their remaining games and even then are likely to be relying on net run-rate to progress.\n\nAfghanistan need to win both of their matches, including one against UAE, and hope that neither UAE or New Zealand pick up points in their final game.\n\nCanada need to win both their remaining fixtures and will need other results to go their way.\n\nRun-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nThe winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate.\n\nIn a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game.\n\nIf a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 20 overs in the case of this tournament.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group A, Colombo\n\nIndia 175-7 (20 overs): Kishan 77 (40); Ayub 3-25\n\nPakistan 114 (18 overs): Usman 44 (34); Hardik 2-16, Chakravarthy 2-17, Bumrah 2-17\n\nIndia continued their recent on-field dominance over Pakistan by winning their highly anticipated meeting in Colombo by 61 runs to confirm their place in the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion and doubt over whether the match would even go ahead, India ultimately proved too strong and sealed a ninth successive win in completed matches against their rivals.\n\nAlthough the captains did not shake hands at the toss and there were no exchanges between the players after the final play, the rest of the match passed without any flashpoints amid the ongoing political tensions between the two nations and last year's military conflict.\n\nThe encounter was effectively won by a brutal early assault by India opener Ishan Kishan, who struck 77 from 40 balls on a tricky, turning pitch.\n\nIt gave co-hosts a flying start and meant, even with Pakistan's plethora of spinners slowing the scoring and taking wickets, they still posted 175-7.\n\nThat always felt a challenging total and Hardik Pandya took a wicket in the first over of the chase and Jasprit Bumrah two in the second to all but confirm the result.\n\nUsman Khan struck some blows in making 44 but Pakistan were swept aside - all out for 114 in 18 overs.\n\nWhile India are now certain to progress as they attempt to retain the title won in 2024, Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday to guarantee their place in the Super 8s.\n\nShould they do so, the rivals could yet meet again in this competition in a semi-final or final.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nFor a while it looked like this match would not happen.\n\nPakistan, whose last win against India was at the Asia Cup in 2022, announced a boycott a week before the tournament began, only to reverse their decision at the start of this week after extensive talks.\n\nIt went ahead, in front of a large crowd weighted towards Indian blue, because it is the most lucrative fixture in the world game, providing the funds upon which cricket's ecosystem survives in its current imperfect state.\n\nHow long that remains the case given India's dominance, built from their cricketing and financial might, remains to be seen.\n\nKishan's assault gave India breathing space and their bowlers were ruthless, even if their fielders dropped three catches.\n\nAfter Pakistan's seamers went the distance, Hardik began with a wicket maiden - dismissing right-hander Sahibzada Farhan, who skewed a pull shot high to mid-on.\n\nIn the next over, the majestic Bumrah pinned left-hander Saim Ayub in front with full inswinger, before Pakistan Salman Agha holed out playing a wild slog.\n\nEven Pakistan's biggest name, Babar Azam, was tamely bowled for five attempting a swipe to left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the fifth over, while left-handers Mohammed Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf meekly picked out fielders in the deep.\n\nAfter all of the build-up this was another underwhelming meeting.\n\nKishan's innings was an outlier across the match. He scored at a strike-rate of 192.50 per 100 balls. Only one other batter to face more than five deliveries, Shivam Dube - who made 27 from 17 balls - went at more than 130.\n\nOf the first 88 runs in the match, 77 came off the bat of Kishan as he made his second 50 in a row at this World Cup.\n\nHe was fortunate to chip three swings into gaps but otherwise hit cleanly in all directions until he was bowled by Ayub in the ninth over.\n\nSwitching through six different spinners, Pakistan's fightback came too late with mystery spinner Usman Tariq held back too long.\n\nAyub had Tilak Verma lbw for a stodgy 25 from 24 balls before Hardik hit his next ball to long-off. Had Ayub's hat-trick ball not narrowly missed Dube's edge and stumps after turning sharply, Pakistan may have had a better chance.\n\nTheir decision to bowl first also seemed a misstep, with the ball skidding through later on.\n\nDube was left to push India beyond 150 which was probably a par total in the conditions.\n\nIn truth, little went right for Pakistan.",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses the potential long-term impact of England's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, and the challenge of facing Ireland at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.\n\nI can easily reel off the losses that stuck with me in the Six Nations, as they can take you to a really dark place at times.\n\nScotland 2000, Ireland 2001 and France 2002 - they all still hurt.\n\nI was involved in all those campaigns and came up short of a Grand Slam by one victory three consecutive times.\n\nIt is important now to take stock and remember that defeat will happen again at some point before the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland will lick their wounds after yet another crushing defeat by Scotland, but even if a potential Grand Slam has gone, they still have a championship to play for.\n\nThe chance to win a Grand Slam does not come around very often, and that is the reality.\n\nLast week I said it would be foolish to draw a straight line from the opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider in Paris.\n\nThis tournament is magical for exactly that reason.\n\nTwo wins and England will be in a position to go to Paris and perhaps try to win the championship.\n\nThere is plenty to focus on and be excited about, and that Murrayfield pain will make England a better team.\n\nBig away wins are not easy in the Six Nations, and Saturday is another one that eluded Steve Borthwick.\n\nIt is not just about winning on another pitch as the World Cup is on neutral soil in Australia.\n\nIt is about the different feeling outside the Twickenham environment and home comforts.\n\nAs impressive as the 12-game winning run was, England still need that South African mentality - wherever you go in the world, you are expected to win and be globally successful.\n\nBorthwick is still yet to travel to Scotland, Ireland or France in the Six Nations and win.\n\nMost adversity comes from playing away from home, and Saturday gave the England players more of those scenarios.\n\nIt is very unlikely they will win a World Cup without a statement away victory beforehand.\n\nThere is a lot happening in these high-pressure games, and for high-paced players it is happening more quickly both physically and mentally.\n\nUnfortunately for Henry Arundell, who was being ultra-competitive, you have to read situations like the one when he took out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nEngland found themselves in a position where they were not playing well and were losing the scraps.\n\nIn those situations, you need clarity as well as competitiveness, and a red card obviously does not help to swing the momentum back.\n\nThat decision has cost England dearly and, given how competitive that wing slot is, I am sure Borthwick is going to have to manage that scenario.\n\nHenry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision.\n\nWhat if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game?\n\nYou have to make good decisions under pressure. Being in those situations more often will help players learn.\n\nSix Nations: Scotland regain the Calcutta Cup\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nEngland will be licking their lips at the opportunity to bounce back against Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWe know England can perform with the comfort of home support, so it is not about putting things right - that will come in games in Rome and Paris.\n\nIt is about building on what they did prior to the Scotland game. Sometimes you have to park a game, write it off and move on.\n\nI thought I had seen England drift away from the kick-heavy style and strategy.\n\nScotland put on an attacking masterclass, whereas when England did attack it felt like they were punching for their lives but not actually landing anything.\n\nThey lacked shape, going left and right without making any progress - like a boxer on the ropes punching for their life but not actually hitting anything.\n\nGeorge Ford's failed drop-goal felt like a last-ditch option, which then resulted in what Borthwick described as a 10-point swing.\n\nI do not think you can blame Ford, the sequence was not set up properly and it felt like tired minds all over the place.\n\nDealing with a fast and furious game is, once again, a learning curve to take forward.\n\nTwo years ago there was plenty of talk that Ireland were going to beat England by 30 points at Twickenham.\n\nIt was such a mismatch in terms of where both sides were in their development.\n\nMarcus Smith's late drop-goal denied Ireland a potential Grand Slam, and that was a huge moment in Borthwick's tenure.\n\nNow England come in as favourites - it is amazing how quickly the landscape changes.\n\nHaving lost badly against France and nearly drawn against Italy, Ireland will be annoyed that everyone is writing them off.\n\nThey are a well-motivated team under Andy Farrell and are very well drilled.\n\nIreland will come out and probably play their best game of the campaign.\n\nScotland, in the space of a week, turned their disappointing loss in Rome into a convincing display against England.\n\nThat is how quickly things can change.\n\nDefeat next weekend and the pressure builds on England, with two difficult away fixtures to finish.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group C, Kolkata\n\nScotland 152 (19.4 overs): Berrington 49 (32); Rashid 3-36, Archer 2-23\n\nEngland 155-5 (18.2 overs): Banton 63 (41), Bethell 32 (28); Davidson 1-12\n\nEngland had another wobble but got their T20 World Cup campaign back on track with a five-wicket victory over Scotland in Kolkata - a result that leaves the Scots on the brink of a group-stage exit.\n\nAfter dismissing Scotland for 152 on a good batting pitch, England lost Phil Salt and Jos Buttler in the first two overs and were 86-4 when Harry Brook was caught for four.\n\nDefeat would have had England facing a humiliating early exit but Tom Banton fought his way through the tension to play the most important innings of his international career to date and secure victory with 10 balls to spare.\n\nHe broke the shackles by hitting spinner Mark Watt for consecutive sixes and finished 63 not out around contributions of 32 from Jacob Bethell and 28 by Sam Curran.\n\nScotland's application with the ball and in the field was admirable. They were ultimately punished for not taking advantage of the platform set by captain Richie Berrington's 49, which had his side 113-3 in the 13th over.\n\nAdil Rashid overcame an expensive start to finish with 3-36 for England, while an improved Jofra Archer took two wickets in the powerplay and finished with 2-23.\n\nIt means England will confirm their place in the Super 8s by beating Italy on Monday.\n\nScotland play Nepal in their final group match on Tuesday but may have been eliminated by other results by then.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nHaving been lucky to escape against Nepal and been convincingly beaten by West Indies, England are still searching for a complete performance at this World Cup.\n\nThey have won World Cups before despite group-stage defeats but improvement is needed if they are to threaten the best in this tournament.\n\nScotland's opening bowling consisted of Brandon McMullen and Brad Currie's medium pace. They found far more movement than England's bowlers and Salt and Buttler sliced catches to the off-side ring for two and three respectively.\n\nThere were no boundaries off the bat in the first four overs.\n\nBethell brought some calm with his patient knock but England were ultimately grateful to Banton who had not lived up to his talents in his previous 36 internationals.\n\nUnlike Bethell, who was caught trying to help a scoop over short fine leg, and Brook - dismissed in the same fashion - Banton played straight and as a result looked more comfortable than any other batter.\n\nHe took only six from his first 10 deliveries and did not hit a boundary until his 11th.\n\nCurran hit two sixes to accelerate England towards the finish line and Will Jacks hit the winning runs, but it was Banton who delivered when England needed him most.\n\nThough Scotland's score always looked 20 runs below par, England were troubled at one stage.\n\nThey took three wickets in the powerplay, including Archer having the dangerous George Munsey and number three Brandon McMullen miscuing pulls in a lively opening spell of three overs, but Berrington countered impressively.\n\nBerrington, a good player of slow bowling, was particularly aggressive against England's spinners. He hit Rashid for two fours and a six in his second over and was the aggressor in a partnership of 71 with Tom Bruce.\n\nAt 113-3 in the 13th over, 190 was Scotland's target. Instead, the wicket of Bruce resulted in the innings sliding away.\n\nHe slog-swept Liam Dawson to deep square leg for 24 - one of six batters to wastefully pick out fielders in the deep.\n\nIn the next over Rashid pinned the sweeping Berrington in front as England's leg-spinner, having gone wicketless for 26 runs in his first two overs, took 3-10 in his second spell.\n\nDawson, who took 2-34, added the wicket of Michael Leask, also caught in the deep.\n\nScotland's collapse 5-14 in 3.3 overs ultimately denied them the 30 runs that could have kept them alive in this tournament.",

    "fullText": "Gennaro Gattuso and his coaching staff have been busy speaking and meeting with a long list of players ahead of the World Cup play-offs in March, and according to recent reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, there are currently around 50 players on the Italy national team radar. Here is a look at all of them.\n\nItaly have not yet secured their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America and must go through the play-offs if they are to avoid missing out on the final tournament for the third cycle in a row.\n\nThe Azzurri will play against Northern Ireland in Bergamo on March 26 in the World Cup play-off semi-final, and should they win that game, they will progress to a one-legged play-off final away against either Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina a few days later: A one-off knock-out match for a spot at the World Cup.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 16: Pio Esposito of Italy celebrates scoring his team’s first goal during the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Norway at San Siro Stadium on November 16, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGattuso and his staff had sought to bring the national team squad together once more before the World Cup play-offs in March, given that they have not got together since the end of the November international break.\n\nThis has not been possible, however, largely due to a congested fixture schedule at club level.\n\nInstead, Gattuso and his staff have arranged a series of meetings and dinners with groups of Italy players and national team hopefuls over the last few months in an attempt to keep the squad somewhat together.\n\nHere is the long list of players Gattuso has supposedly spoken to ahead of the World Cup play-offs.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 05: Gianluigi Donnarumma of Italy warms up prior to the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Estonia at Stadio di Bergamo on September 05, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy.

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nIreland 235-5 (20 overs): Tucker 94* (51); Ahmed 3-33\n\nOman 139 all out (18 overs): Kaleem 50 (29); Little 3-16\n\nStand-in captain Lorcan Tucker hit an unbeaten 94 to lead Ireland to a 96-run win over Oman at the T20 World Cup.\n\nHaving lost their opening games against Sri Lanka and Australia, Ireland needed both victory and a boost to their net run-rate to have any hopes of progression.\n\nWhat was to be a first win at the tournament since beating England in 2022 looked in doubt when Tucker came to the crease with his side 25-2, but the wicketkeeper equalled his highest score in the format to power Ireland to 235-5 by the end of their innings.\n\nDespite Aamir Kaleem providing a half-century, Oman wickets fell quickly with Josh Little leading the way for Ireland's bowlers with three wickets for 16 runs.\n\nIreland play Zimbabwe on Tuesday (09:30 GMT) still needing a win and other results to go their way if they are to make the Super 8s.\n\nBrilliant Muzarabani helps Zimbabwe stun Australia\n\nWhile Tucker filled in for the injured Paul Stirling as captain, it was Tim Tector who opened the batting in place of the Belfast man.\n\nIreland's struggles for a top-order partnership, however, continued with Shakeel Ahmed doing the damage.\n\nThe 38-year-old, celebrating wickets in the style of Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, accounted for Tim Tector (5), Ross Adair (14) and Harry Tector (14) during the powerplay with Ireland reeling somewhat on 47-3 after six overs.\n\nWith Curtis Campher, who provided 12 off seven balls, not sticking around either, it was up to all-rounder Gareth Delany to team up with Tucker and give Ireland's innings some much needed momentum.\n\nThe pair's 101-run partnership off 56 balls took Ireland from what was a shaky start to a position that would lead to their highest ever T20 international total.\n\nWhile there were seven boundaries among Delany's 56 off 30 balls, it was Tucker's efforts that were to provide the headline act.\n\nAn inventive knock that featured 10 fours and four sixes, the only scare came when, with Ireland 67-4, Vinayak Shukla appeared to have him stumped only for the third umpire to judge that Oman's wicketkeeper had dislodged the bails without the ball in his hand.\n\nTucker certainly made the most of the reprieve, pressing on for what is the best knock of the tournament so far, eclipsing Tim Seifert's 89 against UAE for New Zealand.\n\nHe would end the innings frustratingly stranded at the non-striker's end, denied the chance for what would have been a first T20 century as George Dockrell, who plundered 35 from nine balls, faced the final three deliveries.\n\nIf 93 runs in the final five overs of Ireland's innings had appeared to leave the result a formality, Heinrich Malan's side will have had improving their net run-rate on the mind too.\n\nOman were 63-2 after the powerplay, and brought up their 100 in the 11th over, both ahead of the pace set by Ireland, but wickets feel too cheaply to ever bring such a target into realistic focus.\n\nAamir Kaleem led the way with the 44-year-old becoming the oldest player in T20 World Cup history to make a half-century, reaching his fifty in 28 deliveries to break the record set by team-mate Muhammad Nadeem against Sri Lanka only on Thursday.\n\nMost encouraging for Ireland's bowlers was the performance of Josh Little.\n\nThe seamer, who had been without a wicket in his past four T20 internationals, finished with figures of 3-16.\n\nThe 26-year-old, whose 4-23 against Sri Lanka at this tournament in 2021 built his reputation as Ireland's most dangerous quick, had been left out of the side for the opening two games this time around.\n\nBowling with a menacing pace throughout, the left-armer was denied a wicket with his fifth delivery when Ireland's struggles in the field at this tournament continued as Delany dropped Aamir in the deep.\n\nHe came back, however, to claim the wickets of Muhammad Nadeem, Jiten Ramanandi, Nadeem Khan to take away any remote hopes of an Oman victory.",

    "fullText": "Opener Phil Salt called on England to play with their \"chest out\" in their crucial match against Scotland at the T20 World Cup on Saturday.\n\nA narrow win against Nepal was followed by defeat by West Indies on Wednesday meaning Harry Brook's side must beat the Scots to keep their hopes of progressing to the Super 8s in their own hands.\n\nCaptain Brook said England's batters were \"too careful\" against the Windies - something also reflected in frank discussions in the dressing room afterwards.\n\n\"I think getting your chest out and putting the opposition on the back foot, that phrase is used a lot, but I think that's what we do when we're at our best,\" Salt told BBC Sport.\n\n\"When we're at our best, nobody can live with us.\n\n\"It's just about getting to that space more often than we have in the last two games.\"\n\nBrilliant Muzarabani helps Zimbabwe stun Australia\n\nMeet the FPL blogger bowling at the T20 World Cup\n\nEngland, still looking to correct their course after the winter's Ashes defeat. could still progress with defeat by Scotland but it would require a series of results to go their way.\n\nThe Scots are in a similar position, likely needing to win to hold onto hopes of progressing.\n\nEngland have named an unchanged team, with Tom Banton keeping his place over spare batter Ben Duckett.\n\nBanton, who has been out for two in both innings in the tournament so far, and Brook were both dismissed tamely chipping catches off West Indies spinner Gudakesh Motie on Wednesday.\n\nIt came as England, who came into this World Cup having won 10 of their past 11 T20s, lost six wickets in succession against spin in the middle overs.\n\n\"I can't give insights into the mentalities of other guys, but sometimes it can creep in a little bit,\" said Salt, who thrashed 30 from 14 balls before the slide.\n\n\"The differences between playing in bilateral series and tournament play, they are two different things, but the main takeaways from that game were we did possibly bat a bit too tentatively.\"\n\nThe match will be played in Kolkata - the same day as Scotland host England in the Calcutta Cup in the Six Nations.\n\nThe rugby union trophy originated in the city, at Calcutta rugby club, formed of British expats who melted down silver rupees to create the silverware.\n\n\"It's obviously a pretty cool day for everyone,\" said Scotland bowler Brad Wheal.\n\n\"We just want to go out there and do our country proud.\n\n\"So it's a big day for Scottish sport and obviously a massive opportunity for both teams to get a big win going ahead.\"\n\nScotland have played both of their matches so far at this World Cup in Kolkata - a defeat by West Indies and a convincing win over Italy - which should give them an advantage.\n\nThey impressively reached 90-0 in 10 overs before rain intervened when the sides met at the last T20 World Cup in Barbados.\n\nEngland travelled from Mumbai on Thursday and trained on Friday evening, though many of their players have experience of Eden Gardens from the Indian Premier League and past internationals.\n\nSalt was an IPL winner with Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024 and has scored five fifties in nine T20 innings on this ground.\n\n\"Usually it's ever so slightly on the slower side and it's a bit tennis ball bouncy,\" Salt said.\n\n\"I think very much it's been a new ball wicket from my days playing here and at the same time the power play is crucial.\n\n\"If you win the powerplay here you're in a great position.\"",

    "description": "Scotland bowler Brad Currie may open the bowling against England on Saturday but he has an alter-ego - a fantasy football blogger and expert.",
    "fullText": "Brad Currie's biography on social media platform X reads: \"21/22 OR: 1k. 22/23 OR: 1.8k.\"\n\nHe will likely open the bowling for Scotland against England at the T20 World Cup on Saturday, but those numbers do not reference his cricket stats.\n\nInstead, they are Currie's record playing Fantasy Football because online he is known by another name, 'FPL Schofield'.\n\nThere he runs an account with thousands of followers offering tips and tactics on the online football game.\n\n\"My notes page on my iPad is filled with FPL transfers and fixtures rotations,\" Currie tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"My YouTube algorithm is just FPL videos galore. My Twitter is nothing other than football and even my TikTok.\n\n\"My girlfriend absolutely hates it.\"\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nThe Office, Willy Wonka & Denmark at Euro 92 - Scotland's chaotic WC prep\n\nCurrie, 27, was once ranked 30th in the world in a game now played by almost 13 million people.\n\nPlaying a World Cup in India comes with one obvious problem - the five-and-a-half-hour time difference to the UK.\n\nThis week's Premier League matches kicked off in the early hours and the deadlines to make transfers were late at night.\n\n\"I can't figure out a way to get the games on and I am even struggling to see highlights.\n\n\"It has been absolute torture, but thankfully it is the FA Cup this weekend.\"\n\nThough the secret has started to come out, the professional cricket world was initially unaware of Currie's alter ego.\n\nThese days he gets messages from team-mates and opponents asking for advice.\n\n\"[Sussex bowler] Sean Hunt is one,\" Currie says.\n\n\"He messaged me a screenshot before our West Indies game and said: 'I know you have bigger things at play, but what do you think of my team?'\n\n\"The other day he said: 'What do you think of my team? Oh and well bowled.'\"\n\nSo what about a tip for the rest of the FPL season?\n\n\"Chip strategy,\" Currie replies quickly. \"Dead-end into Gameweek 31. Wildcard in 32. Bench boost 33.\n\n\"Triple captain whenever you want.\"\n\nCurrie is the brother of Scott - the Scotland bowler who was called up by England last year.\n\nThey both qualify for Scotland via their Scottish dad, having grown up on England's south coast. Left-armer Brad studied sports psychology at Bournemouth University.\n\nA lifelong fan, Brad was at the Cherries' 3-2 win over Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium - when Amine Adli scored a 95th-minute winner against the Premier League champions - the day he got the call from coach Owen Dawkins to tell him he had made Scotland's World Cup squad.\n\n\"I said to my mate: 'I know exactly what this is, but I can't pick this up because I won't get any signal,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I got to the phone later and Dawks said: 'That was a good result, wasn't it?'\n\n\"I said: 'Yeah, and I hope you're not going to ruin my mood now.'\"\n\nHaving been pipped at qualifying by the Netherlands and Italy, Scotland got a place at this World Cup when Bangladesh opted to boycott the tournament.\n\nThe preceding weeks were uncertain, filled with claims and counterclaims about whether the Tigers would take part and what it would mean for Scotland if they did not. Even the players were not immune.\n\n\"I was at Sussex training in the indoor school and was asking all of the powers that be and the coaching staff,\" Currie says.\n\n\"It was crazy to have people saying we were going. I just thought, 'you know more than me and I am one of the players in the official Scotland group chat'.\"\n\nAs a county pro at Sussex, Currie was fortunate he had been training through the winter.\n\nBowlers' workloads are notoriously important to manage, however, and Scotland's focus switched from the Cricket World Cup League 2 at the end of March to a T20 World Cup in India at the start of February.\n\n\"I don't know what date it officially got announced but the two days after were the weekend and I just did nothing,\" he says.\n\n\"My girlfriend's family were like: 'Should you not be training? Should you not be doing something?'\n\n\"You can't cram in. You just will get injured. It is not like a school test where you can cram in revision.\"\n\nUncertainty also surrounded the availability of the younger Currie brother.\n\nDespite being picked by England for the tour of Ireland last year, he did not make his debut, leaving some to wonder if he could switch back to the Scots.\n\nAs it turned out, one spell as a substitute fielder made him ineligible.\n\n\"I had to text him and ask,\" Brad says.\n\n\"My heart sank because there are loads of brothers out here playing.\n\n\"We have just played the Manentis and the Moscas [against Italy]. There's the Sheikh brothers [Nepal] as well.\n\n\"It probably would have forced Mum and Dad to remortgage the house and get some flights out but there's only one son out here so it's not needed.\n\n\"He is going to try and please Mum and play for England, but I am going to keep Dad sweet and stick to my Scottish genes.\"\n\nEngland's defeat by West Indies effectively means Saturday's encounter is a must-win for both sides.\n\nThey last met at the 2024 T20 World Cup when an impressive Scotland batting performance meant England were faced with a tricky 110 in 10 overs before rain prevented what could have been an intriguing situation.\n\n\"It is something we will never have the answer to,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I have learned to fear no one and go into games expecting to win.\n\n\"I have a fair background in sports psychology and that is the best way to approach these games.\n\n\"They have Adil Rashid [batting] at 11 with 10 first-class hundreds and I haven't got a first-class double-digit score. I am not naive.\n\n\"[But] They have got to play and travel. We have played two games at Eden Gardens.\n\n\"I am just looking forward to it.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The International Cricket Council has been urged to review the rules concerning 12th man duties which denied Scott Currie the chance to play for Scotland at the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nPoole-born Currie, 24, has played three one-day internationals for Scotland having qualified for the Saltires through his Scottish father.\n\nPotentially he could have been lining up to play for Scotland against England in Kolkata on Saturday, alongside brother Brad, only to be deemed ineligible for the tournament because of ICC red tape.\n\nThe Hampshire all-rounder was called up by England for a three-match T20 international series against Ireland last September as a replacement for the injured Saqib Mahmood.\n\nCurrie was not picked in England's playing XI for any of the matches which took place in Malahide, but because he undertook 12th man duties he is now ineligible for Scotland for three years.\n\nSection 2.2 of the ICC's player eligibility regulations state that Currie \"participated\" as a \"non-playing official substitute\".\n\nCricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade said the ICC ruling seems \"quite strange\" compared to other sports.\n\nUnder the rules governing football and rugby union, Currie would have been eligible to play for Scotland having not won an official cap.\n\n\"I don't know when that rule was last looked at, so maybe it is time to have a re-look at that and confirm that what is in place is correct or whether alterations are needed,\" Lindblade told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Is that rule still relevant today in that evolution of our sport where players do move around a lot more from that perspective?\"\n\nUnder ICC regulations players can switch allegiances from associate countries like Scotland to full members like England immediately provided they meet all the other qualification requirements, but they must wait three years the other way.\n\nCurrie declined to comment but has previously spoken of his \"immense pride\" at playing international cricket for Scotland.\n\n\"Taking the field with my brother [Brad], knowing what is means to my old man and his side of the family, is something that always puts a smile on face,\" he said last year.\n\nAn ICC spokesperson told BBC Sport that should a member \"wish to revisit this clause\" then it can be \"raised and discussed, in the first instance, at a men's cricket committee meeting later this month\".\n\nListen to the full interview with Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade broadcast on 31 January on BBC Stumped.\n\nEngland too 'careful' in defeat by Windies - Brook\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Marc Cucurella has been an absolute soldier for Chelsea in the last two years, playing a crazy number of games in a really demanding position.\n\nThe addition of Jorrel Hato this summer was supposed to help him out, but the Dutchman has not proved himself reliable yet, and time again Chelsea have to turn to Cucurella.\n\nThe pressure on his body finally told against Leeds on Tuesday night, when he was taken off with a hamstring problem. In an update in his press conference yesterday, Liam Rosenior said that the club were still awaiting scans to see how bad the damage was.\n\nMarc Cucurella looks sad. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nSigns from Spain aren’t good. Joaquin Marota reports for AS that the Spanish football federation are “worried” about a potential muscular problem, with the World Cup closing in.\n\nThey say that the full back will have an MRI today to discover the full extent of the damage. The Spaniard has already been ruled out of tomorrow’s FA Cup game, and even in the best case it feels likely that he misses the league game a week after that too. That gives him two and a half weeks to try and recover to face Arsenal on March 1st.\n\nAtletico Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Pedro Neto, but at the moment the main transfer sources are saying that’s unlikely. We certainly don’t see the reported £80m price as realistic – although if it was, Chelsea would have a hard time saying no to such a profit.\n\nOne player taking a fair bit of flak recently has been Alejandro Garnacho. Fans want to see more, and Liam Rosenior has even been forced to defender him pretty openly in recent press conferences.",

    "description": "The Nations League does not carry the prestige of other competitions, but Thursday's draw still carries huge importance to Scotland and the Tartan Army.",
    "fullText": "Who needs the Nations League? Now Steve Clarke has ended decades of heartache and taken Scotland to the World Cup, does anything else matter?\n\nUnderstandably, ever since December's gala draw for the summer's finals in North America, every Scotland fan has been consumed with thoughts of facing Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.\n\nThe prospect of partying at the finals for the first time since 1998 has given long-suffering supporters plenty to savour and there's been no need to look beyond, nor anything definite to anticipate.\n\nThat changes the Nations League draw in Belgium on Thursday evening, when Scotland's opponents for matches in the second half of 2026 are confirmed.\n\nCompared to Fifa's festival of football, or even the Euros, it's small potatoes, of course, but these games could hold huge importance for tournaments to come and the development of the national team after their tests in North America.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nAnother plot twist in Scottish title race for the ages\n\nSince being introduced in 2018 in an attempt to add more structure to the international calendar and phase out meaningless friendlies, the competition has followed a familiar format.\n\nNational teams are split into four tiers based on promotion and relegation from the last edition, theoretically putting sides of the same level together.\n\nEach of these tiers are split into groups of four and there's promotion and relegation through the divisions. The best teams in League A then go on into a knock-out finals tournament the following summer with the champions crowned at the end. Simple.\n\nScotland played in the top flight in the last edition back in 2024 but finished in third place in their group behind eventual champions Portugal and Croatia. That put the national team in a play-off to fight for survival and defeat by Greece meant relegation to League B.\n\nRevenge on the Greeks was served in the successful World Cup qualification last year, of course, but Thursday's draw will put Scotland back in familiar territory in the second tier of the Nations League.\n\nScotland are in Pot 1 of the League B draw, but a quick look at the possible opposition puts paid to any ideas that it means an easy draw.\n\nHungary, Poland and Israel are the only sides Scotland cannot face, but with the likes of Switzerland, Republic of Ireland and Sweden as a potential group of opponents, fans won't be taking success for granted. Though do we ever?\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland, Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland, Romania\n\nPot 4: Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Kosovo\n\nScotland will play each opponent home and away, with the fixtures grouped into three double-headers in September, October and November.\n\nGroup winners are promoted automatically, runners-up go into a play-off against a League A side, third faces a relegation play-off and fourth takes a drop straight into League C.\n\nEven eight years after its introduction, the competition does not have the allure of its counterparts, but it is still an important part of the international calendar, especially for Scotland.\n\nHead coach Clarke has spoken repeatedly about how his players need to face strong opposition to keep improving.\n\nThis time around, they will not be playing Europe's elite, but competitive games against sides of a similar level present a good test and strong preparation for the next set of European Championship qualifiers.\n\nPromotion brings prestige, glamour games next time around and prize money, but arguably the real prizes come in how a successful campaign sets Scotland up for the future.\n\nThe seeding for qualification campaigns and finals is always a complicated affair, but there is one simple truth that applies to them all. Winning games pushes a team up the rankings and into a better position - and winning competitive games is more valuable than victory in friendlies.\n\nThere is also the importance of a good Nations League as a lifeline to reach major finals. Four teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup directly have been given a second chance through the play-offs due to their Nations League record.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Scotland's long exodus from a major finals was ended because of a Nations League lifeline – the emotion of the play-off victory in Serbia that sealed a place at Euro 2020 was only possible because of a strong campaign.\n\nIt should not be the case that the national team needs a similar chance to reach Euro 2028, but a horrible set of circumstances could arise that make Nations League success essential.\n\nAs co-hosts of the tournament, the idea of Scotland not making the finals and seeing fans of other nations celebrating at Hampden in unthinkable.\n\nHowever, with four nations hosting the finals, Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland all have to go through the qualification campaign.\n\nIn an ideal world, the national team succeeds there and books a place, with three group games at Hampden guaranteed.\n\nUefa has set aside two places for host nations who fail to qualify in an attempt to make sure all four are in the tournament proper.\n\nHowever, if more than two of the four fail to qualify automatically, it comes down to qualifying ranking and Scotland could conceivably miss out altogether.\n\nIn that specific case, having a play-off place banked from the Nations League would be heaven sent.\n\nThere is one other intriguing footnote to the draw: it could set up the opposition for the next Scotland head coach's first game in charge.\n\nClarke's contract expires after the World Cup and there is no indication if he will carry on in the job, regardless of what happens at the finals.\n\nIf Clarke does leave in the summer, his successor's first matches will be in the Nations League and a new era for the national team will begin when League B kicks off.\n\nBBC Scotland will have live text coverage of the Nations League draw from 17:00 GMT.",

    "description": "Trent Alexander-Arnold endured a difficult start at Real Madrid but his prospects are looking up - and it might earn him a ticket to the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Trent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench in Real Madrid's 2-0 win against Valencia last weekend, there was much anticipation around the former Liverpool right-back's return.\n\nAfter another two months on the sideline, Real supporters had seen very little of the England defender this season.\n\nSince joining the Spanish side in June 2025, he has been limited to just 17 appearances in all competitions.\n\nTwo separate injuries have disrupted his rhythm and denied him the sustained run of games needed to build momentum and a connection with supporters.\n\nThe relationship he built with Xabi Alonso became redundant when the manager was sacked after less than eight months in charge.\n\nNow though, he is fit again and the timing feels significant. The season is entering its decisive stretch and Alexander-Arnold has the opportunity to reassert himself.\n\nWhy are Real Madrid players training in masks?\n\nHasty or a shrewd move? Madrid in shock at swift Arbeloa appointment\n\nAfter a strong Club World Cup, where he started five of Madrid's six matches, Alexander-Arnold began the 2025–26 season sharing right-back duties with Dani Carvajal.\n\nSpanish media praised his early performances, noting he \"showcased his trademark ability to drift inside from full-back\".\n\nBut his campaign was soon disrupted. A hamstring injury in Madrid's opening Champions League game in September put him out for seven weeks and was described by local media as \"a blow to Trent's new chapter\".\n\nHis comeback in November felt particularly poignant as he faced his former club Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nHe subsequently made five more appearances, with Spanish newspaper AS suggesting that \"the initial criticism [of Alexander-Arnold] revealed a lack of understanding of the footballing ability the England international has always possessed\".\n\nMomentum was building and fans were beginning to see the benefits of their star signing, but a thigh injury against Athletic Club in December left him injured and recovering for another two months.\n\nThe 27-year-old admitted he was \"absolutely gutted\".\n\nThat setback kept him out for 14 matches, until his long-awaited return last weekend.\n\nDespite only playing for the final 15 minutes of the match, Alexander-Arnold's return was met with largely positive reaction from supporters.\n\nOn social media, the Madridistas didn't hold back:\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold's minutes against Valencia felt like a prime performance. Our style of play even changed!\"\n\n\"Trent Alexander-Arnold completely changed the game when he came on. Does he deserve to start every match?\"\n\n\"His passes are so satisfying. Football has missed him.\"\n\nThe brief but impressive appearance has raised expectations, especially with the first leg of Real Madrid's Champions League knockout tie against Benfica looming next week.\n\nYet head coach Alvaro Arbeloa was quick to manage the excitement, emphasising that full recovery remains the priority.\n\n\"After being out for a long time, we are taking the same approach with him as with others returning from injury,\" said Arbeloa.\n\n\"We are proceeding cautiously and calmly because what we want is for him to find his rhythm, his best playing form. That's how it will be with Trent.\"\n\nIt was the first time Arbeloa had publicly addressed Alexander-Arnold, and the comments put to rest earlier rumours suggesting he might not feature in his long-term plans - speculation that Real Madrid had carefully shielded the England international from.\n\nThis was a clear signal that Alexander-Arnold remains central to the club's long-term vision. And, as a former Liverpool and Real Madrid right-back himself, Arbeloa may be uniquely placed to help strengthen their relationship off the pitch.\n\nWith Federico Valverde moving back into a central midfield role following Jude Bellingham's recent injury, Real Madrid's right-back picture has shifted, opening the door for Alexander-Arnold to feature more prominently in that position against Benfica and beyond.\n\nArbeloa now has all his options available on that flank: captain Dani Carvajal, Alexander-Arnold (who played ahead of Carvajal against Valencia), Valverde as an emergency option, and academy player David Jimenez, who started in Valencia.\n\nCarvajal's season has been equally frustrating, having battled a series of injuries as well as knee surgery.\n\nDespite now being fit and available, he has barely played any minutes under Arbeloa. In fact, his last start was in September. It's a complex situation given his contract expires in the summer and there appears to have been little progress in renewing it.\n\nThat context places Alexander-Arnold in a strong position to become Madrid's leading option at right-back once fully fit, with Valverde still available as an emergency alternative and Jimenez also impressing when called upon.\n\nWhether Alexander-Arnold will be eased back into the starting XI as he builds fitness, or whether he will leap straight into a key role, given the significance of upcoming fixtures, remains to be seen as Arbeloa manages the reintegration.\n\nIt would be fair to say that, at this stage of the season, Alexander-Arnold's chances of making England's squad for this summer's World Cup appear slim, with his limited minutes at club level the most obvious reason.\n\nInternational selection is usually built on form and fitness, and the England coaching staff are likely to prioritise players who are consistently competing at the highest level.\n\nHe has not had the chance to demonstrate the consistency required to challenge for a place.\n\nHe was omitted from Thomas Tuchel's World Cup qualifying squad in August, with the England coach saying: \"There's no doubt I'm a big fan of Trent, for his talent and his personality. But for this call-up, I've gone with Reece James and Tino Livramento.\n\n\"I know he wanted to be here, which is very important. I just chose others due to competition.\"\n\nEven if Alexander‑Arnold delivers spectacular performances for Real Madrid over the coming weeks, the competition for the England right-back position remains strong.\n\nWith Tuchel preparing to finalise his squad for friendly matches against Uruguay and Japan on 27 and 31 March respectively, selections are likely to prioritise players who have been performing consistently week in, week out.\n\nStill, as Tuchel himself emphasised: \"He's a great player who will always be in contention.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

He's bowling rapid and I'm sure he'll execute better in the coming games.\"\n\nEngland face Scotland on Saturday before their final Group C match against Italy on Monday, with both games taking place in Kolkata.",

    "fullText": "West Indies 196-6 (20 overs): Rutherford 76* (42); Rashid 2-16\n\nEngland 166 (19 overs): Curran 43* (30); Motie 3-33\n\nEngland's batters were spun out by West Indies in Mumbai as Harry Brook's side fell to a 30-run defeat in their second match at the T20 World Cup.\n\nEngland made a flying start in pursuit of 197 but slipped from 74-1 to 166 all out, with six wickets in succession taken by the Windies' spinners through the middle overs.\n\nGudakesh Motie conjured a spell of 3-33, dismissing Jacob Bethell for 33, Tom Banton for two and Brook for 17, while part-timer Roston Chase chipped in with the wickets of Jos Buttler and Will Jacks.\n\nSam Curran held firm for 43 not out but ran out of partners when Adil Rashid holed out at the end of the penultimate over.\n\nEarlier, England leaked runs - Jofra Archer's one wicket cost 48 runs, while Curran's single victim came at a cost of 36 in three overs - to allow West Indies to post 196-6 at Wankhede Stadium.\n\nSherfane Rutherford was the main beneficiary, scoring 74 from 42 deliveries, while being dropped on 23 and 56.\n\nThere were contributions of 34 from Chase and 33 in 17 balls by Jason Holder as well.\n\nThe defeat is not terminal for England's hopes - victories against Scotland on Saturday and Italy on Monday in Kolkata would likely send them through to the Super 8s - but it leaves them little room for manoeuvre.\n\nProteas edge Afghanistan after two super overs\n\nAustralia leave Ireland on brink of World Cup exit\n\nEngland's struggles against spin are not unique to this latest side. They go back generations.\n\nIf fans hoped this iteration had found a successful method when in Sri Lanka before this tournament, this result - under the pressure that comes with a World Cup chase - suggests otherwise.\n\nWhen the ball was hard and with pace to face, England, who were beaten by West Indies in the final of the 2016 T20 World Cup in India, had no issues.\n\nPhil Salt took 24 from the second over, bowled by Holder, and West Indies' total looked 15 runs below par.\n\nHowever, the game changed when Buttler miscued Chase to long-on for 21.\n\nIt opened the door to Motie, who impressively mixed wrist and finger-spin to have Banton and Brook chipping catches either side of zipping one through Bethell's defence and onto the stumps.\n\nCurran was England's hero with the ball in their final-over win against Nepal but he never really looked like finding the boundaries needed when pace returned at the death.\n\nIt was a fine all-round performance from West Indies, who caught every chance in the field, and now top the group with two wins from two.\n\nThey face Nepal at this venue on Sunday, before playing Italy in Kolkata on Thursday, 19 February.\n\nThough Archer had captain Shai Hope caught in the first over and fellow opener Brandon King slashed Curran to deep point in the second, West Indies were always dangerous given their stacked batting line-up.\n\nEngland continued to take regular wickets but only Adil Rashid, who claimed 2-16, managed to slow the scoring.\n\nWhereas Chase took 2-29 after being brought into the XI, England's part-time off-spinner Will Jacks was hit for 32 in two overs - Brook's decision to give him one over in the powerplay costing 19 runs.\n\nArcher, who also struggled against Nepal on Sunday, was wayward with his lines.\n\nRutherford had his moments. The first chance offered was a leading edge that flew to deep third man, with Rashid unable to take the catch or flick the ball back inside the rope.\n\nThat was a tough chance but Rashid would be disappointed not to take a chance off his own bowling when Rutherford skied a slog sweep in the 18th over.\n\nThe left-hander added another 18 runs from seven balls after that miss while Holder hit four sixes, three of which came in the 18th over bowled by Curran.\n\nWith dew not playing a part in making the ball harder to grip for the West Indies bowlers, it proved too much for England when the ball turned.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - results & fixtures\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "With the 2026 Super League season about to kick off on its 30th anniversary, BBC Sport explains what to look out for during a bumper World Cup year.",
    "fullText": "Four months on since Hull KR wrapped up a clean sweep of trophies in 2025, Super League makes its return as it celebrates its 30th birthday.\n\nThree new clubs join an expanded league, there have been signings aplenty, another trip to Las Vegas coming up and it is a World Cup year too.\n\nBut what should you watch out for as the 'greatest game' makes its comeback for another season?\n\nBBC Sport has taken a look at some things to focus on when the curtain opens on the 2026 campaign on Thursday.\n\nThirty years after the inaugural Super League season got under way with 12 teams, this year the competition has expanded to 14 sides.\n\nIt is the first time since 2014 the league has operated with 14 teams having previously dipped down to 12 from the 2015 season.\n\nWith Salford dropping out at the end of last season, the league will welcome three clubs - two of which have played in the top flight before.\n\nBradford Bulls and Toulouse Olympique have both featured in Super League in the past but newcomers York Knights will make their debut this season as the sport continues to expand outside its traditional heartlands.\n\nKnights, whose women's team York Valkyrie have enjoyed plenty of success in the Women's Super League, were selected to join rugby league's top flight by an independent panel along with Toulouse, who come back to the top table following a one-season stint in 2022.\n\nThe panel judged applications against each club's financial performance in 2025, as well as their financial performance and sustainability forecasts for 2026 to 2028 and their ability to \"field a competitive team in 2026 and beyond\".\n\nHeadlined by the high-profile signing of Paul Vaughan from Warrington, York have ushered in a total of 14 new faces as they aim to hit the ground running in their maiden top-flight campaign.\n\nToulouse, meanwhile, welcome Wigan's Tyler Dupree on a season-long loan, hoping to establish themselves alongside Catalans as the league's French representation.\n\nSuper League to expand to 14 teams from 2026\n\nYork and Toulouse to play in expanded Super League\n\nBradford replace Salford in Super League for 2026\n\nTo those of a certain vintage, Bradford Bulls and Super League success are synonymous.\n\nThe club dominated the early Super League era, clinching four league titles and two Challenge Cups during their late 1990s and early 2000s heyday.\n\nFormerly a dominant force, the club lost their top-flight status in 2015 with Wigan Warriors, Leeds Rhinos and St Helens taking it in turns to dominate after Bradford ran out of steam.\n\nDuring their 11-year absence, the club has been plagued with financial troubles and had a stint in the former third-tier League One but, off the back of last season's grading system, they return to Super League.\n\nIconic head coach Brian Noble came back to the club last season and steered them to third in the Championship but they will enter the 2026 campaign under the stewardship of highly-rated former Salford coach Kurt Haggerty.\n\n\"The work we've done leading to round one has been probably more stressful than what's coming ahead,\" Haggerty told BBC Radio Leeds.\n\n\"We've had a lot of stress before we kicked a ball so if I can remain as calm as I have done up to now, I think we'll be ok and I'll be ok.\n\n\"There's a lot of good people around me like Brian Noble who I can rely on and get advice from if I need it.\"\n\nBradford, Toulouse and York have all had to piece together their respective squads for the 2026 season from October onwards, meaning it has been a mad dash to the line for the newcomers to contest the season.\n\nAsked what his ambition was for the coming campaign, Haggerty added: \"I think if we come away from this year with a load of respect, I'll be happy with that.\"\n\nThe expansion to 14 teams means the previously maligned loop fixtures are no more.\n\nThe format was introduced when the league was reduced to 12 sides and ensured that every team played 27 games over the course of a regular season.\n\nIn order for that to happen, however, four of those matches would be so-called loop fixtures where some clubs would face each other again during the regular season based on the final league table from the previous campaign.\n\nThis structure would occasionally lead to some teams having a pretty lopsided campaign - as was the case with St Helens last season, who virtually had a free hit against a chaotic Salford Red Devils side on three occasions while other clubs arguably had a more difficult run-in.\n\nThis led to criticism from many a coach over many a season but returning to a 14-team set-up means the regular season will now consist of 13 home games, 13 away and one Magic Weekend fixture played at a neutral venue - which this year takes place at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nOne side who will not feature in Super League this term are former Grand Finalists Salford.\n\nThe formerly named Red Devils endured a torrid 2025 campaign due to financial issues and frequently fielded youthful sides who were on the receiving end of some demoralising drubbings.\n\nThe club lost their place in Super League due to the end-of-season gradings and were later placed into liquidation by the High Court in December, which plunged its future into doubt.\n\nHowever, former player Mason Caton-Brown led a consortium to take over the club - now running under the Salford RLFC moniker - as they frantically put together the shell of a side to contest the 2026 Championship season in a matter of weeks after being given the go ahead from the Rugby Football League.\n\nHull KR come into the 2026 season off the back of a campaign which saw them win a clean sweep of Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and the Super League Grand Final.\n\nThat success has shattered the glass ceiling as Willie Peters' side muscled their way in to the northern hemisphere elite, becoming only the fifth club in Super League history to win a Grand Final.\n\nBut will their dominance be tested? After all, Wigan came into last season off the back of a historic quadruple of trophies, yet they could not mount a challenge against Hull KR and came away at the end of the season empty-handed.\n\nSt Helens, Leeds and Leigh Leopards have recruited well as they look to dethrone the Robins, who also have a trip to Las Vegas to face the Rhinos and next week's World Club Challenge against National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos to contend with in a packed calendar in the early part of the season.\n\nThere has been some turnover at the Robins, with Jared Waerea-Hargreaves and Micky McIlorum retiring after October's showpiece, but the club have kept the spine of what has made them so successful in recent seasons.\n\nTalismanic half-back Mikey Lewis signed a huge five-year deal before the 2025 season ended and balancing the old and new is crucial to inspiring success in the future, KR forward Dean Hadley said.\n\n\"You look at any successful team, whatever sport that might be and they always have a core group of players and people, which includes the staff,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"When you've got a group where the majority have been together, you build relationships and connections and you get used to each other.\n\n\"Off the back of that it's important to bring in a few new additions and new energy. The boys that have come in have been really good and added to it but the majority of us have been together now for two or three years and hopefully we can carry on.\"\n\nWhat adds some extra spice to the season is the fact there is a World Cup at the end of it, as England's best and brightest aim to put themselves in the picture for a spot in the squad that will travel to Australia in October.\n\nWith Peters \"keen\" to have talks for the role of England boss after the departure of Shaun Wane, how many of his KR cohort will be on the plane down under later this year?",

    "fullText": "\"It's all about the fingertips\" replies Crishan Kalugamage with a wink when asked about the similarities between bowling leg-spin and making pizzas.\n\nKalugamage moved from Sri Lanka to Lucca in Tuscany as a 15-year-old and is one of five home-based players in Italy's 15-man squad for the T20 World Cup.\n\nA sporty kid, Kalugamage made friends competing in athletics and then started playing some amateur cricket near his adopted hometown. His natural talent for the game set him apart and he was soon scouted to play for Roma Cricket Club, one of the oldest in the country.\n\nThe now 34-year-old is one of many players in the Italian squad who have known sacrifice to get where they are today, namely playing in front of thousands of people at famous cricketing stadiums such as Kolkata's Eden Gardens and Mumbai's Wankhede. A global audience of millions watching at home.\n\nKalugamage's job as a pizza maker often came second to playing cricket. \"I lost a lot of jobs,\" he says ruefully, \"Sunday is a very busy day, lots of bosses aren't keen on you not working because you are playing cricket.\"\n\n\"Crish is a very dangerous weapon\" Italy's head coach, John Davison, says on a separate call. \"He can spin it sharply both ways and he will have the element of surprise, hardly anyone in the tournament will have ever faced him.\"\n\nDavison knows his rotations - he is also known as 'The Spin Whisperer'. He has spent the last decade and a half as an in-demand spin coach. Nathan Lyon called Davison the \"best spin coach in the world\" and has worked with him since his teens.\n\nHis dough-spinning days behind him, it'll be Kalugamage's fast googly, rather than a Sloppy Giuseppe, that troubles the batters of Group C (England, Scotland, Nepal and West Indies) who are set to face him.\n\nNone of the 15 squad members were born in Italy and only a few are fluent in the language.\n\nSeveral players hold Italian passports or qualify because of a relative, and some people have baulked at the Italian Cricket Federation casting their net so wide rather than concentrating on developing more homegrown players.\n\nSouth African born and South African capped (six ODIs and 16 T20Is between 2017 and 2021) all-rounder JJ Smuts will play for Italy during the tournament by dint of his marriage but has never even stepped foot in the country.\n\n\"People can have their opinion but we've got a real togetherness,\" says captain Wayne Madsen, speaking before his side's opening match against Scotland on Monday, which saw him dislocate his shoulder and his team soundly beaten.\n\nThe 42-year-old South African born batter is club captain at Derbyshire and has a wealth of experience with teams around the globe. Even so, this group of players has had a real effect on him.\n\n\"That heritage and the journeys that guys have gone on to get here, there's a bond which is pretty hard to describe outside of the feeling that we get as a group,\" said Madsen.\n\n\"It really is probably our biggest strength. Everyone's got a story to tell in terms of how they got to this position and everyone's is unique. Whether it is guys who have grown up in Italy or guys with grandparents who moved away many years ago. We've had some really powerful conversations, it has really bonded us.\"\n\nFor Madsen and Davison, success on the pitch in this tournament is part of a wider plan to build on the growing cricketing roots in Italy.\n\n\"We want to win games and we know and believe that we can. If we can finish in the top eight, that'll change the lives of a lot of our cricketers and put Italian cricket on the map\" says Madsen.\n\n\"I think for us, the main thing is leaving a legacy in Italy and the platform to develop the game further in the country.\"\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nFor some of the squad, the prospect of playing in front of a large crowd will be something of an alien prospect. Davison mentions that the players had a training session inside Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium a few days earlier and it was the first time that the Pakistani born and Italian raised left-arm seamer Hassan Ali had stepped foot inside a cricket stadium of any kind.\n\nThe players have been working with Dr Andrew Hooton, Head of the School of Sports and Exercises Science at the University of Derby, in order to prepare themselves. Hooton has worked with Madsen and Micky Arthur at Derbyshire and also with Burton Albion Football Club.\n\n\"Some of the squad definitely haven't had experience of playing in a big stadium, under lights with huge crowds\" says Hooton, \"One of the things I've been working with them on is being able to perform their skills and maintain their basics in this heightened scenario.\n\n\"We've done some work around 'centering'. Like when you see Ronaldo before he takes a free-kick or penalty, he closes his eyes and does a whole body breath. It allows for attentional focus but also helps to guard against nerves and anxiety. It's physical as well as mental.\"\n\nDavison mentions the 33,000 seater Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is sold out for their second game against Nepal.\n\n\"The ICC give us about 75 tickets for friends and family, that leaves a heck of a lot of supporters for us to win over, but we'll be giving it our best shot,\"\n\n\"We have a platform to take cricket further, to take it to another level,\" adds Madsen. \"We've got the players to make that happen and we're dreaming high. We aren't just here to make up the numbers, we can take sides down.\"\n\nSat next to his captain as he says these words, pizza maker Kalugamage smiles and surreptitiously flicks his fingers. The next part of the journey about to begin.\n\nMadsen dislocates shoulder in Italy's World Cup bow\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

She combined playing with a job as a teacher.\n\nConnor, one of the most influential administrators in the game, became the first female president of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 2021-22.\n\nShe became the first woman to sit on the International Cricket Council's (ICC) cricket committee and remains the chair of the governing body's women's cricket committee.\n\nConnor also served as the ECB's interim chief executive between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe Ashes triumph she led in 2005 was the first time England women had beaten Australia for 42 years.\n\nShe retired from playing at the age of 29 and has arguably had an even greater impact on the game in the boardroom than on the field.\n\nIn Connor's time with the ECB, English women's cricket has moved from an amateur game into the professional era, including multiple changes to the domestic structure.\n\nThe decision to depart is a personal one, and Connor's exit will come after the World Cup, which ends with the final at Lord's on 5 July.\n\n\"Helping to grow women's cricket for the past 18 years has been an absolute privilege,\" said Connor.\n\n\"Having fallen in love with the game in a quite different era from the one we are in now, my goals as an administrator have been firmly rooted in making cricket more equal for women and girls.\n\n\"For it to be as normal for a girl to pick up a cricket bat as a boy.

Their intuition soon morphed into prophecy.\n\nHaving amassed just 99 minutes of action for Real Madrid during the first half of the season, Brazil striker Endrick needed an escape. Lyon were more than happy to provide sanctuary for a player and talisman they desperately craved.\n\n\"We had been waiting for a number nine for so long,\" said Louis-Jean upon the 19-year-old's unveiling after joining on loan until the end of the season.\n\nAt a club where strikers are held in such reverence, his impact has been almost divine.\n\nHe scored 42 minutes into his debut against Lille in the last 32 of the French Cup. Another four goals have followed in five games.\n\nThree of those came against Metz, making him the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick for Lyon, surpassing the great Bernard Lacombe, who had held the record for 54 years.\n\nBefore Saturday's match with Nantes, no Lyon player had been directly involved in more goals (six), had more shots on target (14), or completed more dribbles (19) than the Brazilian since his arrival.\n\nEndrick's signing perpetuates a long-held legacy of Brazilians representing the club.\n\nJuninho Pernambucano, Cris and Sonny Anderson are just a few to have spent significant portions of their careers with Lyon, each contributing to the club's unprecedented run of seven successive Ligue 1 crowns between 2002 and 2008.\n\n\"I know there are a lot [of Brazilians] that have played for the club, and many of them have had a fantastic career here,\" said Endrick during his first interview with French newspaper L'Equipe.\n\nLucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes, Brazil team-mates of Endrick, provided counsel prior to his move.\n\n\"Before coming, I spoke with Paqueta and Bruno,\" he said. \"They told me it was a place I could be really happy.\"\n\nPersonal fulfillment, and a chance \"to play football\" with this summer's World Cup looming, he says were driving factors in his decision to join.\n\n\"Obviously it's a dream I have - that won't change. If you don't play well for your club, however, you can't have a chance of playing for Brazil,\" he added.\n\nIf strikers are revered in Lyon, they are held in almost sacred status in Brazil.\n\n\"We don't have that mobile number nine in the Brazil side,\" says former Lyon captain Cris.\n\n\"We have Gabriel Jesus, Richarlison, but there's a space there for him to help the side with his mobility and the way he sees the game.\"\n\nUltimately, Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will be the man who decides if Endrick makes the plane.\n\n\"We had a wonderful conversation,\" said Endrick when asked about whether the Italian had been in contact before his move.\n\n\"He gave me some advice that has stayed with me,\" he added. \"Now, I have to work in order to improve and become a better player.\"\n\nLyon, and Ligue 1, provide the perfect platform for him to do just that.\n\n\"He's very explosive, very quick, very good in one-on-one situations,\" enthused Lyon manager Paulo Fonseca after his debut against Lille.\n\nHis contentious sending-off for two yellow cards against Nantes on Saturday, however, following a petulant kick out after some robust challenges against him, provides a timely reminder of the adjustments Endrick needs to make.\n\n\"When there are players of that calibre, we have to make sure to contain them,\" said Nantes manager Ahmed Kantari in the aftermath.\n\nHerein lies the challenge Endrick will have to confront - at Madrid he was part of a constellation of stars, while here he assumes that mantle almost uniquely.\n\nThat influence transcends the pitch, too - his signing representing a commercial coup as well as a sporting one.\n\n\"It's obvious his notoriety will boost the club's image,\" Gerlinger said during the Brazilian's presentation.\n\nThe results have been tangible. His arrival video, published on the club's official Instagram account, is the club's most-watched on the platform, while highlights of games against Metz, Lille, Brest and Stade Laval - in which Endrick featured - top their YouTube charts.\n\nLyon will hope his impending one-game suspension does not stymie his, or their, seamless progress of late.\n\nPrior to Endrick's arrival, Fonseca's side had recorded a run of four wins in all competitions - subsequently extended to 12.\n\nHaving crafted a favourable route to the Europa League final courtesy of their top-place finish during the league phase, a spot in the quarter-finals of the French Cup secured, and firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification, Endrick's hopes of \"making history\" at the club - like so many compatriots before him - may just come true.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

Manenti 52 (31); Leask 4-17\n\nMichael Leask and George Munsey starred as Scotland beat World Cup debutants Italy by 73 runs at Eden Gardens.\n\nMunsey - dropped on 40 - blasted 84 as Scotland set 207-4 off their 20 overs, helped by Leask taking 22 from the final five balls of the innings.\n\nLeask carried that momentum into the field, dismissing Italian opener Justin Mosca first ball as Munsey took an excellent diving catch to his right.\n\nDespite a 73-run partnership between brothers Ben and Harry Manenti, Italy were always behind the rate and once they were removed, Scotland skittled the tail for a comfortable win.\n\nWith captain Wayne Madsen unable to bat having dislocated his shoulder fielding, Italy were bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs.\n\nLeask finished with magnificent figures of 4-17, while Mark Watt chipped in with 2-24 as Munsey pouched four catches.\n\nScotland - with one win from two - are next in action against England on Saturday, while Italy face Nepal on Thursday.\n\nWith a rushed build-up to the tournament having replaced Bangladesh, Scotland gave themselves a chance chasing 183 against West Indies in their opener before ultimately falling 35 short.\n\nThey built on that showing with an excellent batting display aided by a flat pitch and a rapid outfield.\n\nTwo thick edges brought Munsey boundaries in the opening over and that set the tone as the left-handed opener struck 13 fours and two sixes in a powerful knock.\n\nDropped by Anthony Mosca off the final ball of the powerplay, he and Michael Jones (37) added 126 for the opening wicket, laying the platform for Scotland's middle order.\n\nBrandon McMullen was unperturbed by the loss of both openers, striking stylish six after stylish six to up the run-rate further.\n\nHe finished 41 not out off just 18 balls and had the best seat in the house to watch Leask close out the innings by smacking Thomas Draca for two sixes and two fours.\n\nThose fireworks took Scotland past 200 for the first time at a men's T20 World Cup and also set the highest total by an associate team in the competition.\n\nAlthough Leask and Munsey combined with the first ball of the reply, former South Africa international JJ Smuts and Anthony Mosca took 23 off Brad Wheal to spark life into the debutants.\n\nHowever, both men were out within the powerplay as Brad Currie and Watt struck for the Scots.\n\nThe Australia-born Manenti brothers kept Italy in the contest, but Harry picked out Munsey at long-off from the returning Leask and Ben holed out to Jones off Olly Davidson as hope drained away.\n\nGrant Stewart and Gian-Piero Meade both chipped straightforward catches back down the ground, before Wheal came back to dismiss Ali Hasan and wrap up proceedings.\n\nSpin trio Leask, Watt and Davidson took combined figures of 7-80 as Scotland avenged their defeat by the Italians at last summer's qualifier in the Netherlands.\n\nZimbabwe cruise to World Cup victory over Oman\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh have requested that Pakistan end their planned boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, opening the door for the fixture to be played on 15 February as scheduled.\n\nThe match, the biggest and most lucrative in cricket, has been in doubt since the Pakistan government advised its team not to take the field against their long-time rivals.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that initial decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, who had a request for their matches to be moved out of India rejected and subsequently pulled out of the tournament.\n\nBut, after talks between officials at the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Lahore on Sunday, BCB president Ameenul Islam requested the match go ahead \"for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem\".\n\n\"We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish,\" he added.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the co-hosts for the tournament with India.\n\nPakistan will forfeit the points from the group-stage match should it not be played but the team's absence from the tournament would also have longer-term consequences for cricket.\n\nIt could lead to disputes over the ICC's current rights deals and continued uncertainty would likely impact future agreements, with the current TV deals set to run out after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nMany of the smaller cricketing nations rely on the money distributed by the ICC, so any cut in revenue would likely hit such countries hardest.\n\n\"Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,\" Islam said.\n\nWhile stopping short of confirming the match will go ahead, the ICC released a statement on Monday evening confirming Bangladesh will not be sanctioned for their boycott.\n\nIt also said Bangladesh will host an ICC event between 2028 and the start of the 2031 World Cup.\n\n\"The ICC, PCB and BCB, along with other members, remain committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport,\" a statement said.\n\n\"All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity.\"\n\nThere were no details on what event Bangladesh would host. All men's events have been confirmed up until 2031, with Bangladesh already scheduled to co-host the 2031 World Cup with India.\n\nThe hosts of women's tournaments have been chosen up to 2027, while the ICC also holds Under-19 World Cups.\n\nThe PCB has been contacted for comment.\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?",

There was no wild celebration. They had pulled it back from the brink.\n\nDespite all that has happened this winter, they came into this World Cup among the favourites having won 10 of their past 11 T20s.\n\nHad Curran not salvaged the victory, everything - McCullum's future in particular - would have come under the microscope again.\n\nThat is pushed back for another day. England must also be praised for not wilting where other England sides have before.\n\nCurran already appeared to have swung the momentum once.\n\nAfter Nepal reached 124-2, his slower ball stopped Dipendra Singh Airee on 44 as the right-hander was caught at deep over. Captain Rohit Paudel was dismissed by Dawson for 39 in the next over.\n\nBut England's experienced bowlers of Archer and Adil Rashid, who conceded 42 from three overs, struggled, leaving Curran to bowl at the last.\n\nHe did not concede a boundary in the final over, mixing his pace and bowling predominately full.\n\nHe was dropped by England before being recalled at the end of last summer but delivered when needed most.\n\nNepal's players completed a lap of honour in front of their deflated supporters at the end.\n\nThough they have been tipped to cause problems at this World Cup, having beaten West Indies over three matches last year and taken South Africa to the final ball at the 2024 World Cup, they have never beaten a major nation on the world stage.\n\nThey were excellent with the ball too - leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane the pick with 1-25, including the wicket of Tom Banton lbw for two.\n\nOff-spinner Sher Malla had Phil Salt caught off a top edge with his first ball in international cricket and Airee also took two wickets with his off-spin in a fine all-round performance.\n\nJacob Bethell made an entertaining 55 and Brook a well-placed 53 for England, but Nepal's batting was on a par as they swept and scurried.\n\nOn this evidence, and given they play all four matches in Mumbai, they have a real shot at progressing from this group.\n\nAn almighty scare - but are England learning?\n\nMinnows Nepal fall four runs short of shock win over England - as it happened\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - results & fixtures\n\nTMS podcast: England survive World Cup scare against Nepal",

    "fullText": "England have a recent history of hair-raising starts to World Cups.\n\nThey were pummeled by New Zealand in Ahmedabad in 2023 and smashed around by Scotland at the last T20 World Cup until rain intervened.\n\nIn front of thousands of Nepalese fans at the famous Wankhede Stadium - the ground where England have produced statistically their worst 50-over bowling performance in history and suffered their heaviest T20 defeat - they were one boundary from defeat.\n\nThe impact of a loss to Nepal does not bear thinking about for an England team under the most intense pressure.\n\nThey did not do much wrong when their opponents were seemingly charging towards a seismic victory, with Nepal's inspired batting deserving of huge credit.\n\nBut the tightrope coach Brendon McCullum and captain Harry Brook are walking is so precarious after England's Ashes defeat and Brook's Wellington escapades, a defeat here may have sent them tumbling to new depths.\n\nThe walkie talkie McCullum was seen talking into during Nepal's chase could have become the equivalent of Ruben Amorim's tactics board in the rain during Manchester United's embarrassing Carabao Cup loss at fourth-tier Grimsby Town in August.\n\nInstead, it may be a hint at a coach who is able to change.\n\nReducing McCullum's coaching to its most recognisable image - feet up, sunglasses in place, watching motionless from a balcony somewhere in the world - would always be wrong.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has won more Champions Leagues than Pep Guardiola, no matter how expressive he is or otherwise.\n\nBut McCullum is the coach who has always asked players to rely on instinct.\n\nHe has done most of his work in the background, leaving his players to make the calls in the middle.\n\nHere, he was sending suggestions to his players when the situation squeezed.\n\n\"That's something we've been doing recently - that dressing room to dugout communication,\" said all-rounder Will Jacks afterwards.\n\n\"It is so messages can get run out to the captain or to the guys who are batting in the middle.\n\n\"It's just an easier way of spreading the message.\"\n\nEngland's white-ball outfit appeared too stubborn in their first months under McCullum last year.\n\nWith a bowling attack of Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, they were thrashed by 150 runs in a T20 on this ground a year ago.\n\nThey arrived in India trying to attack with right-arm express pace and that continued through the Champions Trophy where they did not win a game.\n\nSam Curran will never have the pace of Wood nor the height of Overton, but against Nepal, in defending 10 from the final over, he justified his return from the wilderness.\n\nSome will say England were rescued by the man they discarded. You can also credit them for realising the mistake.\n\nBrook gave a hint at England locating their senses when he spoke to the media on Friday.\n\nHe recalled Liam Dawson - another crucial part of this win with his 2-21 aged 35 - in his first move as captain last year.\n\n\"You look at India's side, and they're one of the best sides to play T20 cricket at the minute, and they've got about five spinners,\" said Brook. \"If they're doing that, why don't we have a little bit of a crack at that as well?\"\n\nHe later backtracked, appearing to be wary of the implications of appearing to imitate India, but would it be so bad if England were?\n\nIt was a diversion from previous messaging of always concentrating on themselves.\n\nBrook would probably tell you it is those conversations - dealing with the media and finding the right words - that is the hardest part of captaincy.\n\nIf it was only about the what goes on a cut strip of 22 yards or the green grass around it, there would be no discussion over his future.\n\nOn the field, he has impressed as a young captain and here, not without frights, he came through his toughest test so far.\n\nEngland have often looked leaderless in the field during their sorry recent run at white-ball tournaments - a spell in which they have given up their T20 and 50-over world titles and exited the Champions Trophy without winning - but at the crunch moment here there was little doubt who was in charge.\n\nHe may not have played under him, but Brook referred to the Eoin Morgan book of captaincy by repeatedly holding the ball at the top of a bowler's mark, giving the heart-rate of his player time to settle.\n\nHe also led the conversation in the drinks break late in Nepal's chase, after which they lost two quick wickets.\n\n\"He was very good at keeping level headed,\" admitted Jacks.\n\n\"Jos [Buttler] spoke as well and those experienced guys are crucial when those pressure situations come around.\"\n\nOf course, the caveat remains that with one swing of the bat, one flash off an edge, the story would all have been different.\n\nNepal were hugely impressive, but are still 16th in the world rankings.\n\nTougher tests will come but England teams have crumbled in pressure moments while carrying far less baggage than this one.\n\nThere are just hints, that they may be learning.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nSri Lanka 163-6 (20 overs): Kusal Mendis 56* (43); Dockrell 2-17\n\nIreland 143 all out (19.5 overs): Tector 40 (34); Theekshana 3-23\n\nIreland could not overcome a host of errors in the field as they fell 20 runs short of Sri Lanka to lose their T20 World Cup opener.\n\nHaving failed to win a game at this tournament two years ago and never beaten Sri Lanka, Ireland got the desired return from their spinners as the co-hosts were restricted to 104-4 through 16 overs.\n\nGeorge Dockrell was the pick of their bowlers and accounted for the wicket of opener Pathum Nissanka for 24 thanks to a fine catch from skipper Paul Stirling.\n\nThe rest of Ireland's work in the field was not nearly as exemplary, however, with five drops, four of them in the final four overs as Sri Lanka tacked on a further 59 runs, making the chase all the tougher.\n\nDespite an apparent hamstring injury, Wanindu Hasaranga accounted for the key wickets of Ross Adair, Harry Tector and Curtis Campher as Ireland were bowled out for 143 in 19.5 overs.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nSeifert half-century helps NZ beat Afghanistan\n\nEngland deny Nepal in final-ball World Cup thriller\n\nWith Ireland winning the toss and electing to bowl, it was an early test of how the side's spinners would adjust not only to the conditions but superior opposition\n\nThrough a three-match series with Italy and two against the UAE in their preparations, Heinrich Malan's side eventually settled upon a bowling attack missing the out-of-sorts Josh Little.\n\nA change facilitated by the bowling renaissance of Dockrell, the decision to leave out Ireland's most dangerous quick was vindicated as the spinners stymied Sri Lanka in the middle overs.\n\nDockrell led the way with figures of 2-17, ably assisted by Gareth Delany whose one wicket came at the cost of 24 runs. With Sri Lanka 50-1 after the powerplay, eight consecutive overs of spin held them to just 87-4 as they were frustrated.\n\nHaving hit Barry McCarthy's final delivery of the powerplay for four, the co-hosts would not find another boundary until Kamindu Mendis brought up his side's 100 in the 16th over.\n\nWith Sri Lanka having finally saw the back of Delany and Dockrell, the partnership of Kamindu Mendis and Kusal Mendis were belatedly able to accelerate ahead, although they were helped in no small part by Irish errors in the field.\n\nThere were three drops in the space of four 17th-inning deliveries from Matthew Humphreys, who will feel his figures of 0-44 should come with an asterisk.\n\nWith Sri Lanka powering from 104-4 to 163-6 across the final four overs of their innings, Ireland's target was much tougher.\n\nWhile Ross Adair always felt the most likely to open the batting with Paul Stirling, there was still a decision to be made between the 31-year-old and Tim Tector coming into this tournament.\n\nAfter averaging 14 across the five warm-ups at the top of the order, Ireland's faith in the man who hit a T20 century against South Africa in 2024 again appeared wholly justified when, despite some less than aesthetic moments, he quickly motored to 34 thanks to five fours and a six.\n\nBut, after contributing two of those five drops in Sri Lanka's innings, Adair had another moment to forget when taking a wild heave at the bowling of a hobbling Hasaranga and having his stumps uprooted.\n\nWithout the thump of Adair and Stirling, who was earlier out for six after facing 13 balls, Ireland relied upon the running of Lorcan Tucker and Tector to keep the game in the balance.\n\nThe required run-rate was always on the rise though and, as Ireland tried to find the accelerator, miscues followed in their attempts to find the boundaries.\n\nThings get no easier in Group B with Ireland set to face Australia on Wednesday (09:30 GMT), while Sri Lanka are next in action a day later against Oman (05:30 GMT).",
