    "fullText": "Barcelona midfielder Gavi is entering the most important phase of his recovery and his eyes are already fixed on the next World Cup.\n\nAccording to SPORT, the 21-year-old is highly motivated to return in time to fight for a place in Spain’s squad.\n\nAfter months of frustration on the sidelines, the young midfielder is finally back training with the group, taking careful steps toward full fitness.\n\nGavi has been out of top-level competition for nearly five months following surgery on his right knee meniscus on September 23.\n\nThe procedure forced him into a long rehabilitation process, but now he is gradually reintegrating into team sessions.\n\nHis workload remains controlled, with both the medical department and coaching staff keeping a close watch on every movement.\n\nWithin Barcelona, it has been made very clear that there will be no shortcuts.\n\nThe club believes it would make little sense to rush his return after showing patience for months.\n\nThe priority is to help Gavi regain confidence, rhythm and match sharpness without risking setbacks.\n\nGavi wants to play the World Cup. (Photo by Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)\n\nA knee injury is delicate, and Barcelona want him to feel completely secure before stepping back into competitive action.\n\nAs such, optimism is growing internally, as the upcoming international break could actually benefit him, giving him uninterrupted weeks of training without the pressure of immediate match demands.\n\nThe plan is for him to complete full sessions consistently, increase intensity step by step, and reconnect with the feeling of being a competitive footballer.\n\nFor Gavi, the past months have been difficult and now, feeling useful to the team again before the end of the season is his short-term objective.\n\nMeanwhile, Luis de la Fuente has maintained regular contact with him.\n\nThe Spain coach is closely following his progress and understands both the risks and the potential reward.\n\nDe la Fuente has never hidden his admiration for the Barcelona midfielder and believes he could still play a role if he reaches the required level in time.\n\nReaching the World Cup will not be easy, as competition in Spain’s midfield is fierce. Despite that, if Gavi regains his rhythm and intensity, the door will not be closed.",

    "description": "Charlie O'Leary was the Republic of Ireland kitman, but his influence extends to football across the island.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to football on the island of Ireland, there isn't much 102-year-old Charlie O'Leary has not seen or done.\n\nFrom serving as the Republic of Ireland's kitman at two World Cups and a European Championship, to refereeing behind the Iron Curtain, the Dubliner has an almost legendary status.\n\nWhat is not as well known is his involvement in founding the \"street leagues\", which helped hone the skills of some of the best players in the history of both the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nNow his story is the focus of a new film which will premiere at the Dublin International Film Festival on Tuesday.\n\nAs the Republic's kitman, O'Leary was part of the national team setup during its golden era, when Ireland defeated England in Stuttgart at Euro '88 and famously stunned Italy in New York at World Cup '94.\n\nBut his influence stretches to some other iconic moments thanks to the street leagues, which he founded in East Wall in Dublin in 1945.\n\nCharlie suggested to the local priest the idea of using the parish church's juvenile sodality - a religious group for young parishioners - as the basis for a football league.\n\nThe sodality was organised on the basis of the local streets - and so the street leagues were born.\n\n\"Schoolboy football hadn't been organised and there was nowhere for a young boy around 14 if he wanted to play football,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"At least this gave those kids at that age a chance of representing those roads in football and getting them interested.\n\n\"So we formed the leagues and they really cottoned on.\"\n\nSo much so that by the 1950s the leagues had spread across Dublin and then to cities across the island, including Belfast.\n\nThe leagues first took root in east Belfast, where people associated with the Harland and Wolff shipyard were among the first to compete.\n\nThey began to feature young men who would go on to achieve sporting greatness.\n\nIn the Republic they included Tony Dunne, who won the European Cup with Manchester United in 1968, Liam Brady, winner of the FA Cup with Arsenal and two Serie A titles with Juventus, and Johnny Giles, part of the great Leeds United side of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, at least three of the 1958 World Cup squad spent time in the street leagues - Harry Gregg, Bertie Peacock and Jimmy McIlroy.\n\nIn later years Manchester United's Sammy McIlroy - who went on to manage Northern Ireland - and Jimmy Nicholl, current Northern Ireland assistant manager, took part in the leagues.\n\nThere was an early sign of things to come in 1957 when Republic of Ireland B took on Romania B in Dublin.\n\n\"There was Liam Tuohy of Newcastle, Noel Payton of Leeds and Dickie Whittaker of Chelsea, all three of them standing together, shoulder to shoulder, for the national anthem,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"Each of those had played, you could pull a curtain over where they lived, the houses were that close.\n\n\"On one day they represented Ireland and all played in the street leagues.\"\n\nCharlie was born just a few months before the Irish Free State - as it was then known - played its first international football match.\n\nThe story of his life - which has therefore spanned the entire existence of his country's national team - will be shown in The Charlie O'Leary Story - From Johnny Cullen's Hill to the Olympic Stadium Rome.\n\nFergus Dowd, who produced the film along with Joe Lee, said the street leagues gave opportunities to young people who would not otherwise have had them.\n\n\"One of the players said to Charlie it was like playing for your country, you played for your street but you were amongst friends and it was really community based,\" he said.\n\n\"I think in a sense we've really sort of lost that innocence - these kids had a jersey on, they were representing the road and their mothers and fathers were watching, so it was a massive community event.\n\n\"Nowadays a lot of the clubs here have their own academies whereas this grew very much organically and it was down to Charlie's idea of making it happen.\"\n\nThe leagues persisted into the 1970s, giving an opportunity to the man who delivered Northern Ireland's greatest moment on the world stage, Gerry Armstrong.\n\nA few years after his iconic goal sealed a 1-0 victory against hosts Spain in the 1982 World Cup, it was the turn of the Republic of Ireland to revel in a shock victory.\n\nThey defeated England 1-0 in Euro '88 and Charlie was watching from the dugout, having been appointed kitman two years earlier.\n\n\"I saw grown men cry,\" Charlie said.\n\n\"There was a man who used to live next door to me and he had gone with his son and he came over to me and he was sobbing.\n\n\"He said 'Charlie, I can boast, I was here when we beat England'.\"\n\nSix years later there was another iconic win, this time against Italy at the World Cup and again, Charlie was there.\n\nThose great victories were masterminded by Jack Charlton, who Charlie said was the best man manager he ever worked under.\n\nHe recalled one occasion when the boss quizzed him after some players were involved in a \"drinking session\" the night before which had ended in a \"rumpus\".\n\n\"He said 'I'm asking you a simple question, what happened last night?',\" Charlie said.\n\n\"I said 'boss hang on a second, if I tell you then you're involved and you've got problems to resolve.\n\n\"I tell you what I'll do, if I say to you everything is resolved, then it's all resolved.\n\n\"So Jack said, 'that's all I want to know, we'll leave it at that,'\n\n\"I got away with that gag every time there was a problem.\"\n\nFrom being part of the backroom team for those famous victories to refereeing in East Germany during the Cold War - \"a bit frightening\" - Charlie has plenty of footballing highlights to pick from.\n\nSo what is his favourite moment?\n\n\"I have to say, I'm a Roman Catholic, when we went to Italy [for the 1990 World Cup] we were brought to see the Pope,\" he said.\n\n\"I was frozen, I couldn't speak.\n\n\"People say, I said this and I said that, I don't remember saying that.\n\n\"But that to me was the biggest thrill I ever got in my life.\"",

    "fullText": "Defending T20 World Cup champions India need \"two big performances\" to reach the semi-finals after Sunday's huge defeat to South Africa, said their assistant coach.\n\nIndia came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.\n\nIn their first chase of the tournament, India's batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.\n\nIndia collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa's 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.\n\nThe magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.\n\n\"Very disappointed in the performance,\" said Ryan ten Doeschate.\n\n\"When you set out to win a World Cup, don't expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,\" the assistant coach added.\n\n\"We've messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.\"\n\nIndia are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe West Indies face Zimbabwe on Monday night in Mumbai in their Super Eights opener.\n\nIndia next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.\n\nSouth Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram's side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.\n\n\"Obviously with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it's going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\nIndia's fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs. Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.\n\nIndia's media tore into the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"The night the cloak came off,\" blazed a headline in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\n\"Sloppy India reach point of no return,\" said the Hindustan Times.\n\nIndia's ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.\n\nIshan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world's top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.\n\n\"It's certainly not panic stations,\" said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India's batting line-up.\n\n\"If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,\" said Ten Doeschate.\n\n\"So can we get them to temper the way they're playing and be a little bit smarter?\n\n\"Or do we just let them go on the way they are?\n\n\"Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?\"\n\nCaptain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.\n\n\"Chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,\" he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.\n\n\"We lost too many wickets in the power play.\"\n\nThe 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.",

    "fullText": "The two-time champions West Indies have looked confident and clinical in the shortest format, showcasing their trademark flair and aggressive style. Under the guidance of head coach Daren Sammy, the Caribbean side have spoken about creating their own slice of history, but consistency will be crucial as the competition intensifies.\n\nThe West Indies enter the match on the back of four consecutive wins, putting behind a disappointing run in bilateral series before the tournament. Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer have led the batting charge, while Jason Holder and Roston Chase have provided balance with their all-round skills. Romario Shepherd has also impressed with both bat and ball, particularly on Indian surfaces where he has IPL experience.\n\nZimbabwe, on the other hand, have been one of the biggest revelations of the tournament. The Sikandar Raza-led side have pulled off memorable victories over former world champions Australia and Sri Lanka, earning respect and recognition on the global stage. Young batter Brian Bennett has been their standout performer with the bat, while Blessing Muzarabani and Brad Evans have been among the leading wicket-takers in the competition.\n\nWith short boundaries and a batting-friendly pitch expected at the Wankhede Stadium, West Indies are likely to target a big-hitting approach, but Zimbabwe’s confidence and resilience suggest they are capable of pushing their opponents to the limit.\n\nWest Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match: Live streaming details\n\nWhen will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe West Indies vs Zimbabwe Super 8 match will be played on Monday, February 23, 2026.\n\nWhere will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match be played?\n\nThe match will take place at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India.\n\nWhat time will the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match start?\n\nThe match is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss at 6:30 PM IST.\n\nWhich TV channels will broadcast the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nThe game will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network in India.\n\nHow to watch live streaming of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match?\n\nFans can watch the live stream on the Jio Hotstar app and website.\n\nWhere can we follow the West Indies vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 match online?\n\nLive ball-by-ball updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.",

    "fullText": "With Mauricio Pochettino about three weeks from selecting the U.S. roster for March training camp and friendlies, a rush of good news concerning two players arrived a few hours apart Saturday:\n\nMidfielder Tyler Adams was on the field for the first time in more than two months and striker Ricardo Pepi was in uniform for the first time in six weeks.\n\nAdams, who recovered earlier than anticipated from a sprained knee ligament, started in Bournemouth’s 0-0 draw at West Ham, while Pepi, in uniform after recovering from a fractured forearm, scored a sensational goal as a second-half sub in PSV Eindhoven’s 3-1 triumph over Heerenveen.\n\nRicardo Pepi laat zich direct gelden bij zijn rentree 🎯👏#psvhee pic.twitter.com/z4UrAtaZkr\n\n— ESPN NL (@ESPNnl) February 21, 2026\n\nWith both back in the mix for national team duty next month — Adams is certain and Pepi is probable — Pochettino has, at the moment, almost his entire player pool available for selection.\n\nOnly midfielder Gio Reyna (muscular issue) and winger Alex Zendejas (adductor) have remained out for multiple weeks.\n\nAdams, the 2022 World Cup captain, missed 10 matches before suiting up at Everton on Feb. 10 — an absence of eight weeks instead of up to a feared three months. On Saturday, he logged 66 minutes, completed 41-of-45 passes and earned the second-best defensive statistics among players on both teams as eighth-place Bournemouth extended its Premier League unbeaten streak to seven.\n\nWith his left forearm well-protected, Pepi entered in the 76th minute and, after video replay negated his apparent goal, he rocketed a 25-yard shot in the 87th minute to stretch his Eredivisie scoring streak to six games. He increased his league total to nine and overall count to 12 in just 22 appearances.\n\nThe timing was ideal for the 23-year-old Texan, who, while injured, fell behind Coventry City’s Haji Wright and Derby County’s Patrick Agyemang on the U.S. depth chart behind No. 1 striker Folarin Balogun (Monaco).\n\n“Amazing feeling to be back!” Pepi posted on social media. “Thank you to all the PSV’ers for the warm support on my return.”\n\nPochettino plans to name his squad for next month’s camp March 17 ahead of friendlies in Atlanta against Belgium on March 28 and Portugal on March 31 — the last gathering before his World Cup decisions. He must submit a provisional list of between 35 and 55 players to FIFA by May 11 before announcing the 26-man squad on or about May 26.\n\nIt was quite a week for Balogun, who followed his two-goal performance against reigning European champion Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a second-half goal that sparked Monaco’s three-goal uprising to shock Ligue 1 leader Lens, 3-2.\n\nHe increased his overall goal haul to 11: five in Ligue 1, five in the Champions League and one in the French Cup.\n\nMidfielder Tanner Tessmann (58 minutes) and third-place Lyon saw their 13-game winning streak across all competitions end with a 3-1 defeat at Strasbourg.\n\nRight back Tim Weah was Olympique Marseille’s best player from an analytical standpoint in a 2-0 loss at Brest, extending fourth-place OM’s overall slump to 1-3-2 heading into next Sunday’s critical home match against Lyon.\n\nToulouse center back Mark McKenzie served a yellow card suspension and missed the 1-1 draw with Paris FC.\n\nCenter back Chris Richards helped Crystal Palace register its second shutout in three Premier League matches, a 1-0 victory over last-place Wolverhampton, which played a man short for about a half-hour before conceding the goal.\n\nLeft back Antonee Robinson was held out of Fulham’s 3-1 triumph at Sunderland without an official explanation, his third consecutive league absence. He had played 90 last weekend in the FA Cup.\n\nMidfielder Brenden Aaronson (73 minutes) and Leeds earned their third straight away draw in Premier League play, a 1-1 result at Aston Villa.\n\nAfter productive matches in the English Championship last week, Wright and Agyemang were quiet. Wright played 71 minutes in a 2-0 victory at West Brom and Agyemang went 90 in a 2-0 loss at Watford.\n\nMidfielder Aidan Morris went 75 in Middlesbrough’s 0-0 draw with second-to-last Oxford, leaving his club three points behind first-place Coventry but six points ahead in the race for the second promotion to the Premier League.\n\nChristian Pulisic, who has been battling bursitis, returned to AC Milan’s lineup after three substitution appearances with a 62-minute effort and two quality scoring chances during a 1-0 home loss to Parma — its first loss in Serie A since the August opener, a stretch of 23 games.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie, who has been in tremendous form for Juventus this winter, played all of the 2-0 loss to Como, a result that stretched the Turin club’s winless rut to five games heading into the home leg of the Champions League affair with Galatasaray on Wednesday. (Juventus lost last week’s opener, 5-2.)\n\nMidfielder Yunus Musah remained on the bench for the seventh time in nine matches as Atalanta edged Napoli, 2-1. He has appeared in 14-of-26 Serie A matches with just three starts, totalling 447 minutes.\n\nIn Serie B, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann has conceded 10 goals in three matches, the most recent setback coming in Cesena’s 3-2 loss to Spezia.\n\nMidfielder Malik Tillman played 81 minutes in Bayer Leverkusen’s 1-0 loss at Union Berlin, ending a seven-game unbeaten streak heading into the Champions League second leg Tuesday against Olympiacos. Leverkusen won the first leg, 2-0.\n\nTeenage center back Noahkai Banks (17th start) continued to impress at Augsburg, which used a late comeback to earn a 3-2 victory at Wolfsburg.\n\nReyna’s call-up hopes continued to dim after missing his fifth consecutive match for Mönchengladbach.

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8s Group 2, Pallekele\n\nEngland 146-9 (20 overs): Salt 62 (40), Jacks 21 (14); Wellalage 3-26,\n\nSri Lanka 95 (16.4 overs): Shanaka 30 (24); Jacks 3-22\n\nA superb bowling performance breathed life into England's T20 World Cup campaign as Harry Brook's side beat co-hosts Sri Lanka by 51 runs in their opening match of the Super 8s phase.\n\nEngland remained unconvincing with the bat in posting 146-9 but their bowlers took full advantage of a tricky surface to knock over their hosts for 95.\n\nJofra Archer dismissed key batter Pathum Nissanka and fellow opener Kamil Mishara but even more impressive were the three wickets for all-rounder Will Jacks inside the powerplay.\n\nJacks, who has struggled with the ball at times in this tournament, removed Kusal Mendis and Pavan Rathnayake in consecutive deliveries and added the scalp of Dunith Wellalage as Sri Lanka crumbled to 34-5 under the pressure of a chase.\n\nAfter Kamindu Mendis chipped back a catch to Liam Dawson and Dushan Hemantha hit his own wicket, Jacks combined with Tom Banton to complete a fine relay catch on the boundary to dismiss Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka's captain and the last recognised batter, for 30.\n\nThat England's batting remains far from perfect is pushed to another day. Jos Buttler made a tortured seven from 14 balls, Jacob Bethell fell to a wild slog and Tom Banton ran himself out.\n\nPhil Salt's 62 and 21 from Jacks, who was the next highest scorer in a fine all-round display, were crucial.\n\nEngland play Pakistan on Tuesday and New Zealand on Friday in their remaining Super 8s matches.\n\nOne win should be enough to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nSalt and Jacks dragged England to a score but Sri Lanka still appeared favourites at halfway.\n\nThough England defended 128 on this ground in a series before the World Cup, Sri Lanka chased 182 with two overs to spare to beat Australia here in the group stage.\n\nThis surface was trickier than that one. Its sticky nature and decent turn offered assistance to the spinners and Jacks capitalised.\n\nAfter conceding four from an accurate first over, Jacks got one to grip to take the leading edge of Mendis. Rathnayake charged him a ball later and was caught skying a hideous swipe.\n\nBrook also used Archer for three consecutive overs at the start.\n\nArcher bowled at high pace and had Nissanka, who scored a brilliant hundred against Australia, caught at deep square leg before finding the edge of Mishara.\n\nHemantha's dismissal – he hit his stumps with his bat flapping at Jamie Overton – summed up a poor Sri Lanka batting display, not that England will care.\n\nAfter nervy wins over Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage, they are closing in on a place in the last four.\n\nStill we wait for England's batting to truly fire at this tournament.\n\nWith his feet stuck and best form seeming distant, Buttler missed three deliveries and toe-ended another before being pinned in front by Wellalage's left-arm spin on the reverse sweep.\n\nOnly 37 runs came from the powerplay, with Bethell caught at short third trying to hit Maheesh Theekshana over mid-wicket.\n\nAs the pressure to score rose, Banton took on a single that was never there and Brook was trapped tentatively on the crease for 14.\n\nThe highest partnership of the match was 26 between Salt and Sam Curran. Battling cramp from the ninth over, Salt did not find top gear and Curran holed out at long-on\n\nJacks targeted the off side smartly and struck four important fours and Overton clubbed a six in the last over.\n\nThere remains room for improvement but England's tactic of favouring batting depth - Jacks was at number seven and Overton nine here – is proving to be smart as the top order struggles.\n\nT20 World Cup: England complete convincing win over Sri Lanka - as it happened\n\nTMS podcast: Bowlers bail out England as they beat Sri Lanka\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses what went wrong in England's record home defeat by Ireland and what areas could be improved for the final two rounds.\n\nRemember two years ago when England were going to get beaten at home by 40 points against Ireland?\n\nThe narrative in this tournament rarely plays out as expected. Teams overperform and sides crack under pressure. That is the beauty of the Six Nations.\n\nThat predicted thumping in 2024 never happened. Instead, England stunned Grand Slam-chasing Ireland with the last play of the game to win 23-22.\n\nRoll on two years, when expectations were much lower, and Ireland delivered that record away win.\n\nAndy Farrell's side arrived with the mentality to deliver a historic victory, bringing the tactics and accuracy needed to win.\n\nThe 21-point difference at Allianz Stadium came down to tactics and decision-making. England made a load of mistakes, and some of that came down to trying to play the match like a game of chess.\n\nThe issue with doing that is that they could not change on the hoof how they wanted to play.\n\nThe tactical battle between coaches Andy Farrell and Steve Borthwick was won by Farrell, but England need players on the field who are able to change tactics as they go.\n\nThey have struggled with sticking to the script instructed to them by Borthwick, with any changes then being delivered at half-time.\n\nGiven the talent and winning run, I was expecting England to adapt better.\n\nWhy do teams play with a high tempo against them? Because England are good.\n\nIt looked like they thought another team could not replicate Scotland's attacking play from last week.\n\nIt was very unlike England, but that is what happens when you get stressed.\n\nThey lacked the senior Lions mentality to get out of sticky situations. Over the last two weeks, where were those decision-makers?\n\nThe defence and attack needed adjusting in the first quarter. They waited 40 minutes and had conceded 22 points.\n\nEngland have good leadership, but Maro Itoje - who will only get better with more minutes under his belt - cannot do it all on his own.\n\nHe wants the leaders around him to step up in their roles, especially given he is not finishing games at the moment.\n\nSomeone like Ollie Chessum can jump in with an idea of how to fix the line-out. Freddie Steward, who can see the flow of the game from the back, could offer input on where the space to attack is.\n\nThe squad has not changed from the 12-game winning run. They are a group of very good rugby players.\n\nEllis Genge was honest and brave in his assessment, but I do not feel let down by England.\n\nThey are capable of winning in Rome and Paris.\n\nThe loss should not be the reason for a load of changes for the Italy game, as Borthwick's continuity in selection is what brought success.\n\nDespite a rest week coming, a three-game block of games is very taxing and England have the depth available.\n\nI would freshen up the half-backs and bring in Fin Smith and Jack van Poortvliet.\n\nAlex Mitchell's injury may open that door for Van Poortvliet, but I want to give a new opportunity to key decision-makers in an away Six Nations game.\n\nSmith is a confident player and, having been England's starting 10 in last year's Six Nations, he will want to prove his ability to adapt in-game.\n\nFull-back George Furbank is another intelligent player who can spot space in attack, and I want to see him as he will also be chomping at the bit to prove his worth.\n\nI would then go Tom Roebuck and Henry Arundell on the wings. A free-flowing game in Rome suits their attacking attributes.\n\nThe back row, too, I felt lacked some balance against Ireland.\n\nBringing Henry Pollock and all his energy off the bench is a play that I would go back to.\n\nA new outlook and perspective from players who have been outside the pressure cooker may well bring long-term benefits.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\nRuthless Ireland beat England, & Scotland come back in Cardiff\n\nNow the narrative is that they did not win big away games in 2025. They beat what was in front of them, and they have proved themselves to be a good side.\n\nLike a good golfer, they are tinkering that bit too much. That has enormous ramifications.\n\nThe progress up until the Scotland game was good enough for a World Cup, but they are trying lots of different things that they do not need at the moment.\n\nOff the back of a tough 2024, England used being the underdog to their advantage.\n\nThey won in Argentina with a young squad and beat New Zealand in November. It becomes trickier when you are known to be one of the top sides.\n\nEngland were getting into that bracket as they blew Wales away, and the rest of the Six Nations knew they were going to have to come up with something superhuman to beat them.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened, and Borthwick's side must deal better with higher expectations.\n\nThe pressure is also different, as every breath for the past month has been about the Six Nations and possibly winning it. That is draining and tiring.\n\nFinding the energy as an underdog to play above yourself is easier than finding that spark within yourself when you are expected to win.\n\nEvery single year you will get these types of results, and that will not change.\n\nIt is not out of the question that England go to Paris and beat France. What is the narrative then?\n\nNothing said Ireland could win against them by 20-odd points - and it happened.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8s Group 1, Ahmedabad\n\nSouth Africa 187-7 (20 overs): Miller 63 (35), Brevis 45 (29); Bumrah 3-15\n\nIndia 111 all out (18.5 overs): Dube 42 (37); Jansen 4-22, Maharaj 3-24\n\nSouth Africa underlined their credentials as serious challengers for the T20 World Cup with an eye-catching 76-run victory against defending champions India in their opening match of the Super 8s phase.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2024 final in Barbados which India won by seven runs, South Africa set the co-hosts a target of 188 as a 35-ball 65 from David Miller and Dewald Brevis' 29-ball 45 helped them recover from a precarious 20-3 after four overs.\n\nIndia, who came into the game with a perfect record of four wins in the group stage, produced an uncharacteristically timid chase in Ahmedabad and looked resigned to their fate after slipping to 51-5 by the 10th over before being bowled out for 111.\n\nOpting to bat first, South Africa were in trouble after losing captain Aiden Markram, Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton for single digits inside the powerplay and needed Miller and Brevis to rebuild their innings.\n\nMiller, who previously played for Ahmedabad-based Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League, looked right at home from the start, finding boundaries with ease as Brevis was happy to play second fiddle.\n\nBrevis then picked up the pace and fell five runs short of a half-century but Miller soldiered on to reach his half-century in 26 balls and by the time he departed in the 16th over, South Africa were well poised at 152-5.\n\nSome good death bowling from Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh reined them back but a late flourish from Tristan Stubbs, who added 20 off Hardik Pandya's final over, in an unbeaten 44 took them to 187-7.\n\nMarkram gave the Proteas the perfect start with the ball by sending back the dangerous Ishan Kishan for a duck in the first over before Marco Jansen removed Tilak Varma three balls later.\n\nKishan's opening partner Abhishek Sharma ended his run of three consecutive ducks but could only muster 15 before falling to Jansen while captain Suryakumar Yadav became the fifth India batter to fall halfway through their innings.\n\nWith him went India's remaining hopes as Keshav Maharaj, who picked up three wickets in the 15th over, and Jansen, who took two in the 19th to finish with 4-22, wrapped up the tailenders.\n\nIndia will need to defeat Zimbabwe in Chennai on Thursday to stay alive in the competition while South Africa will remain in Ahmedabad to face former champions West Indies on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Africa captain Aiden Markram: \"Great performance. We're pumped for the bowling crew, they've been working hard. The partnership [between Miller and Brevis] steadied the ship and kept us in the game. We looked at where we could run hard and our batting in the middle was the difference.\n\n\"We're going to have to enjoy this but park it and get our minds sharp [to face West Indies]. We don't want to take confidence and good vibes for granted.\"\n\nIndia captain Suryakumar Yadav: \"You can't win the game in the powerplay, but you can lose it. We lost too many wickets in the powerplay.\n\n\"Hopefully we bat well, bowl well and field well [against Zimbabwe]. I hope we play the same brand of cricket, nothing changes.\"\n\nTest Match Special commentator Prakash Wakankar: \"You see the satisfaction but also the steely determination on the faces of the South Africa players. Right from the toss, there wasn't the customary smile from Markram, who was very serious and focused.\n\n\"The disappointment from the captain after getting out really said a lot. It clearly shows that South Africa came here with a plan and executed it with ruthlessness to deliver a result that will be very, very well received by their supporters.\"\n\nT20 World Cup: South Africa complete impressive win over India - as it happened\n\nHow South Africa conquered Test cricket in 2025\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Will Jacks, labeled England's 'Jack of all trades' by Harry Brook, delivers again at the T20 World Cup to keep the winter of a lifetime rolling on.",
    "fullText": "Will Jacks has already had quite the winter.\n\nHe made his Ashes debut in Australia, got engaged to his partner Ana in Sydney and now, at times single-handedly, is taking England towards the T20 World Cup semi-finals.\n\nWhich would he rank as his best moment?\n\n\"That is not for me to answer,\" laughed his captain Harry Brook.\n\n\"But he has had three man-of-the-match awards this World Cup and I don't think he has played his best cricket yet.\"\n\nBrook and Jacks go back a long way.\n\nThey were 15-year-olds when they played against each other at the famous Bunbury Festival – Jacks playing for the London schools' side and Brook the north of England.\n\nJacks made 46. Brook took two wickets.\n\nFour years later they were roommates with the Under-19s and now Jacks is keeping Brook's first World Cup campaign as captain afloat.\n\nWhen this tournament began with questions around Brook's suitability to be captain after off-field controversy in Wellington, it was Jacks who was put forward to speak to the media to defend his mate.\n\nAgainst Nepal, the right-hander hit 39 not out, without which England would have suffered one of the great World Cup shocks, and his first T20 fifty against Italy, a powerful 53 not out, pushed a tight game out of the reach of the Italians in their valiant chase.\n\nHis 21 with the bat and three wickets with the ball against Sri Lanka was another gift for Brook, coming on the captain's 27th birthday.\n\nEngland now sit one win from a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\"He is a very competitive lad,\" said Brook. \"He was annoyed when he got out tonight.\n\n\"After his first over he said 'I always bowl better when I am annoyed'. That was one of the reasons I kept him on.\n\n\"He is that perfect player. He is the Jack of all trades who can do everything.\"\n\nJacks' Ashes was not all fairytale proposals below Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nOff the field, he was one of the England players plastered across the front page of the Australian newspapers with a pint in hand in Noosa.\n\nOn it, he struggled with his two wickets in the third Test against Australia in Adelaide costing 212 runs. Across the series he took six wickets for 394 runs.\n\nJacks' stubborn batting in Australia did show a side of his game that hinted at promise and now he is thriving as England's T20 man for all seasons.\n\nBacked by Brook on Sunday he was asked to open the bowling for England for the first time since a match against Australia in Barbados at the last T20 World Cup.\n\nThat day, after what Jos Buttler later described as a \"gut feel\", Aussie opener Travis Head – the man who cut and pulled him into submission in Adelaide – sent him onto the Kensington Oval roof in an over that cost 22 runs. England's campaign never recovered.\n\nThis time his opening over cost only four, even that a boundary courtesy of a misfield.\n\nBrook said it was a \"last-minute\" decision to give Jacks the new ball, the logic being that with a shorter boundary to the left-handed Kamil Mishara's leg side it was better to have Jacks' off-spin turning the ball away.\n\nTypically, after that good first over, Jacks dismissed two right-handers in his next – the dangerous Kusal Mendis poking and chipping back a catch and Pavan Rathnayake charging and slicing a catch high to the off-side ring.\n\n\"Rathnayake's been a very good player for them, and probably their best player of spin - the way that he runs down the pitch,\" Brook said.\n\n\"To get him out first ball was a very crucial part in the game for us.\"\n\nControl was something often lacking with Jacks' off-spin during the winter but here he delivered his most accurate spell.\n\nBowling four overs on the spin, he pitched 91% of his deliveries on the stumps or in the channel - the highest of any England match of his career.\n\nHis only bad ball, one which slipped from his sweaty hand, was pulled for six by Dasun Shanaka but later Jacks got his revenge by being the initial catcher in a brilliant relay grab with Tom Banton.\n\nIf his first three wickets put England on course for victory, the dismissal of Shanaka confirmed it.\n\n\"I love getting the responsibility with the ball,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"It encourages me to get into the game and perform better.\n\n\"[Opening the bowling] is not foreign for me. And with a surface like that, I come in knowing what to do.\"\n\nJacks has been given the nickname of Slim Shady by some England players during this tournament – a reference to his pre-tournament haircut and bleached blond hair. In the dressing room he has even been asked to rap.\n\nBrook appears happy with his Jack of all trades. He is keeping this winter rolling on.\n\nEngland bowlers secure crucial win over Sri Lanka\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nStats battle: Can you beat our new T20 World Cup game?",

    "description": "Rain washed out the Pakistan vs New Zealand Super 8 match, with both teams sharing one point and the semi-final race wide open. Pakistan must beat England and Sri Lanka to reach five points and likely qualify, while any loss could make their chances depend on other results. New Zealand face a similar situation, with wins now crucial to stay in control of their campaign.",
    "fullText": "As a result, both teams shared one point, which has made the race for the T20 World Cup 2026 semi-finals much more complicated.\n\nThis was an important game for both sides because a win would have given them a strong start in the Super 8 stage. \n\nInstead, Pakistan and New Zealand now have only two matches left to push for a top-two finish in their group.\n\nFor Pakistan, the situation is simple but tough. They will next play England and Sri Lanka. If Pakistan manage to win both matches, they will reach five points, which should be enough to book a place in the semi-finals. \n\nHowever, if they lose even one game, their chances become tricky. One win and one loss would leave them on three points, and then they would have to depend on other teams’ results. \n\nIf Pakistan lose both remaining matches, they will be knocked out of the tournament.\n\nNew Zealand are in the same boat. \n\nThe rain has given them a point, but they will still need wins in their upcoming matches to stay in control of their destiny. \n\nAny slip-up could pull them into a tight battle with the other teams in the group.\n\nSince this was the first Super 8 match for both Pakistan and New Zealand, the full picture will only become clear once all teams have played at least one game. \n\nBoth sides were seen as favourites to reach the semi-finals, but the washout has made their path harder and kept the group wide open.",

    "fullText": "The noise is one of the first things that hits you on arrival in India.\n\nThe chatter. The beeping of horns. A thrilling assault on the senses.\n\nEngland have also battled to dampen the noise around their group throughout this T20 World Cup campaign.\n\nShould Brendon McCullum stay on as coach? Is Harry Brook the right man to be captain?\n\nEven after reaching the relative tranquillity of central Sri Lanka, Brook fielded questions about the ongoing situation regarding Pakistan players' involvement in The Hundred.\n\nBrook's pre-prepared answers – he gave it in two separate interviews to different questions – did not say much, but he did at least show support for those involved.\n\nOn another day, Brook's admission that England had \"probably underestimated a couple of the sides\" when scraping through the group stage would have taken the headlines.\n\nIt was honest, but not a great look for a team battling a perception of being loose with their preparation.\n\n\"We obviously didn't know all the players and we had minimal stats on some of them,\" Brook said.\n\n\"That's something that we can definitely improve on in the future, especially in tournaments further down the line - getting your homework done a little bit earlier.\"\n\nEngland's performance in the group stage was undoubtedly unconvincing.\n\nThey were taken to the final ball by Nepal and lost to West Indies in Mumbai, before edging to wins over Italy and Scotland in Kolkata.\n\nBatters got in and got out - Tom Banton's 63 not out the only real match-defining score. Even the ever-reliable Adil Rashid has gone for nine runs per over or \n\nIt means England have shown little to suggest they can threaten late into the tournament to this point.\n\nWithout improvement this will likely be a fourth underwhelming major tournament in a row since they won the T20 World Cup in 2022.\n\nBut Brook's comments also reflect some of the difficulties faced by the major nations at this World Cup – a tournament in which no team has built an entirely compelling case to suggest they will be champions.\n\nPlayers from the lower-ranked teams expressed their keenness to perform, not just to cause an upset but also to prove they are deserving of the greater opportunities they so desperately seek.\n\nThe Test-playing sides, in contrast, had everything to lose. Just ask Mitchell Marsh when he gets off his flight to back to Australia on Saturday.\n\nAnd for all their struggles to finish matches with ease, England were also ahead in all three games against their lower-ranked opponents.\n\nNepal's chase looked to have stalled, Scotland were 127-8 and Italy 1-2 in the first over of their chase.\n\nMost former England captains would not admit it, and maybe Brook has shown he would, but it would only be human to relax in those situations.\n\nMost of all, however, England are hoping familiarity brings an upturn in fortunes.\n\nThey returned to Sri Lanka on Tuesday, first spending two nights in Colombo before taking the winding drive to Pallekele.\n\nColombo was where Brook stood in front of his team-mates in late January and apologised for his late-night antics in Wellington and the subsequent fallout – an attempt to draw a line under the Ashes defeat.\n\nPallekele was where England won all three T20s against the very same team they now face.\n\nEngland said they were badly prepared for the Ashes and now admit to being underprepared for this group stage. For the next task they could hardly have had better preparation.\n\n\"It's just about reading the pitch and the conditions as quickly as possible and communication's key,\" said Brook, when asked what he learned from beating Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We obviously had that last game where we only got 130, but that ended up being a winning score.\n\n\"You never quite know what's going to happen with the pitch and until you end up playing on it.\"\n\nThe 3-0 win, which concluded less than three weeks ago, took England's winning run in T20s against Sri Lanka to 11.\n\nThere have been six UK prime ministers since England last lost to Sunday's opponents in the shortest format.\n\nSri Lanka's key bowlers Wanindu Hasaranga and Matheesha Pathirana have also been ruled out with injury.\n\nAnd after Sri Lanka, England will face Pakistan before a meeting with New Zealand.\n\nThey have won their past three T20 series against Pakistan and beat the Black Caps last year. That was a rain-hit contest but in the one match completed, England racked up 236-4.\n\nThe favourable draw, set by the pre-seedings that have sent the four group winners into the other side of the Super 8 draw, means there will be no excuses should England fail to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nThat was the minimum requirement before this tournament began and relief at avoiding a group-stage exit should not hide that fact.\n\nEngland and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday, with managing director Rob Key to follow on Sunday.\n\nIt is described as a pre-planned trip rather than anything that should ramp up the pressure on coach Brendon McCullum, whose future remains in question after the Ashes debacle.\n\nThese may be three matches for McCullum to save his job – should he want to continue into the summer. Two wins would likely be enough to take England into the semi-finals.\n\nAnything less and that noise would only ramp up again.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nI won't bat for myself to correct form - Buttler\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks",

Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said Abhishek showed good form in the nets and should bounce back in the Super 8s.",
    "fullText": "Team India bowling coach Morne Morkel dismissed any talk of dropping him and said, \"Absolutely no discussion on Abhishek Sharma in the group. He is going to deliver, for the team and viewers. He is entertaining. He is hitting the ball well in the nets.\"\n\nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting the 25-year-old batter. He believes Abhishek is trying too hard to hit big shots from the first ball instead of settling in. \n\n“Abhishek Sharma is a lovely guy, but expectations seem to be weighing on him. If he had started well against the USA, it would have been different. Now, the pressure of being the big six-hitter and top batter is showing,\" Gavaskar said.\n\n\"With his shot range, he needs to spend time in the middle. He cannot try to hit a boundary or six on the first ball of his innings. If the big shots come, fine. But he shouldn’t force himself to play the big shots across the line,” he added.\n\nHe also advised Abhishek to start slowly and build his innings. \n\n“Take a single and get off the mark. Even four dot balls don’t matter. He can make up for them later. He needs to play smart. Spend an hour or two settling in, then play his natural game. First, just get off the mark. Every batter wants that first run. Once he gets it, everything will fall into place,” he added.\n\nAssistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate also backed Abhishek and said he showed good form in training after recovering from illness. \n\nHe said Abhishek batted well in the nets and should be fine in the next phase.\n\nWith India reaching the Super 8s, the team hopes Abhishek will regain confidence and perform when it matters most.",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group B, Pallekele\n\nOman 104 (16.2 overs): Wasim 32 (33); Zampa 4-21\n\nAustralia 108-1 (9.4 overs): Marsh 64 (33)\n\nSpinner Adam Zampa rejected the narrative Australia do not value T20 cricket as highly as other formats after his side departed the World Cup by thrashing Oman for a consolation nine-wicket win.\n\nMitchell Marsh's side were already out of the tournament after defeats by Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe but lifted themselves to dismiss Oman for 104 before racing to their target in just 9.4 overs.\n\nSince their exit was confirmed on Tuesday, it has been suggested, external Australia do not value the shortest format as highly as Test or 50-over cricket.\n\n\"It is totally false,\" said Zampa, a white-ball specialist who has never played a Test.\n\n\"The time the coaches and staff put into our T20 cricket is probably as much as Test cricket, potentially even more time because T20 cricket and one-day cricket, everyone is a lot tighter in the world. The work is definitely there.\"\n\nAustralia's poor World Cup follows their 4-1 victory over England in the Ashes. They have not lost an Ashes series since 2015. They have won six 50-over World Cups but only one of the 10 men's T20 World Cups.\n\nThey lost bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood to injury before this tournament while left-armer Mitchell Starc has also retired from T20s, but their thinking often appeared muddled throughout the group stage here.\n\n\"The Australian public struggle with the fact they don't get to see much white-ball cricket played,\" said 33-year-old Zampa.\n\n\"We play three to six games in the summer and do a lot of our work away from Australian time.\n\n\"They don't get to see the way we play and prepare for these World Cups.\n\n\"It is disappointing it has ended like this but the work and time is as much as the other formats.\"\n\nZampa said he was \"feeling pretty hollow\" after the win over Oman.\n\nHe took four wickets but said it was the \"worst-feeling four-for I have ever got\".\n\nSeamer Xavier Bartlett bowled Aamir Kaleem with the first ball of the match and the seamer barely celebrated - a clear sign of Australia's disappointment at their early exit.\n\nThough the flat atmosphere continued, Australia were clinical. Wasim Ali's 32 was the highest score for Oman, who depart the tournament with four defeats from four.\n\nCaptain Marsh, seemingly keen to hit through any frustrations at his side's run, then crashed seven fours and four sixes, including two huge hits over the leg side, to wrap up victory in quick time.\n\nOnly 12 runs were needed when left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed dismissed Travis Head for 32. Marsh finished unbeaten on 64 from 33.\n\nAustralia's victory concludes the group stage of the World Cup - this was one of few mismatches between the lower and higher-ranked sides.\n\nThe Super 8s begin on Saturday with a meeting between New Zealand and Pakistan in Colombo. England play co-hosts Sri Lanka in Pallekele on Sunday.\n\nStats battle: Can you beat our new T20 World Cup game?\n\n'It smacks of England' - Australia fail again at T20 World Cup",

Ishan Kishan's explosive 77 powered India to 175/7, a target Pakistan couldn't chase, falling for 114. This win secured India's Super Eight spot unbeaten.",
    "fullText": "The scintillating performance by the Men in Blue also contributed to a 56% growth in reach over the India-Pakistan clash during the 2024 edition. Fans tuned in for a whopping 20 billion minutes of total watch time across all screens, reflecting immense engagement.\n\nOn the field, India made a ruthless statement, comfortably defeating Pakistan by 61 runs to secure a place in the Super Eight stage unbeaten. After electing to field first, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s surprise move to bowl in the opening over produced an early wicket, dismissing Abhishek Sharma. But Ishan Kishan immediately turned the tide with a power-packed display, asserting dominance from the start. Pulling Shaheen Shah Afridi for a six on the first ball, Kishan continued to attack, supported by Tilak Varma as India racked up 52 for 1 after six overs, Kishan contributing 42 off just 25 balls.\n\nKishan’s blitz extended beyond the powerplay, hitting a 27-ball fifty and ending with a brilliant 77 off 40 balls, before being dismissed by Saim Ayub. Pakistan relied heavily on spin, using six spinners in the innings—the most ever by a team in a T20 World Cup and joint-most by a Full Member in a T20I. Saim Ayub impressed, removing Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya and finishing with 3 wickets for 25 runs, nearly claiming a hat-trick. India closed their innings at 175 for 7, bolstered by contributions from Suryakumar Yadav (32), Shivam Dube (27), and Rinku Singh (11).\n\nPakistan’s chase never gained traction. Hardik Pandya dismissed Shahibzada Farhan for a duck, followed by Saim Ayub and Jasprit Bumrah dismantling the middle order. Even Salman Ali Agha and Babar Azam faltered under pressure, while Usman Khan’s 44 off 34 balls was the only bright spark. India’s bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah (2/17), Axar Patel (2/29), and Varun Chakravarthy (2/16), ensured Pakistan was bowled out for 114 in 17.5 overs, sealing a one-sided victory.\n\nBrief Scores:\nIndia: 175/7 (Ishan Kishan 77, Suryakumar Yadav 32, Shivam Dube 27; Saim Ayub 3/25)\nPakistan: 114 all out (Usman Khan 44; Jasprit Bumrah 2/17, Axar Patel 2/29, Varun Chakravarthy 2/16)",

    "fullText": "England batter Jos Buttler says he will not just bat for himself as he tries to correct a poor run of form at the T20 World Cup.\n\nButtler, arguably England's greatest white-ball batter, was out for three against Scotland and Italy and has not scored a fifty in 14 international innings this winter.\n\nAfter the 35-year-old was dismissed fourth ball looking to clear the infield for the second match in a row against Italy, former captain Nasser Hussain suggested Buttler should take time to build an innings.\n\nBut, speaking on his For the Love of Cricket podcast, external, Buttler said: \"I would love to just bat for 15 overs but I don't want to bat for 15 overs just for myself and ignore the game.\n\n\"You've got to still play the game.\n\n\"There are times I've been out of form in Test cricket and the batting coach might say 'rein it in and bat for an hour'.\n\n\"In T20 you have got to keep playing the scoreboard.\"\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nButtler's last major contribution for England was 83 from 30 balls against South Africa in September but, given his illustrious career, his place in England's XI remains secure.\n\nHe scored 97 not out for Durban Super Giants in the SA20 in January but made 12, 20, 15, 22, three and one in his other innings there.\n\n\"I felt I was playing really well in the SA20 without getting scores,\" Buttler said. \"One thing I always pride myself on in T20 is if you get in, go and make a good contribution.\"\n\nButtler and England trained on Thursday for the first time since their win over Italy on Monday, after travelling to Sri Lanka.\n\nButtler had a lengthy regular net practice and then faced throw-downs from fielding coach Carl Hopkinson with a wet tennis ball on a soaked concrete strip - an apparent attempt to sharpen his reflexes.\n\nTeam-mate Jacob Bethell dismissed any doubts about the opener's form.\n\n\"He's fine,\" Bethell said. \"The options he has taken haven't come off but no one in that side is worried about Jos in terms of performance.\n\n\"He will come good when we need him in the big stages of this tournament.\"\n\nBethell trained with a bandage on a finger on his left hand. He suffered a cut during the defeat by West Indies and it has meant he has been unable to bowl.\n\nThe injury will be assessed again before England play co-hosts Sri Lanka in their first match of the Super 8s phase on Sunday in Pallekele.\n\nThey progressed through the group stage in unconvincing fashion with edgy wins over Italy, Scotland and Nepal, plus a defeat by West Indies, but before the World Cup they beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in a T20 series, with all three matches played in Pallekele.\n\n\"To beat a good Sri Lankan team at home in their conditions 3-0 was a massive confidence boost for us,\" Bethell said.\n\n\"You can feel it within the group the boys are confident coming back here.\n\n\"We know the conditions, we know how a couple of the teams are going to play. We're definitely, definitely very confident about this Super 8s.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Major League Soccer (MLS) kicks off its 31st season this weekend, ushering in another high-stakes campaign in a World Cup year.\n\nLionel Messi leads Inter Miami CF into the new term as they defend their 2025 MLS Cup crown against 29 rivals.\n\nIt has been 32 years since the United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, two years before the launch of MLS in 1996. Now, three decades later, MLS bids to become one of the world’s most exciting leagues.\n\nIn addition to Messi, several other elite stars are chasing the most prestigious piece of silverware in North American football, including LAFC’s Heung-min Son and Vancouver Whitecaps’ Thomas Muller.\n\nBoth are back for their first full season in MLS after making waves in their first campaign across the Atlantic upon arrival last summer.\n\nMLS has undergone profound changes since its inception in 1996, with all ten teams that launched the league towards the end of the 21st century still competing at the highest level.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that each of those ten sides has changed its name, crest, or both over time. MLS has been constantly evolving in recent decades, yet a historic change is on the horizon this time.\n\nMLS will stage its final full season under the traditional spring-to-fall format this year before switching to Europe’s summer-to-spring calendar in the summer of 2027.\n\nTo facilitate the transition, the league will introduce a shortened 14-game campaign from February to May next year before fully adopting the new schedule.\n\nFrom next season onwards, MLS will align its calendar with top European leagues such as the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, marking the beginning of a new era.\n\nOn February 22–23, MLS kicks off its “MLS Is Back” weekend, with all 30 clubs taking the field.\n\nReigning champions Inter Miami could not have imagined a more challenging way to kick off their title defence, as they head to BMO Stadium to take on star-studded LAFC on the opening weekend.\n\nJavier Mascherano’s charges will play their inaugural match at Miami Freedom Park on April 5 against Austin FC.\n\nWith the 2026 World Cup set to unfold on American soil, MLS pause its season from May 26 to July 16 to make room for the world’s most prestigious international tournament.\n\nSince 11 cities will host the event, a number of club training facilities will be taken over by participating national teams, forcing the league officials to schedule a mid-season break.\n\nOn July 17–18, MLS resumes competition with marquee rivalry fixtures, including a mouth-watering derby between Los Angeles Galaxy and LAFC at Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nOn July 30, MLS hosts the MLS All-Star Game in Charlotte.\n\nFinally, on November 7, Decision Day brings the regular season to a close as teams battle to secure play-off positioning.\n\nHistory beckons for Inter Miami as they could become only the third team in MLS history to win back-to-back titles following their maiden triumph last year.\n\nNeedless to say, all eyes will be on eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi, who reigned supreme during Inter’s title-winning campaign, bagging a jaw-dropping 35 goals in 34 league matches.\n\nMessi might be the Herons’ standout star, but Mascherano’s squad also features other high-profile names, like Sergio Busquets, Sergio Reguilon, Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nFurthermore, Inter shelled out $15 million to sign former Atletico Madrid striker German Berterame from CF Monterrey in January, further increasing an already intimidating firepower.\n\nIf there’s a side capable of challenging Inter’s dominance, it’s LAFC.\n\nSon’s arrival from Tottenham Hotspur last summer transformed Marc Dos Santos’ team into one of the deadliest attacking units in North American football, let alone MLS.\n\nThe South Korean megastar has forged a formidable partnership with Denis Bouanga. Together, they accounted for 25 goals and eight assists, emerging as the division’s most prolific duo alongside Messi and Suarez.\n\nBouanga and Son may no longer have to create chances for themselves alone after LAFC secured the services of Stephen Eustaquio from Porto earlier in February.\n\nIndeed, the skilled midfielder has moved to BMO Stadium on a season-long loan and will try to help the Black and Gold win the crown for the first time since 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Vancouver Whitecaps are bidding to replicate Toronto FC’s remarkable 2017 success and become the second Canadian franchise to lift the trophy.\n\nThough in the autumn of his illustrious playing career, Muller proved to be a game-changer for Jesper Sorensen’s side in the second half of last season, adding elite creativity and finishing touch to this exciting roster.\n\nMuller took MLS by storm upon arrival last summer, netting seven goals and adding three assists in seven appearances during the regular season to help his side reach the play-offs.\n\nDespite a 3-1 defeat to Inter in the grand final, the Whitecaps demonstrated they can compete with the league’s elite and will look to turn that painful lesson into fuel for a genuine title push in 2026.\n\nMessi has elevated MLS to another level since leaving Paris Saint-Germain to join Inter in 2023, and the 38-year-old icon looks set to remain the focal point of attention throughout the upcoming campaign.\n\nUnparalleled in his influence and output, La Pulga continues to set the standard across the league, and there’s no doubt that he will be the cornerstone of Inter’s title defence.\n\nWhile many players would settle for leaving in the shadow of Son, Bouanga has often found a way to outshine his more esteemed teammate, emerging as one of the league’s fiercest strikers.\n\nBouanga was unstoppable last season, tallying 26 goals and nine assists in 34 league games, and he will be the one to keep an eye on this year despite Son’s presence.\n\nIt’s a World Cup year, and a player who made his mark on football’s biggest international stage over a decade ago is perfectly poised to make his American soccer debut.\n\nJames Rodriguez is the man in question. The 36-year-old has joined Minnesota United following a lacklustre spell at Leon and will look to roll back the years after rising to global superstardom at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nA landmark change this year sees every MLS match available at no extra charge to Apple TV subscribers in over 100 countries — the standalone MLS Season Pass has been discontinued in favour of inclusion within the base streaming service, with no blackouts for viewers.\n\nOpening weekend highlights include a marquee Walmart Saturday Showdown clash between LAFC and Inter Miami at the iconic LA Memorial Coliseum, with traditional Sunday Night Soccer continuing the primetime slate.\n\nApple’s expanded coverage also introduces enhanced broadcasts and features like dynamic “Shot on iPhone” angles, aiming to deepen engagement across the regular season, Leagues Cup, All-Star Game, and Audi MLS Cup Playoffs, making 2026 a watershed year for global accessibility of MLS.\n\nFor more live streaming information, see our football live streaming page.",

    "fullText": "Clubs across the world are growing frustrated with FIFA over delays in distributing £185 million in promised solidarity payments from last summer’s Club World Cup, per The Guardian.\n\nFIFA had pledged that clubs that did not take part in the expanded tournament would still receive a share of the revenue, ensuring the benefits filtered down beyond the elite.\n\nHowever, more than seven months after the competition concluded, there is still no confirmed timeline for when the money will arrive or clarity on how it will be divided.\n\nThe total solidarity pot stands at £185m. If shared equally, it would equate to roughly £50,000 per top-flight club worldwide.\n\nWhile that figure may seem modest compared to the £740m in prize money distributed, with winners Chelsea earning around £84m, for many smaller clubs it could prove transformative.\n\nIn leagues where television deals are shrinking or even non-existent, a five-figure payment can be the difference between balancing the books and serious financial strain.\n\nExecutives from smaller European leagues say they have repeatedly sought answers from FIFA but have received no clear clarification on when funds will be released.\n\nThere is no suggestion that FIFA will not pay the money. Instead, the delay appears to stem from ongoing discussions over how to split the £185m between the six continental confederations.\n\nRepresentation at the Club World Cup varied, complicating attempts to create a fair formula. Also, several confederations lack established systems for distributing such funds.\n\nIn Europe, UEFA is expected to use a model similar to its existing solidarity payments for clubs that miss out on the group stages of European competition.\n\nBut until final figures are agreed, no distribution can begin.\n\nThe tournament’s last-minute funding arrangements have not helped.\n\nA £787m broadcast deal with DAZN was only finalised months before kick-off, leaving little time to establish a detailed pay-out structure.\n\nFor football’s smaller clubs, the wait continues and patience is wearing thin.",

    "description": "Jos Buttler's form is a concern but Will Jacks and Sam Curran have shown promise. What to make of England's unconvincing start to the World Cup?",
    "fullText": "England‘s group stage at the T20 World Cup was a mixed bag - some good but overall unconvincing.\n\nSam Curran and Will Jacks have provided reasons to be positive but Jos Buttler‘s tricky start is a concern.\n\nWe have taken a look into the numbers behind his struggles and the other themes of England’s first four matches…\n\nScores of three against both Italy and Scotland mean Buttler made only 53 runs across the group stage – a low return for one of England's key men.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a quiet winter with no fifties in 15 international innings across all formats, though a 97 not out in the SA20 in January casts doubt on those writing him off entirely.\n\nButtler's dismissals against Italy and Scotland were almost identical.\n\nLooking for his first boundary from his fourth ball, he miscued a length ball in the off-stump channel to mid-off.\n\n\"Maybe he is trying too hard to get a score on the board,\" said Buttler's former England team-mate Dawid Malan.\n\n\"The last two innings he has played, he has tried to hit the ball over mid-on.\n\n\"Knowing him and playing with him, his gameplan is generally to look to the off side first and then pick up leg side, so maybe he's just going back to his basics.\n\n\"I don't think we have to worry.\"\n\nAll three of his dismissals against pace, including nicking off against Nepal seamer Nandan Yadav, have come against balls clocked between 75-82mph.\n\nSince the start of 2024, Buttler has struggled against pace bowlers in that bracket more than any other – with an average of 35.8 and a strike-rate of 129.\n\nPerhaps more concerningly, given the tournament now returns to the turning tracks of Sri Lanka, his average against spin in T20 internationals has dropped to 24.1 since 2024 from 61.8 across the two years prior.\n\nButtler's other dismissal in this tournament came against Roston Chase's off-spin.\n\nEven with making 202-7 against Italy, there remains a feeling England's batting is yet to fully fire at this tournament.\n\nThey posted 184-7 against Nepal, were bowled out for 166 by West Indies and wobbled when chasing 153 in their victory over the Scots.\n\nThe problem has not been batters getting in.\n\nEnglishmen have reached 25 runs 14 times so far – the most of any team in the competition – but only four of those knocks have been converted into fifties. No England player has made a score above 75.\n\nWill Jacks rejected the notion this is due to batters failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Responsibility in T20 can be misunderstood,\" he said. \"Sometimes the responsibility is to try and hit 30 off the over.\"\n\nMalan believes The Hundred may be having an impact.\n\n\"There's more emphasis on the first 10 overs now, so if you lose wickets in those first 10 overs then it makes it harder towards the end, but you still need to keep going,\" he said.\n\n\"I used to always worry more about the second 10 overs, so it was about setting things up and then being able to get to that 180 or 190-mark, if the score and wicket dictated it.\n\n\"A lot of these players are playing in The Hundred which is less balls, meaning you have to keep going earlier, and it doesn't really teach you to soak up the pressure for an over or two.\"\n\nCaptain Harry Brook has now got out against spin in three innings in a row after beginning the tournament with 53 against Nepal.\n\nThis is a familiar issue for Brook, who averages 47 against pace in T20 internationals since the start of 2024 but only 23.5 against spin.\n\nBrook's struggles are curious, given his stunning 136 not out on a turning pitch in a one-day international in Sri Lanka last month.\n\nThe return to Sri Lanka for the Super 8s may help Brook because in India he is averaging 20.5 in T20s.\n\nCould Harry Brook struggle in that department then?\n\n“It has probably been his weakness but, saying that, when you bat at four, five or six in T20 cricket and you're walking in at the ninth or 10th over, the majority of balls you are going to face are spin,” Malan said.\n\n“If he is out there for eight overs and he is facing six overs of spin, there is a high chance he's going to get out against spin after starting against spin.\n\n“He changed his technique at the beginning of the year to become better at spin.\n\n“He keeps his bat on the floor for longer whereas he used to stay up.”\n\nOne of the positives of this World Cup so far has been Jacks' promising returns as England's finisher.\n\nHis 39 not out from 18 balls in the four-run win over Nepal was crucial – so too his maiden T20 international fifty against Italy from the tricky position of 101-5.\n\nJacks only took on the finishers' role at the start of last summer but is faring well compared to others before him.\n\nJacks' bowling is more of a concern, however.\n\nWith leg-spinner Adil Rashid, plus two left-arm spinners in Liam Dawson and Jacob Bethell, in the squad, Jacks' bowling role is more significant given he turns the ball in the other direction as an off-spinner.\n\nIt is problematic for England that his six overs have cost 83 runs with two wickets in return.\n\nJacks has struggled most when being swept, conceding 31 runs from eight sweep shots in the group stage.\n\nThough his average amount of turn is only down slightly, 3.5 degrees in the pre-tournament series in Sri Lanka compared to 3.3, Jacks is drifting the ball far less - 1 degree compared to 1.7 degrees in Sri Lanka.\n\nSam Curran came through twice when England were under the most pressure during the group stage.\n\nAgainst Nepal, he successfully defended 10 from the last over.\n\nWhen Italy and Grant Stewart were flying in Monday, Curran stopped the runs and then dismissed the right-hander.\n\nCurran, who was out of favour until September last year, has taken on the role of England's death bowler to good effect.\n\nHe has been especially effective with yorkers – going at 5.07 runs per over with a full length at the death, compared to 14.14 with anything shorter.\n\nCurran is often credited with having a canny mix of slower balls but he has largely kept his pace above 80mph in those crucial final stages.\n\nMore significant has been his control of line…",

    "description": "Muddled selection and the lack of a plan B - how Australia's T20 World Cup campaign was derailed in Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "After Monday's resounding defeat by Sri Lanka took World Cup fate out of his side's hands, Australia captain Mitchell Marsh asked for the luck of the Irish to kick in.\n\nThe following day, Ireland were due to take on Zimbabwe in Pallekele. Any points for the African side would knock Australia out of the competition.\n\nClearly, no-one told Marsh that when it comes to Irish luck in a cricketing context, rain is never far away. The two sides shared the points after wet weather saw the match abandoned without a ball bowled. Zimababwe through, Australia gone.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, there will not be an Australian side in the Super 8s stage or equivalent. Since winning it in 2021, this edition marks a third consecutive T20 World Cup without Australia in the semi-finals.\n\nLess than a month on from wrapping up a resounding Ashes drubbing, Australia's T20 side has failed to hit similar heights. The failings of this competition, which has seen them play all of their group games in Sri Lanka, alongside a wider slump in this format, does little to discard the notion that T20 cricket is not a priority.\n\nAs always after a difficult tournament, selection is questioned. Steve Smith has long been out of this side, not appearing in almost two years. A century and two 50s in the recent Big Bash were not enough to earn a recall. Not until Marsh was hit in the groin in training prior to Australia's first game against Ireland.\n\nSmith was summoned to acclimatise in Colombo in case he was required. He ultimately was, but not as a replacement for Marsh.\n\nAustralia's Test run machine eventually earned a place in the squad proper when the selectors belatedly named a replacement for Josh Hazlewood, who was ruled out of the competition before a ball was bowled.\n\nAll those moving parts for a player who only made it onto the park as a sub fielder while Australia were still mathematically alive, with Smith powerless to stop Sri Lanka and Pathum Nissanka's charge.\n\nThe decision to drop Matthew Renshaw for that defeat also reads as confusing. His 37 off 33 balls against Ireland was slow, but the Ireland camp highlighted how impressed they were given the tricky nature of the pitch. Next time out, Renshaw's 65 off 44 fell short of match-winning status against Zimbabwe.\n\nDropping him against Sri Lanka backfired. After Travis Head and Marsh's opening partnership of 104 off 8.3 overs, Australia looked well set. They lost the next three wickets for 26 runs, the middle order appearing to lack the stability previously provided by Renshaw.\n\n\"The reaction back home has been rather heavy because I think we've been sold down the stream a little bit in terms of our selection and how we've gone about preparing for this T20 World Cup,\" Australia's two-time 50-over World Cup winner Matthew Hayden told Test Match Special.\n\n\"It sort of smacks of England, and their questions in the Ashes preparation - this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of 'we're OK' and 'no, don't worry'. It's a mix of denial and maybe even just mismanagement.\n\n\"We enjoy coming to countries like Sri Lanka but we just haven't prepared for what we've seen. We've picked power hitters in finesse type conditions.\n\n\"[It's] almost like stubbornness but there is a plan A. And that plan A is called power. And it's a day and age of power. In India, that's certainly the case.\n\n\"These conditions [in Sri Lanka], though, are different. They're not such pure batting surfaces, and that requires methodology. It almost requires a bit more of an old school approach and way of thinking about the game that allows you to stay in the contest.\"\n\nAustralia's fast-bowling depth behind the big three of Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc looks strong in red-ball cricket. Just ask England.\n\nIn white-ball cricket, though, it's a different story. Starc has retired from the format while Cummins and Hazelwood are injured. It says plenty that, instead of calling up a bowler immediately once the latter went down, they waited until mid-tournament to call up Smith, a batter.\n\nWord from within the camp refuses to dwell too much on muddled selection or lack of depth.\n\n\"Looking down our list, honestly, it feels like there's more than enough talent to look after the situations in the games that we're playing,\" said Marsh after the Sri Lanka defeat.\n\n\"As much as we can talk about team line-up and who's in, who's out and that sort of thing, I think if everyone just looks after their role it should help [put] us in good stead.\"\n\nAll-rounder Cameron Green, who became the Indian Premier League's most expensive overseas signing when he was picked up for more than £2m by Kolkata Knight Riders in December, was criticised by Hayden having struggled to make an impact despite batting at number three.\n\n\"Cam Green has just looked awful with the bat,\" said Hayden. \"He looks woody, he looks tinny, he looks like he's just a man with no confidence, and I'd be very surprised if that's not exactly the case.\n\n\"Matt Renshaw has come with no baggage to this tournament. He actually had a really good series back home in Australia in the ODIs. He's been a man that's been very ill treated - there's no doubt he should be in the Test team too.\"\n\nThere is a wider question on Australia's cultural attitudes towards T20.\n\nWhile Big Bash crowds are healthy, this tournament has taken place at a difficult time for fans back home to watch. Only one Australian journalist has travelled to cover the team in Sri Lanka, reflecting how editors view the levels of public interest.\n\nIn that context, it seems easy to question to what extent this competition has been prioritised. Even if injuries ruled out players such as Cummins and Hazlewood, other senior players were told to prioritise the Big Bash finals instead of heading on the warm-up tour to Pakistan prior to this week's failing.\n\n\"Cricket Australia needs to have a look at their schedule, and they need to be able to manage their number one and primary resource, which is cricket talent,\" said Hayden.\n\n\"[They need to] find a way to just be a little more controlled, and a little more destined and built towards the purpose of Australian cricket.\"\n\nBefore that, however, Australia have one match remaining in this competition, against Oman on Friday.\n\nA dead rubber, the kind of match usually more associated with England in the Ashes.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Ireland and Australia have both been eliminated from the T20 World Cup as rain prevented play in the Group B game between the Irish and Zimbabwe at Pallekele Cricket Stadium in Kandy.\n\nZimbabwe's shock victory over Australia left them needing just a point on Tuesday to advance to the Super 8s with the match being a must-win for Ireland to retain any hope of advancing.\n\nAustralia, who suffered an eight-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka on Monday, were also banking on a win for Ireland to remain in the hunt for the next phase.\n\nBut with the rain unrelenting in Kandy the match was abandoned with both Ireland and Zimbabwe taking a point apiece.\n\nThat left Zimbabwe on five points and Ireland - whose four-game campaign is complete - on three, with Australia sitting on two and just one game remaining against Oman on Friday (13:30 GMT) which is now a dead rubber.\n\n\"It's very disappointing to go out in this fashion but it's completely uncontrollable,\" said Ireland stand-in skipper Lorcan Tucker.\n\n\"It looked like we were building momentum with the Oman win but unfortunately it came too late.\n\n\"I think when we look back there were moments, especially in the first game against Sri Lanka, which we didn't get quite right. It just wasn't to be - we started a bit slower than we wanted.\n\n\"Our group gained great experience from the tournament, for many it was their first World Cup. It's really competitive and shows the pressure elite cricketers are under.\n\n\"Those big moments, it's how you deal with them and process them.

    "fullText": "Oli Burke insists he has given little thought to a Scotland recall for the World Cup and is simply focusing on doing well for Union Berlin in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe 28-year-old joined Union on a long-term contract in the summer and has scored four goals this season, including a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\n\"I'm just focused on my football here and what happens, happens really,\" Burke, who earned the last of his 13 caps in 2020, said.\n\n\"I've not really thought too much on it. Obviously, I know there's a World Cup coming up, but I've not really been a part of it recently.\n\n\"I'm not really expecting anything. I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying football again, which is the most important thing for me.\n\n\"If I can, hopefully, do some good performances, score some more goals and hopefully that is catching the eye a little bit and gives me a chance, at least.\n\n\"Obviously, it's an absolute honour to wear the badge and represent your country. It's such a privilege. Obviously, I would really love that again and to have that experience again.\n\n\"I cannot think too much on that. I have to just stay focused and do the best I can here and see what happens.\"\n\nBurke is in his third spell in Germany, having made his first move to the Bundesliga in 2016, when he joined RB Leipzeg from Nottingham Forest for what was then a record fee for a Scottish player of £13m.\n\n\"I was young, the price tag, I didn't really know too much about it,\" he recalled. \"I didn't really understand it so much at that age. As I got older, it started to weigh a little bit.\n\n\"In football, everything happens quickly. You have your good moments and then there can be bad moments.\n\n\"It's been kind of like this throughout my career. Many ups and many downs.\"\n\nBurke, who joined Union from Werder Bremen, says the experience he has in Germany has developed him.\n\n\"I almost feel like a different player, but obviously that comes with maturing,\" he said. \"Knowing your job better and being more effective in your role, defensively as well.\n\n\"It's just about adapting really.\"\n\nIn 2019, Burke had a spell on loan to Celtic, who play Stuttgart on Thursday in the Europa League play-off, and he is predicting a difficult tie for his former club.\n\n\"Stuttgart are not an easy team,\" he said. \"They're doing brilliantly this season.\n\n\"Celtic are an amazing club. I love the club. I still watch here and there.\n\n\"I watched the Kilmarnock game the other day. I was saying to my wife 'they're going to score in the last minute' because it's just Celtic typical.\"\n\nKirkcaldy-born Burke also had a stint with Alaves in Spain after his time with Celtic.\n\n\"When you move abroad, it's also important to try and embed yourself into the culture quickly and become close with your team-mates as fast as you can,\" he added.\n\n\"Create a bond, not just on the pitch but off it as well, so that you feel more comfortable and you feel more at home.\"",

Every single day, I dreamed about scoring a hundred on this stage,\" said Samra, who is named after ex-India batter Yuvraj Singh.\n\n\"To do it here, in my first appearance [in Chennai], and as the youngest player in this World Cup – it's truly a dream come true.\"\n\nCanada captain Dilpreet Bajwa, who shared a 116-run stand with Samra for the first wicket, added: \"Hats off to Yuvraj, he finished with a hundred in this match and it's a proud moment for him and all Canadians.\"\n\nKiwi seamers Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Jimmy Neesham and Duffy all claimed one wicket apiece.\n\nNew Zealand had a brief wobble early in the chase when they lost openers Tim Seifert and Finn Allen in quick succession and slipped to 30-2.\n\nHowever, Canada's bowlers were unable to press home the advantage and an unbroken 146-run stand for the third wicket between Rachin Ravindra and Phillips got them home with 29 balls to spare.\n\nPhillips top-scored with a brutal 76 not out of 36 balls while Ravindra finished unbeaten with 59 off 39 deliveries.\n\nNew Zealand's victory sent them through and eliminated Canada in addition to the UAE and Afghanistan.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "England captain Leah Williamson returns to the squad for the first time since Euro 2025 as they prepare to begin their 2027 Women's World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nWilliamson, 28, missed England's friendly victories over China, Ghana and Australia as well as their defeat by Brazil at the end of 2025 due to a knee injury.\n\nThe Arsenal defender had surgery after lifting England's second successive European title in July and returned to action at the start of December.\n\n\"I'm very happy. It feels really good for her too. She has trained lots and I'm in close contact with her and the club,\" said manager Sarina Wiegman.\n\n\"There are more players who are still building and that is one of the reasons why we went with a bigger squad.\"\n\nSeveral big names return to the squad including Chelsea forward Lauren James, Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\n\nJames, 24, was absent for four months with an ankle injury before returning in November and is now back to full fitness.\n\nShe impressed in Sunday's win over Liverpool and boosts Wiegman's attacking options with Arsenal's Beth Mead out with a fractured shin.\n\nGreenwood, 32, missed the start of the season with a knee injury while Hampton had a thigh issue which ruled her out of the November camp.\n\nThere is a first senior call-up for London City Lionesses defender Poppy Pattinson, while uncapped 20-year-old Freya Godfrey retains her place in the squad.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck also earns a recall, with Manchester City's Khiara Keating dropping out of the squad.\n\n\"[Roebuck] came in the last camp of course because we had some injuries. She has got some minutes [with Villa] so it's really good to see her back, see her happy and being available. She is playing and training fully,\" added Wiegman.\n\n\"Keating will be with the under-23s. We all know she is a very talented goalkeeper. I had big concerns about her playing minutes over this last season.\n\n\"It's a long period of time. There is also competition with the other goalkeepers.\"\n\nGotham FC defender Jess Carter is back after she was given time to recover from the conclusion of the National Women's Soccer League play-offs in November.\n\nEngland are without Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, who is out with a hip injury until the end of March.\n\nBay FC defender Anouk Denton, 22, who made her debut as a late substitute in December, is not included in the squad.\n\nThe Lionesses travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThey are the first competitive games since England's success in Switzerland and they will meet reigning world champions Spain later in their qualifying group.\n\nThere are eight international windows before England hope to travel to Brazil for the World Cup between 24 June and 25 July 2027.\n\n\"It's a new year with new objectives as we start our qualification journey with these two very important fixtures against Ukraine and Iceland,\" said Wiegman.\n\n\"This is new opposition for this England team, so that's exciting too. I am looking forward to being back with the squad and getting back to work.\"\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nLondon City Lionesses defender Pattinson has featured for England's youth teams and is the latest to make the jump up to the senior squad.\n\nShe follows in the footsteps of team-mate Godfrey, who is yet to make her debut having been selected for the friendlies against Ghana and China.\n\nWiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to watch Pattinson in London City Lionesses' 2-1 defeat by Manchester United and delivered the news of her England call-up this week.\n\n\"It was a short conversation but she was really happy and really grateful. She can't wait to come in so that was a nice phone call,\" Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"She deserved the call-up because she has played really well. What we have seen the most is that she is very proactive and takes a lot of initiative.\n\n\"She can cover the whole wing on the left side. At the same time, she wants to play forward and is looking for passes forward which I thought was really good.\n\n\"Although she is not the tallest, she does use her body well in defence. Let's see how she relates to the other players we have in the squad.\"\n\nGoalkeepers: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride), Ellie Roebuck (Aston Villa)\n\nDefenders: Lucy Bronze (Chelsea), Jess Carter (Gotham), Grace Fisk (Liverpool), Alex Greenwood (Manchester City), Lotte Wubben-Moy (Arsenal), Maya Le Tissier (Manchester United), Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit), Taylor Hinds (Arsenal), Poppy Pattinson (London City Lionesses), Leah Williamson (Arsenal)\n\nMidfielders: Grace Clinton (Manchester City), Georgia Stanway (Bayern Munich), Keira Walsh (Chelsea), Laura Blindkilde Brown (Manchester City), Lucia Kendell (Aston Villa)\n\nForwards: Chloe Kelly (Arsenal), Lauren James (Chelsea), Aggie Beever-Jones (Chelsea), Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Lauren Hemp (Manchester City), Freya Godfrey (London City Lionesses), Jess Park (Manchester United)",

Ferguson is scheduled to rejoin the team during the Super 8s.\n\nA third win in Group D would seal New Zealand’s place in the next round alongside South Africa, England, West Indies, India and Sri Lanka.

But in the one-day international format, the Black Cups have won all three previous matches against Canada.\n\nCanada is last in the group following losses to United Arab Emirates and South Africa and will be knocked out of the tournament if it loses to New Zealand.\n\nLater Tuesday, Zimbabwe is aiming for a win over Ireland that would also knock 2021 champion Australia out in the first round of the tournament for the first time since 2009.

    "fullText": "The Lionesses return to competitive action next month as their campaign to qualify for the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil begins.\n\nSarina Wiegman's side travel to Turkey to face Ukraine on Tuesday, 3 March (17:00 GMT) before hosting Iceland at the City Ground on Saturday, 7 March (12:30).\n\nThere are just eight international camps before England hope to be in Brazil for the World Cup - so they will want to ensure there are no slip-ups in their first qualifying matches of the year.\n\nEngland have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.\n\nWiegman will name her squad for the first time in 2026 on Tuesday at 11:00 - who might feature and what are the key decisions for the Dutchwoman?\n\nSuccess in 2025 - are the Lionesses ready for 2026?\n\nEngland have not had a competitive fixture since winning Euro 2025 as they beat China 8-0 and Ghana 2-0 in friendly matches at the end of last year.\n\nBefore that, they suffered a 2-1 defeat by Brazil on their homecoming return but recorded a 3-0 win over Australia three days later.\n\nThe matches gave Wiegman an opportunity to test new players and formations - handing a debut to 30-year-old goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse in the process.\n\nAmong those to receive their first senior call-ups to the squad were defenders Anouk Denton, Taylor Hinds and forward Freya Godfrey.\n\nThere was also time for England stars Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze and Lauren James to recover from lengthy injuries.\n\nChelsea defender Millie Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final in 2023, announced her retirement in October having withdrawn from the Euros.\n\nThere was a serious blow for Arsenal forward Michelle Agyemang - one of England's key players in Switzerland - as she was carried off on a stretcher after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during the win over Australia.\n\nBut it's been a successful time for the other Lionesses in Arsenal's squad, including captain Williamson, who lifted the Champions Cup in February.\n\nAnd Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was named the world's best goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or awards in September, as Wiegman picked up the best coach award.\n\nHampton also wrapped up the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award in November after being caught up in the fallout of Mary Earps' autobiography, which was released earlier that month.\n\nMost of Wiegman's key players have returned from injury in recent weeks - but there will still be some noteable absentees.\n\nManchester United midfielder Ella Toone is out with a hip issue until the end of March so will not feature against Ukraine or Iceland.\n\nThere are not many midfield options available with Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns also absent, while team-mate Lucia Kendall came off the bench to play 28 minutes of Villa's 7-3 thrashing by Tottenham on Sunday - her first appearance in five weeks due to a thigh injury.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal winger Beth Mead fractured her shin so is out but Chloe Kelly made her return at the end of January and is available for selection.\n\nArsenal defender Hinds has had an ankle injury that has kept her out for a few weeks but she could still be included.\n\nChelsea full-back Niamh Charles is also sidelined with an ankle injury but team-mate Aggie Beever-Jones came on as an 83rd-minute substitute in their win over Liverpool on Sunday so her return is timely.\n\nTottenham full-back Ella Morris is close to returning from the ACL injury she suffered last year but will not be back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Agyemang and Arsenal defender Katie Reid are still recovering from their respective ACL injuries.\n\nThere remains a lack of full-back options for Wiegman with Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier seen as back-up for Bronze despite playing her club football at centre-back every week.\n\nCharles' absence and Hinds' recent injury means there are limited options at left-back too - meaning Manchester City's Alex Greenwood could once again make the switch from centre-back to full-back.\n\nThere could be a recall for Bay FC's Anouk Denton, who moved to the American club from West Ham in February, two months after making her England debut.\n\nLondon City Lionesses forward Godfrey has impressed this season and Wiegman was at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday to see her grab an assist in a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United.\n\nThe 20-year-old was called up for the first time in November but remains uncapped - so she will hope to feature this time around.\n\nTeam-mate Izzy Goodwin could be a surprise call-up in Beth Mead's absence, though Chelsea's James is back so Wiegman has other attacking options.\n\nWiegman will need to manage players like Kelly, Bronze and Keira Walsh who have not been fully fit in recent weeks and they may not be able to start both games.\n\nBut she will have been boosted by James' impressive display for Chelsea on Sunday, while Jess Park has shone for United and Lauren Hemp for Manchester City.",

Sam has been awesome, and he has been throughout this comp so far.\n\n“When Jof is on a heater, you want to get as much out of as possible – he did that today in his first couple of overs.”\n\nWithout question, England will need to bowl much better in the next stage of the tournament if they want to make the semi-finals.\n\nWhile Brook praised England’s bowlers, he did recognise that their batting unit must improve quickly.\n\n“We haven’t played our best cricket,” he added. “At the end of the day, we have made it through, and we’re heading to Sri Lanka, so we can be happy about that.\n\n“A little bit of a trend in this competition. We have not managed to string along the score as we like to do as a batting unit. We have got to keep on being brave and taking our options.”\n\n202 would normally be an excellent T20 score, but England would have hoped for at least 220 against cricket minnows Italy.\n\nBen Stokes finally has a rude awakening about importance of helmets in cricket\n\nMatthew Renshaw’s scathing interview reveals main culprit behind Australia’s disastrous loss vs. Zimbabwe\n\nSir Geoffrey Boycott reignites Joe Root debate after England’s T20 World Cup loss to West Indies",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Pallekele\n\nAustralia 181 all out (20 overs): Head 56 (29); Hemantha 3-37\n\nSri Lanka 184-2 (18 overs): Nissanka 100* (52), Kusal Mendis 51 (38)\n\nAustralia's hopes of reaching the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup are all but over after Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka hit a brilliant unbeaten 100 to condemn them to an eight-wicket defeat in Pallekele.\n\nStunned by Zimbabwe in their second outing on Friday, Australia needed a win to keep their qualification fate in their own hands but it is Sri Lanka who march into the next round.\n\nFor Australia to sneak through as the second-placed team from their group, they now need Zimbabwe to lose both of their remaining matches against Ireland and Sri Lanka and then to defeat Oman themselves which would bring net run-rate into play.\n\nAustralia's predicament came from their inability to convert a good start from their openers Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh as they set the home side a target of 182 after a collapse in the second half of their innings.\n\nDespite the feeling Sri Lanka could have a complicated chase on their hands because of a pitch which was slowing down, they eased to victory with the Australian bowling attack lacking any bite in the absence of injured Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc.\n\nAnd the Sri Lanka duo of Nissanka and Kusal Mendis took full advantage.\n\nWith wicketkeeper Mendis providing perfect support with a composed 51 from 38 balls, Nissanka brought up his century in 52 balls to take his side past the finish line with an innings that blended brute power and finesse.\n\nAustralia had Marsh return after recovering from a groin injury that forced him out of the first two matches and the returning skipper gave his side a solid platform batting alongside Head, who hit a long-overdue half-century off 27 balls.\n\nThey powered Australia to 104-0 in 8.2 overs before Head departed for 59 and it marked the beginning of dramatic downturn.\n\nMarsh followed him shortly after with a brisk 54 as they unravelled alarmingly to be bundled out for 181, losing their final five wickets in the space of just seven runs and 14 balls.\n\nWith Sri Lanka chasing down the target with ease, the Australians are left clinging to only the slimmest mathematical hope and will watch nervously as Zimbabwe face Ireland on Tuesday.\n\nIt looked as though Sri Lanka's chase of 182 might slip away early when Kusal Perera fell to Marcus Stoinis only eight balls in.\n\nBut it became clear almost immediately Nissanka was operating on an entirely different level in Pallekele, playing \"an innings for the ages,\" as Test Match Special commentator Daniel Norcross labelled it.\n\nNissanka raced to 38 off 20 balls to lift Sri Lanka to 61‑1 at the end of the powerplay.\n\nKusal Mendis then picked up the pace against Australia's spinners, bringing up his third consecutive half-century of this T20 World Cup in 35 balls before Nissanka joined him, reaching his fifty in just 32 deliveries.\n\nAustralia would have hoped for a way back after Mendis departed in the 13th over with Sri Lanka on 105‑2, and though Pavan Rathnayake walked in, he only needed to play second fiddle to Nissanka, who effortlessly took Sri Lanka past the target.\n\nThe 27‑year‑old Sri Lanka opener was outstanding in manipulating the leg‑side field all game, scoring 26 runs through mid‑wicket and another 20 through square leg.\n\nBut he mixed brutal hitting with plenty of finesse too, guiding 15 runs down to third with some deft late cuts.\n\nAdding extra sweetness to Nissanka's day was an extraordinary catch he took to dismiss Glenn Maxwell and keep Australia at bay in the closing stages of their innings.\n\nHaving dropped Maxwell in the previous over, Nissanka more than made up for it with a brilliant flying catch at backward point to send back the Australia all-rounder, who had looked dangerous.\n\nThough there will be concern for pacer Matheesha Pathirana, who walked off with an injury, Sri Lanka will fancy their chances of putting on a good show in the Super 8s and making it to the semi-finals, with both Nissanka and Mendis in good form.\n\nAustralia captain Mitchell Marsh: \"I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark but with the start we had, maybe a few short. Well played to Sri Lanka.\n\n\"We know that at our best we can make big scores but we lost our way a little bit at the end and Sri Lanka bowled well. Not much more to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us.\n\n\"It's a devastated group. We are in the lap of gods now. We haven't been at our best. We will watch the Zimbabwe vs Ireland game and hope.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka: \"One of the best performances in the recent times. Really happy with how the proceedings went.\n\n\"We were still very positive after losing [Pathirana] in the powerplay. We had the confidence and knew about the wicket. Each and every one showed a good body language today. And everyone wanted to contribute somehow.\n\n\"We hope to continue like this in the tournament. It's wonderful to qualify after many years. It's a good team. We should go to the next round and hopefully make to the semis. Thanks to the massive crowd today.\"\n\nNissanka's century leads Sri Lanka to victory and puts Australia on brink - as it happened\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers",

We don't want it to be that close and feel those nerves.\n\n\"But, going forward, it's more experience and we can never have enough of that.\"\n\nEngland progress at World Cup despite Italy scare\n\n'England have no chance at T20 World Cup if they do not improve'\n\nJofra Archer took two wickets in the first over of Italy's chase but Ben Menenti smashed 60 from 25 balls and Grant Stewart 45 from 22 to give Italy real hope.\n\nWith Stewart at the crease, the tournament's lowest-ranked side needed 30 runs from the final two overs for an almighty upset.\n\nThat England came through is obviously a positive. Sam Curran, who also defended 10 from the last over against Nepal, dismissed Stewart in the penultimate over.\n\nHe admitted there have been nerves throughout the initial group stage.\n\n\"It's actually just a tricky stage in a World Cup,\" Curran told the BBC.\n\n\"You're nervous, you've got all kinds of nerves and expectation.\n\n\"I had a little chat with Morgs [former England captain Eoin Morgan] before the toss and said these are the hardest games because we want to get there so badly.\n\n\"Now we've done it it's [about] enjoying it. This is our first aim and now we focus on the teams that we know will be in our group.\"\n\nEngland will play their entire Super 8s phase in Sri Lanka, where they recently beat the co-hosts 3-0 in a T20 series.\n\nTheir opponents are yet to be confirmed. If it goes to seeding then it will be Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand with the top two progressing to the semi-finals.\n\nJacks said he remains as confident in England as when the group left Sri Lanka at the start of the month.\n\n\"Going back to Sri Lanka, we feel confident there,\" he said. \"That experience is good for us.\n\n\"We've obviously done it the hard way, we've not made it easy. But the most important thing is we are on to the Super 8s.\"",

    "fullText": "It has been a miserable season for Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has made only three appearances for Barcelona and Girona. The 33-year-old missed almost the entire first half of the season as he was recovery from back surgery, and after moving to Montilivi, he featured twice before tearing his hamstring.\n\nThere is little chance of ter Stegen returning to action before April, which means he would have a matter of weeks to get himself up to speed ahead of this summer’s World Cup. He has hopes of being Germany’s starter at a major tournament for the very first time, although his injury woes have left these in tatters.\n\nRecent comments by Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann have appeared to back this up. As per Sempre Barca, he has admitted that ter Stegen’s current situation makes it difficult for him to be called up for the World Cup.\n\n“There are three things to consider regarding the goalkeeper position. It’s a tragic injury (for ter Stegen), which I deeply regret. I will never rule him out completely because it is his turn. We have to make the right decision for him and for us. And at the moment, the situation is not favourable.”\n\nGiven that he is 33 years of age, ter Stegen will not have too many years left in football – especially consider his recent injury woes. This summer’s World Cup would have been the perfect time for him to be a starter for Germany at a major tournament, and at this stage, it appears that it will pass him by.\n\nGermany have a number of talented younger goalkeepers rising through the ranks, such as Bayern Munich’s Jonas Urbig and Freiburg’s Noah Atubolu. Both will fancy their chances of ousting ter Stegen in the coming years, and especially before the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco.",

    "description": "After weeks of debate about whether Pakistan's fixture against India would go ahead at the T20 World Cup, the action failed to deliver and it left the rivalry feeling more political than sporting.",
    "fullText": "Colombo awoke to its greyest sky of the week come Sunday morning. A portent, perhaps, of the weather forecast which briefly caused a scare prior to India's dominant win over Pakistan later that evening.\n\nIt certainly mirrored the cloud lurking over the build-up to cricket's most-charged derby. Pakistan relented on their original decision to boycott the fixture in solidarity with Bangladesh, who had to forfeit their place in this T20 World Cup when refused dispensation to play their games outside of India.\n\nArguably more interest stemmed from the pageantry of Sunday's game than from the actual cricket. Plenty were on handshake-watch given recent history between these two. Polite formalities did not return at the toss, Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nTo be ready for the myriad cameras capturing the flip of the coin, both captains have to be in place a good two minutes before getting on with the ceremony. When mired in such awkwardness, it seems an eternity.\n\nEnough time for a detail-oriented TV producer to spot that Salman, Pakistan's skipper, sported a kink in his collar. The scruffy schoolboy-look was rectified by an anonymous figure inadvertently stealing the situation's authority. It certainly detracted from the attempted strong-man image projected by stubborn leaders.\n\nAs did the behaviour of the ex-pros off the pitch. On the ICC broadcast, Rohit Sharma and Wasim Akram warmly greeted before walking the tournament trophy onto the field. Away from the cameras, Harbhajan Singh, Misbah Ul-Haq and Ramiz Raja were spotted in cordial conversation in the media area.\n\nThe stadium certainly felt different to earlier World Cup matches at this venue. A perimeter was set multiple blocks from the ground. Bags were inspected long before the entrance. And again upon arrival. The Sri Lankan special task force, previously unseen at this tournament, was out in force, automatic weapons on full display.\n\nEven the price of a fake jersey among street vendors shot up amid India-Pakistan inflation. Local entrepreneurs were delighted the fixture went ahead. As were the swarming hotels. Such was the influx in India's accommodation that Mohammed Siraj could not squeeze into the lift on his morning commute.\n\nThe backdrop reflected the magnitude of the occasion, but not necessarily any tension. That didn't come until the toss. Albeit there were some murmurs of discontent at the choice of pre-match music. Indian rapper Hanumankind performed with his dance troupe and pyrotechnics aplenty.\n\nHe appeared on the soundtrack to Dhurandhar, a movie released last year, the political undertones of which were not well received in Pakistan where the film is banned. Shortly after Sunday's performance concluded, the call to prayer could be heard from a local mosque. The cricketing gods have a sense of humour.\n\nBoth camps were reluctant to really delve into the off-field narratives. \"In these games the emotions are always going to be high but we need to deal with that,\" said Salman.\n\n\"We have played enough cricket and games like this. You have to see the bigger picture and win our next game to qualify for the Super 8s.\"\n\nKishan goes crazy as India hammer Pakistan\n\nOnce the cricket finally started, Ishan Kishan's belligerent hitting delighted the Indian-heavy crowd - which, it should be said, was not at capacity. Usman Tariq's curious action, his pause akin to Jorginho's jump when taking a penalty, dominated pre-match chat. He failed to remain the protagonist of the contest itself, albeit he did cheekily bow towards Suryakumar upon dismissing the man who was filmed mimicking his ways during Indian net sessions.\n\nAt the mid-innings break, some dared to think we could have a chase on our hands with Pakistan needing 176. India's dominant powerplay, taking four wickets and conceding just 39 runs, put a swift end to such notions.\n\nThe scoreline in this match-up at T20 World Cups now reads 8-1 in favour of India. This rivalry has become political, rather than a sporting one. As tedious as the interference is, it offers more to discuss than one side consistently outclassing the other.\n\nAs if aware of this, in a lull during Pakistan's inevitable defeat, the ICC replayed the cordial exchange between Wasim and Rohit prior to the match. Aren't we all getting along just fine? Just not to the extent that players shook hands once India wrapped up their shellacking. That sign of respect continues to feel some way off.\n\n\"We see them as a team - we are not thinking about this as a rivalry or whatever,\" said India's Axar Patel.\n\n\"We are playing against one team and we are focusing on cricket. Whenever I'm playing, I'm not thinking about whatever, I treat it as one match and opponent.\"\n\nAfter the final wicket, Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube did not feel they had hit their desired workloads. The former bowled three overs in the match, the latter was not required. Out came bowling coach Morne Morkel to catch extra work with his baseball mitt. Opposition resoundingly dealt with yet more reps needed.\n\nAn apt reflection, not that it was required, of this contest's non-existent relationship with the sort of jeopardy required to make us all forget the politics.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nWhy is there talk about a Pakistan spinner's action?",

    "fullText": "The T20 World Cup heads into the final week of group-stage fixtures with six spots in the Super 8s still up for grabs.\n\nWest Indies were the first team to qualify for the next phase, while India joined them with victory over Pakistan later on Sunday.\n\nHere's what the remaining teams need to progress to the next stage.\n\nThe top two teams in each group - A to D - will progress to the Super 8s, which will be made up of two groups of four.\n\nIf any teams are level on points after the four group-stage fixtures, they will be separated by number of wins and then net run-rate.\n\nThe International Cricket Council has pre-determined the Super 8 groups if the eight seeded sides qualify:\n\nX Group: India (X1), Australia (X2), West Indies (X3), South Africa (X4)\n\nY Group: England (Y1), New Zealand (Y2), Pakistan (Y3), Sri Lanka (Y4)\n\nIf any of those sides do not progress, the teams who do in their place will just fill the spot.\n\nEach team plays three more matches in the Super 8s phase, facing each of the other teams in their group once.\n\nAfter those fixtures, the top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winner of each Super 8s group facing the runner-up from the other.\n\nRemaining games: Pakistan v Namibia (18 Feb, 09:30) and India v Netherlands (18 Feb, 13:30)\n\nDefending champions India sealed their place in the Super 8s with a comfortable 61-run win over rivals Pakistan.\n\nPakistan slipped to third with that defeat, with their net run-rate taking a heavy hit.\n\nHowever, a win in their final game against Namibia on Wednesday would see them progress.\n\nUSA have played all of their games and are currently second but need Pakistan to lose their final game and for the Netherlands to lose or not overtake their net run-rate if they win.\n\nThe Netherlands must beat India, hope Pakistan lose and then it could come down to net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: Australia v Sri Lanka (16 Feb, 13:30), Ireland v Zimbabwe (17 Feb 09:30 GMT), Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe (19 Feb, 09:30), Australia v Oman (20 Feb, 13:30)\n\nSri Lanka will progress with a win over Australia on Monday. If they lose they would likely need to beat Zimbabwe and then it could come down to net run-rate. Two wins would guarantee progression.\n\nAustralia would be eliminated if they lose to Sri Lanka on Monday and Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday. They may need to win both their remaining games and rely on net run-rate.\n\nZimbabwe will guarantee progression with two wins. One win potentially may be enough but it would come down to net run-rate.\n\nIreland need to win their last match and hope other results go their way because they can only qualify on net run-rate.\n\nRemaining games: England v Italy (16 Feb, 09:30), Scotland v Nepal (17 Feb, 13:30), West Indies v Italy (19 Feb, 05:30)\n\nWest Indies secured their progression with a nine-wicket win over Nepal on Sunday.\n\nEngland must beat Italy on Monday to progress. A defeat would likely see them eliminated on net run-rate.\n\nScotland need to beat Nepal and hope Italy beat England but do not overtake their net run-rate.\n\nItaly must beat England but could lose to West Indies and then net run-rate would decide who progresses. Two wins would see them through, as would a win against England and a washed-out game against West Indies.\n\nRemaining games: Afghanistan v UAE (16 Feb, 05:30 GMT), New Zealand v Canada (17 Feb, 05:30 GMT), South Africa v UAE (18 Feb, 05:30 GMT), Afghanistan v Canada (19 Feb, 13:30 GMT)\n\nSouth Africa are in a strong position to progress and their spot could be sealed on Monday if UAE lose to Afghanistan. Regardless of that result, a win against UAE on Wednesday would confirm their progression.\n\nNew Zealand likely need to win and hope that UAE do not win both of their games. If both of those things happen then net run-rate would decide who moves through.\n\nUAE likely need to win both of their remaining games and even then are likely to be relying on net run-rate to progress.\n\nAfghanistan need to win both of their matches, including one against UAE, and hope that neither UAE or New Zealand pick up points in their final game.\n\nCanada need to win both their remaining fixtures and will need other results to go their way.\n\nRun-rate is the average number of runs scored per over by a team in their entire innings - so, for example, a score of 140 off 20 overs equals seven runs per over.\n\nNet run-rate is calculated by subtracting the opposition's run-rate from the other team's run-rate.\n\nThe winning side will therefore have a positive net run-rate, and the losers a negative net run-rate.\n\nIn a tournament, net run-rate is worked out by taking the average runs per over scored by that team in each game and subtracting the average runs per over scored against them in each game.\n\nIf a team is bowled out inside their allotted overs, their run-rate is calculated by dividing the runs by the maximum overs they could have batted - 20 overs in the case of this tournament.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group A, Colombo\n\nIndia 175-7 (20 overs): Kishan 77 (40); Ayub 3-25\n\nPakistan 114 (18 overs): Usman 44 (34); Hardik 2-16, Chakravarthy 2-17, Bumrah 2-17\n\nIndia continued their recent on-field dominance over Pakistan by winning their highly anticipated meeting in Colombo by 61 runs to confirm their place in the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion and doubt over whether the match would even go ahead, India ultimately proved too strong and sealed a ninth successive win in completed matches against their rivals.\n\nAlthough the captains did not shake hands at the toss and there were no exchanges between the players after the final play, the rest of the match passed without any flashpoints amid the ongoing political tensions between the two nations and last year's military conflict.\n\nThe encounter was effectively won by a brutal early assault by India opener Ishan Kishan, who struck 77 from 40 balls on a tricky, turning pitch.\n\nIt gave co-hosts a flying start and meant, even with Pakistan's plethora of spinners slowing the scoring and taking wickets, they still posted 175-7.\n\nThat always felt a challenging total and Hardik Pandya took a wicket in the first over of the chase and Jasprit Bumrah two in the second to all but confirm the result.\n\nUsman Khan struck some blows in making 44 but Pakistan were swept aside - all out for 114 in 18 overs.\n\nWhile India are now certain to progress as they attempt to retain the title won in 2024, Pakistan must beat Namibia on Wednesday to guarantee their place in the Super 8s.\n\nShould they do so, the rivals could yet meet again in this competition in a semi-final or final.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup Super 8s?\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nFor a while it looked like this match would not happen.\n\nPakistan, whose last win against India was at the Asia Cup in 2022, announced a boycott a week before the tournament began, only to reverse their decision at the start of this week after extensive talks.\n\nIt went ahead, in front of a large crowd weighted towards Indian blue, because it is the most lucrative fixture in the world game, providing the funds upon which cricket's ecosystem survives in its current imperfect state.\n\nHow long that remains the case given India's dominance, built from their cricketing and financial might, remains to be seen.\n\nKishan's assault gave India breathing space and their bowlers were ruthless, even if their fielders dropped three catches.\n\nAfter Pakistan's seamers went the distance, Hardik began with a wicket maiden - dismissing right-hander Sahibzada Farhan, who skewed a pull shot high to mid-on.\n\nIn the next over, the majestic Bumrah pinned left-hander Saim Ayub in front with full inswinger, before Pakistan Salman Agha holed out playing a wild slog.\n\nEven Pakistan's biggest name, Babar Azam, was tamely bowled for five attempting a swipe to left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the fifth over, while left-handers Mohammed Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf meekly picked out fielders in the deep.\n\nAfter all of the build-up this was another underwhelming meeting.\n\nKishan's innings was an outlier across the match. He scored at a strike-rate of 192.50 per 100 balls. Only one other batter to face more than five deliveries, Shivam Dube - who made 27 from 17 balls - went at more than 130.\n\nOf the first 88 runs in the match, 77 came off the bat of Kishan as he made his second 50 in a row at this World Cup.\n\nHe was fortunate to chip three swings into gaps but otherwise hit cleanly in all directions until he was bowled by Ayub in the ninth over.\n\nSwitching through six different spinners, Pakistan's fightback came too late with mystery spinner Usman Tariq held back too long.\n\nAyub had Tilak Verma lbw for a stodgy 25 from 24 balls before Hardik hit his next ball to long-off. Had Ayub's hat-trick ball not narrowly missed Dube's edge and stumps after turning sharply, Pakistan may have had a better chance.\n\nTheir decision to bowl first also seemed a misstep, with the ball skidding through later on.\n\nDube was left to push India beyond 150 which was probably a par total in the conditions.\n\nIn truth, little went right for Pakistan.",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses the potential long-term impact of England's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, and the challenge of facing Ireland at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.\n\nI can easily reel off the losses that stuck with me in the Six Nations, as they can take you to a really dark place at times.\n\nScotland 2000, Ireland 2001 and France 2002 - they all still hurt.\n\nI was involved in all those campaigns and came up short of a Grand Slam by one victory three consecutive times.\n\nIt is important now to take stock and remember that defeat will happen again at some point before the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland will lick their wounds after yet another crushing defeat by Scotland, but even if a potential Grand Slam has gone, they still have a championship to play for.\n\nThe chance to win a Grand Slam does not come around very often, and that is the reality.\n\nLast week I said it would be foolish to draw a straight line from the opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider in Paris.\n\nThis tournament is magical for exactly that reason.\n\nTwo wins and England will be in a position to go to Paris and perhaps try to win the championship.\n\nThere is plenty to focus on and be excited about, and that Murrayfield pain will make England a better team.\n\nBig away wins are not easy in the Six Nations, and Saturday is another one that eluded Steve Borthwick.\n\nIt is not just about winning on another pitch as the World Cup is on neutral soil in Australia.\n\nIt is about the different feeling outside the Twickenham environment and home comforts.\n\nAs impressive as the 12-game winning run was, England still need that South African mentality - wherever you go in the world, you are expected to win and be globally successful.\n\nBorthwick is still yet to travel to Scotland, Ireland or France in the Six Nations and win.\n\nMost adversity comes from playing away from home, and Saturday gave the England players more of those scenarios.\n\nIt is very unlikely they will win a World Cup without a statement away victory beforehand.\n\nThere is a lot happening in these high-pressure games, and for high-paced players it is happening more quickly both physically and mentally.\n\nUnfortunately for Henry Arundell, who was being ultra-competitive, you have to read situations like the one when he took out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nEngland found themselves in a position where they were not playing well and were losing the scraps.\n\nIn those situations, you need clarity as well as competitiveness, and a red card obviously does not help to swing the momentum back.\n\nThat decision has cost England dearly and, given how competitive that wing slot is, I am sure Borthwick is going to have to manage that scenario.\n\nHenry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision.\n\nWhat if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game?\n\nYou have to make good decisions under pressure. Being in those situations more often will help players learn.\n\nSix Nations: Scotland regain the Calcutta Cup\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nEngland will be licking their lips at the opportunity to bounce back against Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWe know England can perform with the comfort of home support, so it is not about putting things right - that will come in games in Rome and Paris.\n\nIt is about building on what they did prior to the Scotland game. Sometimes you have to park a game, write it off and move on.\n\nI thought I had seen England drift away from the kick-heavy style and strategy.\n\nScotland put on an attacking masterclass, whereas when England did attack it felt like they were punching for their lives but not actually landing anything.\n\nThey lacked shape, going left and right without making any progress - like a boxer on the ropes punching for their life but not actually hitting anything.\n\nGeorge Ford's failed drop-goal felt like a last-ditch option, which then resulted in what Borthwick described as a 10-point swing.\n\nI do not think you can blame Ford, the sequence was not set up properly and it felt like tired minds all over the place.\n\nDealing with a fast and furious game is, once again, a learning curve to take forward.\n\nTwo years ago there was plenty of talk that Ireland were going to beat England by 30 points at Twickenham.\n\nIt was such a mismatch in terms of where both sides were in their development.\n\nMarcus Smith's late drop-goal denied Ireland a potential Grand Slam, and that was a huge moment in Borthwick's tenure.\n\nNow England come in as favourites - it is amazing how quickly the landscape changes.\n\nHaving lost badly against France and nearly drawn against Italy, Ireland will be annoyed that everyone is writing them off.\n\nThey are a well-motivated team under Andy Farrell and are very well drilled.\n\nIreland will come out and probably play their best game of the campaign.\n\nScotland, in the space of a week, turned their disappointing loss in Rome into a convincing display against England.\n\nThat is how quickly things can change.\n\nDefeat next weekend and the pressure builds on England, with two difficult away fixtures to finish.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Group C, Kolkata\n\nScotland 152 (19.4 overs): Berrington 49 (32); Rashid 3-36, Archer 2-23\n\nEngland 155-5 (18.2 overs): Banton 63 (41), Bethell 32 (28); Davidson 1-12\n\nEngland had another wobble but got their T20 World Cup campaign back on track with a five-wicket victory over Scotland in Kolkata - a result that leaves the Scots on the brink of a group-stage exit.\n\nAfter dismissing Scotland for 152 on a good batting pitch, England lost Phil Salt and Jos Buttler in the first two overs and were 86-4 when Harry Brook was caught for four.\n\nDefeat would have had England facing a humiliating early exit but Tom Banton fought his way through the tension to play the most important innings of his international career to date and secure victory with 10 balls to spare.\n\nHe broke the shackles by hitting spinner Mark Watt for consecutive sixes and finished 63 not out around contributions of 32 from Jacob Bethell and 28 by Sam Curran.\n\nScotland's application with the ball and in the field was admirable. They were ultimately punished for not taking advantage of the platform set by captain Richie Berrington's 49, which had his side 113-3 in the 13th over.\n\nAdil Rashid overcame an expensive start to finish with 3-36 for England, while an improved Jofra Archer took two wickets in the powerplay and finished with 2-23.\n\nIt means England will confirm their place in the Super 8s by beating Italy on Monday.\n\nScotland play Nepal in their final group match on Tuesday but may have been eliminated by other results by then.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport\n\nHaving been lucky to escape against Nepal and been convincingly beaten by West Indies, England are still searching for a complete performance at this World Cup.\n\nThey have won World Cups before despite group-stage defeats but improvement is needed if they are to threaten the best in this tournament.\n\nScotland's opening bowling consisted of Brandon McMullen and Brad Currie's medium pace. They found far more movement than England's bowlers and Salt and Buttler sliced catches to the off-side ring for two and three respectively.\n\nThere were no boundaries off the bat in the first four overs.\n\nBethell brought some calm with his patient knock but England were ultimately grateful to Banton who had not lived up to his talents in his previous 36 internationals.\n\nUnlike Bethell, who was caught trying to help a scoop over short fine leg, and Brook - dismissed in the same fashion - Banton played straight and as a result looked more comfortable than any other batter.\n\nHe took only six from his first 10 deliveries and did not hit a boundary until his 11th.\n\nCurran hit two sixes to accelerate England towards the finish line and Will Jacks hit the winning runs, but it was Banton who delivered when England needed him most.\n\nThough Scotland's score always looked 20 runs below par, England were troubled at one stage.\n\nThey took three wickets in the powerplay, including Archer having the dangerous George Munsey and number three Brandon McMullen miscuing pulls in a lively opening spell of three overs, but Berrington countered impressively.\n\nBerrington, a good player of slow bowling, was particularly aggressive against England's spinners. He hit Rashid for two fours and a six in his second over and was the aggressor in a partnership of 71 with Tom Bruce.\n\nAt 113-3 in the 13th over, 190 was Scotland's target. Instead, the wicket of Bruce resulted in the innings sliding away.\n\nHe slog-swept Liam Dawson to deep square leg for 24 - one of six batters to wastefully pick out fielders in the deep.\n\nIn the next over Rashid pinned the sweeping Berrington in front as England's leg-spinner, having gone wicketless for 26 runs in his first two overs, took 3-10 in his second spell.\n\nDawson, who took 2-34, added the wicket of Michael Leask, also caught in the deep.\n\nScotland's collapse 5-14 in 3.3 overs ultimately denied them the 30 runs that could have kept them alive in this tournament.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group D, Ahmedabad\n\nNew Zealand 175-7 (20 overs): Chapman 48 (26); Jansen 4-40\n\nSouth Africa 178-3 (17.1 overs): Markram 86* (44), Miller 24* (17)\n\nSouth Africa won by seven wickets\n\nAiden Markram scored a blistering unbeaten 86 as South Africa raced to a seven-wicket win over New Zealand to maintain their 100% record at the T20 World Cup.\n\nSet 176, the Proteas surged to 83-1 after the powerplay as their captain, assisted by Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton, brutally took down the Black Caps bowlers.\n\nMarkram brought up his half century from 19 balls - the joint-fastest of the tournament - with a straight six and with just seven overs of the chase gone, the outcome was never in doubt.\n\nNew Zealand managed to slow the run-rate but it was much too late and South Africa got over the line with 17 deliveries to spare, Markram finishing with eight fours and four sixes in his 44-ball knock.\n\nVictory puts the Proteas on the brink of qualification for the Super 8s and New Zealand still highly likely to join them if they beat Canada in their final Group D game.\n\nBlack Caps openers Finn Allen and Tim Seifert had come out swinging after their side batted first.\n\nAllen hit four fours and two sixes for his 17-ball 31 before Marco Jansen (4-40) crucially took three wickets in quick succession to bring South Africa back into the game.\n\nThe seamer sent back Seifert for 13 in his first over before dismissing Rachin Ravindra and Allen in the space of four balls in the final over of the powerplay.\n\nMark Chapman and Daryl Mitchell rebuilt the innings and New Zealand were scoring at around 10-an-over for more than half the innings.\n\nThey were 138-5 when Chapman fell to the last ball of the 14th over, having made 48 from 26 balls, with their opponents able to drag it back from there and restrict New Zealand to 175-7.\n\nIt appeared short at the halfway stage and within a few balls of the reply, that was confirmed.\n\nMarkram and De Kock got after opening bowlers Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson from the off, then gave Jacob Duffy the same treatment when he came on.\n\nFerguson bowled De Kock with a slower ball but there was no slowing the Proteas as Markram continued his charge, first alongside Rickelton then Dewald Brevis, who both made 21.\n\nMarkram was able to watch from the non-striker's end as David Miller finished the job in style - launching Ferguson into the stands for a monstrous six.\n\nSouth Africa will official qualify for the Super 8s if the United Arab Emirates fail to beat Afghanistan on Monday.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Gennaro Gattuso and his coaching staff have been busy speaking and meeting with a long list of players ahead of the World Cup play-offs in March, and according to recent reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, there are currently around 50 players on the Italy national team radar. Here is a look at all of them.\n\nItaly have not yet secured their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America and must go through the play-offs if they are to avoid missing out on the final tournament for the third cycle in a row.\n\nThe Azzurri will play against Northern Ireland in Bergamo on March 26 in the World Cup play-off semi-final, and should they win that game, they will progress to a one-legged play-off final away against either Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina a few days later: A one-off knock-out match for a spot at the World Cup.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 16: Pio Esposito of Italy celebrates scoring his team’s first goal during the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Norway at San Siro Stadium on November 16, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nGattuso and his staff had sought to bring the national team squad together once more before the World Cup play-offs in March, given that they have not got together since the end of the November international break.\n\nThis has not been possible, however, largely due to a congested fixture schedule at club level.\n\nInstead, Gattuso and his staff have arranged a series of meetings and dinners with groups of Italy players and national team hopefuls over the last few months in an attempt to keep the squad somewhat together.\n\nHere is the long list of players Gattuso has supposedly spoken to ahead of the World Cup play-offs.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 05: Gianluigi Donnarumma of Italy warms up prior to the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier match between Italy and Estonia at Stadio di Bergamo on September 05, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy.

    "description": "Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott calls, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.\n\nThe two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.\n\nIndia versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.\n\nFew sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.\n\nIt also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.\n\nA week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.\n\nBut what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.\n\nWith the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.\n\nFor a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.\n\nThe tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.\n\nHotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.\n\n“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.\n\n“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”\n\nIt’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.\n\nThese short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.\n\nAnother relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.\n\nAsanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.\n\n“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.\n\n“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”\n\nThe lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.\n\nSo while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.\n\nPakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.\n\nThe reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.\n\nSri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.\n\nSri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.\n\nSri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.\n\nWhen Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.\n\n“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.\n\n“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”\n\nA little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.\n\nCome Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Men's T20 World Cup, Group B, Colombo\n\nIreland 235-5 (20 overs): Tucker 94* (51); Ahmed 3-33\n\nOman 139 all out (18 overs): Kaleem 50 (29); Little 3-16\n\nStand-in captain Lorcan Tucker hit an unbeaten 94 to lead Ireland to a 96-run win over Oman at the T20 World Cup.\n\nHaving lost their opening games against Sri Lanka and Australia, Ireland needed both victory and a boost to their net run-rate to have any hopes of progression.\n\nWhat was to be a first win at the tournament since beating England in 2022 looked in doubt when Tucker came to the crease with his side 25-2, but the wicketkeeper equalled his highest score in the format to power Ireland to 235-5 by the end of their innings.\n\nDespite Aamir Kaleem providing a half-century, Oman wickets fell quickly with Josh Little leading the way for Ireland's bowlers with three wickets for 16 runs.\n\nIreland play Zimbabwe on Tuesday (09:30 GMT) still needing a win and other results to go their way if they are to make the Super 8s.\n\nBrilliant Muzarabani helps Zimbabwe stun Australia\n\nWhile Tucker filled in for the injured Paul Stirling as captain, it was Tim Tector who opened the batting in place of the Belfast man.\n\nIreland's struggles for a top-order partnership, however, continued with Shakeel Ahmed doing the damage.\n\nThe 38-year-old, celebrating wickets in the style of Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, accounted for Tim Tector (5), Ross Adair (14) and Harry Tector (14) during the powerplay with Ireland reeling somewhat on 47-3 after six overs.\n\nWith Curtis Campher, who provided 12 off seven balls, not sticking around either, it was up to all-rounder Gareth Delany to team up with Tucker and give Ireland's innings some much needed momentum.\n\nThe pair's 101-run partnership off 56 balls took Ireland from what was a shaky start to a position that would lead to their highest ever T20 international total.\n\nWhile there were seven boundaries among Delany's 56 off 30 balls, it was Tucker's efforts that were to provide the headline act.\n\nAn inventive knock that featured 10 fours and four sixes, the only scare came when, with Ireland 67-4, Vinayak Shukla appeared to have him stumped only for the third umpire to judge that Oman's wicketkeeper had dislodged the bails without the ball in his hand.\n\nTucker certainly made the most of the reprieve, pressing on for what is the best knock of the tournament so far, eclipsing Tim Seifert's 89 against UAE for New Zealand.\n\nHe would end the innings frustratingly stranded at the non-striker's end, denied the chance for what would have been a first T20 century as George Dockrell, who plundered 35 from nine balls, faced the final three deliveries.\n\nIf 93 runs in the final five overs of Ireland's innings had appeared to leave the result a formality, Heinrich Malan's side will have had improving their net run-rate on the mind too.\n\nOman were 63-2 after the powerplay, and brought up their 100 in the 11th over, both ahead of the pace set by Ireland, but wickets feel too cheaply to ever bring such a target into realistic focus.\n\nAamir Kaleem led the way with the 44-year-old becoming the oldest player in T20 World Cup history to make a half-century, reaching his fifty in 28 deliveries to break the record set by team-mate Muhammad Nadeem against Sri Lanka only on Thursday.\n\nMost encouraging for Ireland's bowlers was the performance of Josh Little.\n\nThe seamer, who had been without a wicket in his past four T20 internationals, finished with figures of 3-16.\n\nThe 26-year-old, whose 4-23 against Sri Lanka at this tournament in 2021 built his reputation as Ireland's most dangerous quick, had been left out of the side for the opening two games this time around.\n\nBowling with a menacing pace throughout, the left-armer was denied a wicket with his fifth delivery when Ireland's struggles in the field at this tournament continued as Delany dropped Aamir in the deep.\n\nHe came back, however, to claim the wickets of Muhammad Nadeem, Jiten Ramanandi, Nadeem Khan to take away any remote hopes of an Oman victory.",

    "fullText": "Brad Currie's biography on social media platform X reads: \"21/22 OR: 1k. 22/23 OR: 1.8k.\"\n\nHe will likely open the bowling for Scotland against England at the T20 World Cup on Saturday, but those numbers do not reference his cricket stats.\n\nInstead, they are Currie's record playing Fantasy Football because online he is known by another name, 'FPL Schofield'.\n\nThere he runs an account with thousands of followers offering tips and tactics on the online football game.\n\n\"My notes page on my iPad is filled with FPL transfers and fixtures rotations,\" Currie tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"My YouTube algorithm is just FPL videos galore. My Twitter is nothing other than football and even my TikTok.\n\n\"My girlfriend absolutely hates it.\"\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nThe Office, Willy Wonka & Denmark at Euro 92 - Scotland's chaotic WC prep\n\nCurrie, 27, was once ranked 30th in the world in a game now played by almost 13 million people.\n\nPlaying a World Cup in India comes with one obvious problem - the five-and-a-half-hour time difference to the UK.\n\nThis week's Premier League matches kicked off in the early hours and the deadlines to make transfers were late at night.\n\n\"I can't figure out a way to get the games on and I am even struggling to see highlights.\n\n\"It has been absolute torture, but thankfully it is the FA Cup this weekend.\"\n\nThough the secret has started to come out, the professional cricket world was initially unaware of Currie's alter ego.\n\nThese days he gets messages from team-mates and opponents asking for advice.\n\n\"[Sussex bowler] Sean Hunt is one,\" Currie says.\n\n\"He messaged me a screenshot before our West Indies game and said: 'I know you have bigger things at play, but what do you think of my team?'\n\n\"The other day he said: 'What do you think of my team? Oh and well bowled.'\"\n\nSo what about a tip for the rest of the FPL season?\n\n\"Chip strategy,\" Currie replies quickly. \"Dead-end into Gameweek 31. Wildcard in 32. Bench boost 33.\n\n\"Triple captain whenever you want.\"\n\nCurrie is the brother of Scott - the Scotland bowler who was called up by England last year.\n\nThey both qualify for Scotland via their Scottish dad, having grown up on England's south coast. Left-armer Brad studied sports psychology at Bournemouth University.\n\nA lifelong fan, Brad was at the Cherries' 3-2 win over Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium - when Amine Adli scored a 95th-minute winner against the Premier League champions - the day he got the call from coach Owen Dawkins to tell him he had made Scotland's World Cup squad.\n\n\"I said to my mate: 'I know exactly what this is, but I can't pick this up because I won't get any signal,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I got to the phone later and Dawks said: 'That was a good result, wasn't it?'\n\n\"I said: 'Yeah, and I hope you're not going to ruin my mood now.'\"\n\nHaving been pipped at qualifying by the Netherlands and Italy, Scotland got a place at this World Cup when Bangladesh opted to boycott the tournament.\n\nThe preceding weeks were uncertain, filled with claims and counterclaims about whether the Tigers would take part and what it would mean for Scotland if they did not. Even the players were not immune.\n\n\"I was at Sussex training in the indoor school and was asking all of the powers that be and the coaching staff,\" Currie says.\n\n\"It was crazy to have people saying we were going. I just thought, 'you know more than me and I am one of the players in the official Scotland group chat'.\"\n\nAs a county pro at Sussex, Currie was fortunate he had been training through the winter.\n\nBowlers' workloads are notoriously important to manage, however, and Scotland's focus switched from the Cricket World Cup League 2 at the end of March to a T20 World Cup in India at the start of February.\n\n\"I don't know what date it officially got announced but the two days after were the weekend and I just did nothing,\" he says.\n\n\"My girlfriend's family were like: 'Should you not be training? Should you not be doing something?'\n\n\"You can't cram in. You just will get injured. It is not like a school test where you can cram in revision.\"\n\nUncertainty also surrounded the availability of the younger Currie brother.\n\nDespite being picked by England for the tour of Ireland last year, he did not make his debut, leaving some to wonder if he could switch back to the Scots.\n\nAs it turned out, one spell as a substitute fielder made him ineligible.\n\n\"I had to text him and ask,\" Brad says.\n\n\"My heart sank because there are loads of brothers out here playing.\n\n\"We have just played the Manentis and the Moscas [against Italy]. There's the Sheikh brothers [Nepal] as well.\n\n\"It probably would have forced Mum and Dad to remortgage the house and get some flights out but there's only one son out here so it's not needed.\n\n\"He is going to try and please Mum and play for England, but I am going to keep Dad sweet and stick to my Scottish genes.\"\n\nEngland's defeat by West Indies effectively means Saturday's encounter is a must-win for both sides.\n\nThey last met at the 2024 T20 World Cup when an impressive Scotland batting performance meant England were faced with a tricky 110 in 10 overs before rain prevented what could have been an intriguing situation.\n\n\"It is something we will never have the answer to,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I have learned to fear no one and go into games expecting to win.\n\n\"I have a fair background in sports psychology and that is the best way to approach these games.\n\n\"They have Adil Rashid [batting] at 11 with 10 first-class hundreds and I haven't got a first-class double-digit score. I am not naive.\n\n\"[But] They have got to play and travel. We have played two games at Eden Gardens.\n\n\"I am just looking forward to it.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The International Cricket Council has been urged to review the rules concerning 12th man duties which denied Scott Currie the chance to play for Scotland at the men's T20 World Cup.\n\nPoole-born Currie, 24, has played three one-day internationals for Scotland having qualified for the Saltires through his Scottish father.\n\nPotentially he could have been lining up to play for Scotland against England in Kolkata on Saturday, alongside brother Brad, only to be deemed ineligible for the tournament because of ICC red tape.\n\nThe Hampshire all-rounder was called up by England for a three-match T20 international series against Ireland last September as a replacement for the injured Saqib Mahmood.\n\nCurrie was not picked in England's playing XI for any of the matches which took place in Malahide, but because he undertook 12th man duties he is now ineligible for Scotland for three years.\n\nSection 2.2 of the ICC's player eligibility regulations state that Currie \"participated\" as a \"non-playing official substitute\".\n\nCricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade said the ICC ruling seems \"quite strange\" compared to other sports.\n\nUnder the rules governing football and rugby union, Currie would have been eligible to play for Scotland having not won an official cap.\n\n\"I don't know when that rule was last looked at, so maybe it is time to have a re-look at that and confirm that what is in place is correct or whether alterations are needed,\" Lindblade told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Is that rule still relevant today in that evolution of our sport where players do move around a lot more from that perspective?\"\n\nUnder ICC regulations players can switch allegiances from associate countries like Scotland to full members like England immediately provided they meet all the other qualification requirements, but they must wait three years the other way.\n\nCurrie declined to comment but has previously spoken of his \"immense pride\" at playing international cricket for Scotland.\n\n\"Taking the field with my brother [Brad], knowing what is means to my old man and his side of the family, is something that always puts a smile on face,\" he said last year.\n\nAn ICC spokesperson told BBC Sport that should a member \"wish to revisit this clause\" then it can be \"raised and discussed, in the first instance, at a men's cricket committee meeting later this month\".\n\nListen to the full interview with Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade broadcast on 31 January on BBC Stumped.\n\nEngland too 'careful' in defeat by Windies - Brook\n\nRefugee Ihsan swaps 'tapeball' cricket for World Cup\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Marc Cucurella has been an absolute soldier for Chelsea in the last two years, playing a crazy number of games in a really demanding position.\n\nThe addition of Jorrel Hato this summer was supposed to help him out, but the Dutchman has not proved himself reliable yet, and time again Chelsea have to turn to Cucurella.\n\nThe pressure on his body finally told against Leeds on Tuesday night, when he was taken off with a hamstring problem. In an update in his press conference yesterday, Liam Rosenior said that the club were still awaiting scans to see how bad the damage was.\n\nMarc Cucurella looks sad. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\nSigns from Spain aren’t good. Joaquin Marota reports for AS that the Spanish football federation are “worried” about a potential muscular problem, with the World Cup closing in.\n\nThey say that the full back will have an MRI today to discover the full extent of the damage. The Spaniard has already been ruled out of tomorrow’s FA Cup game, and even in the best case it feels likely that he misses the league game a week after that too. That gives him two and a half weeks to try and recover to face Arsenal on March 1st.\n\nAtletico Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Pedro Neto, but at the moment the main transfer sources are saying that’s unlikely. We certainly don’t see the reported £80m price as realistic – although if it was, Chelsea would have a hard time saying no to such a profit.\n\nOne player taking a fair bit of flak recently has been Alejandro Garnacho. Fans want to see more, and Liam Rosenior has even been forced to defender him pretty openly in recent press conferences.",

    "description": "The Nations League does not carry the prestige of other competitions, but Thursday's draw still carries huge importance to Scotland and the Tartan Army.",
    "fullText": "Who needs the Nations League? Now Steve Clarke has ended decades of heartache and taken Scotland to the World Cup, does anything else matter?\n\nUnderstandably, ever since December's gala draw for the summer's finals in North America, every Scotland fan has been consumed with thoughts of facing Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.\n\nThe prospect of partying at the finals for the first time since 1998 has given long-suffering supporters plenty to savour and there's been no need to look beyond, nor anything definite to anticipate.\n\nThat changes the Nations League draw in Belgium on Thursday evening, when Scotland's opponents for matches in the second half of 2026 are confirmed.\n\nCompared to Fifa's festival of football, or even the Euros, it's small potatoes, of course, but these games could hold huge importance for tournaments to come and the development of the national team after their tests in North America.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nAnother plot twist in Scottish title race for the ages\n\nSince being introduced in 2018 in an attempt to add more structure to the international calendar and phase out meaningless friendlies, the competition has followed a familiar format.\n\nNational teams are split into four tiers based on promotion and relegation from the last edition, theoretically putting sides of the same level together.\n\nEach of these tiers are split into groups of four and there's promotion and relegation through the divisions. The best teams in League A then go on into a knock-out finals tournament the following summer with the champions crowned at the end. Simple.\n\nScotland played in the top flight in the last edition back in 2024 but finished in third place in their group behind eventual champions Portugal and Croatia. That put the national team in a play-off to fight for survival and defeat by Greece meant relegation to League B.\n\nRevenge on the Greeks was served in the successful World Cup qualification last year, of course, but Thursday's draw will put Scotland back in familiar territory in the second tier of the Nations League.\n\nScotland are in Pot 1 of the League B draw, but a quick look at the possible opposition puts paid to any ideas that it means an easy draw.\n\nHungary, Poland and Israel are the only sides Scotland cannot face, but with the likes of Switzerland, Republic of Ireland and Sweden as a potential group of opponents, fans won't be taking success for granted. Though do we ever?\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland, Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland, Romania\n\nPot 4: Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Kosovo\n\nScotland will play each opponent home and away, with the fixtures grouped into three double-headers in September, October and November.\n\nGroup winners are promoted automatically, runners-up go into a play-off against a League A side, third faces a relegation play-off and fourth takes a drop straight into League C.\n\nEven eight years after its introduction, the competition does not have the allure of its counterparts, but it is still an important part of the international calendar, especially for Scotland.\n\nHead coach Clarke has spoken repeatedly about how his players need to face strong opposition to keep improving.\n\nThis time around, they will not be playing Europe's elite, but competitive games against sides of a similar level present a good test and strong preparation for the next set of European Championship qualifiers.\n\nPromotion brings prestige, glamour games next time around and prize money, but arguably the real prizes come in how a successful campaign sets Scotland up for the future.\n\nThe seeding for qualification campaigns and finals is always a complicated affair, but there is one simple truth that applies to them all. Winning games pushes a team up the rankings and into a better position - and winning competitive games is more valuable than victory in friendlies.\n\nThere is also the importance of a good Nations League as a lifeline to reach major finals. Four teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup directly have been given a second chance through the play-offs due to their Nations League record.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Scotland's long exodus from a major finals was ended because of a Nations League lifeline – the emotion of the play-off victory in Serbia that sealed a place at Euro 2020 was only possible because of a strong campaign.\n\nIt should not be the case that the national team needs a similar chance to reach Euro 2028, but a horrible set of circumstances could arise that make Nations League success essential.\n\nAs co-hosts of the tournament, the idea of Scotland not making the finals and seeing fans of other nations celebrating at Hampden in unthinkable.\n\nHowever, with four nations hosting the finals, Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland all have to go through the qualification campaign.\n\nIn an ideal world, the national team succeeds there and books a place, with three group games at Hampden guaranteed.\n\nUefa has set aside two places for host nations who fail to qualify in an attempt to make sure all four are in the tournament proper.\n\nHowever, if more than two of the four fail to qualify automatically, it comes down to qualifying ranking and Scotland could conceivably miss out altogether.\n\nIn that specific case, having a play-off place banked from the Nations League would be heaven sent.\n\nThere is one other intriguing footnote to the draw: it could set up the opposition for the next Scotland head coach's first game in charge.\n\nClarke's contract expires after the World Cup and there is no indication if he will carry on in the job, regardless of what happens at the finals.\n\nIf Clarke does leave in the summer, his successor's first matches will be in the Nations League and a new era for the national team will begin when League B kicks off.\n\nBBC Scotland will have live text coverage of the Nations League draw from 17:00 GMT.",
