    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers behind on payments could soon start seeing smaller paychecks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Department of Education confirmed to Business Insider on Tuesday that it will begin sending wage garnishment notices to defaulted student-loan borrowers in early January. The Washington Post was the first to report this update.\n\nThe department said that notices will go out to approximately 1,000 defaulted student-loan borrowers the week of January 7, and the notices \"will increase in scale on a month-to-month basis.\" The garnishment occurs only after borrowers have received notice and an opportunity to repay their loans, the department said.\n\nThis update follows the department's announcement in April that it would restart collections on defaulted student loans in May, after a five-year pause. Over 5 million student-loan borrowers are in default, according to department data, which typically occurs after a federal borrower has payments that are more than 270 days past due.\n\nMore could soon enter default status — TransUnion reported 5.8 million newly delinquent borrowers in April, or over 90 days past due, meaning that if those borrowers don't make payments, they could enter default and have their wages seized, in addition to withheld tax refunds and federal benefits like Social Security.\n\nBorrowers in default have options to return to good standing, but they can be time-consuming and complicated. One option is loan rehabilitation, which requires a borrower to contact their servicer and sign an agreement to make nine payments within 20 days of the due date over a period of 10 consecutive months. Wage garnishment would continue during rehabilitation, but upon completion, the default status would be removed from the borrower's credit report.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation. During this process, a borrower can apply to consolidate their defaulted student loan into a federal direct loan, but the record of default would remain on the borrower's credit history.\n\nLinda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said when the collection resumption was first announced that the goal of the policy isn't \"to be unkind to student borrowers.\"\n\n\"Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense,\" McMahon said. \"Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A protest erupted in India’s capital Tuesday in response to the death of a Hindu man who was lynched and burned by an angry mob in neighboring Bangladesh, a new sign of strain in relations between the neighboring countries.\n\nThe protest in New Delhi, mainly led by Hindu nationalist organization Vishva Hindu Parishad, highlights the fragility in the relationship between India and Bangladesh, which often is held up as a rare example of stability in South Asia.\n\nBangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi died in a hospital in Singapore on Thursday after being shot on Dec. 12 in Dhaka. Police in Bangladesh said they identified suspects and the shooter likely had fled to India.\n\nHadi’s death triggered widespread violence in Dhaka. The offices of two national daily newspapers were torched and Indian diplomatic missions were targeted. A Hindu man also was burned alive, which sparked the protest Tuesday in India.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, shouting slogans and accusing Bangladeshi groups of wrongly targeting minorities. They carried placards and banners with slogans including “India will not tolerate torture of Hindus in Bangladesh” and “Our silence should not be mistaken as weakness, we are lions.”\n\nAuthorities erected barricades and imposed tight security around the diplomatic enclave that included police and armored vehicles. Security personnel used batons to hold back some protesters who broke through barricades in an apparent attempt to enter the embassy.\n\nOne of the Indian protestors, Rajkumar Jindal, threatened “dire consequences” if authorities in Bangladesh failed to stop violence against Hindus.\n\n“People who are committing atrocities should stop doing that. We are here to awaken the people who are asleep,” Jindal said.\n\nHadi took part in a 2024 political uprising that ended the 15-year rule of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been in exile since fleeing Bangladesh on Aug. 5, 2024. He was a fierce critic of India and Hasina and planned to run as an independent candidate in a major constituency in Dhaka in the next national elections in February.\n\nHadi's death sparked a new diplomatic squabble with India and prompted New Delhi this week to summon Bangladesh’s envoy.\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also summoned Pranay Verma, the Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, to apprise him of the security situation at Bangladesh missions in New Delhi and state capitals Kolkata and Agartala, a leading Bengali-language newspaper reported Tuesday.\n\nTensions between India and Bangladesh increased again with the death on Thursday of Dipu Chandra Das, a 25-year-old Hindu man who was lynched and burned publicly following allegations of blasphemy in Mymensingh district’s Bhaluka subdistrict.\n\nDas's killing contributed to a pattern of fear among the Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of Hasina.\n\nReligious minority groups including Hindus and Christians have accused Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus of failing to protect the safety of Hindus and others. The Yunus administration has rejected the allegations.\n\nTuesday's protest could complicate cooperation on trade, border management and regional connectivity at a time when the region is already grappling with economic uncertainty and political polarization, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs.\n\n“Opposing India and alleging Indian conspiracies of interference in Bangladesh are being done in order to harden a blatantly Islamist and non-inclusive path for the country,” Chaulia said.\n\nThe rupture is a setback to India’s broader regional strategy, while for Bangladesh the loss of India’s development assistance and markets could further dampen the country's slowing economy and push it further into dependence on China, Chaulia said.\n\nBangladesh and India have enjoyed a warm relationship since 2009 when Hasina came to power and until her ouster. Hasina was considered a friend by India and both countries thrived on bilateral cooperation. But Hasina’s opponents accused her administration of being subservient to India, a major trade and investment partner.",

    "fullText": "Graduate and professional students could soon find themselves with more limited student-loan options. Yale has a plan.\n\nThe Yale School of Public Health posted on LinkedIn last week that it will \"soon introduce a replacement loan option\" for student-loan borrowers who are affected by President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate the Grad PLUS program as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nGrad PLUS allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. Trump's legislation eliminated the program and implemented new borrowing caps: a $100,000 lifetime cap for graduate students and a $200,000 lifetime cap for professional students.\n\nYale said that its new program would \"offer comparable, if not more competitive, loan terms compared to previous Grad PLUS loans,\" adding that more details will be available soon. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn addition to Yale, Bloomberg reported that other schools, such as Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, are also working to establish financing options for students pursuing advanced degrees, including working with private lenders for additional financing.\n\nEducation policy experts previously told Business Insider that limiting borrowing for advanced degrees could push students to either forgo their programs or turn to the private loan market, which could have riskier terms with higher interest rates.\n\nTrump's Department of Education is set to roll out the student-loan borrowing changes in July 2026. It will affect new students. Existing borrowers will be able to retain their financing options. The department is also introducing its new Repayment Assistance Plan in July, which is intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans.\n\nSome advocates and Democratic lawmakers have previously expressed concern with the elimination of Grad PLUS and the new caps on borrowing for advanced degrees. The Department of Education proposed a new definition of \"professional,\" compiling a list of 10 programs, like medicine and dentistry, that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap.\n\nEarlier this month, over 140 bipartisan lawmakers signed onto a letter urging the department to revise the limits to include advanced nursing programs in the professional degree designation.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, told Business Insider that \"we expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education completed its update to income-based repayment plans, expanding access to borrowers with higher incomes.",
    "fullText": "An affordable student-loan repayment plan is now available to more borrowers.\n\nOn December 22, President Donald Trump's Department of Education said that it had completed a key update to income-based repayment plans, removing the requirement to be in partial financial hardship to enroll.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to remove the financial hardship requirement, which meant that the borrower's monthly payment had to be less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over a 10-year period.\n\nNow that the update is complete, borrowers with higher incomes should soon become eligible to enroll in IBR plans. The department said that it encourages borrowers who were previously denied from IBR plans due to a lack of partial financial hardship to reapply using the online income-driven repayment application.\n\n\"If you applied for IBR and your servicer is holding your application, your servicer will process your application in the order in which it was received,\" the department said.\n\nIBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with student-loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on when they first took out the loan. Specifically, borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2014, will receive IBR payments based on 15% of their income with a 25-year repayment period. Borrowers who took out loans after that date will receive payments based on 10% of their income with a 20-year repayment period.\n\nAfter a backlog of IBR application processing, the Department of Education restarted student-loan forgiveness in the fall for borrowers who had reached their payment thresholds.\n\nIn addition to the IBR changes, the department is also working to implement other repayment changes, including new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, as well as a new Repayment Assistance Plan intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans. Those changes are set to roll out in July 2026.",

    "title": "Islamophobic Elites Lied to Destroy the Life of a Palestinian Brown Student",
    "description": "Jeet...",
    "fullText": "Plutocrats, pundits, and government officials joined together in a racist smear campaign against a queer Palestinian student at Brown University.\n\nTo survive a school shooting is traumatic enough, but to then face a nationwide racist smear campaign that falsely accuses you of being the murderer is even worse. That was the fate of Mustapha Kharbouch, a queer Palestinian student at Brown University. While mourning his fellow students, Kharbouch found himself confronting false accusations. Across social media, attempts by the university to protect his privacy were painted as proof of guilt.\n\nThose who libeled Kharbouch were not anonymous social media trolls but some of the country’s most powerful figures, including prominent plutocrats such as Shaun Maguire and Bill Ackman, government officials like US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, lawmakers such as Representative Anna Paulina Luna, and influencers such as Laura Loomer (who is known to have the ear of President Donald Trump). These figures used their considerable megaphones to try to destroy the life of a private citizen. This racist mob operated with reckless disregard for the truth, likely because they knew that Islamophobia enjoys near-total impunity in the United States. To date, this story has not been covered in mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times. This itself is evidence of now normalized vicious Islamophobia has become.\n\nTo understand Kharbouch’s horrific experience, it is necessary to lay out the facts of two murder cases. The best available evidence indicates that on Saturday, December 13, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente went on a shooting spree that killed two people and injured nine at Brown University. Two days later, while still at large, Valente killed MIT scientist Nuno Loureiro, whom Valente had known in his native Portugal. Valente killed himself on December 16. His body was found two days later. The police and FBI seem to have been extremely inept in investigating the case and broke it only with the help of a Reddit post.\n\nThe incompetence of law enforcement allowed racist and Islamophobic conspiracy theories to run wild. The two interrelated conspiracy theories were that Kharbouch was the murderer and that Loureiro was murdered because he was Jewish and an ardent Zionist. The Daily Mail reported that “Israeli officials” believe Loureiro was “assassinated in his home in [a] targeted attack by [an] Iranian operative.” This reporting was nonsense. There is no evidence that Loureiro was either Jewish or a Zionist. As best as can be discovered, Valente’s motives for the murders were personal, based on frustration over his failed academic career.\n\nAn AFP fact-check gives a useful rundown of how the smear against Karbouch spread:\n\nThe allegations appeared to originate with the anonymous X account “@0hour1,” which repeatedly posted photos and videos of Kharbouch on December 15, sometimes alongside images police had released of the person of interest. The student’s photos and email address were quickly plastered across X, sparking calls for their punishment or death.\n\nMany posts highlighted the student’s documented history of pro-Palestinian activism, while several attempted to compare the individual’s body and gait to a person of interest shown in footage released by police….\n\nRight-wing podcaster Tim Pool and US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon joined in amplifying the narrative, which gained further momentum as Brown University webpages mentioning Kharbouch or listing their contact information appeared to be removed, fueling claims of a cover-up. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also reshared multiple posts floating the allegations.\n\nTo protect Kharboch from doxing, Brown University scrubbed information about him from its website. This was taken by Islamophobes as evidence of guilt.\n\nAs Fast Company reports, Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire promoted false accusations about Kharbouch, as well as the erroneous theory of the motivation for Loureiro’s murder. On the social medial site X, the journalist Jasper Nathanial posted a video that Maquire had made about the murders and subsequently deleted. Summing up the video, Nathaniel noted:\n\n[Maguire] claims there is “very strong evidence” that Mustapha Kharbouch, a Palestinian Brown student, “likely” committed the murders of two Brown students. He treats Brown removing pages about Kharbouch as evidence of guilt, completely lost on him that this was a response to doxxing like his. He also falsely claims the slain MIT professor was Jewish and frames the killings as part of a history of “pro-Palestinian terrorism” that he says is supported by [Zohran] Mamdani.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Kharbouch spoke of his experiences: “I woke up on Tuesday morning to unfounded, vile, Islamophobic, and anti-Palestinian accusations being directed toward me online. Instead of grieving with my community in the aftermath of the horrible shooting, I received non-stop death threats and hate speech.”\n\nIt’s possible that Kharbouch might be able to get some redress through the courts by launching libel actions against those who defamed him. But this legal remedy won’t touch the larger problem of out-of-control islamophobia.\n\nAs Washington Post columnist Shadi Hamid notes, rabid expressions of hatred for Muslims have become normal on the right in the Trump era. To cite one example, on December 14, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville tweeted, “Islam is not a religion. It’s a cult. Islamists aren’t here to assimilate. They’re here to conquer.” Vile comments like this have become the norm among Republicans, while Democratic pushback has too often been perfunctory. The defamation campaign against Kharbouch could easily have led to his being physically harmed or killed. Unless Islamophobia and other forms of racism are fought head-on, the US is headed for a dark future.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

He does not claim that this warrant’s affidavit lacks probable cause. He does not claim that this warrant was overbroad or lacked particularity. And he does not – and cannot – claim that the federal warrant included any information obtained by UMPD during its search of devices pursuant to the warrants that Weiss challenges,” the government’s filing read.\n\nWeiss is also facing a civil lawsuit by more than 70 women who say he hacked into private accounts to steal private photos.\n\nHe was the offensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh but was fired in February 2023 following the allegations.",

    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community.

    "description": "I felt ashamed for being overweight in high school, so I stayed consistent with a healthy diet in college. That practice made me a better student.",
    "fullText": "The menus hadn't even closed before I blurted out my order: a salad. It was my way of throwing my friends off the scent, as if a plate of lettuce could erase the truth and hide my late-night snack binging. But deep down, I knew the only person I was fooling was myself.\n\nAt 16, about 4 years ago, standing at 5'9\" and 120 pounds overweight, I felt powerless — not just over my body, but over the insecurities that dictated how I moved through the world.\n\nWeighing over 300 pounds was the elephant in every room I walked into, and most days I felt like the elephant myself. I vividly remember sitting in doctors' offices and being told my BMI was too high, but every time their words felt clinical and detached. What I felt each day was far more immediate, as every choice I made revolved around trying to shrink: grabbing something small at restaurants, ducking out of photos, hesitating to speak up in class for fear of drawing attention.\n\nI was exhausted, yet trying to change felt even more overwhelming. I hoped everything would be different in college.\n\nWhen I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, the thought of starting fresh collided with the reality that I was still carrying the same weight, physically and emotionally.\n\nWatching everyone else carve out their independence made me realize that if I wanted to take advantage of this new beginning, I couldn't keep living in the shadow of my body insecurities. That recognition, that no one could make this change for me, was the first real decision I ever made on my own.\n\nThe process was messy. I researched and experimented, failed and adjusted, over and over again. I cut out seconds, swapped soda for water, and reminded myself that a slice of cake today would not help me tomorrow.\n\nAt first, it felt impossible. I failed often, sometimes in secret, but each time that I pulled myself back on track, I chipped away at the belief that I was incapable of discipline.\n\nAt first, the changes felt so small they seemed pointless, but gradually I noticed patterns forming. My cravings dulled, my routines steadied, and I began to trust myself in situations that once felt impossible.\n\nI came to understand that progress was not a straight line; it curved, dipped, and sometimes reversed. The true test was whether I could keep going even when no one else was forcing me to.\n\nSuccess didn't come as dramatic numbers on a scale but in quieter victories: having the energy to walk across campus without losing my breath, joining a conversation instead of hanging back, and looking in the mirror without immediately turning away.\n\nThe discipline and resilience I built through that journey have carried into every corner of my college life. Balancing coursework, adjusting to independence, and navigating friendships all required the same patience and persistence I first practiced at the table.\n\nI approached long nights of studying the way I approached exercise: one choice at a time, knowing consistency mattered more than perfection. I learned to prioritize my well-being, to recognize when to push forward and when to rest, and to trust that even when progress didn't look linear, it was still happening.\n\nWith the past in the rearview mirror, the desire for change and knowledge feeds my hunger that was once covered up by sweets and treats. My curiosity for more only grew.\n\nThe skills I have obtained before and during my transformation have taught me to believe that change is good. It pushes you to grow into the person you are meant to be. The hardships, growth, and setbacks have helped build my mindset to continue pushing myself.",

    "fullText": "As investigators work to find a motive behind the mass shooting at Brown University and the slaying of an acclaimed MIT professor, former classmates of the accused killer described him as a brilliant but exceptionally difficult student.\n\nClaudio Neves Valente, the 48-year-old suspect who police say was found dead Thursday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was a top student but a disruptive personality in his native Portugal, recalled classmates on Friday.\n\nNeves Valente studied at Instituto Superior Técnico along with Nuno Loureiro, the MIT professor he is now accused of shooting to death. The school confirmed to CNN that both men were students there between 1995 and 2000, and that Neves Valente studied for a degree in Technological Physics Engineering.\n\nThat engineering course was full of gifted students, recalled classmate Felipe Moura – but Neves Valente stood out, for good and bad reasons.\n\n“Claudio was obviously one of the best, but in class he had a great need to stand out and show that he was better than the rest,” Moura wrote in Portuguese in a Facebook post.\n\n“Claudio’s attitude was unpleasant,” he continued, often arguing with “colleagues he didn’t consider as brilliant as him (and who probably weren’t),” he wrote. “They were totally unnecessary quarrels, which did not help the class at all.”\n\nMoura, who now teaches at a Lisbon university, did not respond to messages from CNN. A former classmate, who asked not to be quoted by name, confirmed that Moura’s Facebook account was authentic.\n\nIn an interview with Público, a newspaper in Portugal, Moura echoed his impressions of Neves Valente as an aggressive classmate.\n\n“He had a confrontational personality in class. In other words, the other good students would intervene, ask questions, [but] Claudio liked to say that he was the one who knew,” Moura told the paper.\n\nNuno Morais, another classmate, told Público that Neves Valente and Loureiro were among the top students at the school – but their personalities were starkly different.\n\n“Claudio was one of the students with the best grades in the course. He was much more theoretical,” Morais told the paper. “Nuno was also a good student, he stood out less in terms of grades, but he was a more relaxed person—and seemed to have a knack for slightly more applied subjects.”\n\nAfter graduating in Portugal, Neves Valente enrolled at Brown University in 2000 as a graduate student in physics but did not finish the program. Moura said he stayed in touch with Neves Valente at the time and found that he was once again clashing with other students.\n\n“I exchanged many emails with him at the time and saw that he maintained the same attitude — as he told me —of maintaining unnecessary conflicts with PhD colleagues in class, which he again considered far less capable than he was,” Moura wrote on Facebook. “I could tell that he wasn’t enjoying being at Brown University.”\n\nScott Watson, a classmate at Brown, said Valente was “socially awkward” and that he became his only friend at the university. He struggled in the US, complaining bitterly that classes weren’t challenging and that the food was poor, Watson recalled.\n\n“He would say the classes were too easy—honestly, for him they were. He already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive,” Watson, who is now a professor at Syracuse University, said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nWatson said Valente could be “kind and gentle” but that he was also volatile as well.\n\n“He often became frustrated—sometimes angry—about courses, professors, and living conditions,” Watson said, recalling that once he had to break up a fight between Valente and another classmate he often insulted.\n\nMoura said he tried to convince Valente to stay with the graduate program, but he left after one year.\n\n“Claudio thought none of it was worth it, which was a waste of time and the others were all incapable,” he said on Facebook.\n\nIn an archived Brown website, Neves Valente appears to write to classmates that he’s left the school “permanently.” The note, first reported by the New York Times, includes an email address to reach him and a cryptic note: “The best liar is he who is able to fool himself. They are everywhere, but sometimes proliferate in the most unexpected places.”\n\nA directory of physics graduate students at Brown from that time links to the website alongside a student email address for Neves Valente. The directory shows that he was assigned to room 122 at the Barus and Holley engineering building. Neves Valente carried out his shooting in room 166 in the same building last week, police say.\n\nIt’s unclear what Neves Valente did in the intervening years. Moura wrote on Facebook that he heard he’d returned to Portugal to work for an internet provider; police say he received a visa and returned to the US in 2017, though it is unclear what he did for work.\n\nHis last known address was in Miami, police said.\n\nHis former classmates have been left trying to understand what could have motivated the brutal violence.\n\n“I never expected he would be capable of such a thing,” Moura wrote.\n\nCNN’s Vasco Cotovio, Thomas Bordeaux, Julia Vargas Jones contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "fullText": "SYDNEY (AP) — A judge sentenced a Sydney taekwondo instructor on Tuesday to life in prison without possibility of release for murdering a 7-year-old student and the boy’s parents.\n\nKwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.\n\nHarrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family’s financial success.\n\n“I’m satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,” Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.\n\nHarrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.\n\nState law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy’s parents also can’t be named.\n\nYoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.\n\nYoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.\n\nYoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion’s Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.\n\nHe took the mother’s Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy’s 39-year-old father to death.\n\nYoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.\n\nAfter his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family’s money and later detailed his remorse.\n\nThe former instructor, whose students called him Master Lion, did not look at the victims’ family and other supporters as they sobbed in the court’s public gallery after the sentence was handed down.\n\n“These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion,” the judge said.\n\nWhile the crimes were planned — with Yoo surveilling the family’s home beforehand — he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.\n\nAt a sentence hearing in November, the judge heard Yoo had lied about meeting the wealthiest Australian, Gina Rinehart, qualifying for the Sydney Olympics in 2000, owning a Lamborghini luxury car and living in Sydney’s wealthy eastern suburbs.\n\nTo impress his own wife, he would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people. He sometimes used the title professor.\n\nHarrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.\n\nThe judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.\n\nYoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.\n\nIn a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was “held captive by sin” and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.\n\n“I wish I could turn back time so this didn’t happen,” Yoo wrote. “I pray every day for the people I have hurt.”\n\nYoo’s lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

But before her season even started this year, she tore her ACL, an injury that can put athletes on the bench for more than 9 months.\n\n“It’s been an emotional journey because running is my big thing,” Harris said. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to run this season with my team and keep our streaks alive and just be there for my team because that’s what I love doing.”\n\nThrough her recovery process, she said she found out she might be able to compete this season.\n\n“I got told by my doctors that if I put in the work at physical therapy this summer, that I would be able to get back to running before surgery,” Harris said.\n\nSo that’s what she did, working every week to get better and better to overcome this injury while pushing her team to grow together through a difficult season.\n\n“In a strange way, the injury has grown us all because as a coaching staff, we’ve been able to see our kids rally around one another, and other kids got stronger and maintained that going into the season,” Girls’ athletic coordinator JB Littlejohn said.\n\nDuring this recovery, Harris became an inspiration to her teammates and peers.\n\n“She was our athlete of the Year last year as a freshman,” Littlejohn said. “Her competitive nature, combined with her work ethic, you put that with the natural talent, that’s why we’re seeing what she’s doing.”\n\nThrough determination and hard work, Landry and her team made it all the way to the state cross country meet.\n\n“It was very like congratulating, and I felt like my efforts and everything that I went through paid off finally,” Harris said.\n\nYou can now stream KETK and FOX51 News live 24/7 on your smart TV with KETK+, our brand-new app!

    "description": "The victim's LinkedIn profile indicates Ella Cook began attending Brown in 2024.",
    "fullText": "One of the students killed in the mass shooting at Brown University is Ella Cook, who was a parishioner at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, the church announced during its Sunday, Dec. 14, service.\n\n\"Many of you heard about the tragedy ... And sadly, tragically, one of those people is one of our parishioners,\" Rev. Craig Smalley said in livestreamed remarks.\n\nSmalley described Cook as a \"bright light\" who was engaged in the church and the broader community, and \"incredibly grounded and generous and faithful.\"\n\nCook's LinkedIn profile indicates that she began attending Brown in 2024.\n\nShe was vice president of the Brown Republicans, according to a social media post from Alex Shieh, who left the school earlier this year amid a furor over his DOGE-inspired \"bloat @ Brown\" campaign.\n\n\"Being a conservative at Brown isn't always the easiest, but Ella was never afraid to share her beliefs on an overwhelmingly liberal campus and support others in doing so,\" Shieh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Last spring, while I was under a disciplinary investigation for reporting on Brown's administration for the conservative student paper, almost nobody wanted to be associated with me,\" he added. \"Ella was one of the few who were willing to stand with me in public and help hand out newspapers in front of the dining hall.\"\n\nAlabama U.S. Sen. Katie Britt expressed her condolences to the family of Ella Cook, calling the student’s death “heartbreaking” and “senseless,\" according to reporting from the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nIn a statement, Britt said she and her husband, Wesley, “joined the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University’s campus.”\n\nShe offered comfort to those who knew Cook, noting that her life was “taken far too soon” and expressing gratitude to law enforcement officials working on the investigation. Britt also asked that Ella’s loved ones and community be kept in prayers during this difficult time.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Dec. 14, WRAL News and the News & Observer, in Raleigh, North Carolina, reported that Kendall Turner, a Brown freshman, is among the injured students.\n\nTurner is an alumnus of Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina, said an email sent to the school community, according to reports from both outlets.\n\nThe email said that Turner underwent surgery and is now resting in critical but stable condition. Her parents arrived in Providence on Saturday night.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Brown University student killed in mass shooting ID'd as Ella Cook",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s Kobbie Mainoo’s last year at Old Trafford has been far from plain sailing.\n\nThe Carrington graduate was massively important under Erik ten Hag and even broke into the England national team’s starting eleven.\n\nNonetheless, since Ruben Amorim has come to the club, Mainoo has seen his minutes dramatically reduced.\n\nMainoo has only played 10 matches in the Premier League and has failed to start any of them. What’s more, he has only been on the pitch for a combined 183 minutes.\n\nNaturally, Mainoo is far from content with the situation and was denied a loan move at the end of August.\n\nThe lack of minutes has only fuelled further talk of an exit, with Serie A champions SSC Napoli and Spanish giants Real Madrid and FC Barcelona both seemingly interested in the midfielder.\n\nThe manager’s lack of trust in the fan favourite is clear for all to see. This was evident when Mainoo was given a hero’s welcome last Monday when he came off the bench versus Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nAmorim has defended his decision to stick with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but it seems that now it is more than just the fans questioning the Portuguese manager’s thought process on the matter.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that, “Mainoo’s exasperation over his current situation at Old Trafford barely needs stating. He feels frozen out by a manager who has yet to start him in a Premier League game this season and wants to leave on loan next month in pursuit of regular playing time.”\n\nInterestingly, the paper notes that, “there are figures within the club who are very uneasy about the player’s predicament and what a potential exit could signify.”\n\nWhilst Amorim has insisted that there is a route back for Mainoo, not many would believe him considering Mainoo’s lack of minutes in spite of the club’s limited midfield options.\n\nIn addition, Manchester United have always prided themselves on their academy, and there will have been shudders down the spine of numerous fans after hearing Amorim’s comments on the likes of Harry Amass and Chido Obi in his pre-match press conference.\n\nMoreover, with Manchester United’s academy swarming with many talented starlets at the moment, none more obvious than JJ Gabriel, supporters and indeed the club will worry immensely over the cloud the Mainoo situation is casting over Old Trafford at the moment.\n\nFeatured image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim has faced plenty of heat for his utilisation of Manchester United wonderkid Kobbie Mainoo this season.\n\nNot too long ago, the Carrington graduate was starring for the Red Devils as they overcame Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Who can forget his injury-time winner against Olympique Lyonnais last season?\n\nFrom those heady heights, the Englishman has fallen on hard times under the head coach in this campaign. A total of zero starts in the Premier League has meant the 20-year-old is desperate to jump ship in January.\n\nHe had asked INEOS to leave in the summer as well, and he is likely to approach them once again in the coming days to find some sort of solution.\n\nIt is clear from Amorim’s comments that the England international is unlikely to see too many minutes unless there are injuries or the head coach shuffles his pack.\n\nA whole host of clubs are chasing the United No.37, and while Napoli remains his preferred destination, CaughtOffside have claimed that Chelsea are leading the race.\n\nThe Blues had signed fellow Carrington graduate Alejandro Garnacho in the summer and are now looking to add more young talents from the Red Devils.\n\nBayern Munich are also strong contenders. Thankfully for the 20-time English league champions, the Stockport-born ace remains committed to his boyhood club, and wants only a temporary exit to boost his England World Cup hopes.\n\nHe prefers a foreign club, and the co-owners are unlikely to sanction a deal to a domestic top-four unless it involves an offer too good to be refused.\n\n“Although at least 12 clubs are reportedly in the race, sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Chelsea and Bayern Munich are “leading the chase”.\n\n“It will be interesting to see if Chelsea can convince Manchester United to sell. They are looking to build a formidable team for the future, and the England International midfielder could be the final piece of the puzzle for them.\n\n“However, the player’s personal preference list still places Napoli as the frontrunner. Mainoo is prioritising where he can be a guaranteed starter as he plots his next move.”\n\nHopefully, it does not come to that and the talented star remains at Old Trafford for the foreseeable future.\n\nPossibly, AFCON departures could finally force Amorim to hand Kobbie Mainoo more gametime. And the midfielder must grab his chance with both hands when it arrives.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Over 140 bipartisan lawmakers wrote to oppose the Education Department's plan to place new student-loan limits on nursing programs.",
    "fullText": "Opposition toward new student-loan limits in President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul is mounting.\n\nOn Friday, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent urging him to revise the Department of Education's proposal to place new student-loan limits on professional degree programs.\n\nThe department recently concluded its negotiations on the student-loan payment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The changes included borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: a $100,000 lifetime limit for graduate students, and a $200,000 lifetime limit for professional students.\n\nThe crux of the debate centered on which programs qualify as \"professional,\" and the department identified 10 programs, including medicine, dentistry, and law, that would meet its new definition. Post-graduate nursing programs are not included within the professional definition, and the lawmakers wrote that the omission could exacerbate the ongoing nursing shortage.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nThe lawmakers used the example of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000. They said that the proposed $100,000 cap is \"restricting the pipeline of CRNAs and further limiting an anesthesia workforce that is suffering from shortages across all provider types.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, said in a statement that \"misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion\" about the proposed student-loan limits. Keast cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, based on data from the College Scorecard, most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. However, advocates still expressed concern about their implications. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told Business Insider that removing the professional designation for nurses could make it difficult to recruit and retain staff in the industry.\n\n\"It's going to be a really bad revolving issue where we don't have enough faculty to produce enough nurses to replace the nurses who are retiring,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Education is planning to implement these changes beginning in July of 2026, and its proposal is still subject to change based on the comments it receives from the public early next year.",

    "fullText": "After paying $96,000 toward student loans over the past eight years, Sarah from Philadelphia thought she was finally done. She had faithfully repaid both her personal loans and the $50,000 her parents had taken out under Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students to help fund her education.\n\nAt 29 years old, Sarah told her parents she planned to make her final few payments and close the chapter on student debt. But instead of celebrating, her parents dropped a bombshell: they had consolidated the Parent PLUS loans taken out for her and her siblings into one big loan. Her monthly payments, it turned out, had been covering not just her share, but everyone else's, too.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\n“They kind of just like dropped the bombshell, like, ‘Oh, well, this happened… to make our payments lower,'” Sarah told personal finance experts Dave Ramsey and Rachel Cruze on “The Ramsey Show.”\n\nRamsey quickly jumped in. “No, no, no,” he said. “You did not make an obligation to pay your siblings' part. You made a promise to pay your part.”\n\nSarah explained that she had been paying her parents $1,000 a month for nearly eight years–money she believed was going toward her $60,000 portion of the Parent PLUS loans. But with her parents combining everything into one pot, she was suddenly on the hook for loans that were never hers.\n\nRamsey encouraged her to take a clear-eyed look at the numbers. “We’re talking about 96 months that you paid $96,000, including 7% interest,” he said. “That means I don't owe anymore. Sorry, Mom and Dad. The rest of it's on you and bro. I did my part.”\n\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

In this case, Sarah went above and beyond. “They're very lucky, honestly, as Parent PLUS holders, that Sarah actually has paid $96,000,” Ramsey said. “Ninety percent of the time I take this phone call, it's the parent griping because the kid has never paid a dime.”\n\nSarah acknowledged that confronting her parents could be tough, especially since they had supported her in other ways growing up. “They changed your diaper, but you don't have to pay them for that,” he said. “That's called being a parent.”\n\nRamsey was sympathetic, but firm: she had fulfilled her moral and financial obligations.

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee executed Harold Wayne Nichols by lethal injection Thursday in Nashville for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nNichols, 64, had confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\n“To the people I've harmed, I'm sorry,” Nichols said in his final statement. Before Nichols died, a spiritual adviser prayed over him in the execution chamber and the two recited together the 23rd Psalm and the Lord's Prayer. At several points, they teared up and their voices became strained. After the final “Amen,” the adviser, J.R. Davis, continued talking quietly, with Nichols nodding along.\n\n“Go in peace, my friend. I love you,” Davis told Nichols.\n\nNichols was strapped to a gurney with a sheet pulled up to just above his waist and a long tube running from an adjoining room to an IV inserted on the inside of his elbow. There was a spot of blood near the injection site. At one point he took a very heavy breath and his whole torso rose up. He then took a series of short, huffing breaths that witnesses said sounded like snorting or snoring. Nichols’ face turned red and he groaned. His breathing then appeared to slow, then stop, and his face became purple before he was pronounced dead.\n\nNichols' sister, Deborah Perry, watched the execution from a witness chamber and cried quietly but did not speak.\n\nNichols’ attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to issue a stay of the execution on Thursday.\n\nPulley's sister, Lisette Monroe, had wanted to be present for the execution but became too overwhelmed, her husband and Pulley's brother-in-law, Jeff Monroe, told media afterwards. He read a statement that said the family “was destroyed by evil” the night Pulley was killed.\n\n“Taking a life is serious, and we take no pleasure in it,” he said. “However, the victims, and there were many, were carefully stalked and attacked. The crimes, and there were many, were deliberate, violent, and horrific.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols' execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she'll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nPulley, who was 20 when she was killed, had just finished Bible college and was attending school in Chattanooga to become a paralegal, Jeff Monroe said.\n\n“Karen was bubbly, happy, selfless, and looking forward to the life before her,” he said.\n\nNichols' attorney, Debbie Drew, also spoke after the execution, saying her client had turned his life over to God after speaking to Pulley's mother decades ago, shortly after he was sentenced. His execution “sent the message that no one can rise beyond the crimes they committed decades earlier and that redemption deserves no mercy,” she said.\n\nDavis said after the execution that he had known Nichols for a decade as part of a prison men's group and believes that Nichols' remorse and spiritual transformation were genuine. Davis said Nichols committed “horrible crimes. But killing to teach people not to kill just doesn't make sense.”\n\nNichols had seen two previous execution dates come and go. The state earlier planned to execute him in August 2020, but Nichols was given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs as anti-death penalty activists have put pressure on drug companies and other suppliers. Between the shortages and legal challenges over botched executions, some states have moved to alternative methods of execution including a firing squad in South Carolina and nitrogen gas in Alabama.\n\nIncluding Nichols, a total of 46 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S.\n\nCorrects that Pulley was a student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nReporter Adrian Sainz contributed from Memphis, Tennessee.",

    "description": "Trump's administration announced an agreement to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Borrowers would have to transfer to new plans.",
    "fullText": "It's looking like SAVE can't be saved — and it'll mean millions of borrowers could soon face higher monthly payments.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced a settlement with the State of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nSince last summer, SAVE — created by former President Joe Biden — has been paused due to litigation from Missouri and other GOP-led states. The plan was designed to provide affordable monthly payments to the 7 million enrolled borrowers, along with a shorter timeline for loan forgiveness.\n\nIf a court approves the settlement, the department will stop accepting new applications to SAVE, require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan, and resume payments.\n\nThe Trump administration is \"bringing an end to this deceptive scheme,\" Nicholas Kent, the undersecretary of education, said in a statement. \"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back.\"\n\nThe proposed settlement is pending court approval, and borrowers will not face any changes until the court finalizes it. If the settlement is approved, borrowers will have \"a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan and resume repayment.\n\nIn addition to the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE, the Department of Education said that 450,000 borrowers have \"expressed interest in enrolling in the plan\" and will be affected by the settlement, as well.\n\nThe proposed settlement said that the department would deny pending applications and help borrowers transition out of SAVE, and it would undergo negotiated rulemaking — which includes negotiations with stakeholders on the department's proposal — to effectuate the settlement.\n\nThe department did not provide a timeline for the negotiated rulemaking process.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that borrowers who transition out of SAVE will likely face higher monthly payments. She referred to the Repayment Assistance Plan, a new plan the department is set to launch in July 2026, which would allow for loan forgiveness after 30 years.\n\n\"It is less generous in terms of monthly payments, and also to the extent that you have to be in the program longer before you can get forgiveness,\" Fast said.\n\nWhile the department resumed interest charges on SAVE plan accounts in August, enrolled borrowers previously had until 2028 to transition to a new plan. This proposed settlement accelerates that timeline, and it would be a significant undertaking for servicers to carry out, Fast said.\n\nAbby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said that eliminating SAVE \"without access to a clear and affordable alternative is reckless and short-sighted, creating even more needless confusion, uncertainty, and financial stress for millions of Americans already struggling with the rising cost of living.\"\n\n\"In the midst of a national affordability crisis, their way forward is murky and complicated,\" she said.",
