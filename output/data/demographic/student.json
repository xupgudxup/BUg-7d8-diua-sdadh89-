    "title": "Trump's plan to limit student loans for nurses in his repayment overhaul is facing bipartisan backlash",
    "description": "Over 140 bipartisan lawmakers wrote to oppose the Education Department's plan to place new student-loan limits on nursing programs.",
    "fullText": "Opposition toward new student-loan limits in President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul is mounting.\n\nOn Friday, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent urging him to revise the Department of Education's proposal to place new student-loan limits on professional degree programs.\n\nThe department recently concluded its negotiations on the student-loan payment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The changes included borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: a $100,000 lifetime limit for graduate students, and a $200,000 lifetime limit for professional students.\n\nThe crux of the debate centered on which programs qualify as \"professional,\" and the department identified 10 programs, including medicine, dentistry, and law, that would meet its new definition. Post-graduate nursing programs are not included within the professional definition, and the lawmakers wrote that the omission could exacerbate the ongoing nursing shortage.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nThe lawmakers used the example of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000. They said that the proposed $100,000 cap is \"restricting the pipeline of CRNAs and further limiting an anesthesia workforce that is suffering from shortages across all provider types.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, said in a statement that \"misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion\" about the proposed student-loan limits. Keast cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, based on data from the College Scorecard, most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. However, advocates still expressed concern about their implications. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told Business Insider that removing the professional designation for nurses could make it difficult to recruit and retain staff in the industry.\n\n\"It's going to be a really bad revolving issue where we don't have enough faculty to produce enough nurses to replace the nurses who are retiring,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Education is planning to implement these changes beginning in July of 2026, and its proposal is still subject to change based on the comments it receives from the public early next year.",

    "fullText": "After paying $96,000 toward student loans over the past eight years, Sarah from Philadelphia thought she was finally done. She had faithfully repaid both her personal loans and the $50,000 her parents had taken out under Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students to help fund her education.\n\nAt 29 years old, Sarah told her parents she planned to make her final few payments and close the chapter on student debt. But instead of celebrating, her parents dropped a bombshell: they had consolidated the Parent PLUS loans taken out for her and her siblings into one big loan. Her monthly payments, it turned out, had been covering not just her share, but everyone else's, too.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\n“They kind of just like dropped the bombshell, like, ‘Oh, well, this happened… to make our payments lower,'” Sarah told personal finance experts Dave Ramsey and Rachel Cruze on “The Ramsey Show.”\n\nRamsey quickly jumped in. “No, no, no,” he said. “You did not make an obligation to pay your siblings' part. You made a promise to pay your part.”\n\nSarah explained that she had been paying her parents $1,000 a month for nearly eight years–money she believed was going toward her $60,000 portion of the Parent PLUS loans. But with her parents combining everything into one pot, she was suddenly on the hook for loans that were never hers.\n\nRamsey encouraged her to take a clear-eyed look at the numbers. “We’re talking about 96 months that you paid $96,000, including 7% interest,” he said. “That means I don't owe anymore. Sorry, Mom and Dad. The rest of it's on you and bro. I did my part.”\n\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

In this case, Sarah went above and beyond. “They're very lucky, honestly, as Parent PLUS holders, that Sarah actually has paid $96,000,” Ramsey said. “Ninety percent of the time I take this phone call, it's the parent griping because the kid has never paid a dime.”\n\nSarah acknowledged that confronting her parents could be tough, especially since they had supported her in other ways growing up. “They changed your diaper, but you don't have to pay them for that,” he said. “That's called being a parent.”\n\nRamsey was sympathetic, but firm: she had fulfilled her moral and financial obligations.

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee executed Harold Wayne Nichols by lethal injection Thursday in Nashville for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nNichols, 64, had confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\n“To the people I've harmed, I'm sorry,” Nichols said in his final statement. Before Nichols died, a spiritual adviser prayed over him in the execution chamber and the two recited together the 23rd Psalm and the Lord's Prayer. At several points, they teared up and their voices became strained. After the final “Amen,” the adviser, J.R. Davis, continued talking quietly, with Nichols nodding along.\n\n“Go in peace, my friend. I love you,” Davis told Nichols.\n\nNichols was strapped to a gurney with a sheet pulled up to just above his waist and a long tube running from an adjoining room to an IV inserted on the inside of his elbow. There was a spot of blood near the injection site. At one point he took a very heavy breath and his whole torso rose up. He then took a series of short, huffing breaths that witnesses said sounded like snorting or snoring. Nichols’ face turned red and he groaned. His breathing then appeared to slow, then stop, and his face became purple before he was pronounced dead.\n\nNichols' sister, Deborah Perry, watched the execution from a witness chamber and cried quietly but did not speak.\n\nNichols’ attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to issue a stay of the execution on Thursday.\n\nPulley's sister, Lisette Monroe, had wanted to be present for the execution but became too overwhelmed, her husband and Pulley's brother-in-law, Jeff Monroe, told media afterwards. He read a statement that said the family “was destroyed by evil” the night Pulley was killed.\n\n“Taking a life is serious, and we take no pleasure in it,” he said. “However, the victims, and there were many, were carefully stalked and attacked. The crimes, and there were many, were deliberate, violent, and horrific.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols' execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she'll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nPulley, who was 20 when she was killed, had just finished Bible college and was attending school in Chattanooga to become a paralegal, Jeff Monroe said.\n\n“Karen was bubbly, happy, selfless, and looking forward to the life before her,” he said.\n\nNichols' attorney, Debbie Drew, also spoke after the execution, saying her client had turned his life over to God after speaking to Pulley's mother decades ago, shortly after he was sentenced. His execution “sent the message that no one can rise beyond the crimes they committed decades earlier and that redemption deserves no mercy,” she said.\n\nDavis said after the execution that he had known Nichols for a decade as part of a prison men's group and believes that Nichols' remorse and spiritual transformation were genuine. Davis said Nichols committed “horrible crimes. But killing to teach people not to kill just doesn't make sense.”\n\nNichols had seen two previous execution dates come and go. The state earlier planned to execute him in August 2020, but Nichols was given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs as anti-death penalty activists have put pressure on drug companies and other suppliers. Between the shortages and legal challenges over botched executions, some states have moved to alternative methods of execution including a firing squad in South Carolina and nitrogen gas in Alabama.\n\nIncluding Nichols, a total of 46 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S.\n\nCorrects that Pulley was a student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nReporter Adrian Sainz contributed from Memphis, Tennessee.",

    "description": "Trump's administration announced an agreement to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Borrowers would have to transfer to new plans.",
    "fullText": "It's looking like SAVE can't be saved — and it'll mean millions of borrowers could soon face higher monthly payments.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced a settlement with the State of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nSince last summer, SAVE — created by former President Joe Biden — has been paused due to litigation from Missouri and other GOP-led states. The plan was designed to provide affordable monthly payments to the 7 million enrolled borrowers, along with a shorter timeline for loan forgiveness.\n\nIf a court approves the settlement, the department will stop accepting new applications to SAVE, require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan, and resume payments.\n\nThe Trump administration is \"bringing an end to this deceptive scheme,\" Nicholas Kent, the undersecretary of education, said in a statement. \"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back.\"\n\nThe proposed settlement is pending court approval, and borrowers will not face any changes until the court finalizes it. If the settlement is approved, borrowers will have \"a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan and resume repayment.\n\nIn addition to the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE, the Department of Education said that 450,000 borrowers have \"expressed interest in enrolling in the plan\" and will be affected by the settlement, as well.\n\nThe proposed settlement said that the department would deny pending applications and help borrowers transition out of SAVE, and it would undergo negotiated rulemaking — which includes negotiations with stakeholders on the department's proposal — to effectuate the settlement.\n\nThe department did not provide a timeline for the negotiated rulemaking process.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that borrowers who transition out of SAVE will likely face higher monthly payments. She referred to the Repayment Assistance Plan, a new plan the department is set to launch in July 2026, which would allow for loan forgiveness after 30 years.\n\n\"It is less generous in terms of monthly payments, and also to the extent that you have to be in the program longer before you can get forgiveness,\" Fast said.\n\nWhile the department resumed interest charges on SAVE plan accounts in August, enrolled borrowers previously had until 2028 to transition to a new plan. This proposed settlement accelerates that timeline, and it would be a significant undertaking for servicers to carry out, Fast said.\n\nAbby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said that eliminating SAVE \"without access to a clear and affordable alternative is reckless and short-sighted, creating even more needless confusion, uncertainty, and financial stress for millions of Americans already struggling with the rising cost of living.\"\n\n\"In the midst of a national affordability crisis, their way forward is murky and complicated,\" she said.",
