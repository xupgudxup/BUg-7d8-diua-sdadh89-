    "title": "Student-loan forgiveness emails are going out to a new batch of borrowers",
    "description": "Trump's Department of Education emailed a group of student-loan borrowers who reached their payment threshold under income-driven repayment plans.",
    "fullText": "Some student-loan borrowers are getting an early Valentine's Day gift from the Department of Education.\n\nEarlier this week, another batch of borrowers who have completed at least 20 years of payments on an income-driven repayment plan received emails from the department with the subject line: \"You're eligible to have your student loan(s) discharged.\"\n\nThe email, which multiple borrowers shared with Business Insider, said that the department will \"work with your loan servicer to process your IDR discharge over the next several months.\" Borrowers do not need to take any action to receive the relief; however, those who wish to opt out of the relief have to contact their servicer by March 5 to specify that they do not want the discharge.\n\nBorrowers might choose to opt out of the relief to avoid state tax liability, the email said. Doing so would require them to continue paying back their loans.\n\nAfter the March opt-out date, the department will send borrowers' information to their servicers, and the servicer will notify the borrower once the relief has been processed. The email said that most borrowers will see the relief processed within two weeks, but it could take more time for some borrowers.\n\nThis student-loan forgiveness comes after the expiration of 2021 provision from the American Rescue Plan that made forgiveness tax-free. Borrowers who become eligible for relief after January 1, 2026, could be hit with thousands of dollars in taxes. However, the Department of Education previously said that it will consider the date a borrower reached their payment threshold as the date of the relief, so even if they were part of the latest batch of emails, if they completed their last payment in 2025, they should not face additional taxes.\n\nThe Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on how borrowers can confirm their tax status on the latest loan forgiveness. However, the borrower's servicer would typically notify the borrower of the relief's effective date.\n\nThe student-loan industry overall is facing significant changes in the coming months. Beginning in July, the department will begin implementing its repayment overhaul, which President Donald Trump signed into law as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It includes new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees. Borrowers who enroll in the new plans would have longer timelines to forgiveness and could face higher monthly payments.\n\nThe department has maintained that its goal is to simplify repayment and ensure that borrowers do not take out student loans they cannot afford to repay.\n\n\"We have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a recent statement.\n\nHave a story to share?

A future court date has not yet been scheduled.\n\nBokar is a third-year student at Ohio State, according to his LinkedIn page, and was named as a member of the Buckeye Student Leadership Academy as a Student Engagement Leader of Access Strategies on an Ohio State admissions website. As of 1:30 p.m. Thursday, he no longer appeared on the BSLA webpage.\n\nBokar was also a student teacher at Pickerington Central High School, where he was arrested Wednesday.\n\nA Pickerington Schools spokesperson told NBC4 that Bokar “was serving as a student teacher through one of the district’s partner universities and that he would not be returning to Pickerington Local Schools.”\n\nIn addition, Pickerington Central’s principal Roshawn Parker sent a letter to parents, which read in part, “Law enforcement was on site to remove a student teacher from the building due to allegations that were reported to authorities.  As this is an active police investigation, we are unable to share additional details at this time.”\n\nNo students from Pickerington schools were involved in the alleged incident, the district said.\n\n“These allegations are extremely concerning,” said an Ohio State spokesperson in a statement. “The individual in question is not currently allowed on campus or at university engagements, including student teaching assignments.”",

    "fullText": "Alexandra Eala is one of the most popular players on the WTA Tour.\n\nThe Filipina, 20, first made a name for herself at the 2025 Miami Open, reaching the semi-finals after defeating Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek.\n\nFrom there, Eala has continued her ascendancy, becoming the first Filipina in history to become a top-40 ranked player on the WTA Tour.\n\nMost recently, Eala has been competing in the Middle East. She reached the Abu Dhabi Open quarter-finals last week, before being knocked out in the first round of the Qatar Open.\n\nAmid the hustle and bustle of the tennis Tour, Eala has taken time to share some of her wisdom.\n\nAs per a post on the Rafa Nadal Academy Instagram page, Eala said: “I think the most important skill as a student athlete is to know how to compartmentalise.\n\n“And if I’m being frank, when I was on tournament, I never wanted to do any kind of school work, never wanted to do any kind of homework, any kind of google classes.\n\n“No [laughing] I never wanted to do it just because I was so focused on the tournament and you’re always like, tense even when you’re not on court.\n\n“So what I felt it was important is to know when is the right time to do what. And when you have a certain time where you’re competing – okay, all your focus is on the competition.\n\n“And when you have the time to study, for example, all your attention is on studying. So you maximise your efforts and you maximise your time.”\n\nEala is set to travel to the UAE to take part in the Dubai Tennis Championships. Eala, who will enter the tournament through qualifying, will make her debut appearance at the event.\n\nFollowing her appearance in Dubai, Eala will likely travel to North America to take part in the Indian Wells Open – where she will defend 390 WTA points.\n\nIn September last year, Eala won her maiden WTA title at the Guadalajara 125k event in Mexico.\n\nThe title win confirmed what many had been thinking prior to the success: Eala is one of the most promising talents on the WTA Tour.\n\nHowever, she is yet to capture a first WTA Tour-level title: a tournament that offers 250 ranking points – or more – to the winner.\n\nEala’s best effort to date came at the 2025 Eastbourne Open, where she lost in the final to Maya Joint, despite having championship points.\n\nEala has more than proven that she can win a WTA Tour-level event. However, whether she can deliver on her potential remains to be seen.",

    "description": "Aspiring computer science student Alex Seungyong Yang sees AI as both a challenge and opportunity as he enters university as a freshman in the fall.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex Seungyong Yang, an 18-year-old high school senior, based in Seoul. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs an incoming university freshman and the founder of an AI research startup, AI feels like a double-edged sword.\n\nI started my AI research and development startup with other students around the world, and AI has been amazing for us. It's allowed us to push further and think about achieving things we couldn't have imagined. On the other hand, I'm pursuing a computer science major this fall, and I keep hearing that computer science jobs are being replaced by AI.\n\nNo one has explicitly told me that pursuing computer science is a complete waste of time, but many people around me have expressed concerns about the risks it entails. I think those concerns point to something valid.\n\nSimply learning how to code no longer guarantees a stable or well-defined career path, but there are still many opportunities by staying within what I would call the \"eye of the typhoon\" and studying these machines, even if they are increasingly unpredictable.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2026, the tech industry changed so much. Last year, there was still a broad sense of expansion and experimentation, startups, new tools, and huge model launches. Now, what feels dominant is resource concentration in capital, compute, and top talent, along with a narrowing focus on AI infrastructure.\n\nThis kind of acceleration makes it so that one year doesn't feel like just a single year anymore. I think that computer science, engineering, and very technical majors are the only majors that can fully understand how this industry is changing and the direction of that change.\n\nI think the important part of studying computer science isn't about basic coding or programming; it's understanding the logic behind it and the framework that can be applied anywhere, anytime, wherever we are with technology. It's all about solving the problem, and I think that kind of talent is most relevant in the AI era.\n\nStudying computer science will help me adapt more flexibly and with greater urgency in my career. I want to use the knowledge from my degree to develop a niche kind of talent rather than simply following a very conventional pathway and becoming another factory-made worker.\n\nBeing unemployed or unable to find a job used to be the most obvious failure. Now, given how frequently unemployment is already happening around us, I don't think it can even be considered the greatest failure anymore. To me, the biggest failure would be an inability to adapt, and if we become irrelevant as technology advances.\n\nA small number of people or companies can now build and deploy things at a scale that used to require much larger organizations. Rather than only preparing for predefined roles, I spend time now and will continue to during my degree, building real systems, contributing to research, and working on projects where the constraints are unclear and the outcomes are uncertain.\n\nI see my computer science degree as a way to build depth, judgment, and adaptability rather than just technical skills.\n\nI don't see this as a guaranteed strategy, and I'm still learning what truly matters, but I hope that developing this ability in specific domains matters the most. I'm in competition with AI, but it's equally a competition with other people. I want to become an irreplaceable person, not just with AI, but also relative to other people.\n\nMany peers around me who are pursuing computer science and working on startups believe this is actually the easiest era to start something and succeed. Some majors naturally keep people closer to the frontier of change. I believe studying computer science, engineering, or mathematics trains you to reason from first principles, work with abstraction, and stay comfortable with uncertainty.\n\nThose habits matter more than any specific technical skills, which may quickly become outdated. Because the underlying skills are transferable, people in these fields may be better positioned to adapt when conditions change, even if the direction of change is unclear.\n\nI'm excited to pursue computer science, even though it might be uncertain how it will turn out. Things may become more complex, demanding, and challenging than I can anticipate, but I still believe there will be abundant opportunities for those who are willing to adapt, go deep, and continuously redefine their value.\n\nDo you have a story to share about higher education and AI?

    "fullText": "It wasn't until my junior year at Stanford University that I first heard about ChatGPT from classmates who'd mentioned they had \"chat\" summarize the class reading.\n\nWhen I asked them what they meant by \"chat,\" they told me all about the AI tool, chatGPT.\n\nI was an English major with a creative writing emphasis during my time at Stanford, so reading and writing were important to my work.\n\nI wanted to ask the students who used ChatGPT to do the reading: Why are you even at Stanford? Why be at any university at all? Isn't the point of pursuing higher education to expand our minds and become better communicators?\n\nAs I progressed through my studies, I would hear ChatGPT mentioned more and more often, with some college professors even adding an AI clause to their syllabi. Some instructors would allow students to use ChatGPT for assistance (a murky definition) while others wouldn't allow it at all.\n\nI refused to use the AI tool in any way.\n\nI didn't care if instructors allowed students to use ChatGPT. I deliberately chose not to use it at all.\n\nSure, studying and studying literature in particular was difficult, but this was why I'd chosen the major; it was challenging, and I wanted to become better with words.\n\nI chose to become an English major because I wanted to improve my writing. I lacked confidence in my writing because I didn't know how to use words when I first entered college. I didn't have that finesse.\n\nApart from wanting to become a better writer, I also wanted to defend my opinions and thoughts with flair. I wanted to articulate sentiment precisely and formulate strong arguments. I wanted to write strongly worded emails. I wanted to think and speak freely.\n\nI wouldn't have been able to achieve any of that if I used ChatGPT.\n\nWhenever I'd hear a peer say they just used ChatGPT for their homework assignments, I'd often think about the many deserving students who hadn't been offered a seat at the university — students who, in a heartbeat, would've happily done these assignments themselves.\n\nI had the privilege of studying words at a strong English literature department with so many fine writing instructors. I leaped at opportunities to have my very own work critiqued by great writers. I still can't fathom having \"my\" writing, either partially or entirely synthetic, reviewed by instructors.\n\nAfter all, I was writing in and walking about the same grounds that writing legends once did — writers like bell hooks, John Steinbeck, Karen Zacarías, and David Henry Hwang. With this writing pedigree in mind, I was inspired and motivated to write myself.\n\nNot a day goes by without me putting my English degree to good use. Not a day goes by without me being grateful to my past self for putting in the work to earn the degree herself — without ChatGPT.",

The department proposed a $100,000 lifetime borrowing limit for graduate students and a $200,000 limit for professional students, and narrowed the programs that would qualify as \"professional\" to 10, including medicine, dentistry, and law.\n\nPost-graduate nursing programs are not included in the professional definition, meaning that students in those programs would not qualify for the higher borrowing limit. Of the over 2,500 public comments received so far, more than 1,200 mentioned nursing. One comment, for example, said: \"During a critical nursing shortage it's vital that nurses are able to advance their education so they can teach the next generation of nurses.\"\n\nAnother comment said: \"Policies that make graduate nursing education less affordable will not only discourage nurses from advancing their education but will also reduce the number of nurse educators available to train the next generation of nurses. Fewer educators mean fewer nursing school slots and longer delays in bringing new nurses into the workforce, and ultimately compromising care.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, previously cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits when asked about concerns on the borrowing caps.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nData from the College Scorecard also showed that most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. Still, many of the comments expressed concern that the caps could exacerbate the existing healthcare shortage. In December, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent, urging him to revise the definition of a professional degree to include postgraduate nursing programs.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the lawmakers said. They referred to the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000 — double the proposed cap for the program.\n\nThe public comment period for the repayment proposals ends on March 2. The department said in a press release that it \"may make changes\" to its regulations based on the feedback it receives before moving toward final implementation this summer.",

    "description": "\"I don't see any other way than working up until my last day,\" Jordan Hendrickson, who has over $500,000 in student loans, said.",
    "fullText": "For some, retirement means relaxation. For Jordan Hendrickson, retirement means debt.\n\n\"I don't have any retirement savings,\" Hendrickson, 54, told Business Insider. \"I don't see any other way than working up until my last day.\"\n\nHendrickson received her doctorate in psychology in 2013, bringing her total student-loan balance to about $350,000, including what she borrowed for her bachelor's and master's degrees. While she qualified for Pell Grants, which are awarded to low-income students, Hendrickson turned to federal loans to help cover the remaining costs.\n\nShe now works two jobs, as a telehealth provider for a mental health company and on the mobile support team for her county. The latter qualifies her for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nWhile Hendrickson is about halfway through her PSLF payments, she's worried federal changes to student loans — including President Donald Trump's plans to narrow eligibility for PSLF — could leave her paying off her debt, which now stands at just over $500,000, for decades to come.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen with this. I think that's my biggest anxiety, is the uncertainty,\" Hendrickson said. \"I would like to plan for retirement, but I don't see a path forward right now, given that debt.\"\n\nBusiness Insider has previously spoken to student-loan borrowers who have said they're postponing retirement, or are struggling in retirement, due to their student-debt loads. This year's looming changes to the federal lending landscape are adding additional stress. Trump's administration will begin implementing repayment changes this summer, including new repayment plans and a new rule that would limit PSLF eligibility.\n\nWhile Hendrickson said she doesn't regret taking out student loans for her education, she wishes there were more certainty for her and other borrowers' repayment outlooks.\n\n\"The education I got was really good. I really love what I do. I do work 70 hours a week, but there's a meaning in that work,\" Hendrickson said. \"I wouldn't change it. I just wish it wasn't like this.\"\n\nWhile Hendrickson isn't sure if she'll retire, Amye Cooley, 85, is already retired — but has just over $60,000 in student loan debt weighing her down.\n\nAfter a divorce, Cooley returned to school in 1978, hoping it would help her earn more money to take care of her family. She took out about $25,000 in student loans for her bachelor's degree, but upon graduating, she was unable to find a job, so she put her loans into forbearance.\n\nShe began working as a paraprofessional in her school district in 1984, earned her teaching certification, and taught for about 15 years before retiring from her full-time job in 2010 and switching to part-time tutoring. However, she's not enjoying the peace she had hoped for because of her student loans.\n\n\"I could have new rugs put in. I could have new windows put in. I could have some work done on my car. I could stop worrying about them garnishing my Social Security,\" Cooley said. \"There's a whole lot of things I could do, but I have these student loans.\"\n\nWhile Cooley is current on her student loans, she relies on Social Security and a teacher's pension to stay afloat and is worried that her federal benefits could be seized should she fall behind on her payments. The Department of Education announced in January that it was pausing wage garnishments and tax refund seizures, but did not specify when the pause would lift.\n\nSimilar to Cooley, Grace, 67, pursued her bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology to make more money. Her balance now stands at $232,000, and despite making payments for over 25 years as required for forgiveness under income-driven repayment plans, she said she's been unable to get an answer on whether she qualifies for relief.\n\nShe's now retired, and she said the anxiety with regard to her payment outlook is overwhelming — especially because, should she qualify for forgiveness this year, it could be accompanied by thousands of dollars in taxes. A 2021 provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free expired at the end of 2025, and the Trump administration has given no indication that it will be renewed.\n\nWith major federal repayment changes looming, though, the administration said it's acting in borrowers' best interests to curb excessive borrowing and simplify a complex student-loan system. Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement last year that the repayment changes \"will benefit borrowers who will no longer be pushed into insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off.\"\n\nThose improvements are coming too late for Cooley, who said her life— and retirement — was altered the moment she chose to take out student loans.\n\n\"I went back to school to give my kids a better life,\" Cooley said. \"And now 41 years later, I'm still paying this off. It's made a hell of a difference in my life.\"",

    "title": "A physician who racked up 7-figures of student debt explains how she started buying investment properties with her 401(k) funds",
    "description": "When Dr. Jill Green decided she wanted to invest in property, she was saddled with student loan debt and didn't have liquid savings. She did have money in a 401(k), but figured those funds were off limits.",
    "fullText": "\"My net worth was negative $1 million,\" the family practice and emergency medicine doctor told Business Insider. \"Our primary home was our only asset.\"\n\nGreen, who began her career in investment banking before pivoting to medicine, began entertaining the idea of property investing after hearing a physician couple speak at a virtual entrepreneur event for doctors. The couple, Kenji and Leti Asakura, used real estate investing to create an additional revenue stream, allowing them to scale back at work and spend half the year traveling.\n\nShe decided to enroll in their course, designed to help physicians build rental portfolios and reduce taxes.\n\nIt was a decent chunk of upfront money, about $2,500, for someone with a negative net worth, but Green viewed it as a smart investment for her and her husband.\n\n\"I was like, if we even get $10,000 back in our taxes next year, the course will have paid for itself four times. It seemed like a no-brainer, and he agreed,\" she said. \"So, I took the course, and our tax return that next year, after implementing what they taught, was $40,000. I was able to take that money and use it to buy another investment.\"\n\nWhen Green decided she wanted to invest in property, the main barrier was coming up with funds for the down payment: \"We didn't have $200,000 sitting in a savings account.\"\n\nShe and her husband did have some money in their 401(k) accounts, but they figured it was off-limits.\n\n\"I had heard of people taking money out of their 401(k) as loans before, and my thought was, 'Those people are irresponsible. You don't touch your retirement account,'\" said Green.\n\nIndeed, retirement-specific accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs come with early withdrawal penalties, intended to discourage investors from dipping into their retirement funds. However, as she learned in the real estate course, she could borrow (not withdraw) from her account.\n\n\"It's essentially taking a loan from yourself, and you're paying the interest back to yourself,\" Green explained. \"Your retirement account doesn't get touched, and there are no tax implications.\"\n\nShe and her husband ended up taking a loan from their 401(k) to help fund the purchase of their first investment property, a medical office building.\n\nUsing an SBA loan and buying in a low-interest rate environment helped keep their costs low, she added: \"The down payment requirement was quite small, and the interest rate was incredible.\" She said they locked in a 4% rate.\n\nBorrowing from her 401(k) posed a greater mental barrier. She had to convince herself that \"I'm not a reckless idiot. This is going to be OK to try something that I considered audacious like that,\" she said, adding that people still question her when they find out she used retirement money to fund real estate purchases. \"I've used that strategy more than once, and I've now become quite comfortable with it, but when I talked to other physicians about it, they're like, 'Do I need to write you a check for something? Are you doing OK?'\"\n\nAs for the actual process, she said it was simple and kick-started their rental portfolio, which they've gradually scaled, adding one rental property per year.\n\nThey selected a five-year repayment plan, which translated to about $200 per paycheck.\n\n\"It wasn't anything that we felt as a family,\" said Green. \"They just take it out of your paycheck. You're essentially paying yourself back every month. It was very easy.\"\n\nGreen said she doesn't believe real estate is as out of reach as many people think it is, particularly professionals with access to retirement accounts: \"Most people have a 401(k) because we've all been told to save for that, so most people have access to some capital that they can borrow from.\"\n\nAnd, it can be a potentially life-changing investment.\n\nShe said she's now debt-free, and her net worth has swung by about $4 million since 2019: \"I've been able to go to $3 million positive net worth. I don't think that there's a way to have that kind of power to amplify and literally change the position that you're in, from financial insecurity to financial security.\"\n\nThe most difficult part is taking the first step, especially if you're starting from a scarcity mindset like Green was. Her advice is to start small: Watch YouTube videos or listen to podcasts about real estate, \n\n\"Just start somewhere,\" she said. \"The difference between 0 and 1 is infinite — they call that the infinite 1%, to go from 0% to 1% of doing something. So, if you can just start somewhere, it literally doesn't even matter where, then you're already infinitely farther ahead than someone who never starts at all.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (PIX11) — A New Jersey mother is sharing her daughter’s story in hopes of changing how high-caffeine drinks are labeled across the country, and the effort is now reaching Capitol Hill.\n\n“That was the day when my life changed forever,” Jill Katz said. It’s been years since her daughter Sarah died. In 2022, the 21-year-old college student went into cardiac arrest while out with friends. Her mother says it all started with a cup of lemonade, packed with caffeine.\n“She was at a friend’s birthday party, in college, and she collapsed. She didn’t make it,” Katz said. “It’s the call that keeps parents awake at night.”\n\nSarah had a heart condition, and her family says she had always been mindful about what she ate and drank. According to her mother, she didn’t realize that 30 ounces of the drink she ordered at a popular restaurant chain contained as much as 390 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nFor context, the FDA says most healthy adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, so the drink Sarah had was close to that limit in a single serving. “With grief, there is no restoration, but transformation,” Katz said. “Being involved with her legacy and being able to save other people’s lives in her memory.”\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\nThe restaurant chain has since removed the item from its menu following multiple lawsuits.\n\nCaffeine is widely used to boost energy by stimulating metabolism and making the heartbeat faster. Doctors, however, say high doses can be risky, especially for people with underlying conditions.\n\nAccording to the Caffeine Informer database, a single shot of espresso contains about 77 milligrams of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 80 to 300 milligrams, depending on the brand and size. “When you stimulate so much, and the heart is not prepared for that, they can just collapse,” said cardiologist Dr. Daniel Garcia.\n\nGarcia says the lack of consistent labeling and regulation around caffeine can be dangerous for everyone, from college students to older adults. “As a cardiologist, I advise completely against any energy drink or high-content caffeine drink,” he said. “You don’t know exactly what the amount is and how your body is going to respond.”\n\nNow, Sarah’s death is drawing attention from lawmakers.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Rob Menendez is pushing for the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, federal legislation that would require clearer warnings about caffeine in foods and beverages.\n\nRequire companies to clearly list caffeine content on bottles, cans, and packaging.\n\nRequire chain restaurants to disclose caffeine levels on menus.\n\nFlag items with 150 milligrams or more of caffeine with a visible “high caffeine” warning.\n\nAdd advisory language about recommended daily caffeine limits.\n\nOrder federal health agencies to study caffeine’s health effects and launch public education campaigns.\n\nSupporters say the goal is not to ban caffeinated drinks, but to make sure consumers know what they’re getting before they take a sip. “People need to know what they’re putting in their bodies,” Katz said. “We’re not talking about limiting or banning. We’re talking about making an informed choice.”\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support in Congress, with a total of 14 cosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats.",

    "fullText": "This week, I had the chance to speak with longtime Notre Dame athletic trainer Mike Bean about a problem he spent decades watching athletes struggle through—and the solution he eventually built himself.\n\nAfter 36 years with Notre Dame student-athletes across baseball, men’s and women’s soccer, hockey, tennis and for the last 30 years football, Bean had seen just about every version of an ankle injury imaginable. He’d also seen the limitations of how those injuries were treated.\n\n“Ankle injuries and ankle recovery have always been a major obstacle for athletes,” Bean said. “We had options to protect the ankle from spraining, or treat it after a sprain—but I always felt there had to be a better way than what we were doing.”\n\nThat belief stayed with him throughout his career.\n\nBean’s path to Notre Dame began after completing his master’s degree in sports medicine at Western Michigan University, followed by a 10-month internship with Notre Dame’s sports medicine staff. That internship turned into a full-time role—and eventually a 36-year tenure on the Irish sidelines.\n\nDuring that time, ankle injuries remained one of the most persistent challenges he faced.\n\n“Low ankle sprains are one thing, but high ankle sprains are much more problematic,” he explained. “If they’re severe enough, they can even require surgery.”\n\nTraditional treatment options presented their own issues. Braces were worn directly on the ankle, forcing athletes to squeeze both foot and brace into a shoe that was never designed to accommodate both.\n\n“That compromises the integrity of the shoe,” Bean said. “And once again, I kept thinking—there has to be a better option.”\n\nAround 2009 or 2010, Bean decided to act on that instinct.\n\n“I started putting some ideas down on paper,” he said. Working with a local orthotist in South Bend, he began the long process of turning concept into reality. It took several years of refinement, but eventually, they had something that worked.\n\nThat something became the TayCo Brace.\n\nVisually, it immediately stood apart from anything else on the market.\n\n“First off, our brace goes over the shoe,” Bean said. “That alone sets it apart from most ankle braces out there.”\n\nBut the design wasn’t just about looking different—it was about function.\n\n“I wanted something that would support the ankle without compromising the shoe,” he explained. “And I wanted people to be able to wear their orthotics too.”\n\n“I wanted to support more than just one part of the ankle,” Bean said. “The ankle, the heel or hindfoot, and the midfoot. Supporting all of those areas is a huge benefit.”\n\nThat design is especially important for high ankle sprains, which affect rotational movement.\n\n“Our brace minimizes that rotation so the injury can heal safer and quicker,” he said.\n\nWhile Bean is quick to point out that no brace replaces proper treatment and rehabilitation, he believes the TayCo Brace plays a critical role in restoring confidence—something that’s just as important as physical healing.\n\n“The brace isn’t the savior,” he said. “The athlete still has to rehab. The ankle has to get stronger. Swelling has to come down safely.”\n\nWhat the brace does provide is the ability to return to normal movement patterns almost immediately.\n\n“They can walk with a normal gait pattern pretty much from the beginning, and pain-free,” Bean said. “That allows them to retain strength while they heal.”\n\nJust as important, it removes fear.\n\n“It gives them confidence that their ankle isn’t going to give out,” he explained. “It takes away the fear of reinjury before they’re fully back to strength.”\n\nWhether it’s planting during a football play or sprinting down the first-base line, that confidence can make all the difference.\n\nFrom a trainer’s perspective, Bean believes the TayCo Brace has changed how ankle injuries are managed altogether.\n\n“Ankles are meant to move,” he said. “The first thing we want to do with an ankle injury is get you moving.”\n\nTraditional walking boots often limit that movement—but they also create new problems.\n\n“When you put someone in a walking boot, it raises one hip higher than the other,” Bean said. “That can lead to hip or back injuries, and muscle atrophy.”\n\nBecause the TayCo Brace allows normal gait and movement, athletes can maintain strength and progress into advanced rehab sooner.\n\n“It gets you back into your activities as quickly—and safely—as possible,” he said.\n\nLike many athletic trainers, Bean was used to fabricating braces and splints as part of the job. Introducing the TayCo Brace followed that same organic path.\n\n“We tried it in practice for quite some time before ever using it in games,” he said. “We had really great success, and it just kind of snowballed from there.”\n\nSoon, athletes were asking for it by name.\n\n“Now I’ve got guys coming into my office saying their ankle hurts and asking if they can use one during practice,” Bean said.\n\nThat trust eventually extended far beyond Notre Dame—into collegiate and professional sports nationwide.\n\nSeeing the brace highlighted on ESPN during a recent pregame broadcast was a moment that caught even Bean by surprise.\n\n“I thought, wow—that’s some cheap advertising,” he joked. “But it was really gratifying to see people taking notice.”\n\nWhat Bean never anticipated was how far beyond athletics the brace would reach.\n\nIn 2016, he partnered with Dr. Fred Ferlic of South Bend Orthopaedics, who shared Bean’s frustration with walking boots and saw the potential for something better.\n\nTogether, they expanded the TayCo Brace into multiple versions: for military training, workers wearing steel-toed boots, senior citizens with ankle instability, post-surgical rehab patients, and even individuals with neurological disorders.\n\n“We’ve used it with patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome,” Bean said. “It’s helped preserve their gait and prevent their ankles from buckling.”\n\nThe feedback has been overwhelming.\n\n“Hearing from people who were homebound and can now get out and walk safely—that’s what really moved the needle for me,” he said. “Helping people get back to their lives is why we do this.”\n\nWhile seeing the TayCo Brace used in the NFL, college athletics, and high schools is gratifying, Bean says those moments pale in comparison to something much simpler.\n\n“Seeing an elderly man or woman able to go to the grocery store again—that’s the most gratifying thing for me,” he said.\n\nEven the name of the brace reflects how personal the journey has been.\n\n“It comes from my family,” Bean said. “Tay is from my oldest daughter Taylor, and Co is from my wife Colleen and my youngest daughter Courtney.”\n\nFor a man who spent his career quietly helping athletes recover behind the scenes, the TayCo Brace represents something bigger than innovation.\n\nIt represents a lifetime spent asking one simple question—and refusing to stop until he found the answer:\n\nFor a man who spent 36 years serving Notre Dame student-athletes, it feels fitting that Mike Bean’s most lasting impact extends far beyond the sidelines. The same care, patience, and athlete-first mindset that defined his time in the training room now lives on through the TayCo Brace—helping people of all ages return to movement, confidence, and independence. It’s a reminder that some of the most meaningful contributions to the game aren’t made under the lights, but in the quiet work of helping others heal.\n\nYou can learn more about the TayCo brace here: Keep Your Shoes with TayCo Brace – Walking Boot/AFO Alternative",

    "description": "A 34-year-old woman who posed as a Boston high school student befriended children ages 13 to 16, telling them she had a foster mother and convincing them they were helping her with personal issues.",
    "fullText": "The 34-year-old woman who posed as a student at several different Boston Public Schools tricked children into believing she was their friend and left them emotionally scarred, a former high school student who met the woman said on Tuesday.\n\n“It just makes me hard to trust people ... (it makes me question) is it this person, or is this just like another Shelby,” said Janelle Lamons, a former student at Burke High School, who was friends with an adult woman she thought was her age during the 2022-23 academic school year.\n\n“Moving forward, I think a lot of students are going to continue to feel betrayal,” Lamons said. “Even though it happened three years ago, they would never forget how that made them feel at that time.”\n\nShelby Hewitt, 34, pleaded guilty in Suffolk County Superior Court on Tuesday to identity fraud, violating the standards of conduct for a public employee and three counts of forgery of a document. Three other charges were dismissed as part of the plea agreement.\n\nShe was ordered to serve four years of probation for each guilty plea, which will be served concurrently, and pay more than $9,000 in restitution. Her trial scheduled for next week was therefore canceled.\n\nUnder her probation, Hewitt must continue her mental health treatment and prescribed medications, stay away from the child whose identity she stole while the child was in Department of Children and Families custody. She also must stay away from all Boston Public Schools, cannot be employed as a social worker and is not allowed to seek a social work license.\n\nAfter her guilty plea, Hewitt apologized to the courtroom and said she was “deeply sorry for the pain I caused,” acknowledging her actions “caused confusion, alarm and probably fear for students, families and staff.”\n\n“I should never have been there ... I violated the trust of the school community, my family and everybody in my life that loved me,” Hewitt said. She added she carries “shame every day” and “was not being a good person,” but is continuing her mental health treatment “to try to be a better one.”\n\nHewitt, who is college and graduate-school educated, is a former social worker with the Department of Children and Families, most recently from Dec. 2021 until Feb. 2023. She took on two different identities when she was posing as a student — one of them being the identity of an actual child in DCF care, prosecutors said.\n\n“Both systems which she undermined are systems ... designed to care and protect children,” Assistant District Attorney Ursula Knight said on Tuesday.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Hewitt — who was in her early 30s at the time — enrolled herself as a 16-year-old in the ninth grade at Burke High School, prosecutors said. She then requested a transfer to Brighton High School and at the beginning of June 2023, enrolled herself again under a different name at English High School.\n\nShe also created false DCF social worker identities, complete with a fake state website domain and profiles, in order to enroll herself as a student, according to prosecutors.\n\nDuring her time attending classes at the Boston schools, Hewitt posed as a child in need of special education services. She also enrolled for eating disorder care at Walden Behavioral Treatment Center, through her false DCF social worker profiles.\n\nHewitt made friends with students ages 13 through 16, telling them she was from Colombia and had a foster mother, Lamons said. These children were “very real” victims of her actions, Judge Debra Squires-Lee told Hewitt, who “thought you were their friend, thought they were helping you with your issues” and “have been harmed.”\n\nOutside the courtroom, Hewitt refused to tell reporters why she chose to pose as a student. Her lawyer, Timothy Flaherty, said she’s “a young woman with significant mental health concerns” and a “lifetime of emotional issues dominating bad decisions.”\n\nBut to Lamons and her mother, Robin Williams, probation is not enough.\n\n“For her to have probation — that’s an insult ... she is a monster,” Williams said. She is looking for a conversation with Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, BPS Superintendent Mary Skipper and Gov. Maura Healey on the situation, she said.\n\n“We all need to come together and find a better solution, to make sure that this does not happen again, and make sure that the kids are safe,” Williams said.\n\nSpencer shopping plaza barricaded suspect dead; officer and person shot\n\nBarricaded suspect at Spencer shopping plaza killed in shootout with police; officer shot\n\nChicago-based rap manager on trial for alleged conspiracy to bankroll elite lifestyle\n\nMinor charged with attempted murder after fight in Ipswich leads to stabbing\n\nMurder suspect wanted in Mass. arrested as fugitive in Maine",

    "description": "As a med student at Stanford, I think about my mother, who knows very little English. I wonder how I could make patients like her more comfortable.",
    "fullText": "My patient set down his knitting sticks, leaned over, and said in Spanish: \"Wow. This went by fast.\"\n\nI thought he meant the movie we were watching. Ciro Guerra's \"El abrazo de la serpiente.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, answering in Spanish.\n\n\"La vida,\" he said. \"Pasó volando.\"\n\nHe was a patient I met as a volunteer back in college. Our conversations unfolded because I could meet him in his own language. Spanish turned a hospital bed into a place where he became more than a diagnosis. I heard about the life he shared with his late wife, learned of his children's hobbies, and, more than once, the story of how he finally won his mother-in-law's approval.\n\nThese early conversations led me to deepen my love of language as a medical student at Stanford.\n\nIn college, a medical Spanish course at Yale transformed how I understood patient care. We practiced explaining conditions and conducting clinical conversations entirely in Spanish. We studied health reporting from across Latin America and worked through practice cases involving linguistic barriers to care.\n\nThe class pushed my perspective beyond English and an America-centric system, giving me the foundation for global health work and health equity research that ultimately inspired my interest in medicine.\n\nNow, whenever I interact with a patient as a medical student, I picture my own immigrant mother, who speaks little English, in the exam chair. Would she feel safe? Would my words reassure her — or push her to nod along politely while hiding her confusion?\n\nTrust, I learned, is the real currency of medicine.\n\nOutside of my coursework as a medical student at Stanford, I serve at free clinics and vaccination drives, where many patients arrive alone, without caregivers who can translate. At vaccination sites, staff and professors call on me to step in as a translator.\n\nLast month, during a free clinic shift, I was able to speak my dialect, Fujianese, with a patient for the first time since coming to California. It was a humbling and emotional moment for both of us. I helped take her history and clarified the specific legal and insurance barriers she faced to the physicians. As she spoke through tears about her uncertainty and fears, I stayed with her while we connected her to community organizations working to secure alternative forms of health coverage for undocumented patients after her Medicaid coverage was dismantled.\n\nThe stakes are real. When language barriers stand between patients and clinicians, studies show more medical errors, delayed diagnoses, and lower use of preventive primary care.\n\nOn one of the evenings I spent with that patient at the hospital, who shared his life story with me, the overhead speakers crackled: \"The wards will be closed to visitors in 10 minutes.\"\n\nShortly afterward, one of the patient-care assistants opened his room door to check that we heard the announcement.\n\nI remember him saying, \"I think I'll be fine. My wife will be coming later.\" My patient then pointed at me. \"He can help me until she gets here.\"\n\nThe assistant's eyes met mine. \"That's wonderful,\" she said.",

    "title": "What Happened When a 'Ghost Student' Scammer Took Out Student Loans in My Name",
    "description": "Identity thieves are absconding with federal student aid.",
    "fullText": "Identity thieves are now using college enrollment to take out student loans in victims' names. This so-called \"ghost student\" scam capitalizes on limited verification for online class sign-ups and the federal aid application process to steal millions in funds while assigning the debt to unsuspecting targets.\n\nI personally have been a victim of this scam, which I discovered only after an outstanding student loan debt landed on my credit report in 2024. Here's how the scheme works.\n\nTo run this scam, fraudsters use stolen or fake identities to enroll \"ghost students\" in online classes while also applying for federal student aid, including Pell grants and loans. Of course, they never actually attend those classes, instead disappearing with the money and placing the resulting financial burden on the individuals and schools they've conned.\n\nIn my case, scammers had used just enough accurate personal information to \"enroll\" at a community college in southern California and take out a Pell grant in my name. However, because the enrollment was fraudulent, the grant was considered overpaid and sent to collections via the U.S. Department of Education—which is how it landed on my credit record.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Inspector General (OIG), this type of fraud blew up with the shift to online and remote learning, particularly at community colleges that offer open enrollment (and generally engage in limited verification of applicant information). Increasingly, AI tools also likely help scammers to expand their reach with enrollment and loan applications and get past identity verification checks.\n\nThe scheme has affected schools across the country. In California alone, nearly a third of all applicants to community colleges in 2024 were identified as fake. A handful of individuals have been sent to prison after stealing millions in \"ghost student\" financial aid, but the OIG still has 200 investigations open.\n\nFor individuals targeted by the ghost student scam, the consequences are essentially the fallout of identity theft, such as debt falsely assigned to you that negatively affects your credit or the inability to get legitimate student loans (or any other type of credit) when you actually need them.\n\nIt also forces you into a long and arduous process of disputing the fraud: I spent several months going back and forth between the Department of Education, the community college, the credit bureaus, and an attorney to track down the fraudulent applications, file identity theft reports, provide extensive documentation proving that I wasn't responsible for the debt, and get the information removed from my record.\n\nUnfortunately, the ghost student scam circumvents a standard anti-fraud safeguard because most federal student aid doesn't require a credit check. (My credit record had been frozen for years, and still was at the time that this fraud took place.) While you should absolutely freeze your credit and thaw it temporarily only when needed, this step may not prevent bad actors from using your information to apply for grants and loans.\n\nBecause this scam is a form of identity theft, you should take every precaution to safeguard your personal information. Given the ubiquity of data breaches and hacks, you can assume a lot of it is already out in the open, but that doesn't mean you can't lock accounts down and practice good digital hygiene. Credit fraud alerts and a regular review of your credit reports will help you catch any suspicious activity quickly.",

Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.\n\nOur vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.\n\nBefore Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.\n\nOur students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776),  Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.\n\nEmerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.\n\nWe call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.\n\nThis is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.\n\nThis role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.\n\nYou design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.\n\nYou are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.\n\nYou refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat \"waiting for a developer\" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.\n\nYou think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.\n\nYou talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.\n\nYou have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.\n\nYou believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.\n\nYou work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.\n\nTalking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.\n\nPrototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.\n\nShipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let \"it hasn't been built yet\" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.\n\nDesigning the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.\n\nMeasuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.\n\nWorking across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.\n\nDocumenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.",

    "description": "Biden's reforms to the bankruptcy process for student-loan borrowers are working.  The main issue: not enough people know about it.",
    "fullText": "It's not a myth: you really can get rid of your student loans in court.\n\nFor decades, student-loan borrowers seeking relief through bankruptcy rarely succeeded. However, 2022 guidance implemented by former President Joe Biden eased the process by establishing clearer, more streamlined guidelines for borrowers. The changes have allowed the bankruptcy process to move more quickly.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has retained the guidance, and a recent study by Jason Iuliano, a law professor at the University of Utah, showed that it's working for borrowers. Iuliano found that success rates for student-loan borrowers seeking bankruptcy have reached 87% since Biden's guidance was implemented, and of those borrowers, 97% of their student-loan balances were eliminated. Still, bankruptcy filings remain \"remarkably low,\" Iuliano wrote.\n\nThe reforms led to about 350 additional bankruptcy cases following the new guidance, Iuliano said. With over 40 million borrowers holding student debt and 5 million of them in default, the increase in cases is quite small.\n\n\"Put differently, in the first full year of the reforms, only one in 42,000 struggling borrowers filed an adversary proceeding to seek relief,\" he said.\n\nThe lack of awareness of the bankruptcy process is a concern for Bob and Tammy Branson, a bankruptcy attorney and senior paralegal, respectively, in Florida. They said they've seen an increase in successful cases for clients seeking bankruptcy since the 2022 guidance, but many attorneys across the country aren't taking cases because they don't know it works.\n\n\"A lot of attorneys, we think, don't believe it works because we couldn't do it for so long,\" Tammy said. \"They don't even realize that this is solid. The attorneys for the Department of Justice are telling us to go forward. They're processing them. None of us knows each day what could happen, but it is a good process, and it's working.\"\n\nThe student-loan industry is undergoing critical changes in the coming year, making it increasingly important that borrowers are aware of their avenues for relief, including bankruptcy. The Trump administration is set to begin implementing its new repayment plans with less generous terms this summer. While wage garnishment and tax refund seizures are paused for defaulted borrowers, those behind on payments have a limited time to make a plan to return to good standing or risk losing their federal benefits.\n\nIt's not just low earners, Tammy said. Even borrowers making six figures might find they cannot afford their student-loan payments in addition to housing, food, and childcare costs, and bankruptcy could be their best way out — especially once consequences for defaulted borrowers resume.\n\n\"We think it's going to drive more people to bankruptcy because it might be their best way to resolve it,\" Tammy said. \"Their only way to resolve it.\"\n\nPrior to the 2022 guidance, borrowers had to meet the \"undue hardship\" standard, which required them to show that they could not maintain a minimal standard of living, that their circumstances were unlikely to improve, and that they had made a good-faith effort to repay their debt.\n\nThat was a difficult bar to clear, and courts interpreted the standard strictly, resulting in very few successful cases. Biden's reforms retained the undue hardship standard but reduced the burden on borrowers by allowing them to complete self-attestation forms to help courts assess their discharge requests and avoid a lengthy investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said in July 2024 that borrowers filed 588 new cases from October 2023 to March 2024, marking a 36% increase from the prior six-month period. Additionally, a group of Democratic lawmakers said in October 2024 that, based on data they obtained, nearly 900 borrowers filed for bankruptcy in the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, and 85% of those borrowers received full or partial discharges.\n\nThe lawmakers wrote at the time that the Education and Justice Departments \"should continue to educate potentially qualifying borrowers, their attorneys, and other individuals and organizations who work to help borrowers.\"\n\nOnce a borrower files for bankruptcy, borrowers are protected from garnishments, Bob said, so it's in a borrower's best interest to file as soon as they can if they're at risk of defaulting.\n\n\"Bankruptcy, in general, gives everybody that fresh start and a breather,\" Bob said.",

    "fullText": "Following an electric 2025 season that saw him hoist both the national championship and the Heisman trophy as an Indiana Hoosier, Fernando Mendoza now finds himself as the runaway favorite to be the first overall pick of the 2026 NFL Draft. That means that professional scouts and coaching staff alike will now be assessing not just his athleticism, but his attention to detail, pattern recognition, general recall, and the overall state of his mental capacities.\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into studying and understanding an NFL playbook, but according to one of Mendoza’s former classmates, the Las Vegas Raiders are going to love what they see in Mendoza when they finally get to interview him and quiz him.\n\nA former UC Berkeley student, claiming to have shared a contracts law class with the future first-overall draft pick during his time at the university, suggested that the professor of their class was notorious for giving student athletes, specifically football players, a hard time. “If you are a football player at Cal, there is, unfortunately, a stereotype,” she noted.\n\n“The professor would ask a law question and then ask one of the football players like, ‘Why is this, this?’ or ‘Why is this that?’ Fernando always knew his shit. Like, he would shut up the professor because he would be so impressed that he knew what was going on, and mind you, this is a law class at Berkeley.”\n\nSuffice to say, Mendoza’s competitiveness extends well beyond the football field, and he wasn’t going to be shown up by some uppity law professor from the West Coast. Although the fan did also suggest that the instructor’s confrontations with student athletes were never hostile and predominantly friendly.\n\n“The professor would always tease football players and most of the football players would tease him back, and it would just be some kind of banter.” she recalled. Nevertheless, that kind of attention to detail and willingness to understand the finer points of any subject is exactly what head coaches and coordinators will be looking for in Mendoza’s upcoming interviews.\n\nThrow in the fact that the 22-year-old has one of the most positive attitudes of any prospect in recent memory, and it’s safe to say that this will be a slam dunk for the Raiders on night one of this year’s draft. “Even though he was being teased by the professor, he would just be smiling. He would answer whenever he was asked. He was such a genuine, humble guy.”\n\nMuch has been made of Mendoza’s squeaky clean image, but as more personal testimonies, like this one, begin to come to the forefront, it becomes readily apparent that he is in fact as nice as everyone says he is, and that will certainly go long way in securing him a lengthy career in the National Football League.\n\nThe post “Fernando Mendoza Used to Regularly Stump His Own Law Professor”: Berkeley Law Student Puts Insane Allegations Against Heisman Winner appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Leaders at Navient and Sallie Mae said that Trump's sweeping student-loan repayment changes will be a boon to their private lending business.",
    "fullText": "Private student-loan companies are gearing up for a big year ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is preparing to roll out its sweeping student-loan repayment changes beginning in July. Those changes include new repayment plans and caps on federal borrowing for advanced degrees.\n\nSome companies see those changes as an opportunity for the private lending industry. During an earnings call last week, Jonathan Witter, the CEO of lender Sallie Mae, said that the company is \"excited about the opportunity created by the recent federal student lending reforms.\"\n\n\"These changes should reduce the likelihood of students and families taking on unsustainable levels of student debt,\" Witter said. \"These reforms also create the opportunity for us to help more students and families.\"\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminates the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. The legislation also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professionals, such as those in medical or law school.\n\nWitter said the company expects those changes to bring in an estimated $5 billion in annual loan originations. Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed similar sentiment during the company's earnings call this month. He said that the changes to Grad PLUS are an \"opportunity\" for the company to expand, saying that \"there's a lot of room for growth\" this year.\n\nPrivate lenders have been anticipating these repayment changes for months. Yowan said during an August 2025 earnings call that eliminating the Grad PLUS program is \"a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\" SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto said at the time that the repayment changes could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\"\n\nWhile private lenders anticipate boosts to their businesses from Trump's repayment overhaul, some critics and borrowers are concerned. Borrowers could choose to forgo their programs entirely due to more limited federal financing, and if they turn to private lenders, they would lose out on federal debt relief and forgiveness.\n\nSara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, previously told Business Insider that private student loans could also have higher interest rates than federal loans, leaving borrowers with more unaffordable debt.\n\n\"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,\" Partridge said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration said the reforms are intended to curb excessive borrowing and increase accountability in the federal system.\n\n\"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a January statement.",

    "description": "Trump's admin posted its proposed rule to overhaul student-loan repayment, including new caps on borrowing. The public will have 30 days to comment.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping student-loan changes are a key step closer to becoming reality.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on Thursday that it has published the proposed rule on student-loan repayment changes in the Federal Register, a key step the department must complete before implementing the final rule.\n\nAfter Trump signed his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation into law, the department began negotiations with stakeholders on the proposed changes, which included new borrowing caps, the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans, and a new repayment plan with less generous terms than those of existing plans.\n\nPublishing the rule to the Federal Register is the next step in the negotiated rulemaking process, allowing the department to progress toward implementing the rule in July.\n\n\"With consensus reached in support of the Department's proposed rule, we have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nOnce the rule is formally published on Friday, the public will have until March 2 to comment on the proposed rule. The department said in its press release that it would consider the comments and \"may make changes to the proposed regulations in response to substantive comments.\"\n\nOne key change in the rule is the creation of a new Repayment Assistance Plan. It would set borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance would be forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than the SAVE plan, which the legislation eliminates. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, allowed for lower monthly payments and forgiveness after 10 years.\n\nWhile the spending legislation would not eliminate SAVE before 2028, the department announced a proposed settlement which, if approved, would accelerate that timeline and require borrowers to switch to a new plan within a limited timeframe.\n\nIn addition to the new repayment plans, the proposed rule would place new borrowing caps on graduate and professional degrees while eliminating the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nChanges for defaulted student-loan borrowers are also coming; the rule would allow borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans twice, a process that would require them to work with their servicer on a payment plan that would eventually result in the default status being removed from their credit reports. Borrowers were previously allowed just one chance to rehabilitate.",

    "description": "I studied music in both Hong Kong and the US. In China, I did most of my work on my own time and didn't need to meet many requirements.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John von Seggern, founder of Futureproof Music School. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the 90s, the music scene in Asia was booming. I'm a bass player and jazz musician, and I was drawn to Japan in particular. Japanese people are known for being music lovers, and I enjoy their culture. It seemed like a good place to start a career.\n\nThere, I connected with a well-known artist in Hong Kong. I started touring Hong Kong and mainland China. After five big tours, I was tired. I've always loved studying, reading, and learning. I was dating a graduate student at the University of Hong Kong, and I thought that getting my master's degree would give me a much-needed break.\n\nI didn't need to pass any tests to get into the program; I just submitted a research proposal. My area of study — the intersection of music and the internet — was unique at the time, which I think helped me get in.\n\nThe University of Hong Kong follows a British model, which depends a lot on self-directed learning. I had a few small seminars during my roughly 18 months at the college, but most of my work was done on my own time. I'd meet with my advisor weekly, and then go off and do the reading and research he recommended.\n\nI received a fairly generous graduate school stipend in Hong Kong. It was enough to pay my rent and live on, and because of the relaxed time requirements, I could supplement my income by playing music gigs in the city.\n\nI was the only American in my program; most of the others were Chinese. There was a high regard for education in Hong Kong. Although it was unusual for a student to be in their 30s, people respected that I had returned to school.\n\nI did occasional work as a graduate assistant, and most of the undergrad students were Hong Kong natives. They were very disciplined and turned in top-quality work. Later, when I was a graduate assistant in the US, I was sad to see that my students' writing wasn't as strong as their Chinese counterparts.\n\nI really enjoyed being at the university, but I was getting concerned about the future of Hong Kong. The island was returned to China in 1997. During my travels, mainland China had always felt black and white, whereas Hong Kong was technicolor. Now, it felt that Hong Kong was beginning to fade. This was a big point of conversation among foreign faculty at the university.\n\nI decided to return to the US, just as lots of musicians settled in California. When I enrolled at the University of California, Riverside, I immediately noticed differences.\n\nTo begin with, the college didn't recognize most of the work I'd done in Hong Kong. I was able to bring my original research, but I didn't get credit for seminars, mostly because the British approach didn't equate easily with the American system.\n\nThe study in California was much more prescriptive, with required classes. At first, I didn't like that because I wanted to pursue my own intellectual interests. In hindsight, however, I was forced to learn a lot of fundamental knowledge that was beneficial.\n\nBeing in grad school in the US felt like a struggle to survive. I was expected to work more hours for a much smaller stipend — not even enough to cover rent. When I graded papers from undergrads, I was surprised when people handed in papers with obvious misspellings. It felt like a level of carelessness that I hadn't seen in Hong Kong.\n\nI wouldn't say that either China or the US was better for grad school; they were just two different approaches.\n\nUltimately, I'm glad I did both. The Hong Kong system was more personal, whereas the US system felt like boot camp, full of requirements I needed to meet.\n\nBoth experiences have benefited me in the years since. Although no one has ever asked me for my degree, the knowledge I gained in Hong Kong and Riverside has been really helpful.\n\nHave you attended college in both the US and China?

    "description": "Virta Health CEO Sami Inkinen only felt like he “made it” once in 2008, when he was able to pay off $100,000 in debt. He didn’t own a car until he was 37, and is “happy with very little.”",
    "fullText": "When envisioning the CEO of a billion-dollar company, it’s easy to fall victim to the clichés: a well-manicured businessman adorned in designer clothes, jet-setting from one international meeting to the next, a team of assistants in tow. But not every entrepreneur enjoys the spoils of their success with a glitzy lifestyle—some are simply thankful to pay off their student loans.\n\nSerial entrepreneur Sami Inkinen has founded and scaled three different companies—including two unicorns—throughout his 20-year career. While the Virta Health CEO has built wealth thanks to his business success, he isn’t concerned with his net worth. In fact, Inkinen only viewed himself as wealthy when he was able to repay the $100,000 of student debt that was burning a hole in his bank account.\n\n“There’s one moment in my life that I felt rich. And then after that, I’ve never thought of money,” Inkinen tells Fortune. In 2008, three years after Inkinen cofounded real estate search company Trulia, he sold off a batch of secondary shares worth $500,000 pre-tax. “I had enough money to pay all my student debts. I was able to buy whatever I wanted, and it was a very expensive bicycle purchase, [and] furnishing my tiny apartment in San Francisco.”\n\nThe immigrant entrepreneur first made his foray into entrepreneurship with mobile software company Matchem back in 2000 when he was still living in Finland. After two and a half years serving as the cofounder and VP of business development, Inkinen sold the organization for a few million dollars, and uprooted his life in Europe to head to the U.S.\n\nThe Gen X entrepreneur attended Stanford’s MBA program, graduating in 2005 with an advanced business degree and $100,000 of student debt. Consulting giant McKinsey floated him a six-figure job offer, flush with a $10,000 signing bonus. It was a chance for Inkinen to quickly pay off his loans, but he skirted the opportunity and returned to entrepreneurship.\n\nFor the next decade, the entrepreneur helped scale Trulia into an industry staple, before Zillow acquired the company for a whopping $3.5 billion in 2015. Now, Inkinen is 11 years into his third stint as a founder, serving as the CEO of $2 billion healthcare business Virta Health. His student loans are squared away, bills are covered, and housing is fully furnished.\n\nInkinen will always remember the excitement of financial security he felt back in 2008, but stipulates the thrill was fleeting. It’s not in his nature to be “money-driven,” the executive says.\n\n“This feeling of money bringing happiness disappeared in less than two or three days. I was like, ‘Okay, well, it’s nice that I have no debt,’” Inkinen explains. “Money isn’t going to make my life or break it, and it’s not going to bring happiness.”",

Between new federal loan caps and the looming shadow of generative artificial intelligence, the legal profession’s newest recruits are walking into a high-stakes gamble that looks very different from the one their predecessors lost after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEnrollment rose to 52,404 by 2010, a 7 percent jump from three years earlier. Many of those students didn’t enter the legal careers they may have envisioned; about half of 2011 law school graduates were not working in full-time jobs that required a law degree within a year of graduation.\n\nThe job prospects for lawyers have since greatly improved, with more than 80 percent of students who graduated in 2023 and 2024 working in jobs that require their legal credentials within a year, according to the American Bar Association.\n\nBut the flocks of people applying to law school face new risks.\n\nNew limits on student loans that go into effect this year could make financing a degree more expensive. And artificial intelligence threatens to bring major changes to the industry, affecting which jobs are available and how much they pay.\n\n“It’s too early to know how things will change,” said Kellye Testy, the executive director of the Association of American Law Schools, which has more than 170 members.\n\n“Some worry that A.I. will decrease demand for lawyers,” she said, adding that eventually the technology could have a more direct role in legal work. “That could matter in three years,” she said.\n\nIn 1985, going to law school at a private university cost on average about $8,000 a year, according to the Law School Admission Council. Now the average cost is about $60,000 a year at private universities — and a still hefty $32,000 a year at public ones. At some law schools, tuition and annual living expenses exceed $110,000.\n\nFinancing that big bill is about to get more expensive. Stricter limits on student loans, which were passed as part of President Trump’s tax and spending law last year, go into effect in July. They impose a yearly limit of $50,000 for students seeking professional degrees, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.\n\nAlternative financing options like private loans can have higher interest rates and more restrictions than federal direct loans, said Susan Bogart, director of financial aid for Penn State Dickinson Law, where the cost of attendance will be about $90,000, according to its website.\n\nDuring a surge of applications, law schools may also pull back on the discounts they offered to entice promising students when applicants were scarce.\n\nIt can be difficult to estimate how well the investment in a law degree will pay off.\n\nLaw students often anticipate landing high-paying legal jobs in private law firms or corporations, where the entry-level salary can be around $225,000, according to the National Association for Law Placement. But the median starting salary for public service lawyers, for example, is around $65,000 — which can make monthly student loan payments more of a stretch.\n\nIn 2023, Stanford researchers, in collaboration with a legal technology company, announced that ChatGPT had passed the bar exam, scoring in the 90th percentile.\n\nThat claim, which other researchers later challenged, set off a wave of speculation about how A.I. would affect lawyers. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimated that year that the technology could automate 44 percent of legal work.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how new A.I. tools for lawyers, including Thomson Reuters’s CoCounsel and the A.I. legal assistant Harvey, will affect the availability of legal jobs or how much they pay.\n\nThe tools can make routine legal tasks, including document review and case research, faster. (Lawyers who have tried to use A.I. for more than that have sometimes been embarrassed by A.I.-generated briefs that cite made-up court cases.)\n\n“It’s really good at sifting through massive amounts of information and trying to pare that down a little bit,” Michael Kohagen, a lawyer in the mergers-and-acquisitions practice at WyrickRobbins, a law firm in Raleigh, N.C., told the “I Am the Law” podcast.\n\nSo far, more efficient grunt work hasn’t stopped firms from hiring new lawyers: Law students who graduated in 2024 had the highest employment rate ever, according to the National Association for Law Placement. More than 90 percent found jobs.\n\nThings could get dicier: The association also reported that law firms had hired fewer summer associates in 2024 and 2025, which it said suggested “that there will be fewer graduates employed by large firms over the next few years.”\n\nTesty said that it was possible A.I. could shrink job openings, but that it was also possible it could expand what lawyers do. “It could be used to streamline small disputes in court, for example,” she said.\n\nNeither the growing expense nor potential changes to the industry are deterring students like London Cooper, who is a political science major in her final year at Dillard University in New Orleans and plans to pursue a law degree.\n\nCooper has applied to five law schools, after carefully checking into how to afford the cost of the degree.\n\n“I factored so many things in, even looking at projected salaries for starting lawyers,” she said. But A.I. wasn’t part of her calculations. Instead, she’s banking on the more timeless appeal of a legal education.\n\n“I feel like law is one area where you can see how society really runs,” she said.\n\nIt was a different kind of Davos. At the opening ceremony, Larry Fink, an interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, took aim at the institution itself, saying it “can’t remain an echo chamber.” Climate change, once a central topic of discussion of the annual gathering, retreated to the sidelines, and where there was once talk of a shared political and economic future, President Trump instead made a laundry list of threats against other nations. Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada received a standing ovation after describing the end of Pax Americana.\n\nThe future of Greenland remains uncertain. Trump has walked back threats to use military force or tariffs to acquire Greenland and said Wednesday that he had reached a deal with NATO over the autonomous Danish territory. Proposals under discussion are said to include giving the United States a sovereign claim to its bases in Greenland and checking Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic.\n\nTikTok struck a deal for a U.S. entity. Its U.S. operations will be managed by a group of non-Chinese investors — including Oracle, the Emirati investment firm MGX and Silver Lake — which will own 80 percent of the new venture. The announcement ends a legal saga over the app’s future in the United States after a 2024 law required it to be separated from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, but some experts say the deal does not resolve concerns that China could still influence the new entity.\n\nTrump sued JPMorgan Chase over “debanking” claims. The $5 billion lawsuit, which also names Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s C.E.O., as a defendant, contends that the bank stopped doing business with Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nOther big deals: Netflix converted its $83 billion bid for large parts of Warner Bros. Discovery into an all-cash offer. Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of Trump’s effort to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed. And natural gas prices spiked ahead of a powerful winter storm.\n\nOver the next few days, early-action applicants to Virginia Tech will find out whether they’ve been admitted to the school. That’s more than a month sooner than last year — and the university says A.I. is to thank.\n\nVirginia Tech is among the first schools to use A.I. to assess college applications, of which it received 58,000 for the 2026-27 school year.\n\nPreviously, essays were reviewed by two human readers, plus a third if the scores differed significantly. This year, each essay got one initial score from an A.I. tool and one from a human, then a third read from a human as needed. The school made the change after three years of testing.\n\nJuan Espinoza, the vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech, estimates it saved his department more than 8,000 hours of work. DealBook’s Sarah Kessler talked with him about the process. The interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nHow did you make the decision to incorporate A.I. into admissions?\n\nWe were getting our decision back to students much later than other colleges and universities. So we knew we needed to accelerate the review process, but we didn’t want to get rid of the essay.\n\nLouis Hickman, an assistant professor who studies the intersection of technology and work, reached out and said: “Hey, I’ve done a lot of research on artificial intelligence, and I feel like we can help. Would you be willing to partner, just for research purposes?”\n\nAfter a third year of running it in the background, he was able to show with high confidence that the A.I. tool was operating just as strongly as our human readers.\n\nWe agreed that if we’re going to do this, we’re going to tell the world. We’re going to tell our applicants — students. Because I truly believe there’s a level of trust they’re giving us that their applications will be handled with care.\n\nOn the other side, can you tell when students are using A.I. to write their responses to their essays?\n\nWhen you feel like you’ve got something that can detect it, it’s almost immediately out of date. So I actually have very little confidence in anyone who states that they have something that can detect A.I. use. Are we even attempting to do that? No, we’re not.\n\nI tell students: “If you feel you can use A.I. as a brainstorming tool, use it. I do not think it’s in your best interest to use it to write the essays completely — it may not best represent who you are, and that would be a disadvantage in our process.”\n\nSo at some point you might have an A.I.-generated essay being read by your A.I. assessor?\n\nDo you think at any point the ability of A.I. to generate responses to questions will change the application process itself? For example, maybe essays become obsolete?\n\nAbsolutely. We don’t use recommendation letters in our process. But for some schools who continue to utilize them, I’m hearing of counselors using A.I. to write those letters.\n\nOn the surface that might bring some level of concern. But I would argue if the counselor is still able to represent that student well by using that tool, the result is going to be less time writing letters and more time talking to students.\n\nI think some people fear A.I. admissions tools will create a black box that filters you out in a way that you don’t understand and might be a mistake.\n\nThat’s where safeguards are so important. If we were solely using A.I. to evaluate the essays, not having a human read, I think we’d see a very different reception to this change.\n\nOne week each year, the world’s elite descend on Davos, a Swiss mountain town that has a residential population of about 10,000. Businesses there adjust prices accordingly.\n\nSnagging a table for two in the lobby restaurant of the Hilton Garden Inn — which is within the security zone of the World Economic Forum — cost about how much per hour this week, according to The Wall Street Journal?\n\nFind the answer at the bottom of this newsletter.\n\nThanks for reading! We’ll see you Monday.\n\nWe’d like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.",

    "description": "Remote college in 2020 didn't work for Jacob Palmer. “It felt very intangible, is the best way that I have found to say it ... It didn’t work for me. I hated it.”",
    "fullText": "Growing up in Concord, North Carolina, just outside Charlotte, Jacob Palmer was a classic academic achiever. “I was a good student,” he said in an interview with Fortune. “In high school, I participated in all types of extracurriculars, student leadership, I did a lot of public speaking. I had all sorts of friends.” But he said something changed during the pandemic. “School looked drastically different doing online classes and Zoom calls. It felt very intangible.” He said he figured out pretty quickly that online college “didn’t work for me. I hated it.”\n\nPalmer said that instead of sticking with college, he tried things out, including a stint at a FedEx warehouse for several months, and a change of scenery at his grandparents in rural Virginia, where he worked at a factory for a few months.\n\nWhen he returned home, in need of a job, his mom was putting in a hot tub and she mentioned the electrician working on it was “super passionate and loved his job.” Palmer said he sounded him out, estimating that the electrician was about 29 at the time, and Palmer liked that he worked for himself.\n\n“I had a general interest in working with my hands, fixing and making things, as well as a basic understanding of electrical theory from my time in AP Physics class,” he said. Soon afterward, he started as a full-time apprentice at a small, Charlotte-based contracting firm, earning $15 an hour at first and working his way up the ladder.\n\nHe was far from alone. Palmer’s micro-generation abandoned college in droves during the pandemic, driving 42% of an overall 15% decline in undergraduate enrollment between fall 2010 and fall 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Overall, college may have peaked, as experts have predicted a “demographic cliff” ever since 2007, when Americans started having fewer children with the coming of the Great Recession, and birthrates have not recovered since, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Palmer was part of a movement deciding to try something else instead of college.\n\n“I spent a few years just untangling the extension cords and doing the grunt work,” he said, earning hours en route to sitting for an electrical license. But even though he didn’t become a college student, he still found himself studying hard, because he had to pass his licensing exam, in January 2024. Just a month later, at 21, he opened his own business, Palmer Electrical. By the end of that year, according to profit and loss statements reviewed by Fortune, he grossed nearly $90,000. This nearly doubled to $175,000 in 2025 and he said he was “thinking $250,000 is a good goal for 2026, but my main focus is still to continue learning and make new opportunities.”",

    "description": "Trump gave defaulted student-loan borrowers a major break on wage garnishment and tax refund seizure. Still, thousands are waiting for debt relief.",
    "fullText": "If there's one thing student-loan borrowers are familiar with, it's uncertainty — and there's a lot of that right now.\n\nAround the time it was set to take effect in early January, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced that it was pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted student-loan borrowers. This gives borrowers behind on payments more time to find a way back to good standing, but it's unclear how much time they'll have.\n\nAs to when that pause will lift, not even servicers appear to know. An employee at a major student-loan servicer told Business Insider that they received communications about the pause just days before it was announced to the public, and they do not know when garnishment and treasury offsets will resume.\n\nWhile the pause is good news for borrowers and provides them with relief as tax season commences, student-loan forgiveness backlogs continue to weigh on the thousands waiting for their relief to be processed. A recent court filing from the Department of Education said that 734,221 income-driven repayment applications were pending as of December 31, 2025, and that 3,400 discharges were approved in December.\n\nThe department wrote in its filing that litigation over the SAVE income-driven repayment plan is preventing it from processing some borrowers' debt relief applications. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments and a short timeline to debt relief, has been blocked since July 2024, and the department's filing said that it is focusing on processing income-based repayment discharges for borrowers who became eligible for relief before April 2025, the month that the block on SAVE was expanded in court.\n\nDuring this time, the department said that it is \"evaluating the most effective way to resume discharges for the borrowers who would have become eligible under the SAVE Plan Final Rule criteria after the date of the injunction. Currently, the only cancellations taking place are for IBR borrowers who became eligible before April 2025.\"\n\nThe pause on consequences for defaulted borrowers provides some relief, while the pause on forgiveness processing prolongs uncertainty — and, with more repayment changes on the horizon, student-loan borrowers have described feeling stuck in limbo, unable to financially plan. Some policy experts and lawmakers have also said that while the pause for defaulted borrowers is needed relief, the uncertainty could put borrowers at risk.\n\nThe department said in a press release last week that the delay in collections is intended to give borrowers \"additional time to evaluate these new repayment options once they consolidate their loans or complete a repayment or rehabilitation agreement.\"\n\nWith all of the back-and-forth policy changes, it's difficult to keep track of what is, and isn't, happening for student-loan borrowers.\n\nThe main change that defaulted borrowers need to know is that their wages and other federal benefits should not be seized until the Department of Education announces that the pause is lifted.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options, which will support a stronger financial future for borrowers and enhance the long-term health of the federal student loan portfolio,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement last week.\n\nMeanwhile, borrowers should prepare for looming repayment changes, which were signed into law in Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nBeginning in July, the department will begin rolling out new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees. Additionally, over 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE could be kicked off the plan sooner than anticipated; the department announced a proposed settlement that, if approved, would give SAVE borrowers a limited time to enroll in a new plan and face higher payments.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, previously told Business Insider.",

The officers then told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,\" she said.\n\nStenvik said the family has an active asylum case and has not been ordered to leave the country.\n\n“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. \"You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child.”\n\nShe said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the U.S. illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child,” she said.\n\n“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.\n\nStenvik said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents wouldn't leave Liam with that person. DHS didn't immediately respond to an email Thursday asking if Conejo Arias had asked to keep his son with him.\n\nLiam and his father were being held in a family holding cell in Texas, Marc Prokosch, the family’s lawyer, said during the news conference.\n\n“Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they’ve been asked to do,” Prokosch said of the family's asylum claim. “So this is just cruelty.”\n\nMinnesota has become a major focus of immigration sweeps by DHS-led agencies. Greg Bovino, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns in Minneapolis and other cities, said 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” have been arrested in Minnesota in the last six weeks.\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nLiam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.\n\nThe district is made up of five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. The majority of the students come from immigrant families, according to Stenvik.\n\nShe said they've noticed their attendance drop over the past two weeks, including one day where they had about one-third of their students out from school.\n\nElla Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”\n\n“His classmates miss him,” she said. \"And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”\n\nThis story was updated to correct Greg Bovino's title to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection offical, not Patrol.",

    "title": "Student-loan forgiveness for public servants is at risk under Trump's plan to ax cheaper monthly payments, Democratic lawmakers say",
    "description": "Trump agreed to a settlement that would end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Lawmakers raised concerns about pushing borrowers off too soon.",
    "fullText": "Millions of student-loan borrowers could soon be forced off a key repayment plan — and debt relief is on the line.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Tim Kaine, led their colleagues in raising concerns regarding the Department of Education's proposed settlement to end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nOver 7 million borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, which was created by former President Joe Biden and intended to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness. Litigation halted the plan in 2024, and President Donald Trump's administration recently announced a proposed settlement that would effectively eliminate the plan and require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan with higher payments.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for eliminating SAVE by 2028, and this settlement would accelerate that timeline. The lawmakers wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that borrowers are likely to face \"significant hurdles\" switching to a new plan, and those enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program — which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years — are at heightened risk.\n\n\"Forcing these borrowers to transition out of SAVE with little guidance risks further lost time to debt relief and payment increases that could render continued public service untenable,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nBorrowers have not received credit toward PSLF while on the SAVE forbearance. While resuming payments on a different income-driven repayment plan would count toward PSLF, the lawmakers wrote that transitioning millions of borrowers to a new plan in a short timeframe would be a significant administrative burden, and they requested that the Department of Education give borrowers at least six months to switch to a new plan before their next payment comes due.\n\nThe department wrote in its press release that SAVE borrowers \"will have a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement at the time that \"American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.\"\n\nA slew of changes is on the horizon for student-loan borrowers. While borrowers are still waiting for a court to approve the SAVE settlement, provisions of Trump's spending legislation — including new repayment plans and borrowing caps — are set to be rolled out beginning in July.\n\nThose changes come as over 5 million borrowers are in default on their student loans, following the Trump administration's resumption of collections in May 2025 after a five-year pause. The Education Department announced last week that it is temporarily pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers. Still, Democratic lawmakers said in their letter that SAVE borrowers are at risk of defaulting should they face challenges transitioning to a new plan.\n\n\"It is imperative the Department take every action possible to ensure the 7 million borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE are provided with the information and resources necessary to avoid delinquency or default in order to avoid an even bigger default crisis,\" they wrote.",

    "fullText": "The U.S. Department of Education has announced that it will delay wage garnishment for defaulted student loans.\n\nThe move, revealed Friday, reverses the department’s earlier plan to gradually restart wage garnishment for groups of borrowers, and will allow the agency more time to finalize new repayment plans.\n\nGarnishing wages could have affect millions who are 270 days or more past due, and have major ramifications for Black borrowers. Due to ongoing racial inequality, Black students aren’t only more likely to rely on loans to make college affordable. They’re also more likely to struggle to pay back their loans once they enter the workforce.\n\nThe shift reverses course on earlier plans to restart wage garnishments this month after a pandemic-era pause. In December, the agency’s announcement that it would begin seizing the pay of defaulted borrowers was the latest shock to the education landscape.\n\nLast November, the Trump administration said that it was relocating certain responsibilities and programs — including those that support low-income districts and historically Black colleges and universities — out of the Education Department to “break up the federal education bureaucracy.”\n\nAnd last July, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the mass firings at the agency to continue, though the issue is still being litigated in the lower courts. Black workers are overrepresented among federal workers and, as a result, have been disproportionately affected by the cuts.\n\nThe agency didn’t set a new date for involuntary collections. It said that the delay will give borrowers time to evaluate new repayment plans that are scheduled to be available starting July 1.\n\nHere’s what you need to know if your student loans are in default.\n\nThe department must send borrowers a 30-day notice before it can begin garnishing their paychecks. These notices cover how borrowers can address their defaulted loans and seek a hearing to dispute the decision to seize pay.\n\nThe government can garnish as much as 15% of a borrower’s disposable wages.\n\nBorrowers who aren’t in default but might be delinquent can avoid defaulting on their loans by participating in a repayment option.\n\nThere are several income-driven repayment plans available, including Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). Deferment or forbearance may also be possible in some circumstances.\n\nStanley Tate, an attorney specializing in student loan law, told Capital B that a common theme he has observed is that many borrowers default not because no options exist — but because they’re unaware of which plans they qualify for and how they might enroll in them.\n\nAt the moment, there’s no legislation that would broadly stop or suspend federal student loan wage garnishment, according to Tate.\n\nGarnishment occurs if a defaulted borrower does nothing. Employers will withhold up to 15% of a borrower’s paycheck. That money is sent to the government. Borrowers are legally required to retain at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage per week, or $217.50.\n\nBorrowers must be notified 30 days before garnishment begins. Additionally, they have the right to request a hearing and to pursue options such as consolidation or rehabilitation to resolve the default, Tate said.\n\n“From a practical standpoint,” he added, “the key right is the ability to stop garnishment by exiting default before wage withholding starts.”\n\nEspecially for lower-income borrowers, a 15% wage garnishment is significant. It could have a large impact on their ability to pay for rent, transportation, child care, health care, and other needs, Tate said.\n\nHe noted that what makes this period particularly difficult is that many of these same borrowers could qualify for income-driven repayment plans that require a much smaller payment — sometimes well below what would be taken through garnishment.\n\n“In that sense,” Tate said, “garnishment often reflects a breakdown in communication and access rather than a lack of repayment options.”\n\nThe post Student Loan Wage Garnishment Is Put on Hold.

    "description": "Eryn Bostwick said that her high student-loan payments have prevented her from moving forward with IVF treatment.",
    "fullText": "College was always the goal for Eryn Bostwick.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Bostwick, 37, said her parents wanted to ensure she had the opportunities they didn't have, and they believed that earning a college degree would provide her with financial stability.\n\nBostwick's parents weren't wrong — data show that a four-year college degree leads to higher earnings than a high school diploma. However, to accomplish that goal, Bostwick had to take out student loans and Pell grants. She said she wasn't fully aware of the long-term ramifications of the debt.\n\nShe now has just over $55,000 in student loan debt, which she accrued while pursuing a bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. at public universities with the goal of becoming a college professor. As a result, she's put off major life decisions, like adding to her family.\n\n\"I've always been very careful about when I would feel comfortable bringing a child into this world,\" Bostwick told Business Insider.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, or IVF, was the only way Bostwick could have a child due to existing medical conditions. While Bostwick and her husband were able to afford the initial rounds of treatments, Bostwick left her full-time job in Texas to move back to Ohio to be closer to family, and she was unable to find a job that paid enough to cover IVF, student-loan payments, and her other expenses.\n\nShe now works as a part-time teacher at two different colleges, with an income in the low five figures.\n\n\"Could we go through IVF? Sure, but then we wouldn't be able to afford actually having a child,\" Bostwick said. \"It just felt like there's too much hanging over our heads.\"\n\nMany student-loan borrowers have told Business Insider that they've had to put off major life decisions, like having children, retiring, or purchasing a home, due to their high debt loads. The year ahead could bring even more financial strain to borrowers — President Donald Trump's Education Department will begin implementing a repayment overhaul in July, which includes new repayment plans with higher monthly payments.\n\nThe uncertainty of what's to come in the student-loan industry has borrowers like Bostwick wary of making major life decisions that could become significant financial burdens.\n\n\"It feels like any power was taken from me, all because of a decision I made when I was 18 years old that I didn't completely comprehend, that my parents didn't completely comprehend, that I felt was necessary in order to create this better life for myself,\" Bostwick said. \"And now it's really just become a noose around my neck.\"\n\nBostwick said she has 71 qualifying payments toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years, or 120 qualifying payments.\n\nHowever, she is also enrolled in the SAVE plan, created by former President Joe Biden and intended to provide borrowers with cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to debt relief. Borrowers on the plan have been in forbearance since July 2024 due to litigation, meaning that PSLF borrowers have not been receiving credit toward forgiveness during that period.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's administration announced a proposed settlement to eliminate the plan. If a court approves the settlement, SAVE borrowers would have a limited time to enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan with higher payments.\n\n\"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement alongside the announcement of the proposed settlement.\n\nIt's not that simple, Bostwick said. Many of the students she teaches are first-generation, like herself, and they pursued higher education because they were told it's the best way to achieve upward mobility and financial stability. Given her experience with student debt, Bostwick said she \"makes it her mission\" to ensure her students are aware of the implications of taking out loans, and that a degree isn't always necessary to pursue certain career paths.\n\n\"I've never once heard somebody say they don't want to be able to take out loans and never pay them back,\" Bostwick said. \"They want to be able to pay their loans back, but the current system makes it nearly impossible.\"\n\nTrump's Department of Education said it's working to improve the system. It just concluded negotiations on proposals aimed at preventing borrowers from taking out unaffordable debt, and it has previously said that its changes to repayment are aimed at reducing complexity in the student-loan industry.\n\nBostwick said she isn't getting her hopes up.\n\n\"I just feel like I've constantly been trying to keep my head above the water, and it's never really been good enough,\" she said. \"It's unbelievably frustrating.\"\n\nHave a story to share?

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Robina Aminian's family believes the college student was killed by a bullet fired by Iranian security forces straight into the back of her head.\n\nBut her death in the nationwide protests that challenged the Islamic Republic's theocracy was only the start of the family's agony. In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body. Then the family raced to escape authorities who might demand payment to release the body and buried her hastily in an unmarked roadside pit.\n\nTheir odyssey reflects the trail of anguish left by Iran's deadly assault on protesters, which has led to desperate relatives searching overflowing morgues across the country. For families, the loss of loved ones is compounded by the difficulty they face in grieving and giving the dead a dignified sendoff.\n\nMore than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.\n\n“She wanted a bright future for herself,” her uncle, Nezar Minoei, said from Oslo. “But unfortunately, the future has been stolen from her.”\n\nDetails about what happened to Aminian are scant. After her death, her mother called relatives outside the country, recounting what she learned from Aminian's friends, who were present when she was killed.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to three relatives, who all described similar details from the mother's account. An Oslo-based human rights organization, Iran Human Rights, released a report about her killing, citing witness testimony. They verified there was a shooting on the night of Jan. 8 around the campus of the Shariati Technical and Vocational College for Girls.\n\nWith communications greatly limited in Iran, the AP has been unable to independently confirm the family’s account or the wounds to Aminian’s body or to verify its location. The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York has declined to comment.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of activists on the ground and has been accurate during previous unrest in Iran, said at least 3,090 people have been killed. Iran's government has not offered any overall casualties figures.\n\nEverything that Aminian's relatives abroad know about her death comes from a brief phone call her mother was able to make Jan. 10 to relatives in Oslo.\n\nThey say the mother, Amina Norei, got a call Jan. 8 from Aminian’s friends, who said she had been gunned down by security forces. The friends told Norei they were walking away from campus in Tehran after dark when they saw a protest and joined in.\n\nA bullet fired by security forces struck the back of Aminian’s head, her friends told the mother.\n\nVideos shared on social media, verified by the AP, and statements by rights groups, doctors and survivors, describe Iranian agents using rifles and shotguns to disperse protesters across the country.\n\nIran's theocracy, which has used violence in previous rounds of unrest, increasingly refers to demonstrators as “terrorists.\" Authorities allege some demonstrators were armed, but there are no allegations that anyone was armed in Aminian's vicinity at the time of her death.\n\nAminian’s relatives said she was not an activist or involved in politics.\n\nAminian's mother was in Kermanshah, a western city in the Kurdish region of Iran nearly 460 kilometers (230 miles) from Tehran, when she learned about her daughter's death.\n\nShe rushed to Tehran in the middle of the night, she told family. Norei recalled to them how she began unzipping body bag after body bag, looking for Aminian.\n\n“She looked through so many beautiful faces, trying to find her girl,\" Hali Norei, Amnian's aunt, said from Oslo. ”And what is so horrifying for me is imagining what my sister feels as she searches for her daughter.\"\n\nMany other Iranian families are searching overflowing morgues for loved ones, according to rights group Amnesty International. Bodies have piled up in trucks, freight containers and warehouses, the group said.\n\nWhen Norei found her daughter, she was joined by her husband, daughter and son, and the family rushed out with the body, fearing authorities would block their way and insist on a payment to release the corpse, according to Minoei, Aminian’s uncle.\n\n“She actually stole the body,” Minoei said.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the New York City-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it has received multiple accounts of intelligence forces demanding money from families in exchange for the return of protesters' bodies. The group called the levies “a well-known, standard practice” in Iran to scare families into not publicly mourning their dead.\n\nOther families reported to the center that they were forced to sign papers falsely declaring that their dead relatives were members of the security forces in order to retrieve the bodies.\n\nIranian state television recently aired a statement saying mortuary and burial services were free, after repeated allegations of the practice.\n\nMinoei said the mother told him that she and her oldest daughter spent the seven-hour ride back to Kermanshah clutching the body in the backseat, blood and tears staining their clothes. When they got home, the mother told him, security forces had surrounded their house.\n\nAmina Norei told her family they had only one option: They drove out of town and dug a pit on the side of the road. They placed the body inside and drove away. Aminian is still believed to be buried there, in an unmarked grave.\n\nRelatives said they have not heard from Amina Norei or other relatives in Iran since Sunday.\n\nJulia Frankel reported from Jerusalem.",

    "description": "The Education Department just gave defaulted student-loan borrowers more time to figure out payment plans and ensure their tax refunds aren't seized.",
    "fullText": "If you're behind on your student-loan payments, you now have more time to figure out a payment plan before filing your taxes.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on January 16 that it's temporarily pausing wage garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program, which seizes federal tax refunds, to give defaulted borrowers more time to repay their loans.\n\nPrior to this pause, defaulted borrowers were subject to both wage garnishment and the seizure of their tax refunds. Advocacy group Protect Borrowers and the National Consumer Law Center issued a warning to student-loan borrowers before the department's announcement, urging them to check whether they're in default before filing their taxes to prevent their refunds from being seized.\n\nIn May 2025, President Donald Trump's Department of Education resumed collections on defaulted student loans after a five-year pause, meaning that borrowers in default — which typically happens when a federal borrower does not make payments for more than 270 days — were once again subject to the consequences of defaulting, including wage garnishment and seizure of tax refunds.\n\nWithout the pause in place, the government could begin seizing a defaulted borrower's tax refunds after they file, leaving them without sufficient time to make a plan to return their loans to good standing.\n\n\"Once you've already filed your taxes, that process is underway. It is going to be nearly impossible to get your loans out of default before your refund would go out,\" Abby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, told Business Insider of what would happen were the pause to lift. \"And then it's very, very unusual to be able to get that refund back after it's already been seized. So the real moment of opportunity for borrowers is before they file their taxes.\"\n\nThe two groups suggested that borrowers call the Treasury Department's Treasury Offset Program Call Center at 1-800-304-3107 to see if they're on the Treasury's default list for having some or all of their tax refunds seized.\n\nOver 5 million student-loan borrowers are in default, and Shafroth said that while the government is required to send a notice to borrowers informing them of their default status and that they're subject to garnishment and benefits seizures, those notices generally just go out once via physical mail, and they can be easy to miss or forget about.\n\nIf a borrower is in default and is on the list to have their refunds seized, they can request an extension to file their taxes, giving themselves more time to figure out their options. Those options include loan rehabilitation, which requires a borrower to contact their servicer and sign an agreement to make 9 payments within 20 days of each due date over 10 consecutive months. While the process is time-consuming, it has the benefit of eventually removing the default status from a borrower's credit report.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation, which is quicker than rehabilitation but does not remove the default status from a borrower's credit history. A borrower can apply to consolidate their defaulted student loans into a federal direct loan, which they can then continue paying under an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nShafroth added that a borrower might be eligible to have their defaulted loan canceled if they qualify for specific cancellation programs, such as those for borrowers who attended schools that closed before they completed their programs.\n\n\"A lot of working people depend on their tax refund to make ends meet, to get caught up on rent, to pay for necessary car repairs or expenses,\" Shafroth said. \"So that tax refund isn't a bonus for most people. It's really built into their annual budget, and it's important to protect.\"",

    "description": "With Trump's proposed cap on credit card interest rates and new caps on student loans, more Americans might turn to alternative lenders.",
    "fullText": "More Americans might find themselves turning to personal and private loans this year.\n\nProposed changes to the lending market could impact banks and consumers starting this year, particularly in two of the largest areas of consumer debt: credit cards and student loans. Private and personal lending firms could end up big winners if those changes stick.\n\nOn the student debt side, President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new borrowing caps on graduate and professional loans in an attempt to curb excessive borrowing. It also eliminated the Grad and Parent PLUS programs, which allowed parents and graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nMore recently, Trump proposed a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, which he said would prevent credit card companies from \"ripping off\" consumers.\n\nThe changes to student loan borrowing are set to take effect in July, while it's unclear if Trump's credit card proposal will come to fruition, as its most likely path would be through congressional legislation.\n\nSome policy experts and lenders have said that the caps on rates could mean banks reduce credit card offerings, and caps on student loan borrowing could drive consumers to private loans to help fill the gap.\n\nAs the cost of living continues to rise in the US, personal loans, credit card debt, and student debt are already at record highs. While the benefit of a personal loan is that its flexible terms allow it to be used for a wide range of purposes, interest rates vary depending on credit scores, similar to credit cards.\n\nSimilarly, taking on private student loans could also be riskier than federal financing because their interest rates are often variable, meaning the rate could increase or decrease over the loan's lifetime.\n\nA joint statement from several banking associations said that the cap on credit card interest \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans.\n\nOn Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase's CFO said that if the interest cap were to take effect, it may not be worth it for the bank to be in the credit card business. Similarly, student borrowers without sufficient financing for their programs may turn to private lending.\n\nPersonal lending company SoFi is an example of a company that could benefit from both policies. CEO Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X that, should Trump's credit card cap proposal be implemented, consumers would need access to more credit.\n\n\"That creates a large void—one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto said.\n\nNoto also said during an August earnings call that the elimination of Grad and Parent PLUS loans could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\" Private lender Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed a similar idea during an earnings call: \"Grad PLUS elimination is a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\"\n\nA SoFi spokesperson told Business Insider that the company prioritizes affordability, \"and providing members with a more accessible and safer path to financial independence.\"\n\nAn analysis by credit reporting firm TransUnion found that unsecured personal loan balances reached record highs in the third quarter of 2025, totaling $269 billion.\n\nThe accumulation of debt is a concern shared by some policy experts and lawmakers, particularly regarding student loans. In August, Sen. Elizabeth Warren led some of her colleagues in sending letters to the major private student-loan lenders asking for information on how they plan to protect borrowers in anticipation of an influx into the private lending market.\n\n\"Student debt places a tremendous burden on borrowers, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy, driving employment, spending, and housing decisions that have long-lasting negative impacts on borrowers' financial health,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Placing a greater share of student loans into the hands of private lenders threatens to make these problems much worse.\"",

    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "description": "Since December 5, over 400 student-loan borrowers have shared their stories while gearing up for Trump's major repayment overhaul this year.",
    "fullText": "\"I got student-loan forgiveness!\"\n\n\"I'm working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\"\n\nIn one month, over 400 student-loan borrowers shared their experiences of repayment and relief with me in a brief survey.\n\nEach story was unique and touched on a range of themes, which will feed more in-depth stories on respondents' experiences throughout the year.\n\nAs 2026 shapes up to be a year of turmoil for student-loan borrowers due to President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul, I wanted to start by looking broadly at the main concerns on the minds of those who reached out.\n\nSome borrowers told me that they achieved student-loan forgiveness or repaid their loans in full. However, the majority of respondents reported a range of concerns about the future of their balances, including worries about losing a key affordable repayment plan, struggling to get help from their servicers, being in default on their loans, and more.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation includes the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two less generous options. It also eliminates the SAVE plan, which promised affordable monthly payments with a shorter timeline to debt relief. Nearly half of the survey's respondents said they're enrolled in SAVE.\n\nIf you're interested in sharing your student-loan story and having it highlighted in future coverage, fill out the survey here, and I'll be in touch. Here are some of the main themes that student-loan borrowers have shared so far.\n\nOn December 9, the Department of Education announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan, established by former President Joe Biden. A court has not yet approved the settlement. However, upon approval, the department would not enroll any new borrowers in SAVE, deny pending applications, and move all enrolled borrowers to existing repayment plans.\n\nWhile the department intended to eliminate SAVE by 2028, the settlement accelerates the timeline and would push the 7 million enrolled borrowers into new repayment plans with higher payments sooner than anticipated. Some borrowers in the survey described SAVE as a lifeline for them, and they expressed concerns about their ability to afford higher monthly payments on a new plan.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, told me.\n\nSome survey respondents said that they had their balances wiped out through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nOver 60 respondents said that they're pursuing PSLF, and while they're at different stages, the majority said that they're concerned about the future of the program. Trump's Department of Education finalized a rule to limit eligibility for PSLF following a March executive order that directed the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nThe new rule, set to go into effect in July, would exclude employers from PSLF who the department determines to have engaged in \"illegal activities\" that do not align with the administration's views.\n\nRespondents who are pursuing PSLF described feeling like a \"pawn\" and being \"held hostage\" due to the program's uncertainty.\n\nThe consequences of default are also weighing on some borrowers' minds. Beginning January 7, the Department of Education said it would start notifying about 1,000 borrowers in default that their wages will be garnished. It follows the resumption of collections on defaulted student loans in May 2025 after a five-year pause.\n\nOver 5 million borrowers are in default, which typically occurs after a federal borrower hasn't made payments in more than 270 days. Some borrowers in default said they're expecting wage garnishment notices, while those who are not yet in default but are concerned about affording payments said they're worried garnishments are in their future.\n\nBorrowers in default described feeling \"depressed\" and \"anxious\" due to their repayment statuses.\n\nParent PLUS loans allow parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their kids' education. It's also facing changes in Trump's spending legislation: the department is planning to impose a $65,000 lifetime borrowing limit per dependent student, which would limit parents' ability to help finance their kids' college experiences.\n\nSome Parent PLUS borrowers said they've been struggling with repayment long before Trump's proposed changes. For example, some are struggling to pay back the loans years after their kids graduated while balancing their own debt and expenses.\n\nParent borrowers described paying more than what they borrowed, with some saying taking out the loans was a \"mistake.\"\n\nIn addition to facing the changing federal student-loan landscape, some survey respondents reported balancing both federal and private student loans. Private student loans often have higher interest rates, and they're not eligible for federal relief programs, such as PSLF.\n\nHowever, some borrowers turn to the private lending market for additional financing, and the Department of Education's new proposed caps on borrowing could lead more borrowers to turn to private student loans to help pay for programs that federal aid would no longer cover.",

    "description": "Trump's Education Department concluded another round of negotiations focused on gainful employment, aimed at protecting student-loan borrowers.",
    "fullText": "How do you make sure you can afford the student debt you're taking on?\n\nIt's a complicated question that President Donald Trump's Education Department spent a week hashing out. On Friday, the department concluded negotiations and reached consensus on its proposal to strengthen accountability in student-loan borrowing, including revising the gainful employment rule.\n\n\"This is a game changer,\" Nicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, said in his closing remarks. \"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results.\"\n\nSome of these changes are part of Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The Department of Education has already completed negotiations on some of the student-loan provisions in the bill, including the creation of new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, which will begin taking effect in July.\n\nThe revisions debated this week include eliminating the debt-to-earnings ratio test, which ensured a borrower's student-loan payments are no more than 8% of their annual earnings. It said this would reduce complexity. Some education policy experts worry it would weaken protections for students.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that it \"makes a lot of sense\" for the Department of Education to streamline the metrics, but the proposal risks leaving students with debt they're unable to repay with the elimination of the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nGainful employment, first established by former President Barack Obama in 2014, cut off federal student aid for schools that offered programs that left students with unaffordable debt compared to their likely postgrad income. Trump repealed the rule during his first term in 2019, and former President Joe Biden reinstated it. The existing version went into effect in July 2024.\n\nBiden's version of the rule used two separate metrics to determine whether a program met gainful employment requirements: a debt-to-earnings test and an earnings premium test, which measured whether a typical graduate from the program is earning at least as much as they typical high school graduate in their state.\n\nIn addition to eliminating the debt-to-earnings test, the Department of Education's proposal would allow programs to continue receiving Pell Grant funding even if they fail the earnings premium test. However, if at least half of Title IV funds, which include Pell Grant funds, are going toward programs that fail the earnings premium test, the department would strip all funding from the failing program.\n\nWhile removing Pell eligibility for some failing programs is better than nothing, the two changes could weaken protections for students, Fast said.\n\n\"We're worried that low-income students will exhaust their limited Pell Grant eligibility on programs that don't provide a return on their investment,\" Fast said.\n\nResearch that Fast coauthored, for example, found that in 2022, about 169,000 students received Title IV aid to enroll in programs that would pass the earnings premium test but fail the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nThe department's negotiator said that the gainful employment changes will not be ready by the start of the 2026 academic year, so the new requirements are set to go into effect in the fall of 2027.\n\nLawmakers have previously pushed for a strengthened gainful employment rule. A group of Democratic lawmakers in 2023 called on the Biden administration to put forth a rule that protects students who enroll in \"postsecondary programs that saddle students with unaffordable debt and provide low financial returns.\"",

    "description": "During this hearing, under the new state law, prosecutors were able to request that Aundre Matthews be held without bond.",
    "fullText": "An 18-year-old student charged with murder in the stabbing death of a classmate was denied bond on Wednesday.\n\nAundre Matthews is accused of killing Andrew Meismer after a fight between the two escalated during a science class at Sterling High School in Baytown, according to court records. Investigators say the dispute began over a $21 vape pen Matthews said was missing and believed that Meismer took.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Cory Scott, an investigator with the Goose Creek Police Department, testified to seeing \"quite a bit\" of blood in the classroom, on the floor, and splattered on the wall on the day of the incident.\n\nWednesday's hearing was also one of the first under the new state law in which a prosecutor can request a defendant be held with no bond in non-capital offenses.\n\n\"It's brand new. This is the constitutional amendment that, as we've talked about, gives prosecutors and the judiciary another tool in the toolbox to ensure that people (who) shouldn't be out get to stay in,\" Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare said following Matthews' hearing.\n\nDuring the hearing, Matthews showed no visible emotion as prosecutors and defense attorneys argued whether he should be eligible for bond. Meismer's family was present in the courtroom.\n\nDetective Scott also presented surveillance video from inside the school. While the video was not released publicly, prosecutors described footage showing Matthews and Meismer entering an empty science lab together. Minutes later, a teacher's aide was seen pushing Matthews out of the room.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that Matthews stabbed Meismer inside the lab and argued that Matthews poses an ongoing threat to the community.\n\n\"It took over a minute to pry this defendant from this victim,\" a prosecutor said in court, adding that Matthews allegedly held Meismer in a chokehold as blood poured from his wounds.\n\nThe state also introduced Matthews' school disciplinary records, which prosecutors said showed an escalating pattern of behavior, including a prior incident in which he allegedly brought a knife to school.\n\nJudge Emily Detoto cited those school records as a key factor in her decision to deny bond.\n\n\"The school records are voluminous,\" DA Teare said, \"and they indicate an escalating pattern of behavior.\"\n\nMatthews' defense attorney, Gian Paolo Mecerola, said he was not surprised by the ruling but argued that responsibility also lies with the school district. He noted that Matthews was part of a special education program and said the district was aware of behavioral concerns but allowed him to continue attending school.\n\n\"There are clearly issues here,\" Mecerola said, adding that Matthews is being raised by his sister, who is his legal guardian. He said he is continuing to investigate those circumstances.\n\nDistrict Attorney Teare emphasized that the hearing was not a determination of guilt or innocence. Instead, he said, it was narrowly focused on whether Matthews should remain in custody while the case moves forward. The case has not yet been presented to a grand jury, and no trial date has been set.\n\n\"This is whole new for everyone,\" Teare said of the bond denial process. \"We don't have a full-time frame yet.\"\n\nAndrew Meissmer's family attended the hearing but declined to comment afterward.\n\nThe case remains in its early stages, and Matthews will continue to be held without bond as the legal process continues.\n\nHigh school student dies after being stabbed by a classmate in Baytown, Goose Creek CISD says\n\nHarris County DA's office accepts murder charge for teen accused in classmate's stabbing: Officials\n\n$3 million bond for student accused of stabbing friend in school, as school district stays quiet\n\nFor news updates, follow Miya Shay on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "description": "Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990, is seeking to overturn her conviction over what her lawyers claim were several constitutional violations.  The petition for habeas corpus relief was filed Monday in New York, where she is being held at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, and, in New Hampshire, where the murder happened.  “This petition challenges whether a fair adversarial process took place.”",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990, is seeking to overturn her conviction over what her lawyers claim were several constitutional violations.\n\nThe petition for habeas corpus relief was filed Monday in New York, where she is being held at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, and, in New Hampshire, where the murder happened.\n\n“Ms. Smart’s trial unfolded in an environment that no court had previously confronted — wall-to-wall media coverage that blurred the line between allegation and evidence,” Jason Ott, who is part of Smart’s legal team, said in a statement. “This petition challenges whether a fair adversarial process took place.”\n\nThe move comes about seven months after New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte rejected a request for a sentence reduction hearing. Ayotte said she reviewed the case and decided it was not deserving of a hearing.\n\nA spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said it would have no comment about the petition.\n\nA spokeman for New Hampshire’s attorney general said it would not comment on pending litigation “other than to note that the State maintains Ms. Smart received a fair trial and that her convictions were lawfully obtained and upheld on appeal.”\n\nIn their petition, lawyers for the 57-year-old Smart argue that prosecutors misled the jury by providing them with inaccurate transcripts of surreptitiously recorded conversations of Ms. Smart that included words that were not audible on the recordings. Among the words they claim weren't audible but in the transcript were the word killed in the sentence “you had your husband killed,\" the word busted in the sentence “I'm gonna be busted\" and the word murder in the sentence “this would have been the perfect murder.”\n\n“Modern science confirms what common sense has always told us: when people are handed a script, they inevitably hear the words they are shown,” Smart’s attorney, Matthew Zernhelt, said in a statement. “Jurors were not evaluating the recordings independently — they were being directed toward a conclusion, and that direction decided the verdict.”\n\nLawyers also argued the conviction should be overturned because the verdict was tainted by the media attention and due to faulty instructions to the jury. They argued jurors were told they must find that Smart acted with premeditation, not told they must consider only evidence presented at trial.\n\nThey also argued the trial court gave her a mandatory life sentence without parole for being an accomplice to first-degree murder, despite New Hampshire not mandating that sentence for the charge.\n\nSmart was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Although Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIt took until 2024 for Smart to take full responsibility for her husband’s death. In a video released in June, she said she spent years deflecting blame “almost as if it was a coping mechanism.”\n\nSmart’s trial was a media circus and one of America’s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school employee and a student. The student, William Flynn, testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced and that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors and all have since been released.\n\nFlynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts’ Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man’s throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to 28 years to life. They were granted parole in 2015. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released.\n\nThe case inspired Joyce Maynard’s 1992 book “To Die For” and the 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.",

    "description": "The Trump administration has executed a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech by targeting student protestors, lawyers and the press.",
    "fullText": "Syril, 25, carries a large banner of the US constitution with a number of other demonstrators during a protest marking US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, in Washington, DC, US, 30 April 2025. REUTERS/Allison Bailey\n\nThe Trump administration has executed a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech by targeting student protestors, lawyers and the press. Global Insight assesses the threat to the rule of law and what is being done to protect it.\n\nOn 8 March, recent Colombia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was returning home from dinner with his eight-month pregnant wife when he was arrested and forced into an unmarked car by four agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Khalil, a legal resident in the US, had been a leader of the pro-Palestine protests on Colombia’s campus last spring. He is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana awaiting deportation and has not been charged with a crime.\n\n‘They are targeting the most vulnerable people who are standing up for Palestinian rights,’ says Justin Mazzola, Deputy Director of Research at Amnesty International USA, which is working closely with the lawyers on Khalil’s case. ‘The idea is to basically get people to stop protesting what’s happening in Gaza.’\n\nIn the short time that US president Donald Trump has held power, his administration has weaponised the federal government to suppress speech and punish his adversaries. In what many experts have challenged as a violation of First Amendment rights, a cornerstone of US democracy, President Trump has threatened protestors, banned news outlets from covering White House events and used executive orders to sanction law firms who he believes attacked him unfairly in the past. Subsequent court cases will test America’s most fundamental checks and balances on executive power.\n\nJonathan Hafetz\n\n Membership Officer, IBA Human Rights Law Committee\n\n‘We are seeing the gravest assault on freedom of speech at least since the McCarthy era, and I think in many respects the nation’s history,’ says Jonathan Hafetz, a professor of law at Seton Hall Law School and Membership Officer of the IBA Human Rights Law Committee.\n\nThe high-profile arrest of Khalil is part of a series of actions taken by the Trump administration against foreign students who have expressed support for Palestinians. Students and faculty members at US universities across the country have been detained by federal agents and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that his department has revoked at least 300 foreign students’ visas. Following arrests, government lawyers have cited a provision of a rarely used 1952 immigration law that allows the Secretary of State to revoke visas or permanent residency from anyone judged to be undermining US foreign policy. Jameel Jaffer, the inaugural director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, an independent organisation founded by Colombia University, believes that the arrests and detentions of foreign students are ‘impossible to reconcile’ with the First Amendment, and predicts that the courts will eventually make clear that it protects non-citizens from deportation. ‘At the most basic level if the First Amendment means anything it means that the government can’t arrest you or imprison you for political speech,’ he says. ‘That is the core protection of the First Amendment.’\n\nIn March, the national American Association of University Professors (AAUP), AAUP chapters at Havard, NYU and Rutgers, and the Middle East Studies Association, represented by the Knight Institute, filed a lawsuit in Boston seeking to block the arrests, detentions and deportations of international students and staff ‘who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and other protected First Amendment activities.’\n\nJaffer adds, however, that the question of whether the Trump administration will comply with any court rulings remains. ‘Both the court’s willingness to enforce their orders and the Trump administration’s decisions about how to respond to the court orders will be influenced by perceptions of public opinion,’ he says.\n\nAlongside visa revocations in recent months the US government commenced a widespread termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records from a national database. A visa revocation, while significant, only impacts a person’s ability to return to the country, whereas eliminating a student’s SEVIS status puts them at risk of deportation. The government has since reversed the policy and reactivated most records following hundreds of lawsuits filed by students who said their records had been terminated based on charges that had been dismissed or minor offences that would not warrant a cancellation. NAFSA, an educational non-profit, found that some SEVIS record terminations referenced ‘potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.’\n\nAdam Cohen, an immigration lawyer and partner at Siskind Susser in Tennessee, is concerned by the lack of due process and transparency related to the SEVIS terminations, which he says could resume at any time. ‘The problem is when they’re terminating the SEVIS record, they’re making people believe that they need to leave immediately and they’re not even getting to that hearing in an immigration court,’ he says. ‘It’s not even clear what the issue was right? What was the adverse foreign policy? In certain cases, did they repost something on social media?’\n\nIn addition to the crackdown on international students the White House has threatened to withdraw millions of dollars in federal funding from at least 60 universities unless they agree to a set of demands to address alleged failures to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism and drop diversity, equity and inclusion policies. In response, elite US university Havard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing the funding freeze violates procedural requirements and its First Amendment Rights to freedom of speech. To restore its funding, Colombia University agreed to many of the administration’s demands including allowing security officers to remove or arrest individuals and taking control of its Middle East department from faculty.\n\nJameel Jaffer\n\n Director, Knight First Amendment Institute\n\nIn response to the action against Colombia, of the country’s top constitutional professors, both liberal and conservatives, wrote an open letter critical of the Trump administration’s use of funding cuts ‘as a tool to pressure recipients into suppressing First-Amendment protected speech,' which can extend to viewpoints ‘many of us find wrongheaded or deeply offensive.’ The First Amendment offers broad protections and guarantees freedom of the press, speech, religion, the right to assemble and the right to petition the government.\n\nJaffer says the damage being done while students and universities wait for court judgments is significant. ‘It has created a climate of fear and repression on campuses across the country,’ he says. ‘It’s caused an intense chilling effect and really changed the character of American universities quite dramatically.’\n\nIn certain cases, the question of whether the executive branch would defy a ruling by a federal judge has already been answered. In February the chief judge of the US Court for the District of Colombia ordered the US government to halt deportation flights carrying immigrants alleged to be Venezuelan gang members. But officials chose to ignore the order. ‘This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!’ President Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. In April, the FBI arrested a judge in Wisconsin for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration’s refusal to turn the planes around, many commentators have declared the US in a constitutional crisis. Steven Richman is Chair of the IBA’s Bar Issue Commission and a member at Clark Hill. He says while Trump undermining judges is concerning, the fears about him transforming the US into an authoritarian state should be placed in context. ‘Since Marbury v Madison established the primacy of judicial review in 1803, by which the federal courts could declare legislation, as well as executive and administrative actions as unconstitutional, presidents of various parties from time to time have been alleged to have defied the Supreme Court. The facts of each situation and specific rulings of the Court remain important to evaluate the executive’s conduct. What is significant is that there remains an acknowledgement that the rule of law governs, and Marbury v Madison remains in place.’\nSome of the most aggressive escalations of the Trump administration’s assaults on the legal system have manifested in a barrage of executive orders punishing large commercial law firms who have represented his political opponents or been involved in causes against him. The orders, which allege wrongdoing by individual lawyers and civil rights law violations by affirmative action schemes, terminate the firms from government contracts and restrict their employees from access to federal buildings. To avoid the sanctions, multiple law firms have cut deals with President Trump and collectively agreed to provide $940m in pro bono work for causes his administration supports. Others have decided to stand firm.\n\n‘The order is a plain violation of the First Amendment,’ Jenner & Block said, which, alongside Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, successfully obtained preliminary court rulings to block the executive orders. ‘Our constitution forbids attempts by the government to retaliate against citizens and lawyers based on the clients they represent, the positions they advocate, the opinions they voice and the people with whom they associate.’\n\nRichman says the government using executive power to take revenge on lawyers is problematic and a direct challenge to the independence of the legal profession. ‘If someone feels that a law firm has brought a frivolous or legally unjustified claim, there are remedies at law for pursuing such claims. The end can never justify the means. The means – due process, fairness, respect for the social contract and political will that underlies a system – must be respected.’\n\nIn response to the executive orders more than 500 law firms signed an amicus brief, accusing the Trump administration of a campaign of ‘draconian punishment’ against lawyers who have acted for clients it disapproves of. ‘Whatever short-term advantage the administration may gain from exercising power in this way, the rule of law cannot endure in the climate of fear that such actions create.’\n\nSome lawyers at firms who are unhappy with their employer’s decision to negotiate a deal with President Trump have quit their jobs in protest. One such former associate, Rachel Cohen, gave up her role at a prestigious white shoe law firm because of its decision not to challenge the Trump administration’s sanctioning of the legal profession. ‘I sent what I considered a conditional resignation that either we need to do something about this real infringement on the legal system, on democracy, on traditional impartiality, or I can’t work here anymore.’\n\nCohen, who has now joined recently launched firm Lowell and Associates, which is dedicated to representing those facing legal actions from the Trump administration, believes that the agreements law firms are reaching with Trump are shortsighted, especially in the cases where they have proactively made a deal with Trump to avoid an executive order being issued in the first place. ‘I don’t know why anyone would think that a president who has a history of not respecting people who he has entered into deals with would respect the terms of a terrible deal when people have shown them what their weak spots are,’ she says.\n\nLower courts have been strong in opposing President Trump’s efforts to undermine the legal system and suppress freedom of speech. A federal judge in Washington, DC temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order against Susman Godfrey, which helped Dominion (a manufacturer of voting machines that lawyers for Trump falsely accused of deleting votes for him in the 2020 election) secure a $700m settlement to resolve a defamation case against Fox News. The judge called the executive order ‘a shocking abuse of power’, which stemmed from a ‘personal vendetta.'\n\n‘It was a clear attempt to retaliate against the law firm for representing a client that was seeking to hold Fox News to account for spreading lies and misinformation about the 2020 election,’ says Hafetz. ‘This is why it is so surprising and disappointing that some law firms have sought to cut deals with the Trump administration because those firms that have fought back have been vindicated and received relief.’\n\nIn its statement after the settlement, Fox acknowledged that the court found some of its statements about Dominion to be false, but said its settlement ‘reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.’\n\nAlongside law firms, major media organisations have chosen to negotiate with Trump rather than challenge his attacks. In the run up to President Trump’s inauguration ABC News quickly settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump and Meta agreed to pay $25m to resolve a lawsuit over its decision to suspend Trump from its social media platforms following the January 6 attack on the US capital. In another notable move, the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times pulled their presidential endorsements.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to news organisations it disfavours. The Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. In February, the White House announced that it had banned the Associated Press from accessing certain press events because of its refusal to rename a body of water the Gulf of America. The White House said it would also exert greater control over which news outlets would get access to the president.\n\nPeople take part in a rally organised by Jewish activists against the detention by ICE agents of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil in New York City, U.S., 20 March 2025. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nGovernments favouring certain news organisations over others ‘is part of the authoritarian playbook,’ says Mark Stephens, Co-Chair of the IBA’s Human Rights Institute. ‘Banning the Associated Press essentially covering Trump in the way you would normally expect is designed to interfere with the free flow of information.’\n\nMel Bunce, a professor of international journalism and politics at City St George’s, University of London, says that the seriousness of the ban is underscored by the vital role of the Associated Press as a conduit for information. ‘The Associated Press is an incredibly important news organisation that is relied on by hundreds of news outlets around the world. Alongside Reuters and AFP, it is one of the most important building blocks of the international news system,’ she says. ‘It is one of the most rigorous and fact-based news organisations, and their news is shared globally – to millions of people in audiences around the world. And that’s why this is such a red flag.’\n\nWhile targeting the mainstream media, the Trump administration has branded itself as the ultimate defender of free speech. Trump officials backed up by billionaire social media owners have become fervent critics of ‘censorship’ coming from ‘woke’ progressivism that, they argue, would like to constrain the First Amendment.\n\nIn April a federal judge in a preliminary injunction ordered the White House to restore the access of The Associated Press access to cover presidential events, affirming on First Amendment grounds that the government cannot punish the news organisation for the content of its speech. Trump administration lawyers argued in court filings that the Associated Press does not have a constitutional right to specific presidential events.\n\nIn a show of solidarity against the ban, 40 news organisations signed a letter urging the White House to reverse the restrictions on the Associated Press. The signatories included outlets like Fox News and Newsmax, where many of the broadcasters and audience members are Trump supporters.\n\nAmy Brouillette is Director of Advocacy at the International Press Institute, an organisation that works to defend press freedom and independent journalism. ‘Limiting access to media pool events because of the news agency’s editorial decisions stifles freedom of speech,’ she says. ‘News organisations should be allowed to make editorial decisions without fear of retaliation from government officials.’\n\nIn another setback to the Trump administration a federal judge temporarily blocked its dismantling of state-funded broadcaster Voice of America, following an executive order accusing it of being ‘anti-Trump’ and ‘radical’. The director of Voice of America, Mike Abramowitz announced that almost his entire staff of 1,300 people had been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe Trump administration’s decision to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the 90-day freeze on foreign development assistance funding, is also impacting independent journalism internationally. ‘The recent freezing of USAID is having a very serious impact on the media and civil society organisations that play a role in ensuring accountability and transparency,’ says Brouillette. ‘The role that the media and civil society play is not only important for democracy but it’s also important for peace and security.’\n\nAlice Johnson is the IBA Multimedia Journalist and can be contacted at alice.johnson@int-bar.org",

The understanding didn't.\n\nThat's when an NYU business school professor decided to fight AI-assisted coursework with AI-powered oral exams.\n\nPanos Ipeirotis, a professor at NYU's Stern School of Business who teaches data science, wrote in a blog post published last week that he became concerned about student assignments that read like \"a McKinsey memo\" but lacked genuine understanding.\n\nWhen he called on students in class and asked them to defend their submissions, many struggled to do so.\n\n\"If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nTo counter that, he revived oral exams and enlisted an AI agent to administer them at scale, in an attempt to \"fight fire with fire.\"\n\n\"We need assessments that evolve toward formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning,\" Ipeirotis said.\n\n\"Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale,\" he added. \"Now, AI is making them scalable again.\"\n\nIn the blog post detailing the experiment, Ipeirotis said he and his colleague built the AI examiner using ElevenLabs' conversational speech technology.\n\n\"Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done,\" he said, adding that it took minutes to set up.\n\nThe oral exam had two parts. First, the AI agent questioned students about their capstone projects, probing their decisions and reasoning. Then it selected one of the cases discussed in class and pushed students to think through it live.\n\nOver the course of nine days, the system assessed 36 students. Each session lasted about 25 minutes, with total compute costs coming in at about $15 for all 36 students. A human-run oral exam could cost hundreds of dollars at teaching-assistant rates, Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis also used AI to grade the exams. Three AI models — Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT — independently assessed each transcript. They then reviewed one another's evaluations, revised their scores, and produced a final grade, with Claude acting as the \"chair\" to synthesize the decision.\n\nIpeirotis said the \"council of LLMs\" graded more consistently than humans, and \"more strictly, but more fairly.\"\n\n\"The feedback was better than any human would produce,\" he wrote, adding that the AI analysis also surfaced gaps in how the material had been taught.\n\nHowever, students were divided. Only a small minority preferred the AI oral exams, and many found them more stressful than written tests — even while acknowledging they were a better measure of real understanding.\n\nStill, Ipeirotis said the oral exams demonstrated \"how learning is supposed to work.\"\n\n\"The more you practice, the better you get,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis' blog post comes as universities grapple with how to test students in the AI era.\n\nA paper published in September in the academic journal \"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education\" said AI has turned student assessment into a \"wicked problem.\"\n\nThe study's authors interviewed 20 unit chairs at a large Australian university in late 2024. Through hourlong Zoom interviews, they found instructors to be overwhelmed by heavier workloads, confusion surrounding AI use, and a lack of agreement on what an AI-proof assessment should look like.\n\nSome faculty members told researchers that AI should be treated as a tool for students to master. Others view it as academic dishonesty that erodes learning. Many admitted they were unsure how to proceed.\n\nIn May, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said on an episode of his podcast, \"Possible,\" that AI can make it easier for students to exploit traditional assessment formats, such as essays. Universities should rethink how they evaluate learning, he said, adding that students could soon expect an \"AI examiner.\"\n\nHoffman said that oral exams leave less room for shortcuts, requiring students to demonstrate real understanding.",

    "description": "A provision that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free is expiring in 2026. It could put borrowers on the hook for thousands of dollars in taxes.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan forgiveness isn't certain — but taxes are.\n\nOn January 1, a provision in former President Joe Biden's 2021 American Rescue Plan that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free expired. It means that student-loan borrowers who qualify for student-loan forgiveness in 2026 could face thousands of dollars in new taxes alongside their debt relief.\n\nIt's a concern for borrowers who are close to reaching their qualifying number of payments on an income-driven repayment plan or the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nFor example, Misty Knapp, a 59-year-old student-loan borrower enrolled in PSLF, told Business Insider that she's just six payments away from reaching debt relief, but she doesn't think she can afford the taxes that would come with the forgiveness.\n\n\"I don't know what that's going to look like, but if I'm taxed on the amount that's forgiven, that would be a lot of money,\" Knapp said.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Education was working through a backlog of income-based repayment applications in 2025, meaning some borrowers who reached their payment threshold were left waiting for relief.\n\nThe department reached an agreement with the American Federation of Teachers in October to make sure that if a borrower reached their qualifying number of payments in 2025, they would not be subject to the new 2026 taxes, even if the department was still processing their claim in the new year.\n\nStill, the agreement said that the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department would have the \"final say\" on whether a borrower's forgiveness would count as taxable income, not the Department of Education.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers expressed concern with what they called the looming \"tax bomb\" set to hit borrowers. In November, Sen. Elizabeth Warren led some of her colleagues in sending a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging him to use his authority to reverse the expiration of the tax-free provision.\n\nThe lawmakers cited an analysis from advocacy group Protect Borrowers, which found that the average borrower on an income-driven repayment plan who receives debt relief could face losses between $5,800 and $10,000.\n\n\"By punishing IDR beneficiaries with massive tax bills, the federal government undermines the very purpose of the IDR program and reneges on its promises to borrowers,\" the lawmakers wrote.",

Williamson suffered multiple bites requiring eight stitches.\n\nThird-grade teacher Sierra Allen had just parked her car outside the elementary school when the two dogs also \"suddenly charged\" at her.\n\n“They were biting and snapping and jumping over me,” Allen told Fox 10 News. “They bit through my UGG boots, they bit through my pants. I have scars on my legs and thighs. It’s awful to look at — it’s a constant reminder of what happened to me one week ago today.”\n\nAllen was bitten on her legs before a group of parents, who were dropping their kids off at the school, stepped in to save her from the dogs, per Fox 10 News.\n\n“They were snapping at my face and at my neck. I want to say thank you to the parents — I probably wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for them,” said Allen.\n\nPolice officers and animal control arrived at the scene after Allen and Landin had been transported to the hospital, Fox 10 News reported.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe elementary school initially sent an email to parents stating that dogs attacked two students and a teacher. However, the City of Prichard later clarified that it was just one student and one teacher, adding that the victims sustained “minor” injuries, a claim Allen disputes.\n\n“I cannot walk for extended periods of time without my left knee swelling,” Allen told Fox 10 News. “I’ve never had that problem before. The bite marks on my right thigh — where the teeth went through — they’re still knotted and bruised.”\n\nThe two dogs belonged to the same owner, according to Fox 10 News. They were issued a mandatory 10-day quarantine notice following the incident.\n\nAllen alleges that the dog owner said “they don’t know where the dogs are,” following the attacks, per Fox 10 News. “Those dogs were not trained to be around people. They’re vicious, and they need to be captured,” she added.\n\nThe Mobile County Health Department’s Rabies Division is reportedly investigating the incidents.\n\nThe attacks have left Allen considering leaving her job, while Landin is now “terrified” of dogs, his mother told KOLD. “He is terrified. He wakes up out of his sleep at night just hollering,” she said.\n\nPEOPLE has contacted the City of Prichard and the Mobile County Health Department’s Rabies Division for comment.",

    "fullText": "SWANSEA — The Swansea community is mourning the loss of an elementary school student who died over the holiday break.\n\nSuperintendent of Swansea Public Schools Scott Holcomb responded Friday, Jan. 2 with a letter to families and staff about the death of second-grader Mason Stringer.\n\n“It is with heavy hearts that we share the heartbreaking news of the unexpected death of one of our students. … We hold Mason’s family, friends, classmates, teachers, and all who loved him close in our thoughts and hearts during this time of profound loss.”\n\nStringer, a student in Ms. Robinson’s class, the letter read, attended Gardner Elementary School.\n\n“The death of a child touches us in different ways. It can leave us feeling heartbroken and confused as we navigate the emotions that come with grief,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nIn the days ahead and upon students’ return to school, “additional therapeutic and counseling supports” will be made available to staff and students at Gardner, and at Elizabeth S. Brown Elementary School where Stringer’s brother is a student.\n\nSchool counselors, adjustment counselors, and other trained professionals will be present to “offer care, comfort, and a listening ear to any student or staff member in need,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nSupport will be offered, “to anyone who may need it, as we recognize that many members of our school community may be impacted. Families are encouraged to reach out to their school if they feel their child would benefit from additional assistance,” Holcomb’s letter read.\n\nHolcomb’s letter lists books and materials that could offer “thoughtful,” “age-appropriate” guidance for navigating the loss of a community member through conversations among families at home.\n\nGood Grief, a website that offers age-appropriate guidance for talking with children about death, grief reactions to expect, and ways to support children through loss.\n\nNational Alliance for Children’s Grief, an online resource that provides articles and caregiver toolkits focused on helping children cope with grief.\n\nSesame Street in Communities – Grief, a guide that offers child-friendly language, videos, and activities designed to help young children understand and express feelings related to loss.\n\nHolcomb’s letter recommends families use simple, honest, and age-appropriate language to speak about the event and reassure students that “they are safe, loved, and cared for,” and that feelings of sadness, confusion, or even uncertainty are natural.\n\nThese conversations, wrote Holcomb, may be ongoing and student questions are expected.\n\n“Out of respect for the Stringer family’s privacy, we ask that you hold them in your thoughts and heart while honoring their need for space as they grieve,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nNo other information related to the death is known at this time.\n\n“We are a deeply caring and connected community. In moments like this, our compassion, kindness, and willingness to support one another matter more than ever,” Holcomb wrote.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Herald News: Swansea mourns the loss of Gardner Elementary School student",

    "fullText": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) — More than 300,000 inactive university students have been removed from the rolls in Greece, cutting the country’s official student population by nearly half, authorities said Friday.\n\nThe move marks the end of a decadeslong practice — formally abolished in recent legislation — that allowed extended enrollment to facilitate lifelong learning and lengthy breaks for work.\n\nOn Friday, the Education Ministry said that 308,605 students admitted to state-run universities’ four-year degree programs before 2017 had been removed from the records.\n\n“Student status is not valid for life in any modern European university,\" Education Minister Sofia Zacharaki said. \"We want degrees with value, which reflect effort, skills and passion.”\n\nMinistry officials said that about 35,000 people successfully applied for reenrollment in 2025.\n\nOpponents of the conservative government's reform, mostly from the academic community, argue the second-chance program failed to address the scale of disruption caused by Greece’s severe financial crisis in the previous decade.\n\nThe country's active student population stands at just over 350,000, studying at 25 public higher education institutions, according to 2024 data from the Hellenic Authority for Higher Education.\n\nUndergraduate degree programs at state universities are normally funded by the government.

But recognized private universities are gradually being introduced.\n\nEducation Ministry officials said that dormant students — those who had interrupted their studies — didn't impose any direct financial burden on universities, but created administrative difficulties.\n\n“With updated student lists, universities gain the ability to plan more precisely,” Deputy Education Minister Nikos Papaioannou said.\n\n“That is a prerequisite for improving academic quality, daily operations and the criteria used to evaluate Greek universities in international rankings.”",

    "description": "The student loan system feels increasingly unstable and that uncertainty is driving more people to look for relief.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is taking a harder line on Americans with student loan debt, and borrowers are feeling it from two sides.\n\nOn the one front, the U.S. Department of Education has slammed the brakes on income-driven repayment (1). In August alone, 327,955 applications were denied, according to a Dec. 15 court filing (2). For borrowers who were counting on those plans to cap their monthly bills and eventually erase remaining balances, the fallout is immediate: higher payments or a limbo-like forbearance where interest keeps piling up while relief stays out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, the government is preparing to restart wage garnishment for borrowers in default as early as January (3). Millions of people are already more than 270 days behind on their loans, putting them at risk of having part of their paycheck seized after a 30-day notice.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nOnline, frustration is boiling over. One Reddit user wrote (4), “Mine will be nearly $500 a month which is literally impossible for me to pay. I just laugh at it now because simply no way I can afford that. If I tried, my parents and I would be dead before I pay even a quarter of what I owe. It’s a joke.”\n\nAmid the tightening screws, however, a surprising escape hatch is opening. Student loans have long been considered nearly impossible to wipe out through bankruptcy — but that assumption might be outdated.\n\nBorrowers who pursue bankruptcy relief are succeeding at rates few would have believed just a decade ago. An analysis by University of Utah law professor Jason Iuliano (5) found filers now manage to discharge some or all of their student debt 87% of the time through bankruptcy, up from 61% in 2017, largely due to a streamlined legal process introduced three years ago.\n\n“That’s strikingly high when you think about the narrative being it’s impossible to discharge,” Iuliano told The New York Times (6). His findings were published this month in The American Bankruptcy Law Journal, following 15 years of research.\n\nThe shift comes as financial pressure on borrowers continues to grow. A survey from the Institute for College Access and Success found 42% of borrowers are forced to choose between student loan payments and basic necessities, while 20% are delinquent or already in default (7). Even though the Biden administration canceled $183.6 billion in loans for more than 5 million borrowers, broader forgiveness efforts have stalled (8).",

    "description": "Student-loan borrowers will begin to see the effects of Trump's changes to repayment and borrowing in July 2026.",
    "fullText": "The new year is bringing a host of new changes for millions of student-loan borrowers.\n\nBeginning in July 2026, the student-loan provisions signed into law in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation are set to begin taking effect. Those provisions include rolling out new student-loan repayment plans, new borrowing caps, and eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans, which could result in higher monthly payments for borrowers.\n\nHere's what the Trump administration has in store for student-loan repayment in 2026.\n\nBeginning in July, the Department of Education plans to begin its process of eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan.\n\nThe standard repayment plan would set fixed payments for borrowers over a 10 to 25-year period based on the borrower's original balance. The Repayment Assistance Plan would serve as the income-based option for borrowers; it would set payments at 1% to 10% of the borrower's income, with a minimum monthly payment of $10 and forgiveness after 30 years.\n\nIt's less generous than the existing income-based repayment plan, which forgives balances after 20 or 25 years, and former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, which would forgive balances after as few as 10 years of payments.\n\nBorrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2026, will have until 2028 to enroll in RAP before the other plans phase out. Borrowers who take out loans after July 1, 2026, will only have RAP and the standard repayment plan as available repayment options.\n\nIn addition to new repayment plans, Trump's spending legislation eliminated the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nIt also implemented new borrowing caps for borrowers seeking advanced degrees. Graduate students would have a cap of $20,500 a year or $100,000 over a lifetime, and professional students would have a cap of $50,000 a year and $200,000 over a lifetime.\n\nThe Department of Education also proposed instituting a revised definition of a \"professional\" program, which included 10 programs that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap, including medicine, law, and dentistry. The new definition was a key point of contention with stakeholders who negotiated the terms with the department because the revised definition leaves out advanced programs like nursing, some of which have tuition that is above the proposed caps.\n\nTrump's spending legislation included eliminating the SAVE plan as part of its phase-out of existing income-driven repayment plans by 2028. However, his administration announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri in December that would end the SAVE plan as soon as the court approves the settlement.\n\nIt means that the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE would have a limited period of time to find a new repayment plan and restart their monthly payments at a higher amount. Additionally, the department said that it would deny pending applications to SAVE, which would include 450,000 borrowers who have expressed interest in enrolling in the plan.\n\nThe Department of Education is expanding eligibility for income-based repayment plans by removing the requirement of partial financial hardship. Prior to Trump's spending legislation, borrowers seeking to enroll in an IBR plan were required to have a monthly payment based on their income that was less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over 10 years.\n\nRemoving that requirement, which the department said would be completed in December 2025, means that borrowers with higher incomes would be eligible to enroll in IBR. Additionally, the department said that servicers would hold IBR applications that would otherwise be denied, and the applications would be processed once the updates to IBR were completed.",

    "fullText": "Parents could see big student-loan changes in the new year.\n\nBeginning July 1, 2026, the Department of Education will begin implementing President Donald Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul, which he signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nThe overhaul includes new income-driven repayment plans and lower borrowing caps — including for the Parent PLUS program, which allowed parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their kids' educations. The department is planning to impose a $65,000 lifetime borrowing limit per dependent student, or $20,000 per year, which will limit parents' ability to use federal financing to help send their children to college.\n\nThe new borrowing cap would apply to parents taking out new loans in 2026. Existing Parent PLUS borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2026, can continue borrowing at their existing terms until 2028.\n\nAdditionally, parents who take out loans after July 1 will only have access to the standard repayment plan and will not be able to enroll in the new Repayment Assistance Plan, which the Department of Education is rolling out to replace existing income-driven repayment plans.\n\nA September analysis from the Brookings Institution said that, based on data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey and the College Scorecard, 7.7% of undergrad students had parents who took out Parent PLUS loans at an average amount of $16,272 in the 2019-2020 school year. Higher-income families borrowed higher amounts: the analysis said that among families earning more than $130,000 annually, 46% took out more than $20,000 in Parent PLUS loans each year.\n\n\"However, these patterns mask a crucial insight: While lower-income families borrow smaller absolute amounts, they face significantly higher debt-to-income ratios,\" the analysis said, meaning that the repayment burden tends to be greater for lower-income families despite borrowing at lower amounts.\n\nParent PLUS loans also tend to have the highest interest rates among federal student loans, currently standing at 8.94%. Still, the analysis said, they have several advantages, including access to more flexible repayment options and interest deductions on federal taxes.\n\nThe new limits could leave parents looking for alternative options to help pay for their kids' educations, including turning to private lending, which tends to have higher interest rates with riskier terms. They come as the department is also eliminating the Grad PLUS loan program and placing new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, with the goal of curbing excessive student-loan borrowing.",

In the video, Rosh showed a clip of someone who said the energy used to mine lithium for EV batteries has a greater environmental impact than gas-powered cars.\n\nWhile Rosh said there are some environmental consequences from EV battery production, the TikToker rejected the idea that internal combustion engines are better for the planet.\n\nIn the video, Rosh presented a graph from Generation Investment Management which showed that other metals were mined significantly more than lithium in 2022. For example, about 1.3 million kilotonnes of iron were mined compared to 130 kilotonnes of lithium.\n\n\"The idea that it's worse or even comparable to what we are currently doing to maintain the fossil fuel status quo is completely wrong,\" Rosh said.\n\nThe EPA said the planet-friendly vehicles have a smaller carbon footprint than their gas counterparts because they have zero tailpipe emissions. In fact, a new study found that EVs zero out their carbon footprint in just two years on the road.\n\nThe transportation sector is the largest source of air pollution in the country. Switching to an EV can keep pollution out of the atmosphere and help you avoid paying for maintenance and high gas prices.\n\nHundreds of TikTok users responded to Rosh's video.

She asked whether there was any way to make the student loan balance \"go away.\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" personal finance expert Dave Ramsey said after confirming her age.\n\nLaRhonda told the hosts about her educational background. She said she holds three degrees: a bachelor's degree in multidisciplinary studies focused on criminal justice and religion, a master's degree in accounting, and a master's degree in divinity with a focus on theology and homiletics.\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nMissed Tesla?

    "description": "Apple, Michigan taxpayers, and one of Detroit’s wealthiest families spent roughly $30 million training hundreds of people to build iPhone apps. Not everyone lands coding jobs right away.",
    "fullText": "Lizmary Fernandez took a detour from studying to be an immigration attorney to join a free Apple course for making iPhone apps. The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit launched as part of the company’s $200 million response to the Black Lives Matter protests and aims to expand opportunities for people of color in the country’s poorest big city.\n\nBut Fernandez found the program’s cost-of-living stipend lacking—“A lot of us got on food stamps,” she says—and the coursework insufficient for landing a coding job. “I didn’t have the experience or portfolio,” says the 25-year-old, who is now a flight attendant and preparing to apply to law school. “Coding is not something I got back to.”\n\nSince 2021, the academy has welcomed over 1,700 students, a racially diverse mix with varying levels of tech literacy and financial flexibility. About 600 students, including Fernandez, have completed its 10-month course of half-days at Michigan State University, which cosponsors the Apple-branded and Apple-focused program.\n\nWIRED reviewed contracts and budgets and spoke with officials and graduates for the first in-depth examination of the nearly $30 million invested in the academy over the past four years—almost 30 percent of which came from Michigan taxpayers and the university’s regular students. As tech giants begin pouring billions of dollars into AI-related job training courses across the country, the Apple academy offers lessons on the challenges of uplifting diverse communities.\n\nSeven graduates who spoke with WIRED said they had good experiences at the academy, citing benefits such as receiving mentorship from past students. Fernandez says she was impressed by a focus on developing inclusive apps and a series of speakers from Apple who were genuinely willing to help and share frank lessons. “Their heart was in the right place,” she says.\n\nThe program does expose people of color to new possibilities. “It changed my life,” says Min Thu Khine, who’s now mentoring coding students and working at an Apple Store Genius Bar. “My dream is to be a software engineer at Apple.”\n\nThe academy also draws positive grades from some researchers who study tech education, such as Quinn Burke. He says its fully subsidized in-person instruction surpasses the quality of many coding boot camps, which proliferated over the past decade and sometimes left students in debt and with narrow skills.\n\nBut the academy being open to all can complicate instruction and how to measure success. One entire family attended together, and at least two mothers have come with their daughters. Students on average are in their thirties, ranging from 18-year-olds to, for example, a grandfather in his seventies who wanted to develop a photo app for his grandchild, according to Sarah Gretter, the academy leader for Michigan State.",

    "fullText": "Thousands of student-loan borrowers are stuck in limbo.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Department of Education provided an update on the progress it has made in processing student-loan borrowers' income-driven repayment applications in a court filing last week. It seems the department still has a lot of work to do: 802,730 IDR applications are pending as of November 30.\n\nPer the court filing, the department discharged the loans of 170 student-loan borrowers who were on IDR plans in November, with another 280 discharges for borrowers who had completed their payments through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nThe updates are a result of an agreement the Department of Education reached with the American Federation of Teachers, which accused the department in a lawsuit of delaying processing and denying borrowers the relief they're owed.\n\nIn October, the department also said in a court filing in the AFT lawsuit that it would process more forgiveness for borrowers on income-driven repayment plans, appearing to be a commitment to keep working through the backlog. The latest update leaves it uncertain as to how quickly the department intends to process applications and grant relief to borrowers who complete their qualifying number of payments.\n\nBeginning in July 2026, the department is set to begin implementing major repayment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. These include a new repayment plan, borrowing limits for graduate, professional, and parent loans, and changes to PSLF eligibility.\n\nTax changes are also coming. A 2021 provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free is set to expire in January, meaning that borrowers who reach their qualifying number of payments for relief in 2026 could face thousands of dollars in taxes. The department confirmed, however, that borrowers who reached their payment threshold before 2026 but did not yet have their discharge approved would not face taxes.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers told Business Insider that they're bracing for higher payments next year as a result of the slew of repayment changes, along with uncertainty as to how those changes will play out.\n\n\"My overall general feeling is anxiety and nervousness about it because we really don't know what's going to happen,\" Jennifer Oakes, a 41-year-old borrower, said.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's final rule on limiting eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is set to go into effect in July 2026.",
    "fullText": "Big changes are coming for a long-standing student-loan forgiveness program.\n\nIn 2007, Congress approved the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is designed to forgive student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of making qualifying payments. It meant that student-loan borrowers who dedicate at least a decade of their careers to public service work could count on their balances eventually being wiped out.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is changing the popular program, in which about 7 million borrowers are enrolled. At the end of October, the Department of Education finalized its rule to narrow eligibility for PSLF in response to Trump's March executive order directing the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nA fact sheet from the department said that the rule will change the definition of a qualifying employer \"to exclude employers that participate in illegal activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose.\"\n\nThe final rule is set to go into effect in July 2026, and some student-loan servicers that collect payments from borrowers in PSLF have said that nothing is changing yet, and borrowers will receive updates as the regulations go into effect.\n\n\"For now, there are no impacts to borrowers, payment counts, or discharges,\" one servicer, Aidvantage, posted on its website.\n\nThe Department of Education said that the changes are intended to ensure that borrowers who receive PSLF have employers that contribute to public service and do not violate any laws. However, borrowers and advocates have expressed concerns that the changes to eligibility will block public servants from relief because their employers do not align with the administration's political views.\n\n\"With this new rule, the Trump Administration is refocusing the PSLF program to ensure federal benefits go to our Nation's teachers, first responders, and civil servants who tirelessly serve their communities,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nThe key change in the PSLF rule concerns eligibility for PSLF employers. While any public service employer previously qualified for the program, a fact sheet from the Department of Education said that it will be changing the definition of a \"qualifying employer\" to exclude employers that have participated in \"substantial illegal activity,\" which the department said includes actions supporting terrorism or gender affirming care.\n\nIf the department determines that an employer engaged in illegal activity, affected employers will be notified and receive an opportunity to rebut the department's findings. Borrowers will also be notified, but they cannot appeal the findings themselves.\n\nShould the employer be disqualified from PSLF, they can reapply to be a qualifying employer within 10 years, or they can enter a \"corrective action plan\" with terms agreed upon by the department. Once an employer is deemed ineligible, any payments borrowers make while under that employer will not count toward PSLF, but retroactive payments would continue to be valid.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers in public service raised concerns with the looming PSLF changes. Megan Flocken, a nonprofit worker, told Business Insider: \"I'm counting my lucky stars that there's still the possibility that this PSLF program will remain intact because I have dedicated my whole professional life to public service.\"\n\nShortly after the department released its final rule, a coalition of advocates and nonprofits sued the administration, accusing it of violating the law and harming government and nonprofit recruitment. Some Democratic lawmakers also called for the rule to be rescinded; Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on X on November 1 that the administration does \"not have the right to take away student debt forgiveness from teachers, nurses, veterans and other public servants if they do not show loyalty to your right-wing political agenda.\"",

    "description": "Geoffrey Hinton, the \"Godfather of AI,\" said he's \"not convinced\" the age of AI scaling is over, like his former student Ilya Sutskever recently said.",
    "fullText": "Not everyone in AI is ready to declare the end of the age of scaling.\n\n\"I'm not convinced it's completely over,\" Geoffrey Hinton, the \"Godfather of AI,\" recently told Business Insider, weighing in on one of the hottest debates in AI circles this year.\n\nHinton is aware that OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, one of his former students, said last month that the pendulum of AI development is swinging back toward research — and away from companies simply making breakthroughs by scaling, or acquiring more compute and more chips.\n\n\"Is the belief really: 'Oh, it's so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?' It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don't think that's true,\" Sutskever said on an episode of the \"Dwarkesh Podcast.\"\n\n\"So it's back to the age of research again, just with big computers,\" added Sutskever, who is now running his own AI startup.\n\nHinton said there will always be a need for more data. (Another issue facing scaling is the finite amount of high-quality data.) He predicted that the large chatbots will start generating their own data, as Google DeepMind's AlphaGo and AlphaZero do on a much smaller scale to master the board game Go.\n\n\"Nobody's worried about a lack of data because it plays against itself and generates data that way,\" Hinton said of the early program. \"And the equivalent for a language model is when it starts reasoning and saying, 'Look, I believe these things and these things imply that thing, but I don't believe that thing, so I'd better change something somewhere.' And by doing reasoning to check the consistency of his own beliefs, it can generate a lot more data.\"\n\nScaling is at the very core of Big Tech's capex spending spree, a bet based on the belief that by acquiring more compute or training data, AI models will continue to grow smarter and more advanced.\n\nIncreasingly, some AI leaders have expressed uncertainty about making their future bets based on their trust in scaling. Alexandr Wang, now head of Meta's superintelligence division, said in 2024 that scaling is \"the biggest question in the industry.\"\n\nYann LeCun, who worked with Hinton on pioneering AI research, has also challenged the extent of the scale doctrine.\n\n\"You cannot just assume that more data and more compute means smarter AI,\" LeCun said in April when he was still Meta's chief AI scientist. Like Sutskever, LeCun has since launched his own startup.\n\nSutskever said scaling has been attractive because it allows companies to make a \"very low-risk way\" bet on AI advancements.\n\nIn contrast, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that scaling laws could ultimately unlock the biggest and most elusive prize in AI: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\n\n\"The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system,\" Hassabis said at the Axios' AI+ Summit in December. \"It could be the entirety of the AGI system.\"",

    "description": "About 1,000 defaulted student-loan borrowers will receive wage garnishment notices the week of January 7 with more to come as the year progresses.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers behind on payments could soon start seeing smaller paychecks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Department of Education confirmed to Business Insider on Tuesday that it will begin sending wage garnishment notices to defaulted student-loan borrowers in early January. The Washington Post was the first to report this update.\n\nThe department said that notices will go out to approximately 1,000 defaulted student-loan borrowers the week of January 7, and the notices \"will increase in scale on a month-to-month basis.\" The garnishment occurs only after borrowers have received notice and an opportunity to repay their loans, the department said.\n\nThis update follows the department's announcement in April that it would restart collections on defaulted student loans in May, after a five-year pause. Over 5 million student-loan borrowers are in default, according to department data, which typically occurs after a federal borrower has payments that are more than 270 days past due.\n\nMore could soon enter default status — TransUnion reported 5.8 million newly delinquent borrowers in April, or over 90 days past due, meaning that if those borrowers don't make payments, they could enter default and have their wages seized, in addition to withheld tax refunds and federal benefits like Social Security.\n\nBorrowers in default have options to return to good standing, but they can be time-consuming and complicated. One option is loan rehabilitation, which requires a borrower to contact their servicer and sign an agreement to make nine payments within 20 days of the due date over a period of 10 consecutive months. Wage garnishment would continue during rehabilitation, but upon completion, the default status would be removed from the borrower's credit report.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation. During this process, a borrower can apply to consolidate their defaulted student loan into a federal direct loan, but the record of default would remain on the borrower's credit history.\n\nLinda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said when the collection resumption was first announced that the goal of the policy isn't \"to be unkind to student borrowers.\"\n\n\"Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense,\" McMahon said. \"Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A protest erupted in India’s capital Tuesday in response to the death of a Hindu man who was lynched and burned by an angry mob in neighboring Bangladesh, a new sign of strain in relations between the neighboring countries.\n\nThe protest in New Delhi, mainly led by Hindu nationalist organization Vishva Hindu Parishad, highlights the fragility in the relationship between India and Bangladesh, which often is held up as a rare example of stability in South Asia.\n\nBangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi died in a hospital in Singapore on Thursday after being shot on Dec. 12 in Dhaka. Police in Bangladesh said they identified suspects and the shooter likely had fled to India.\n\nHadi’s death triggered widespread violence in Dhaka. The offices of two national daily newspapers were torched and Indian diplomatic missions were targeted. A Hindu man also was burned alive, which sparked the protest Tuesday in India.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, shouting slogans and accusing Bangladeshi groups of wrongly targeting minorities. They carried placards and banners with slogans including “India will not tolerate torture of Hindus in Bangladesh” and “Our silence should not be mistaken as weakness, we are lions.”\n\nAuthorities erected barricades and imposed tight security around the diplomatic enclave that included police and armored vehicles. Security personnel used batons to hold back some protesters who broke through barricades in an apparent attempt to enter the embassy.\n\nOne of the Indian protestors, Rajkumar Jindal, threatened “dire consequences” if authorities in Bangladesh failed to stop violence against Hindus.\n\n“People who are committing atrocities should stop doing that. We are here to awaken the people who are asleep,” Jindal said.\n\nHadi took part in a 2024 political uprising that ended the 15-year rule of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been in exile since fleeing Bangladesh on Aug. 5, 2024. He was a fierce critic of India and Hasina and planned to run as an independent candidate in a major constituency in Dhaka in the next national elections in February.\n\nHadi's death sparked a new diplomatic squabble with India and prompted New Delhi this week to summon Bangladesh’s envoy.\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also summoned Pranay Verma, the Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, to apprise him of the security situation at Bangladesh missions in New Delhi and state capitals Kolkata and Agartala, a leading Bengali-language newspaper reported Tuesday.\n\nTensions between India and Bangladesh increased again with the death on Thursday of Dipu Chandra Das, a 25-year-old Hindu man who was lynched and burned publicly following allegations of blasphemy in Mymensingh district’s Bhaluka subdistrict.\n\nDas's killing contributed to a pattern of fear among the Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of Hasina.\n\nReligious minority groups including Hindus and Christians have accused Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus of failing to protect the safety of Hindus and others. The Yunus administration has rejected the allegations.\n\nTuesday's protest could complicate cooperation on trade, border management and regional connectivity at a time when the region is already grappling with economic uncertainty and political polarization, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs.\n\n“Opposing India and alleging Indian conspiracies of interference in Bangladesh are being done in order to harden a blatantly Islamist and non-inclusive path for the country,” Chaulia said.\n\nThe rupture is a setback to India’s broader regional strategy, while for Bangladesh the loss of India’s development assistance and markets could further dampen the country's slowing economy and push it further into dependence on China, Chaulia said.\n\nBangladesh and India have enjoyed a warm relationship since 2009 when Hasina came to power and until her ouster. Hasina was considered a friend by India and both countries thrived on bilateral cooperation. But Hasina’s opponents accused her administration of being subservient to India, a major trade and investment partner.",

    "fullText": "Graduate and professional students could soon find themselves with more limited student-loan options. Yale has a plan.\n\nThe Yale School of Public Health posted on LinkedIn last week that it will \"soon introduce a replacement loan option\" for student-loan borrowers who are affected by President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate the Grad PLUS program as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nGrad PLUS allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. Trump's legislation eliminated the program and implemented new borrowing caps: a $100,000 lifetime cap for graduate students and a $200,000 lifetime cap for professional students.\n\nYale said that its new program would \"offer comparable, if not more competitive, loan terms compared to previous Grad PLUS loans,\" adding that more details will be available soon. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn addition to Yale, Bloomberg reported that other schools, such as Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, are also working to establish financing options for students pursuing advanced degrees, including working with private lenders for additional financing.\n\nEducation policy experts previously told Business Insider that limiting borrowing for advanced degrees could push students to either forgo their programs or turn to the private loan market, which could have riskier terms with higher interest rates.\n\nTrump's Department of Education is set to roll out the student-loan borrowing changes in July 2026. It will affect new students. Existing borrowers will be able to retain their financing options. The department is also introducing its new Repayment Assistance Plan in July, which is intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans.\n\nSome advocates and Democratic lawmakers have previously expressed concern with the elimination of Grad PLUS and the new caps on borrowing for advanced degrees. The Department of Education proposed a new definition of \"professional,\" compiling a list of 10 programs, like medicine and dentistry, that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap.\n\nEarlier this month, over 140 bipartisan lawmakers signed onto a letter urging the department to revise the limits to include advanced nursing programs in the professional degree designation.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, told Business Insider that \"we expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education completed its update to income-based repayment plans, expanding access to borrowers with higher incomes.",
    "fullText": "An affordable student-loan repayment plan is now available to more borrowers.\n\nOn December 22, President Donald Trump's Department of Education said that it had completed a key update to income-based repayment plans, removing the requirement to be in partial financial hardship to enroll.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to remove the financial hardship requirement, which meant that the borrower's monthly payment had to be less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over a 10-year period.\n\nNow that the update is complete, borrowers with higher incomes should soon become eligible to enroll in IBR plans. The department said that it encourages borrowers who were previously denied from IBR plans due to a lack of partial financial hardship to reapply using the online income-driven repayment application.\n\n\"If you applied for IBR and your servicer is holding your application, your servicer will process your application in the order in which it was received,\" the department said.\n\nIBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with student-loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on when they first took out the loan. Specifically, borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2014, will receive IBR payments based on 15% of their income with a 25-year repayment period. Borrowers who took out loans after that date will receive payments based on 10% of their income with a 20-year repayment period.\n\nAfter a backlog of IBR application processing, the Department of Education restarted student-loan forgiveness in the fall for borrowers who had reached their payment thresholds.\n\nIn addition to the IBR changes, the department is also working to implement other repayment changes, including new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, as well as a new Repayment Assistance Plan intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans. Those changes are set to roll out in July 2026.",

    "title": "Islamophobic Elites Lied to Destroy the Life of a Palestinian Brown Student",
    "description": "Jeet...",
    "fullText": "Plutocrats, pundits, and government officials joined together in a racist smear campaign against a queer Palestinian student at Brown University.\n\nTo survive a school shooting is traumatic enough, but to then face a nationwide racist smear campaign that falsely accuses you of being the murderer is even worse. That was the fate of Mustapha Kharbouch, a queer Palestinian student at Brown University. While mourning his fellow students, Kharbouch found himself confronting false accusations. Across social media, attempts by the university to protect his privacy were painted as proof of guilt.\n\nThose who libeled Kharbouch were not anonymous social media trolls but some of the country’s most powerful figures, including prominent plutocrats such as Shaun Maguire and Bill Ackman, government officials like US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, lawmakers such as Representative Anna Paulina Luna, and influencers such as Laura Loomer (who is known to have the ear of President Donald Trump). These figures used their considerable megaphones to try to destroy the life of a private citizen. This racist mob operated with reckless disregard for the truth, likely because they knew that Islamophobia enjoys near-total impunity in the United States. To date, this story has not been covered in mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times. This itself is evidence of now normalized vicious Islamophobia has become.\n\nTo understand Kharbouch’s horrific experience, it is necessary to lay out the facts of two murder cases. The best available evidence indicates that on Saturday, December 13, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente went on a shooting spree that killed two people and injured nine at Brown University. Two days later, while still at large, Valente killed MIT scientist Nuno Loureiro, whom Valente had known in his native Portugal. Valente killed himself on December 16. His body was found two days later. The police and FBI seem to have been extremely inept in investigating the case and broke it only with the help of a Reddit post.\n\nThe incompetence of law enforcement allowed racist and Islamophobic conspiracy theories to run wild. The two interrelated conspiracy theories were that Kharbouch was the murderer and that Loureiro was murdered because he was Jewish and an ardent Zionist. The Daily Mail reported that “Israeli officials” believe Loureiro was “assassinated in his home in [a] targeted attack by [an] Iranian operative.” This reporting was nonsense. There is no evidence that Loureiro was either Jewish or a Zionist. As best as can be discovered, Valente’s motives for the murders were personal, based on frustration over his failed academic career.\n\nAn AFP fact-check gives a useful rundown of how the smear against Karbouch spread:\n\nThe allegations appeared to originate with the anonymous X account “@0hour1,” which repeatedly posted photos and videos of Kharbouch on December 15, sometimes alongside images police had released of the person of interest. The student’s photos and email address were quickly plastered across X, sparking calls for their punishment or death.\n\nMany posts highlighted the student’s documented history of pro-Palestinian activism, while several attempted to compare the individual’s body and gait to a person of interest shown in footage released by police….\n\nRight-wing podcaster Tim Pool and US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon joined in amplifying the narrative, which gained further momentum as Brown University webpages mentioning Kharbouch or listing their contact information appeared to be removed, fueling claims of a cover-up. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also reshared multiple posts floating the allegations.\n\nTo protect Kharboch from doxing, Brown University scrubbed information about him from its website. This was taken by Islamophobes as evidence of guilt.\n\nAs Fast Company reports, Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire promoted false accusations about Kharbouch, as well as the erroneous theory of the motivation for Loureiro’s murder. On the social medial site X, the journalist Jasper Nathanial posted a video that Maquire had made about the murders and subsequently deleted. Summing up the video, Nathaniel noted:\n\n[Maguire] claims there is “very strong evidence” that Mustapha Kharbouch, a Palestinian Brown student, “likely” committed the murders of two Brown students. He treats Brown removing pages about Kharbouch as evidence of guilt, completely lost on him that this was a response to doxxing like his. He also falsely claims the slain MIT professor was Jewish and frames the killings as part of a history of “pro-Palestinian terrorism” that he says is supported by [Zohran] Mamdani.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Kharbouch spoke of his experiences: “I woke up on Tuesday morning to unfounded, vile, Islamophobic, and anti-Palestinian accusations being directed toward me online. Instead of grieving with my community in the aftermath of the horrible shooting, I received non-stop death threats and hate speech.”\n\nIt’s possible that Kharbouch might be able to get some redress through the courts by launching libel actions against those who defamed him. But this legal remedy won’t touch the larger problem of out-of-control islamophobia.\n\nAs Washington Post columnist Shadi Hamid notes, rabid expressions of hatred for Muslims have become normal on the right in the Trump era. To cite one example, on December 14, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville tweeted, “Islam is not a religion. It’s a cult. Islamists aren’t here to assimilate. They’re here to conquer.” Vile comments like this have become the norm among Republicans, while Democratic pushback has too often been perfunctory. The defamation campaign against Kharbouch could easily have led to his being physically harmed or killed. Unless Islamophobia and other forms of racism are fought head-on, the US is headed for a dark future.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

He does not claim that this warrant’s affidavit lacks probable cause. He does not claim that this warrant was overbroad or lacked particularity. And he does not – and cannot – claim that the federal warrant included any information obtained by UMPD during its search of devices pursuant to the warrants that Weiss challenges,” the government’s filing read.\n\nWeiss is also facing a civil lawsuit by more than 70 women who say he hacked into private accounts to steal private photos.\n\nHe was the offensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh but was fired in February 2023 following the allegations.",

    "fullText": "Donovan Metayer was a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida when a gunman opened fire and killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day 2018.\n\nA young man who was a “radiant” child according to family and friends, has died.\n\nDonovan Joshua Leigh Metayer, 26, died on Dec. 15 by suicide. Metayer, who survived the 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, suffered from mental health episodes following the tragic incident and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The shooting occurred during Metayer’s senior year, when most students are thinking about college applications and their life after high school.\n\nBut the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 people, had a profound effect on Metayer and stands as an example of how the trauma of gun violence can linger on for years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Metayer family, Donovan was brilliant from an early age and excelled academically. His humor, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated in his honor, could “light up any room.”\n\nIn the years following the Parkland shooting, Metayer’s dreams of attending college and working in his preferred career field of computer science began to fade. On multiple occasions, he would be hospitalized for suicidal ideation and after one mental health episode in 2021, he was Baker-acted and deemed temporarily unable to purchase a firearm.\n\nYears later, with the help of a private psychiatrist and the Henderson Clinic Metayer began making progress and healing. He’d soon work at Office Depot and earn a promotion and an IT certificate. His mental health journey echoes that of many Black boys across America, masking emotions and not wanting to be seen as a “burden” by family. Treatment, from therapy to medication, may seem like a difficult path thanks to limited resources, social stigmas and more.\n\nHowever, just as Metayer was progressing and gaining more independence according to his family, he soon learned his Risk Protective Order had lapsed.\n\nMetayer then purchased a gun from a gun shop in the area and within a week, he turned the gun on himself.\n\nIn a statement shared on his GoFundMe page, Donovan’s family wrote, ” Donny’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of the mental health crisis plaguing our youth and the lasting trauma of gun violence on our community. As we grieve his loss, we are breaking the code of silence in his memory. Though Donny’s life was brief, his impact will be everlasting.”\n\nThe family is asking for funds to assist for Metayer’s celebration of life and endow a fund at the Henerson Clinic that will “provide healthcare, housing and hope for people of all ages with behavioral health conditions” throughout the state of Florida.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.\n\n‘They beat our brother’: New York community demands justice after video shows police beating a Black man\n\nRay J has restraining order extended following November arrest, faces 6 misdemeanor charges: ‘I’m missing my kids’\n\nDeaths of Missisippi mom Shardee McGill and 3-year-old daughter determined to be murder-suicide",

    "fullText": "The menus hadn't even closed before I blurted out my order: a salad. It was my way of throwing my friends off the scent, as if a plate of lettuce could erase the truth and hide my late-night snack binging. But deep down, I knew the only person I was fooling was myself.\n\nAt 16, about 4 years ago, standing at 5'9\" and 120 pounds overweight, I felt powerless — not just over my body, but over the insecurities that dictated how I moved through the world.\n\nWeighing over 300 pounds was the elephant in every room I walked into, and most days I felt like the elephant myself. I vividly remember sitting in doctors' offices and being told my BMI was too high, but every time their words felt clinical and detached. What I felt each day was far more immediate, as every choice I made revolved around trying to shrink: grabbing something small at restaurants, ducking out of photos, hesitating to speak up in class for fear of drawing attention.\n\nI was exhausted, yet trying to change felt even more overwhelming. I hoped everything would be different in college.\n\nWhen I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, the thought of starting fresh collided with the reality that I was still carrying the same weight, physically and emotionally.\n\nWatching everyone else carve out their independence made me realize that if I wanted to take advantage of this new beginning, I couldn't keep living in the shadow of my body insecurities. That recognition, that no one could make this change for me, was the first real decision I ever made on my own.\n\nThe process was messy. I researched and experimented, failed and adjusted, over and over again. I cut out seconds, swapped soda for water, and reminded myself that a slice of cake today would not help me tomorrow.\n\nAt first, it felt impossible. I failed often, sometimes in secret, but each time that I pulled myself back on track, I chipped away at the belief that I was incapable of discipline.\n\nAt first, the changes felt so small they seemed pointless, but gradually I noticed patterns forming. My cravings dulled, my routines steadied, and I began to trust myself in situations that once felt impossible.\n\nI came to understand that progress was not a straight line; it curved, dipped, and sometimes reversed. The true test was whether I could keep going even when no one else was forcing me to.\n\nSuccess didn't come as dramatic numbers on a scale but in quieter victories: having the energy to walk across campus without losing my breath, joining a conversation instead of hanging back, and looking in the mirror without immediately turning away.\n\nThe discipline and resilience I built through that journey have carried into every corner of my college life. Balancing coursework, adjusting to independence, and navigating friendships all required the same patience and persistence I first practiced at the table.\n\nI approached long nights of studying the way I approached exercise: one choice at a time, knowing consistency mattered more than perfection. I learned to prioritize my well-being, to recognize when to push forward and when to rest, and to trust that even when progress didn't look linear, it was still happening.\n\nWith the past in the rearview mirror, the desire for change and knowledge feeds my hunger that was once covered up by sweets and treats. My curiosity for more only grew.\n\nThe skills I have obtained before and during my transformation have taught me to believe that change is good. It pushes you to grow into the person you are meant to be. The hardships, growth, and setbacks have helped build my mindset to continue pushing myself.",

    "fullText": "As investigators work to find a motive behind the mass shooting at Brown University and the slaying of an acclaimed MIT professor, former classmates of the accused killer described him as a brilliant but exceptionally difficult student.\n\nClaudio Neves Valente, the 48-year-old suspect who police say was found dead Thursday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was a top student but a disruptive personality in his native Portugal, recalled classmates on Friday.\n\nNeves Valente studied at Instituto Superior Técnico along with Nuno Loureiro, the MIT professor he is now accused of shooting to death. The school confirmed to CNN that both men were students there between 1995 and 2000, and that Neves Valente studied for a degree in Technological Physics Engineering.\n\nThat engineering course was full of gifted students, recalled classmate Felipe Moura – but Neves Valente stood out, for good and bad reasons.\n\n“Claudio was obviously one of the best, but in class he had a great need to stand out and show that he was better than the rest,” Moura wrote in Portuguese in a Facebook post.\n\n“Claudio’s attitude was unpleasant,” he continued, often arguing with “colleagues he didn’t consider as brilliant as him (and who probably weren’t),” he wrote. “They were totally unnecessary quarrels, which did not help the class at all.”\n\nMoura, who now teaches at a Lisbon university, did not respond to messages from CNN. A former classmate, who asked not to be quoted by name, confirmed that Moura’s Facebook account was authentic.\n\nIn an interview with Público, a newspaper in Portugal, Moura echoed his impressions of Neves Valente as an aggressive classmate.\n\n“He had a confrontational personality in class. In other words, the other good students would intervene, ask questions, [but] Claudio liked to say that he was the one who knew,” Moura told the paper.\n\nNuno Morais, another classmate, told Público that Neves Valente and Loureiro were among the top students at the school – but their personalities were starkly different.\n\n“Claudio was one of the students with the best grades in the course. He was much more theoretical,” Morais told the paper. “Nuno was also a good student, he stood out less in terms of grades, but he was a more relaxed person—and seemed to have a knack for slightly more applied subjects.”\n\nAfter graduating in Portugal, Neves Valente enrolled at Brown University in 2000 as a graduate student in physics but did not finish the program. Moura said he stayed in touch with Neves Valente at the time and found that he was once again clashing with other students.\n\n“I exchanged many emails with him at the time and saw that he maintained the same attitude — as he told me —of maintaining unnecessary conflicts with PhD colleagues in class, which he again considered far less capable than he was,” Moura wrote on Facebook. “I could tell that he wasn’t enjoying being at Brown University.”\n\nScott Watson, a classmate at Brown, said Valente was “socially awkward” and that he became his only friend at the university. He struggled in the US, complaining bitterly that classes weren’t challenging and that the food was poor, Watson recalled.\n\n“He would say the classes were too easy—honestly, for him they were. He already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive,” Watson, who is now a professor at Syracuse University, said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nWatson said Valente could be “kind and gentle” but that he was also volatile as well.\n\n“He often became frustrated—sometimes angry—about courses, professors, and living conditions,” Watson said, recalling that once he had to break up a fight between Valente and another classmate he often insulted.\n\nMoura said he tried to convince Valente to stay with the graduate program, but he left after one year.\n\n“Claudio thought none of it was worth it, which was a waste of time and the others were all incapable,” he said on Facebook.\n\nIn an archived Brown website, Neves Valente appears to write to classmates that he’s left the school “permanently.” The note, first reported by the New York Times, includes an email address to reach him and a cryptic note: “The best liar is he who is able to fool himself. They are everywhere, but sometimes proliferate in the most unexpected places.”\n\nA directory of physics graduate students at Brown from that time links to the website alongside a student email address for Neves Valente. The directory shows that he was assigned to room 122 at the Barus and Holley engineering building. Neves Valente carried out his shooting in room 166 in the same building last week, police say.\n\nIt’s unclear what Neves Valente did in the intervening years. Moura wrote on Facebook that he heard he’d returned to Portugal to work for an internet provider; police say he received a visa and returned to the US in 2017, though it is unclear what he did for work.\n\nHis last known address was in Miami, police said.\n\nHis former classmates have been left trying to understand what could have motivated the brutal violence.\n\n“I never expected he would be capable of such a thing,” Moura wrote.\n\nCNN’s Vasco Cotovio, Thomas Bordeaux, Julia Vargas Jones contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Two years after the Supreme Court effectively ended race-conscious college admissions nationwide, Johns Hopkins University has seen a significant change in the racial makeup of its freshman class, according to newly released enrollment data.\n\nSince 2023, the number of Asian first-year undergraduate students, as measured by federal reporting standards, has risen nearly 20 percentage points, to 45.1% from 25.6%. Black first-year student representation, meanwhile, has been cut in half, dropping to 4% from 9.8%, as has the Hispanic student population, which fell to 10.1% this year from 20.8% two years ago. White freshman enrollment remained relatively flat, at 21% in 2025, compared with 19.3% in 2023. Those self-reporting as white fell more sharply to 30.9% from 39.1%.\n\nThe data offer a clear, local snapshot of how elite universities may be changing in the wake of the 2023 ruling, which prohibited schools from considering race in admissions. While universities across the country warned the decision could reduce racial diversity, Johns Hopkins’ numbers show an especially stark shift.\n\n“Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [Students for Fair Admissions] v Harvard, we have been navigating an evolving legal and regulatory environment,” said university spokesman J.B. Bird in an email to the Baltimore Sun. “We continue to work on opening our doors as wide as possible to students from all backgrounds and perspectives.”\n\nThe research university has seen some success in its efforts to diversify by income level, regardless of race. The 2025 freshman class has the highest-ever number of Pell grant recipients, at 24.1%, up slightly from 23.8% last year and 21.6% the year before. First-generation college student admission remained flat from last year at 20.3% percent, but up from 19.4% in 2023. Both Pell grant recipients and first-generation college students had risen steadily since 2010.\n\nThe university’s new Tuition Promise program could also increase diversity in the coming years, said Amelia, a second-year graduate student who declined to give her last name.\n\nThe program, which begins next year, with January admissions, offers a free education to students whose families earn less than $200,000, and includes living expenses for those making less than $100,000.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision is already changing higher education in more ways than student body demographics can reveal, said Bryan Cook higher education policy director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank. Johns Hopkins is not unique, though the court’s decision more strongly impacted private, elite college and universities that had been trying to recruit more diverse student bodies, Cook said. Schools like community colleges that accept all applications, and state schools that rely primarily on test scores for admissions, would not be affected, he said.\n\nA lot of institutions are having to make significant changes in their policies,” Cook said. “In many cases, this is already changing the demographics of what campuses look like.”\n\nIt’s difficult to determine the whole story, he said, admissions data only shows part of what is happening.\n\n“We know nothing about the demographics of their applicant pool and how that might line up with admissions,” Cook explained. “We don’t know what’s happening universally across all schools.”\n\nThe Urban Institute reached out to universities to request applicant data to improve their understanding, publishing their findings in July of 2025.\n\n“Early analysis from 18 institutions suggests that Black students’ share of the applicant pool increased more between 2023 and 2024 than in any of the prior five years,” the report states, “but their share of the admitted student pool held constant or even decreased. Furthermore, an increasing number of applicants have chosen not to disclose their race or ethnicity.”\n\nAmong elite universities, those admitting less than half of their applicants, Black student admissions fell to 5.9% in 2024 from 6.6% in 2023, while Black admissions at less selective schools remained level.\n\nMost Americans support fair admissions, said Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, the organization that brought the lawsuit against Harvard, resulting in the Supreme Court decision.\n\n“Credible polling from across the political spectrum indicates that Americans agree that a student’s race or ethnicity should not be considered as a factor in whether that student is accepted or rejected at any university,” Blum said.\n\nHopkins student Aaden, who asked to only be identified by his first name.\n\n“I believe it is important to have a diverse student body,” said Aaden, a third-year chemistry student, “although I think if we were picking people because of their race, it’s not fair to Asian and white students. People with lower grades might be picked because of their race.”\n\nAaden lives in Florida, where his parents immigrated from the Caribbean. He said he hasn’t experienced racism on campus but understands how new Black and Hispanic students might feel more isolated this year.\n\nMaria Laskaris, a college counselor from TopTier Admissions, helps students prepare for and get into schools best suited for their needs, beginning younger than high school age. She agreed that the Supreme Court ruling affects primarily highly selective private institutions, but said the changes would not necessarily change how she advises minority student clients.\n\n“I would make sure that any student I advise is aware of the landscape in which they are applying to college and various policies of the colleges they’re interested in,” she said. “It’s about how you set yourself apart. What do you bring to the table that makes you stand out from other applicants?”\n\nTricia Bishop contributed to this report.\n\nHave a news tip?

    "fullText": "SYDNEY (AP) — A judge sentenced a Sydney taekwondo instructor on Tuesday to life in prison without possibility of release for murdering a 7-year-old student and the boy’s parents.\n\nKwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.\n\nHarrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family’s financial success.\n\n“I’m satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,” Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.\n\nHarrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.\n\nState law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy’s parents also can’t be named.\n\nYoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.\n\nYoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.\n\nYoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion’s Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.\n\nHe took the mother’s Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy’s 39-year-old father to death.\n\nYoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.\n\nAfter his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family’s money and later detailed his remorse.\n\nThe former instructor, whose students called him Master Lion, did not look at the victims’ family and other supporters as they sobbed in the court’s public gallery after the sentence was handed down.\n\n“These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion,” the judge said.\n\nWhile the crimes were planned — with Yoo surveilling the family’s home beforehand — he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.\n\nAt a sentence hearing in November, the judge heard Yoo had lied about meeting the wealthiest Australian, Gina Rinehart, qualifying for the Sydney Olympics in 2000, owning a Lamborghini luxury car and living in Sydney’s wealthy eastern suburbs.\n\nTo impress his own wife, he would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people. He sometimes used the title professor.\n\nHarrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.\n\nThe judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.\n\nYoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.\n\nIn a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was “held captive by sin” and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.\n\n“I wish I could turn back time so this didn’t happen,” Yoo wrote. “I pray every day for the people I have hurt.”\n\nYoo’s lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

    "fullText": "UNION GROVE, Texas (KETK) — Union Grove student athlete, Landry Harris, showed her perseverance and dedication to her sport by pushing through a potentially season-ending injury.\n\nUnion Grove ISD names new superintendent\n\n“I’ve kind of done sports my whole life,” Harris said. “My family’s very, very into sports. All my brothers did sports. So I’ve been doing them since third grade.”\n\nShe’s played numerous sports throughout the years, but truly found her stride in cross country, even setting a school record her freshman year. But before her season even started this year, she tore her ACL, an injury that can put athletes on the bench for more than 9 months.\n\n“It’s been an emotional journey because running is my big thing,” Harris said. “I didn’t know if I’d be able to run this season with my team and keep our streaks alive and just be there for my team because that’s what I love doing.”\n\nThrough her recovery process, she said she found out she might be able to compete this season.\n\n“I got told by my doctors that if I put in the work at physical therapy this summer, that I would be able to get back to running before surgery,” Harris said.\n\nSo that’s what she did, working every week to get better and better to overcome this injury while pushing her team to grow together through a difficult season.\n\n“In a strange way, the injury has grown us all because as a coaching staff, we’ve been able to see our kids rally around one another, and other kids got stronger and maintained that going into the season,” Girls’ athletic coordinator JB Littlejohn said.\n\nDuring this recovery, Harris became an inspiration to her teammates and peers.\n\n“She was our athlete of the Year last year as a freshman,” Littlejohn said. “Her competitive nature, combined with her work ethic, you put that with the natural talent, that’s why we’re seeing what she’s doing.”\n\nThrough determination and hard work, Landry and her team made it all the way to the state cross country meet.\n\n“It was very like congratulating, and I felt like my efforts and everything that I went through paid off finally,” Harris said.\n\nYou can now stream KETK and FOX51 News live 24/7 on your smart TV with KETK+, our brand-new app!

    "description": "The victim's LinkedIn profile indicates Ella Cook began attending Brown in 2024.",
    "fullText": "One of the students killed in the mass shooting at Brown University is Ella Cook, who was a parishioner at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, the church announced during its Sunday, Dec. 14, service.\n\n\"Many of you heard about the tragedy ... And sadly, tragically, one of those people is one of our parishioners,\" Rev. Craig Smalley said in livestreamed remarks.\n\nSmalley described Cook as a \"bright light\" who was engaged in the church and the broader community, and \"incredibly grounded and generous and faithful.\"\n\nCook's LinkedIn profile indicates that she began attending Brown in 2024.\n\nShe was vice president of the Brown Republicans, according to a social media post from Alex Shieh, who left the school earlier this year amid a furor over his DOGE-inspired \"bloat @ Brown\" campaign.\n\n\"Being a conservative at Brown isn't always the easiest, but Ella was never afraid to share her beliefs on an overwhelmingly liberal campus and support others in doing so,\" Shieh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Last spring, while I was under a disciplinary investigation for reporting on Brown's administration for the conservative student paper, almost nobody wanted to be associated with me,\" he added. \"Ella was one of the few who were willing to stand with me in public and help hand out newspapers in front of the dining hall.\"\n\nAlabama U.S. Sen. Katie Britt expressed her condolences to the family of Ella Cook, calling the student’s death “heartbreaking” and “senseless,\" according to reporting from the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nIn a statement, Britt said she and her husband, Wesley, “joined the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University’s campus.”\n\nShe offered comfort to those who knew Cook, noting that her life was “taken far too soon” and expressing gratitude to law enforcement officials working on the investigation. Britt also asked that Ella’s loved ones and community be kept in prayers during this difficult time.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Dec. 14, WRAL News and the News & Observer, in Raleigh, North Carolina, reported that Kendall Turner, a Brown freshman, is among the injured students.\n\nTurner is an alumnus of Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina, said an email sent to the school community, according to reports from both outlets.\n\nThe email said that Turner underwent surgery and is now resting in critical but stable condition. Her parents arrived in Providence on Saturday night.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Brown University student killed in mass shooting ID'd as Ella Cook",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s Kobbie Mainoo’s last year at Old Trafford has been far from plain sailing.\n\nThe Carrington graduate was massively important under Erik ten Hag and even broke into the England national team’s starting eleven.\n\nNonetheless, since Ruben Amorim has come to the club, Mainoo has seen his minutes dramatically reduced.\n\nMainoo has only played 10 matches in the Premier League and has failed to start any of them. What’s more, he has only been on the pitch for a combined 183 minutes.\n\nNaturally, Mainoo is far from content with the situation and was denied a loan move at the end of August.\n\nThe lack of minutes has only fuelled further talk of an exit, with Serie A champions SSC Napoli and Spanish giants Real Madrid and FC Barcelona both seemingly interested in the midfielder.\n\nThe manager’s lack of trust in the fan favourite is clear for all to see. This was evident when Mainoo was given a hero’s welcome last Monday when he came off the bench versus Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nAmorim has defended his decision to stick with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but it seems that now it is more than just the fans questioning the Portuguese manager’s thought process on the matter.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that, “Mainoo’s exasperation over his current situation at Old Trafford barely needs stating. He feels frozen out by a manager who has yet to start him in a Premier League game this season and wants to leave on loan next month in pursuit of regular playing time.”\n\nInterestingly, the paper notes that, “there are figures within the club who are very uneasy about the player’s predicament and what a potential exit could signify.”\n\nWhilst Amorim has insisted that there is a route back for Mainoo, not many would believe him considering Mainoo’s lack of minutes in spite of the club’s limited midfield options.\n\nIn addition, Manchester United have always prided themselves on their academy, and there will have been shudders down the spine of numerous fans after hearing Amorim’s comments on the likes of Harry Amass and Chido Obi in his pre-match press conference.\n\nMoreover, with Manchester United’s academy swarming with many talented starlets at the moment, none more obvious than JJ Gabriel, supporters and indeed the club will worry immensely over the cloud the Mainoo situation is casting over Old Trafford at the moment.\n\nFeatured image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim has faced plenty of heat for his utilisation of Manchester United wonderkid Kobbie Mainoo this season.\n\nNot too long ago, the Carrington graduate was starring for the Red Devils as they overcame Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Who can forget his injury-time winner against Olympique Lyonnais last season?\n\nFrom those heady heights, the Englishman has fallen on hard times under the head coach in this campaign. A total of zero starts in the Premier League has meant the 20-year-old is desperate to jump ship in January.\n\nHe had asked INEOS to leave in the summer as well, and he is likely to approach them once again in the coming days to find some sort of solution.\n\nIt is clear from Amorim’s comments that the England international is unlikely to see too many minutes unless there are injuries or the head coach shuffles his pack.\n\nA whole host of clubs are chasing the United No.37, and while Napoli remains his preferred destination, CaughtOffside have claimed that Chelsea are leading the race.\n\nThe Blues had signed fellow Carrington graduate Alejandro Garnacho in the summer and are now looking to add more young talents from the Red Devils.\n\nBayern Munich are also strong contenders. Thankfully for the 20-time English league champions, the Stockport-born ace remains committed to his boyhood club, and wants only a temporary exit to boost his England World Cup hopes.\n\nHe prefers a foreign club, and the co-owners are unlikely to sanction a deal to a domestic top-four unless it involves an offer too good to be refused.\n\n“Although at least 12 clubs are reportedly in the race, sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Chelsea and Bayern Munich are “leading the chase”.\n\n“It will be interesting to see if Chelsea can convince Manchester United to sell. They are looking to build a formidable team for the future, and the England International midfielder could be the final piece of the puzzle for them.\n\n“However, the player’s personal preference list still places Napoli as the frontrunner. Mainoo is prioritising where he can be a guaranteed starter as he plots his next move.”\n\nHopefully, it does not come to that and the talented star remains at Old Trafford for the foreseeable future.\n\nPossibly, AFCON departures could finally force Amorim to hand Kobbie Mainoo more gametime. And the midfielder must grab his chance with both hands when it arrives.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Over 140 bipartisan lawmakers wrote to oppose the Education Department's plan to place new student-loan limits on nursing programs.",
    "fullText": "Opposition toward new student-loan limits in President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul is mounting.\n\nOn Friday, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent urging him to revise the Department of Education's proposal to place new student-loan limits on professional degree programs.\n\nThe department recently concluded its negotiations on the student-loan payment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The changes included borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: a $100,000 lifetime limit for graduate students, and a $200,000 lifetime limit for professional students.\n\nThe crux of the debate centered on which programs qualify as \"professional,\" and the department identified 10 programs, including medicine, dentistry, and law, that would meet its new definition. Post-graduate nursing programs are not included within the professional definition, and the lawmakers wrote that the omission could exacerbate the ongoing nursing shortage.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nThe lawmakers used the example of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000. They said that the proposed $100,000 cap is \"restricting the pipeline of CRNAs and further limiting an anesthesia workforce that is suffering from shortages across all provider types.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, said in a statement that \"misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion\" about the proposed student-loan limits. Keast cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, based on data from the College Scorecard, most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. However, advocates still expressed concern about their implications. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told Business Insider that removing the professional designation for nurses could make it difficult to recruit and retain staff in the industry.\n\n\"It's going to be a really bad revolving issue where we don't have enough faculty to produce enough nurses to replace the nurses who are retiring,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Education is planning to implement these changes beginning in July of 2026, and its proposal is still subject to change based on the comments it receives from the public early next year.",

    "fullText": "After paying $96,000 toward student loans over the past eight years, Sarah from Philadelphia thought she was finally done. She had faithfully repaid both her personal loans and the $50,000 her parents had taken out under Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students to help fund her education.\n\nAt 29 years old, Sarah told her parents she planned to make her final few payments and close the chapter on student debt. But instead of celebrating, her parents dropped a bombshell: they had consolidated the Parent PLUS loans taken out for her and her siblings into one big loan.

You made a promise to pay your part.”\n\nSarah explained that she had been paying her parents $1,000 a month for nearly eight years–money she believed was going toward her $60,000 portion of the Parent PLUS loans. But with her parents combining everything into one pot, she was suddenly on the hook for loans that were never hers.\n\nRamsey encouraged her to take a clear-eyed look at the numbers. “We’re talking about 96 months that you paid $96,000, including 7% interest,” he said. “That means I don't owe anymore. Sorry, Mom and Dad. The rest of it's on you and bro. I did my part.”\n\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

In this case, Sarah went above and beyond. “They're very lucky, honestly, as Parent PLUS holders, that Sarah actually has paid $96,000,” Ramsey said. “Ninety percent of the time I take this phone call, it's the parent griping because the kid has never paid a dime.”\n\nSarah acknowledged that confronting her parents could be tough, especially since they had supported her in other ways growing up. “They changed your diaper, but you don't have to pay them for that,” he said. “That's called being a parent.”\n\nRamsey was sympathetic, but firm: she had fulfilled her moral and financial obligations.

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee executed Harold Wayne Nichols by lethal injection Thursday in Nashville for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nNichols, 64, had confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\n“To the people I've harmed, I'm sorry,” Nichols said in his final statement. Before Nichols died, a spiritual adviser prayed over him in the execution chamber and the two recited together the 23rd Psalm and the Lord's Prayer. At several points, they teared up and their voices became strained. After the final “Amen,” the adviser, J.R. Davis, continued talking quietly, with Nichols nodding along.\n\n“Go in peace, my friend. I love you,” Davis told Nichols.\n\nNichols was strapped to a gurney with a sheet pulled up to just above his waist and a long tube running from an adjoining room to an IV inserted on the inside of his elbow. There was a spot of blood near the injection site. At one point he took a very heavy breath and his whole torso rose up. He then took a series of short, huffing breaths that witnesses said sounded like snorting or snoring. Nichols’ face turned red and he groaned. His breathing then appeared to slow, then stop, and his face became purple before he was pronounced dead.\n\nNichols' sister, Deborah Perry, watched the execution from a witness chamber and cried quietly but did not speak.\n\nNichols’ attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to issue a stay of the execution on Thursday.\n\nPulley's sister, Lisette Monroe, had wanted to be present for the execution but became too overwhelmed, her husband and Pulley's brother-in-law, Jeff Monroe, told media afterwards. He read a statement that said the family “was destroyed by evil” the night Pulley was killed.\n\n“Taking a life is serious, and we take no pleasure in it,” he said. “However, the victims, and there were many, were carefully stalked and attacked. The crimes, and there were many, were deliberate, violent, and horrific.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols' execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she'll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nPulley, who was 20 when she was killed, had just finished Bible college and was attending school in Chattanooga to become a paralegal, Jeff Monroe said.\n\n“Karen was bubbly, happy, selfless, and looking forward to the life before her,” he said.\n\nNichols' attorney, Debbie Drew, also spoke after the execution, saying her client had turned his life over to God after speaking to Pulley's mother decades ago, shortly after he was sentenced. His execution “sent the message that no one can rise beyond the crimes they committed decades earlier and that redemption deserves no mercy,” she said.\n\nDavis said after the execution that he had known Nichols for a decade as part of a prison men's group and believes that Nichols' remorse and spiritual transformation were genuine. Davis said Nichols committed “horrible crimes. But killing to teach people not to kill just doesn't make sense.”\n\nNichols had seen two previous execution dates come and go. The state earlier planned to execute him in August 2020, but Nichols was given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMany states have had difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs as anti-death penalty activists have put pressure on drug companies and other suppliers. Between the shortages and legal challenges over botched executions, some states have moved to alternative methods of execution including a firing squad in South Carolina and nitrogen gas in Alabama.\n\nIncluding Nichols, a total of 46 men have died by court-ordered execution this year in the U.S.\n\nCorrects that Pulley was a student at Chattanooga State Community College.\n\nReporter Adrian Sainz contributed from Memphis, Tennessee.",

    "description": "Trump's administration announced an agreement to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Borrowers would have to transfer to new plans.",
    "fullText": "It's looking like SAVE can't be saved — and it'll mean millions of borrowers could soon face higher monthly payments.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced a settlement with the State of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nSince last summer, SAVE — created by former President Joe Biden — has been paused due to litigation from Missouri and other GOP-led states. The plan was designed to provide affordable monthly payments to the 7 million enrolled borrowers, along with a shorter timeline for loan forgiveness.\n\nIf a court approves the settlement, the department will stop accepting new applications to SAVE, require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan, and resume payments.\n\nThe Trump administration is \"bringing an end to this deceptive scheme,\" Nicholas Kent, the undersecretary of education, said in a statement. \"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back.\"\n\nThe proposed settlement is pending court approval, and borrowers will not face any changes until the court finalizes it. If the settlement is approved, borrowers will have \"a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan and resume repayment.\n\nIn addition to the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE, the Department of Education said that 450,000 borrowers have \"expressed interest in enrolling in the plan\" and will be affected by the settlement, as well.\n\nThe proposed settlement said that the department would deny pending applications and help borrowers transition out of SAVE, and it would undergo negotiated rulemaking — which includes negotiations with stakeholders on the department's proposal — to effectuate the settlement.\n\nThe department did not provide a timeline for the negotiated rulemaking process.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that borrowers who transition out of SAVE will likely face higher monthly payments. She referred to the Repayment Assistance Plan, a new plan the department is set to launch in July 2026, which would allow for loan forgiveness after 30 years.\n\n\"It is less generous in terms of monthly payments, and also to the extent that you have to be in the program longer before you can get forgiveness,\" Fast said.\n\nWhile the department resumed interest charges on SAVE plan accounts in August, enrolled borrowers previously had until 2028 to transition to a new plan. This proposed settlement accelerates that timeline, and it would be a significant undertaking for servicers to carry out, Fast said.\n\nAbby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said that eliminating SAVE \"without access to a clear and affordable alternative is reckless and short-sighted, creating even more needless confusion, uncertainty, and financial stress for millions of Americans already struggling with the rising cost of living.\"\n\n\"In the midst of a national affordability crisis, their way forward is murky and complicated,\" she said.",
