    "fullText": "Paris Hilton shared the secret sauce behind her entrepreneurial success: her ADHD.\n\nThe 44-year-old original influencer, reality star, and founder of a laundry list of business ventures, said on the January 21 episode of \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty\" that her neurodivergent brain helps her \"think outside the box.\"\n\n\"I never wanted to be in one lane. I wanted to create my own lane. And I just have always been someone who just loves to do things and take risks and do things before anyone else,\" she said.\n\nHilton was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and although she struggled to cope with some of the symptoms as a teen, she now calls it her \"superpower.\"\n\n\"I know I would not be the woman I am today or the entrepreneur without it, because it just gives me such drive and curiosity and creativity and having a million ideas all the time, and just my brain just never stops,\" Hilton added.\n\nShe said that she is able to \"hyperfocus\" and enter a flow state when something interests her. \"That's where the magic happens,\" she said.\n\nPeople with ADHD, which stands for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, can have trouble concentrating or sitting still, because their brains work differently to most people. Signs and symptoms can include having high levels of energy, being impulsive, finding it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, and being very talkative.\n\nBefore Hilton was diagnosed with ADHD, she often worried something was \"wrong\" with her, and didn't understand why she struggled at school.\n\n\"No matter how hard I would study or try, I would constantly just not be able to remember things in school, be losing my homework, failing tests,\" she said.\n\nShe also experienced severe emotional pain when she felt rejected or criticized, a condition known as rejection-sensitive dysphoria, which is linked to ADHD.\n\n\"It's exhausting. And it's painful, and it's very difficult to go through,\" she said.\n\nNow, she is spreading the message across her music, documentaries, and media interviews that ADHD can be \"a good thing,\" she added.\n\n\"You can be successful in life, and some of the most creative people I know and brilliant geniuses all have ADHD as well,\" Hilton said.",

    "title": "I flew to Bali for a surf camp. A conversation I had there about failure inspired me to launch a small business.",
    "description": "Gina Jaguttis shared how two solo trips to Bali led her to start her slow fashion business as a side hustle.",
    "fullText": "On a Monday morning in early December, I met Gina Jaguttis as we loaded our surfboards into the camp van just before sunrise. We only got to talking on a choppy boat ride that took us a mile off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe 26-year-old real estate project manager from Munich came to the surf camp to improve her skills on the water. I came to talk with adventurous travelers about their big ideas, from new businesses to life after layoffs.\n\nAt our camp's bonfire that night, she began to tell me why she made a second solo expedition to the tropical island. As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",

    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft, saying he deserves the \"wrongful gains\" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing ​on Friday.\n\nOpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding what ‌was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial ‌against the two companies.\n\n\"Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of the seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,\" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment outside ⁠business hours on the amount of compensation ‌Musk is seeking.\n\nMICROSOFT AND OPENAI ALSO FILE SUITS\n\nDuring the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and part of a \"harassment\" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.\n\nMusk may seek punitive damages and other penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any ‍injunction might take.\n\nIn their own ⁠filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as \"made up,\" \"unverifiable\" and \"unprecedented\" and as seeking an \"implausible\" transfer of billions from a nonprofit ⁠to a former donor-turned-competitor.",

    "title": "When I left the Marines, I struggled to adjust to civilian life. Finding work in the real world was the most challenging.",
    "description": "I left the Marines to become an entrepreneur. While the skills I learned in the military helped my transition, I struggled with civilian work life.",
    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

    "description": "Justine Tello shares the lessons she learned from leaving public relations for teaching, then pivoting to running a small business with her spouse.",
    "fullText": "In July 2024, five years into my career, I made a drastic job switch that I would soon come to regret.\n\nFollowing about a year of disenchantment at my workplace, I left my job at a public relations agency to become a high school English teacher. I took a nearly 36% pay cut.\n\nI wasn't concerned about my paycheck because I desired a more meaningful and impactful role. I soon found myself underprepared and overwhelmed by the switch, and I left my teaching role after my first semester.\n\nAt first, I relied on my savings, my family's support, and my meager earnings as a part-time yoga teacher. My then-boyfriend and I got engaged and were married six months later.\n\nNow, we co-own a small HVAC and electrical company, where I lead the communications and marketing strategy.\n\nI loved getting to know the students and having the opportunity to mentor some of them. I learned many new skills while preparing lessons and grading papers.\n\nWhen it came to my career and my goals, the position didn't align with what I had historically wanted, and I didn't accept the job with a strategy in mind — I accepted it to pursue something new, whether I was prepared for it or not.\n\nTruthfully, I switched careers because I was dissatisfied with my original place of work, feeling stagnant in my personal growth, and lacking interest in my clients' missions. Instead of reframing my perspective or setting a new career goal, I sought a quick escape.\n\nAfter a year of reflection, I've identified three crucial mistakes that led to my unsatisfying career change.\n\nIn my final year at my PR agency, I found myself more easily discouraged by problems that were smaller than I initially perceived, or by those that had been resolved yet still lingered in my mind, like a delayed promotion, company layoffs, and a dissonant relationship with a supervisor.\n\nThese were challenging, but for the most part, I believe that the company and my managers handled problems well, and things began to smooth out over time.\n\nUnfortunately, my attitude toward my workplace remained negative after a handful of poor, back-to-back experiences. Although I was working with several amazing team members and continued to take on tasks I enjoyed, my dissatisfaction with my workplace persisted.\n\nI was burned out and a little lonely. I had been working remotely for over four years, which takes a toll on an extrovert like me, despite spending many evenings and weekends with friends and family. I longed for a position that included in-person connections, and I latched onto the idea that I could only solve my issues by switching to a new workplace.\n\nI halfheartedly applied to new PR jobs, but nothing panned out. I applied for a position as a high school English teacher on the recommendation of a family member, not because teaching was my ultimate passion, but because people are, and it felt like a way to contribute something meaningful.\n\nThe offer letter was framed as a call to something greater, and it felt like I would be filling a role that desperately needed someone. While I longed to have a positive impact on their lives, I also felt an obligation to accept the position.\n\nIf I could step back in time to the middle of my discontent in my PR role, I would try to reframe my perspective and approach my job with a different attitude. Every job can be impactful and meaningful if approached with the perspective of doing your best for yourself and for others.\n\nIf I still found my PR job no longer a fit and longed to have a greater impact on the world, the next step shouldn't have been to bail, but rather to determine clear career goals that aligned with my personal values and mission.\n\nI tried to pursue a shiny, new calling rather than develop a solid career plan. It didn't work out because I gave significant weight to one over the other, but the two can fit hand in hand.\n\nIt's better to approach a career change intentionally and with an overarching goal, rather than latching onto a new idea and pursuing it blindly. Oftentimes, it's frightening to define our goals and a solid plan, because we feel that once we decide on a direction, we can never change our path. That's inaccurate.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would've drawn up a clear plan — perhaps including multiple potential pathways — before switching fields. If the desire to teach high school English was lying dormant somewhere inside my heart, it surely would've made itself known in a new-career-ideas brainstorm.\n\nI would recommend that anyone looking to discover their true passion or calling jot down a mix of their skills and interests, and then research which jobs align with both. If a new career of interest arises, pursue it intentionally by identifying existing or gaining new relevant experience and by connecting with people in the field.\n\nI quit my teaching role because of long work hours, emotional exhaustion, and a sense that I was operating in a silo. A few other teachers occasionally offered me encouragement or advice, but I was still required to create curricula from scratch and develop my lessons on my own.\n\nWhile I would like to change some of my past career choices, I don't regret the lessons I learned and the students and coworkers I met.\n\nI'm grateful to have had the opportunity to discover more about myself through this process — to see where I can change my attitude, set new goals, and achieve greater things in the future. Every failure is a learning experience, and I'll try to make this one count.",

    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",
