    "fullText": "A $20 aspirin doesn't happen by accident. It happens by design.\n\nMark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and co-founder of Cost Plus Drugs, is not new to healthcare disruption. His pharmaceutical company was built on a simple premise: show the cost, add a transparent markup, and publish it. So when he returned to his blog \"Blog Maverick\" last year with a post titled \"A Few Words On Healthcare,\" he wasn't just offering commentary. He was expanding that same pricing philosophy to the entire $5 trillion U.S. healthcare system.\n\nHe opened plainly. \"I haven't published anything on here in a long, long time.. Thought it would be fun to start up again,\" he wrote. What followed was a direct critique of how money moves through medicine.\n\n\"Healthcare is a very simple industry made complicated,\" Cuban wrote.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nThis Energy Storage Company Already Has $185M in Contracts—Shares Are Still Available\n\nHe clarified that he was not attacking innovation. \"I'm not talking about the relentless search for better ways to care for patients,\" he wrote. \"Whether its surgery robotics or better bandaids, the quest to improve care is vitally important.\" The issue, he stated, is financial engineering. \"What I'm referring to is the complication of the industry in search of margin dollars.\"\n\nCuban framed the conversation with a straightforward question. \"What Should it Look Like?\"\n\nHis answer stripped the system down to its bones.\n\n\"Hypothetically, It should look like 1955,\" he wrote. \"Patients go to providers for care. Providers provide that care. Patients get a bill and if they can afford it, they pay that bill. That's it.\"\n\nThat simplicity leads directly to what he calls the defining issue. \"The ONLY question in healthcare should be ‘How should care for people who can't afford to pay for their care be paid?'\"\n\nIn Cuban's view, every reform, regulation and reimbursement formula should orbit that single question.\n\nCuban cited total U.S. healthcare spending at roughly $5 trillion and proposed working backward. \"Before we start that discussion, let's do a very, very simple back of the envelope discussion of the cost of healthcare in this country,\" he wrote. \"So call me a dreamer.\"\n\nHis first lever is transparency, but not the standard version of posting procedure prices. That, he argued, fails because \"everyone bundles and upcodes and plays games in order to extract as much revenue from whoever is paying as possible.\"",

    "description": "Marc Bowker, a small business owner, said Trump continues to cause uncertainty for small businesses after Supreme Court tariff ruling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marc Bowker, owner of Alter Ego Comics, a comic book shop in Lima, Ohio, after the Supreme Court overturned some of President Donald Trump's tariffs. This story has been edited for length a clarity.\n\nMy first reaction to the Supreme Court decision was, \"This is awesome and long overdue.\" The second was, \"Okay, what's next?\"\n\nThen I saw the president say there would now be a new 10% global tariff and that the Supreme Court justices who ruled against him are unpatriotic and unloyal. So it feels like this is going to drag on forever and ever until he gets his way. It's like death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\nI think there are more questions remaining than answers. I appreciate the Supreme Court siding with Americans and American businesses, but it feels like it's going to be a tug-of-war that may go on throughout this entire administration.\n\nThis administration has created a level of uncertainty in the small business landscape that I haven't seen in 23 years of owning my store.\n\nIn addition to being a small-business owner in America, I'm a consumer in America, so I'm paying more for everything that my family consumes, from food to physical products. It's a one-two punch for us.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet of every shipment that had a tariff charge, and as of today, we've paid over $12,000 since Trump started all of this.\n\nWe've had to pass on a percentage of that to our customers, and as a result, we've seen a slowdown in orders. Some are taking a wait-and-see mentality, or they just don't want to pay the extra fee.\n\nComics themselves — a lot of which are printed in Canada — have not been impacted by tariffs. But for me and for other comic book stores, action figures, board games, and comic book supplies, like storage items, are being impacted. Action figures account for about 65% of my shop's revenue, and they are made in China.\n\nA lot of these orders are made far in advance, too. We were being charged tariffs on items ordered in 2023 and 2024. There's stuff I need to order next week that ships in June of 2027. Is the tariff going to be 6%? Is it going to be zero? Is it going to be 100%? I have no idea.\n\nAs for the tariff costs small businesses have already paid, are we getting that back? Probably not. Are the corporations that paid the bulk of the tariffs going to be reimbursed? Where does that come from? I feel like this is just going to cause more paperwork, more red tape, more headaches. I don't know what the next step is.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, yes, there would be some reimbursement of the fees that all American businesses have had to pay. If I had to settle for something, it would be that, effective today, there are no more of these Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's hard to be excited about the Supreme Court ruling when, within hours, the White House says it's going to push back with more tariffs.\n\nThe administration is throwing so much at us every day that we can't make any progress. It's hard to see what the future will look like.\n\nI would hate to see this stretch on the next three years of the administration. It's going to take all this extra time that could be spent running our businesses and serving our customers, just trying to stop the government from getting its hands in our pockets.\n\nIt really feels like our elected officials are not listening to us. Historically, the Republican Party has been promoted as the party of business in the United States. If they truly were, they would be listening to constituents who are saying these tariffs are hurting our businesses.",

    "description": "Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024, but there’s a price.",
    "fullText": "A new analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute reveals that while aggressive trade policies implemented in 2025 have successfully driven a significant wedge between midsize American businesses and Chinese suppliers, the decoupling has come with a staggering price tag for U.S. companies.\n\nThe report, titled “Tracking international payments: How are midsize firms reacting to tariffs?” paints a picture of a business sector that is bending but not breaking under historic pressure. According to JPMorgan banking data on financial outflows of firms with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, the cost of importing goods has skyrocketed—and American companies are bearing the brunt.\n\nWhere are U.S. companies sourcing imports instead of China?\n\nHow much have tariff payments increased for midsize firms?\n\nWhat long-term risks do these trade policies pose?\n\nWhy are midsize firms particularly vulnerable to tariff impacts?\n\nWhile these companies scramble for alternative sources to Chinese manufacturing, they’re paying a big price on imports. Following the implementation of tariff rate increases and new universal tariffs in April 2025, monthly tariff payments by these midsize firms have tripled compared with early 2025 levels.\n\nIf the primary objective of the trade policy was to reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing, the banking giant’s data suggests the strategy is working. Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024.\n\nHowever, this retreat from China has not signaled a retreat from the global economy. Instead of reshoring operations entirely, American businesses appear to be engaging in a costly game of musical chairs.\n\nThe report finds that while payments to China fell, outflows to other regions—specifically Southeast Asia, Japan, and India—have accelerated. This evidence points to “import substitution,” where U.S. firms rush to find alternative suppliers in friendly nations to bypass the steepest levies placed on Beijing.\n\nThe JPMorgan researchers warn that while trade volumes have remained stable, the financial health of these companies may be at risk. Midsize firms are uniquely vulnerable; they are often too large to fly under the regulatory radar but “lack the scale to absorb sustained cost increases” compared with massive multinational corporations.\n\nThe burden of these new taxes has been particularly uneven. While the “universal tariffs” announced in April 2025 did capture new firms that previously paid no duties, the JPMorgan analysis found that the vast majority of the surge in government revenue came from firms that were already paying tariffs. Essentially, the policy has intensified the financial pressure on existing importers rather than spreading the cost widely across new players.",

He argued that the era of “static” tools—where businesses must bend their workflows to fit a software's limitations—is rapidly ending.\n\n\"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization,\" Cuban stated, citing a shift where AI models mold themselves around specific business needs in real time.\n\nThis AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Costly Ad Mistakes — See Why Investors Are Paying Attention\n\nOwn the Characters, Not Just the Content: Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company\n\nHe noted that even industry titans like Microsoft Corp.

    "description": "The \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star and entrepreneur, Bethenny Frankel, is among wealthy Americans to move to Florida from cultural hubs like New York City and LA.",
    "fullText": "The former \"Real Housewives of New York City\" star Bethenny Frankel built her public persona in the Big Apple, but after moving to Florida in 2025, she says the Sunshine State is the new cultural hub for America's rich and famous.\n\n\"Miami is the new LA,\" Frankel, 55, told Business Insider. \"In the way that LA was the cool place to be, and aspirational people wanted to be there.\"\n\nLast March, the reality TV veteran, entrepreneur, and social media influencer joined a wave of New Yorkers relocating to South Florida, settling on the coast with her teenage daughter.\n\nShe's one of many Americans leaving cultural hubs like New York and Los Angeles for smaller cities in the Sun Belt. A January 2026 Bank of America Institute study on US migration found that New York recorded the second-largest population loss of any US city in the fourth quarter of 2025, after Los Angeles. About 45% of outbound New Yorkers headed southward, with Miami alone accounting for 7% of departures.\n\n\"It's also cool to be in New York,\" Frankel said, \"but not as much as being in Miami, and Florida in general.\"\n\nAmong the Florida arrivals is a number of billionaires. Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Glenview Capital Management's CEO, Larry Robbins, have all relocated from northern cities to Florida's warmer shores in the past four years.\n\n\"Rich people are moving down here,\" said Frankel, who runs the private membership dating community The Core. \"Miami's exploded, real-estate-wise.\"\n\nData backs that up. Realtor.com's December 2025 Luxury Housing Report found that the Miami metro area had the highest number of million-dollar listings in the country, snatching a title that had traditionally been held by New York. More than a quarter of demand in the Miami metro region originated from the New York metro area, the report found.\n\nFrankel said the influx of new wealth has changed Miami's cultural landscape. \"It means shopping, art, nightlife, the real-estate cool factor,\" she said. \"Everybody went where the money is. The money is dictating what's happening on social media, and what's happening that's cool.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Lucia Moses reported in December that Miami is emerging as a hub for social media influencers. It had the highest number of top Instagram creators per capita of any US city, ahead of New York and LA.\n\nFlorida's draw in recent years, however, has extended beyond just billionaires and social-media influencers. Business Insider previously reported that differences in tax policy and cost of living meant that someone earning $150,000 a year could save roughly $50,000 annually by moving from New York City to Miami, largely due to Florida's lack of state income tax.\n\nFor Frankel, the move offered more than that. She said it has made her \"more social\" and allowed her to run her businesses from the \"sunniest and most beautiful-weathered place.\"\n\nWhile Florida has drawn in large numbers of domestic migrants since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Miami has begun to hemorrhage residents. The Bank of America Institute study found that Miami recorded the third-largest domestic population decline among US cities in the fourth quarter of 2025, with many residents relocating to more affordable parts of Florida, including Orlando and Tampa.\n\nIn Frankel's views, the whole state is having a moment. \"Delray, Palm Beach, Boca, Miami, the Design District,\" she said. \"Florida is on fire.\"",

    "fullText": "Entrepreneur and reality TV star Kimora Lee Simmons has spent around five years living in a legally contested $25 million Beverly Hills mansion purchased by her estranged husband with money he stole from 1MDB — a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at the heart of one of the world’s largest multibillion-dollar frauds in history, The Post can reveal.\n\nSimmons has not made mortgage or rent payments in that time, per court docs, and she’s allegedly refusing to vacate the house.\n\nShe is claiming that her estranged husband, disgraced banker Tim Leissner, sold the property fraudulently and without authority to real estate moguls the Reuben brothers.\n\nThe seven-bedroom estate, which sits on 3.7 acres in the heart of Beverly Hills, can be seen, at least from the outside, in her current reality show, “Kimora: Back in the Fab Lane”.\n\nBut what will happen to the property remains unclear as the legal dispute enters its fifth year.\n\nThe ongoing civil dispute over possession, title and liability stems from the distressed refinancing and sale-leaseback of the luxury property.\n\nA trial-setting conference is slated for Feb. 25. (Leissner has yet to comment, or actively participate in the case, although he was personally served in New York on Aug. 14.)\n\nIt all comes as Leissner, a German national, surrendered to federal prison in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 6 — eight years after he pleaded guilty for his role in the $4.5 billion fraud. Simmons has also been in the news, promoting her show.\n\nIn 2022, Leissner testified under oath that he bought the property, at 25 Beverly Park Circle, with $25 million that had been stolen from the Malaysian people.\n\nHe gave the testimony as the government’s star witness in the criminal trial of his former Goldman Sachs colleague Roger Ng in federal court in Brooklyn. Ng is currently serving a 10-year jail sentence for his role. There is no evidence or suggestion that Simmons was involved in 1MDB.\n\nNo one disputes that the $25 million Beverly Hills home was bought with stolen 1MDB money in 2017.\n\nBut the fact that Leissner did not have to forfeit the mansion is unusual — and it leaves the door open for Malaysia to demand it back from its current owners, along with any other assets that Leissner bought with stolen money, sources told The Post. And he has quite a few.\n\nThe massive fraud began in 2009 with the creation of a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Within days, $700 million had been siphoned out of it. That year, a Wharton dropout named Jho Low — described by US and international investigators and prosecutors as the fraud’s architect — began buying trophy real estate in Manhattan with stolen cash and throwing money around New York City clubs.\n\nThe Post was the first publication to mention Low by name, pointing out his high-rolling ways, which caught the eye of investigators, sources later told The Post.\n\nLow, who remains a fugitive, maintains his innocence but gave up around $700 million in assets to the DOJ without admitting guilt. He still faces criminal charges in the Eastern District of New York for money laundering and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, and in DC for illegal campaign contributions.\n\nBut “if Low was 1MDB’s architect, Leissner was its engineer,” another source told The Post.\n\nThe six-year fraud — which benefited Malaysia’s then-Prime Minister Najib Razak, Low and others — was ultimately investigated by 10 different countries. And Leissner was arrested for his part in June 2018.\n\nAs the judge in Ng’s case said, “Leissner admitted to efforts to move and hide assets, including ownership of his entities like Keyway [the holding company for the Beverly Hills mansion] out of apparent concern the US government would seek to disgorge the Property as restitution.”\n\nThe Beverly Hills home is also unusual because other trophy real estate assets bought with stolen 1MDB cash have been seized — like Low’s New York and LA properties, including a $30.55 million condo on Columbus Circle.\n\nAnother penthouse, in Walker Tower at 212 W. 18th St., was bought for a record $51 million purchase in 2014 by Khadem al Qubaisi, who who was implicated in the fraud and is now in prison. The property was seized and sold by the US government for a paltry $18 million in 2020.\n\nCelebrities who were gifted pricey assets bought with stolen 1MDB money were also asked by the US government to return them in a record civil asset forfeiture case, and they did — mostly.\n\nTo date, the government has successfully recovered and repatriated around $1.4 billion to Malaysia — the largest recovery in DOJ history.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, for example, returned a Picasso and a Basquiat worth a combined $12.2 million and Marlon Brando’s Oscar, worth $600,000, all gifted to him by Low with 1MDB money.\n\nBut Simmons’ home remains an outlier — and is now the subject of this messy court case.\n\nLeissner claimed in court in Ng’s 2022 trial that he sold his assets to Newland, a Hong Kong-based company.\n\nBut sources say Newland may have been a front company.\n\nIn November 2020, Leissner’s LLC, Keyway Pride, held by Newland, sold the Beverly Hills property to the billionaire brothers and real estate moguls David Reuben and Simon Reuben, after interest on a $12 million mortgage he had taken out to cover “living expenses” was not paid, according to a source with knowledge of the deal. The Reuben brothers declined to comment.\n\nAs part of the deal, Leissner and Simmons were also to pay $67,000 a month to continue to live in the property, according to court documents.\n\nHowever, Simmons “has been [living] there since November 2020 and no rent has been paid to date,” a source with knowledge of the deal told The Post.\n\nWhile Simmons later challenged the sale and leaseback of the property, in October 2020 she allegedly signed a Keyway resolution authorizing it, although she says her signature was procured through misrepresentation and abuse of trust by Leissner, according to the defendants’ complaint, filed in January 2021 — two months after the home sold to the Reuben brothers.\n\nSimmons’ lawyers and reps did not return requests for comment, nor did Leissner’s lawyer. In court testimony in the Ng case, Leissner said he continued to reside in the home after his 2018 arrest — he and Simmons have a 10-year-old son — but did not specify when he left.\n\nThe estranged couple no longer live together, sources say, adding that neither Leissner nor Simmons “have paid a penny” to live there.\n\nIn January 2021, Simmons filed a lawsuit in a Beverly Hills court. The ongoing case is between cross-defendants and plaintiffs Keyway Pride, Leissner and Simmons; and cross-plaintiffs and defendants 25 Beverly Park Circle Propco LLC, Cantervale Limited and Chicago Title Company.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Simmons claimed that the new owners of the house — the Reuben brothers — illegally bought the Beverly Hills house, because it was bought without her permission.\n\nNone of this drama, however, is part of Simmons’ new reality show, “Kimora: Back in the Fab Lane,” which features at least the exterior of the Beverly Hills home. In a clip promoting the E! reality series, she says: “My name is Kimora and I am a hoarder — but a luxury hoarder,” as she shows off her collection of 698 luxury handbags.\n\nSimmons once posted on social media about her friendship with Rosmah Mansor, the diamond-collecting, handbag-stockpiling wife of ex-Prime Minister Najib. Mansor has been compared to Imelda Marcos for the way she amasses luxury goods bought with stolen money. Simmons’ handbag collection is even larger than Mansor’s — although there is no suggestion Simmons’ was bought with stolen money.\n\nThat was not the case for Mansor. In May 2018, police seized her collection of 567 luxury handbags, shortly after Najib’s coalition lost the general election. Police were seen loading five trucks with orange Hermès boxes. Many of the handbags were ultimately returned; others were auctioned by the government, according to reports.",

    "fullText": "The federal Small Business Administration suspended more than 111,000 California borrowers after uncovering $8.6 billion in suspected fraudulent activity linked to the COVID pandemic, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced Friday.\n\n\"We have suspended nearly 112,000 borrowers tied to at least $9 billion in suspected fraud,\" Loeffler said in a press release on Friday. \"This staggering number represents the most significant crack-down on those who defrauded pandemic programs, and it illuminates the scale of corruption that the Biden Administration tolerated for years.\"\n\nThe SBA reported that all in, it suspended 111,620 California borrowers who received 118,489 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loans, totaling $8.6 billion.\n\nThe Border Gets The Attention While Fraudulent Government Benefits Bleed Taxpayers Dry\n\nPPP loans were a COVID-era federal relief program that gave small businesses money to keep workers on the payroll, while EIDL loans are part of an SBA program that provides low-interest disaster relief loans to help businesses survive during times of diaster, including the pandemic.\n\n\"Once again, the Trump SBA is taking decisive action to deliver accountability in a state whose unaccountable welfare policies have created a culture of fraud and abuse at the expense of law-abiding taxpayers and small business owners,\" Loffler continued.\n\nChildcare Expert Exposes Key Roadblock To Uncovering Potential Fraud Schemes In Minnesota: 'Really Difficult'\n\nThe announcement follows California Attorney General Rob Bonta saying on Thursday that the Trump administration was promoting \"baseless claims\" of persistent fraud in the state.\n\n\"Trump claims California is wasting money when, in reality, our programs are helping lower-income individuals and lower-income families get healthcare, food and housing assistance,\" Bonta said on Thursday.\n\n\"Trump claims, wrongly, California is perpetuating fraud when we are the victim,\" he added.\n\nBonta's office noted that California has recovered nearly $2.7 billion in various fraud schemes across the last 10 years, \"including by partnering with the federal government.\"\n\nExclusive: Senate Bill Targets Minnesota-style ‘Runaway Fraud’ To Force Scammers Repay Taxpayers\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Bonta's office on Friday for additional comment.\n\nNewsom's office directed Fox News Digital to the Governor Newsom Press Office X account, which mocked the SBA announcement.\n\n\"OMG. The Trump Administration found MAJOR FRAUD in programs THEY control, Newsom's Press Office's X account posted, linking to a New York Post exclusive on the announcement.\n\n\"The state has no role running / administering these programs.Were they hiding this??? California doesn’t hide fraud … we fight it. Nearly 1,000 arrests + over $125 billion STOPPED under @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom.\"\n\nLoeffler continued that the alleged California fraud comes after the SBA suspended 6,900 borrowers in Minnesota associated with 7,900 potentially fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans, which totaled roughly $400 million.\n\n\"As we did in Minnesota, we are actively working with federal law enforcement to identify the criminals who defrauded American taxpayers, hold them to account, and recoup the stolen funds. As we continue our state-by-state work, our message is clear: pandemic-era fraudsters will not get a pass under this Administration,\" Loeffler said, comparing California to its investigations in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota became ground zero for welfare and social services fraud surrounding the pandemic late in 2025, when investigators uncovered sweeping fraud schemes that could top $9 billion.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "description": "An entrepreneur has ripped up the non-league rulebook since buying a football club.",
    "fullText": "Barrie Drewitt-Barlow is used to exploring the unknown.\n\nHe and his ex-husband Tony made headlines in 1999 when they became one of the first gay couples in the UK to have children through a surrogate mother.\n\nMore recently, the entrepreneur let a stranger live in his house for a reality show and has appeared on other shows such as Rich House, Poor House and Below Deck Sailing Yacht.\n\nWhat he never dreamed of doing was becoming the owner of a football club.\n\n\"I was the one who would sit on my laptop doing work when it ever came on the TV, or I'd go out,\" he says.\n\nBut now the 55-year-old cannot get enough of the beautiful game.\n\nIt has been a year since he completed a multi-million pound deal to purchase Essex-based Maldon and Tiptree Football Club.\n\n\"The offside rule still doesn't make any sense to me,\" he concedes.\n\n\"Every now and then when I see the whistle going from the ref or the linespeople, I just don't get it. I'm like, 'What's happened? Why has he stopped playing?'\n\n\"I almost thought they were doing a Morris dancing kind of thing with their flags at one point. It's not what I expected.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow grew up on a council estate in Manchester before moving to Essex and making a fortune in property.\n\nAcquiring Maldon and Tiptree FC in February 2025 marked his latest business venture.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow quickly oversaw the signing of some big names, including ex-West Ham United striker Freddie Sears and and the Zimbabwe international and former Colchester United, Leyton Orient and Southend United attacker Macauley Bonne.\n\nKevin Horlock, who once played for Manchester City, West Ham and Ipswich Town, was brought in as manager.\n\nThe arrivals made waves in the local football scene, as the Isthmian League North side, founded in 1946, are in the eighth tier of English football.\n\nIt was all the same to Drewitt-Barlow though.\n\nHe says: \"As a novice, you look at football and you see these crazy salaries from these big Premier League people - £300,000 a week – and it's not like that in this league.\n\n\"A lot of people still work regular jobs, this is a part-time thing for them.\n\n\"I didn't realise that kind of thing happened. I thought if you were a footballer, you're a footballer - you weren't a black cab driver or a roofer as well.\n\n\"But people have real lives and real jobs, that was the hardest thing for me to work out.\"\n\nAnother reality check for Drewitt-Barlow, who lives in Danbury, Essex, was the FA Cup.\n\nA series of impressive wins surged the Jammers into the first round proper of the prestigious English tournament.\n\nThere they faced Port Vale: a League One side who were 99 places above them in the footballing pyramid.\n\nWhat happened during the lead-up to the match quickly changed Drewitt-Barlow's entire outlook on the game.\n\n\"I'd heard about the FA Cup but I didn't understand the importance of it,\" he explains.\n\n\"I agreed with the FA to let the cup come here for an evening and I tell you now, the queues were round the block, down the street, for people to come in and see a piece of tin.\n\n\"It's like what the hell, people are actually that interested in this cup? Well, oh my God, they were.\n\n\"They were literally queuing, grown guys with their kids, waiting outside to come in and have a photograph taken with the FA Cup.\n\n\"Honestly, we felt the magic that night,\" he adds.\n\nIt was not just the excitement that Drewitt-Barlow, now club chief executive, was surprised by - it was the cash too.\n\nThe Jammers' match was chosen for TV coverage, earning them what he said was about £100,000.\n\nThe club also took half of the money earned on the gate, of which there were 4,551 fans in attendance, and won £15,800 in prize money for making it to the first round.\n\n\"I felt like all our Christmases came together with that FA Cup run,\" Drewitt-Barlow adds.\n\nEven before the match, which Maldon and Tiptree went on to lose 5-1, people were already talking about the businessman - who had been filmed during the cup draw.\n\n\"When it was announced on the TV I was like, 'Where the hell is Port Vale?',\" he recalls.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow has embraced becoming the pantomime villain on the terraces, but being targeted for his sexuality is where he draws the line.\n\n\"It's difficult on the terraces still,\" he says. \"That's where the bite comes from.\"\n\n\"There's still a massive stigma about being gay in football, but as time goes on those boundaries should break down.\n\n\"I don't mind being the whipping boy. They can call me all the names under the sun, I really couldn't give a flying hoot.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow claims to have been approached by footballers - three of which he says are currently playing in the Premier League - who are hiding being gay.\n\nHe is happy to help, but insists he does not want to become \"the poster boy for gay footballing\".\n\n\"I've already been classed as the poster boy for gay parenting or surrogacy and it doesn't get anybody anywhere,\" he adds.\n\n\"I don't think people want to [come out] because they're scared about what might happen in the dressing room, as well as on the pitch.\n\n\"I think the only people that can truly help and make it more normalised are the leagues and the FA.\"\n\nAway from the terraces, Drewitt-Barlow has been kept busy with renovations.\n\nFrom the clubhouse to the changing rooms, he has led an expensive overhaul of the facilities, which he described as \"semi-derelict\" when he arrived.\n\nEven purchasing grass for each goalmouth set him back £40,000.\n\nIt is very much a family operation, with husband Scott and son Aspen also overseeing the project.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow says: \"It was unloved, the place was tired. It needed somebody to come in, give it some love and show it some attention - and that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nUnder his stewardship, he claims Maldon and Tiptree have gone from attracting 70 spectators to an average crowd of 800.\n\n\"There's a lot of players who want to come here now, big players,\" he boasts.\n\n\"I can't walk around Tesco now without somebody telling me who we should be employing as a footballer.\"\n\nThe chief executive wants to take his club, which is in second place, into the English Football League and is chasing back-to-back promotions.\n\nHe reveals half the squad are being paid full-time, while the other half remain part-time.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow believes his club is now sustainable and will end the year in profit, boosted by the launch of a BTEC sports course in September.\n\nBut does he feel tired after his first year in football?\n\n\"Honestly, it's given me a fresh lease of life, I feel regenerated. I can't believe I didn't do this sooner,\" Drewitt-Barlow says.\n\n\"People love football, I never got it before now. I just did not get what people saw in football.\n\n\"Now I get it, I totally get it.\"\n\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nZimbabwe's Bonne leaves Maldon & Tiptree\n\nJammers boss enjoying first FA Cup run\n\nProspective owners 'plan to rebuild club's ground'",

    "description": "ICE activity and tariffs are making for an especially tough month for Perennial Cycle in Minneapolis. The owner is focusing on the community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luke Breen, co-owner of specialty bike shop Perennial Cycle in uptown Minneapolis. The following conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nPerennial is a specialty bike shop. We do cargo bikes, city utility bikes, and commuting bikes, and have been a niche business for 33 years.\n\nPerennial focuses on community events. Last year, we did 35 organized community rides. So, while we do rely on selling bikes, we're very community-driven. That's always been a big piece of Perennial Cycle.\n\nYou cannot be in Minneapolis without ICE's presence impacting your day-to-day. You just simply cannot. Imagine: We had to shut down our schools to keep children safe. It is insane what is happening right now.\n\nAs a bike shop, we've had meetings so we can be aware of each other's levels of anxiety — how we're doing, is everybody OK? For some people, it's going to affect them a little differently, and we've come up with a plan for if ICE is on the block.\n\nWe were closed on Friday, January 23, for the ICE OUT protest. To me, it's a big ask to have small businesses go on strike, and later I heard that it was the first general strike in 80 years. I'm really glad that Perennial did that.\n\nI also went to the march in downtown Minneapolis last Friday afternoon and was a little overwhelmed with emotions. I had no idea how massive it was. When you're in a march like that, you can kind of see the few thousand people that are around you. It isn't until later when you see those overhead videos posted online, and it's like, 'Oh my God.'\n\nIt had an amazing vibe. There was not a lot to cheer about, and yet there's a lot to be together about. It took a lot of awesome organizing to pull that off. There were restaurants that were handing out food. There were tables with cases and cases and cases of hand warmers. It was minus 10 when I went down there, and the wind was blowing. I did not expect that many people because it was so cold.\n\nWe held a fundraiser for MIRAC, a local immigrant rights organization, scheduled for Sunday. I talked with Brieanna, the artist and screenprinter I am working with. We considered canceling. Brieanna and I decided that canceling is exactly what ICE would want us to do. We did not cancel the event.\n\nThere was a line outside the door that was a half-block long at one point. Tons of people showed up. Everybody was just happy to be part of the community. A couple of legal observers explained what it's like to be an observer, knowing that lots of people are very curious about it, but it's pretty intimidating when you just go by what you're seeing on the news and on Instagram. That was part of the aim of the fundraiser: to foster observer conversations.\n\nWe raised over $4,000. We brought in, I don't know, probably like 20 grocery bags of food for a food shelf. All those things were great, but the most appreciation came from people saying they were happy to be together, happy to have a place to go and be around other people who were kind of in mourning.\n\nWe had little cheat sheets with information about the event that we handed out when visitors walked in the door. One of the things was, \"Yes, we're a bike shop Monday through Saturday, but today we're not. Please don't ask us questions about bikes.\" We just didn't have the capacity to do bike stuff.\n\nThere were plenty of people at the fundraiser who weren't familiar with the bike shop. But plenty of people who were like, \"Wow, this is kind of weird. Why is this happening in a bike shop?\" And that was kind of fun explaining that, actually, this is very normal because we focus on community events. We have Cambros containers for serving coffee to 100 people. We have serving trays for treats. We have all the things that are necessary to organize an event like this. The bike shop actually already has the musicians who were singing.\n\nIt's off-season for me. I am really happy to have found a place to plug in to be useful during what's happening in Minneapolis right now. Numerous people came up and thanked me for opening the shop and doing the fundraiser. Most of the kind words were about community and not about raising money.\n\nHopefully, the shop will make it through, but honestly, it is a real challenge.\n\nOur city's under siege, but in reality, we all know it's our country that's under siege. We know a lot of people are super challenged by what's going on right now. I sell pretty expensive bicycles. These cargo bikes are not cheap. So for me, the tariffs have completely turned my life upside down. I'm learning that there is a plural for the word crisis, and it's crises. And that's what I'm looking at — one crisis on top of another.\n\nI have high seasons and low seasons. It's a low season, so I have to be very protective with my money right now. Any loss of income is a big deal because we're barely going to cover expenses for the month. This is a typical cycle for a business in Minnesota, a very seasonal business, so none of that is overwhelming. But, yeah, that's why the strike was definitely a big ask, and I'm so happy I did it. I believe that the store will reap rewards on the other side of this.",

    "fullText": "Paris Hilton shared the secret sauce behind her entrepreneurial success: her ADHD.\n\nThe 44-year-old original influencer, reality star, and founder of a laundry list of business ventures, said on the January 21 episode of \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty\" that her neurodivergent brain helps her \"think outside the box.\"\n\n\"I never wanted to be in one lane. I wanted to create my own lane. And I just have always been someone who just loves to do things and take risks and do things before anyone else,\" she said.\n\nHilton was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and although she struggled to cope with some of the symptoms as a teen, she now calls it her \"superpower.\"\n\n\"I know I would not be the woman I am today or the entrepreneur without it, because it just gives me such drive and curiosity and creativity and having a million ideas all the time, and just my brain just never stops,\" Hilton added.\n\nShe said that she is able to \"hyperfocus\" and enter a flow state when something interests her. \"That's where the magic happens,\" she said.\n\nPeople with ADHD, which stands for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, can have trouble concentrating or sitting still, because their brains work differently to most people. Signs and symptoms can include having high levels of energy, being impulsive, finding it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, and being very talkative.\n\nBefore Hilton was diagnosed with ADHD, she often worried something was \"wrong\" with her, and didn't understand why she struggled at school.\n\n\"No matter how hard I would study or try, I would constantly just not be able to remember things in school, be losing my homework, failing tests,\" she said.\n\nShe also experienced severe emotional pain when she felt rejected or criticized, a condition known as rejection-sensitive dysphoria, which is linked to ADHD.\n\n\"It's exhausting. And it's painful, and it's very difficult to go through,\" she said.\n\nNow, she is spreading the message across her music, documentaries, and media interviews that ADHD can be \"a good thing,\" she added.\n\n\"You can be successful in life, and some of the most creative people I know and brilliant geniuses all have ADHD as well,\" Hilton said.",

    "description": "Gina Jaguttis shared how two solo trips to Bali led her to start her slow fashion business as a side hustle.",
    "fullText": "On a Monday morning in early December, I met Gina Jaguttis as we loaded our surfboards into the camp van just before sunrise. We only got to talking on a choppy boat ride that took us a mile off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe 26-year-old real estate project manager from Munich came to the surf camp to improve her skills on the water. I came to talk with adventurous travelers about their big ideas, from new businesses to life after layoffs.\n\nAt our camp's bonfire that night, she began to tell me why she made a second solo expedition to the tropical island. As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",

    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft, saying he deserves the \"wrongful gains\" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing ​on Friday.\n\nOpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding what ‌was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial ‌against the two companies.\n\n\"Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of the seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,\" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment outside ⁠business hours on the amount of compensation ‌Musk is seeking.\n\nMICROSOFT AND OPENAI ALSO FILE SUITS\n\nDuring the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and part of a \"harassment\" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.\n\nMusk may seek punitive damages and other penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any ‍injunction might take.\n\nIn their own ⁠filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as \"made up,\" \"unverifiable\" and \"unprecedented\" and as seeking an \"implausible\" transfer of billions from a nonprofit ⁠to a former donor-turned-competitor.",

    "description": "I left the Marines to become an entrepreneur. While the skills I learned in the military helped my transition, I struggled with civilian work life.",
    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

    "description": "Justine Tello shares the lessons she learned from leaving public relations for teaching, then pivoting to running a small business with her spouse.",
    "fullText": "In July 2024, five years into my career, I made a drastic job switch that I would soon come to regret.\n\nFollowing about a year of disenchantment at my workplace, I left my job at a public relations agency to become a high school English teacher. I took a nearly 36% pay cut.\n\nI wasn't concerned about my paycheck because I desired a more meaningful and impactful role. I soon found myself underprepared and overwhelmed by the switch, and I left my teaching role after my first semester.\n\nAt first, I relied on my savings, my family's support, and my meager earnings as a part-time yoga teacher. My then-boyfriend and I got engaged and were married six months later.\n\nNow, we co-own a small HVAC and electrical company, where I lead the communications and marketing strategy.\n\nI loved getting to know the students and having the opportunity to mentor some of them. I learned many new skills while preparing lessons and grading papers.\n\nWhen it came to my career and my goals, the position didn't align with what I had historically wanted, and I didn't accept the job with a strategy in mind — I accepted it to pursue something new, whether I was prepared for it or not.\n\nTruthfully, I switched careers because I was dissatisfied with my original place of work, feeling stagnant in my personal growth, and lacking interest in my clients' missions. Instead of reframing my perspective or setting a new career goal, I sought a quick escape.\n\nAfter a year of reflection, I've identified three crucial mistakes that led to my unsatisfying career change.\n\nIn my final year at my PR agency, I found myself more easily discouraged by problems that were smaller than I initially perceived, or by those that had been resolved yet still lingered in my mind, like a delayed promotion, company layoffs, and a dissonant relationship with a supervisor.\n\nThese were challenging, but for the most part, I believe that the company and my managers handled problems well, and things began to smooth out over time.\n\nUnfortunately, my attitude toward my workplace remained negative after a handful of poor, back-to-back experiences. Although I was working with several amazing team members and continued to take on tasks I enjoyed, my dissatisfaction with my workplace persisted.\n\nI was burned out and a little lonely. I had been working remotely for over four years, which takes a toll on an extrovert like me, despite spending many evenings and weekends with friends and family. I longed for a position that included in-person connections, and I latched onto the idea that I could only solve my issues by switching to a new workplace.\n\nI halfheartedly applied to new PR jobs, but nothing panned out. I applied for a position as a high school English teacher on the recommendation of a family member, not because teaching was my ultimate passion, but because people are, and it felt like a way to contribute something meaningful.\n\nThe offer letter was framed as a call to something greater, and it felt like I would be filling a role that desperately needed someone. While I longed to have a positive impact on their lives, I also felt an obligation to accept the position.\n\nIf I could step back in time to the middle of my discontent in my PR role, I would try to reframe my perspective and approach my job with a different attitude. Every job can be impactful and meaningful if approached with the perspective of doing your best for yourself and for others.\n\nIf I still found my PR job no longer a fit and longed to have a greater impact on the world, the next step shouldn't have been to bail, but rather to determine clear career goals that aligned with my personal values and mission.\n\nI tried to pursue a shiny, new calling rather than develop a solid career plan. It didn't work out because I gave significant weight to one over the other, but the two can fit hand in hand.\n\nIt's better to approach a career change intentionally and with an overarching goal, rather than latching onto a new idea and pursuing it blindly. Oftentimes, it's frightening to define our goals and a solid plan, because we feel that once we decide on a direction, we can never change our path. That's inaccurate.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would've drawn up a clear plan — perhaps including multiple potential pathways — before switching fields. If the desire to teach high school English was lying dormant somewhere inside my heart, it surely would've made itself known in a new-career-ideas brainstorm.\n\nI would recommend that anyone looking to discover their true passion or calling jot down a mix of their skills and interests, and then research which jobs align with both. If a new career of interest arises, pursue it intentionally by identifying existing or gaining new relevant experience and by connecting with people in the field.\n\nI quit my teaching role because of long work hours, emotional exhaustion, and a sense that I was operating in a silo. A few other teachers occasionally offered me encouragement or advice, but I was still required to create curricula from scratch and develop my lessons on my own.\n\nWhile I would like to change some of my past career choices, I don't regret the lessons I learned and the students and coworkers I met.\n\nI'm grateful to have had the opportunity to discover more about myself through this process — to see where I can change my attitude, set new goals, and achieve greater things in the future. Every failure is a learning experience, and I'll try to make this one count.",

    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",
