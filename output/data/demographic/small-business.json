    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "description": "An entrepreneur has ripped up the non-league rulebook since buying a football club.",
    "fullText": "Barrie Drewitt-Barlow is used to exploring the unknown.\n\nHe and his ex-husband Tony made headlines in 1999 when they became one of the first gay couples in the UK to have children through a surrogate mother.\n\nMore recently, the entrepreneur let a stranger live in his house for a reality show and has appeared on other shows such as Rich House, Poor House and Below Deck Sailing Yacht.\n\nWhat he never dreamed of doing was becoming the owner of a football club.\n\n\"I was the one who would sit on my laptop doing work when it ever came on the TV, or I'd go out,\" he says.\n\nBut now the 55-year-old cannot get enough of the beautiful game.\n\nIt has been a year since he completed a multi-million pound deal to purchase Essex-based Maldon and Tiptree Football Club.\n\n\"The offside rule still doesn't make any sense to me,\" he concedes.\n\n\"Every now and then when I see the whistle going from the ref or the linespeople, I just don't get it. I'm like, 'What's happened? Why has he stopped playing?'\n\n\"I almost thought they were doing a Morris dancing kind of thing with their flags at one point. It's not what I expected.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow grew up on a council estate in Manchester before moving to Essex and making a fortune in property.\n\nAcquiring Maldon and Tiptree FC in February 2025 marked his latest business venture.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow quickly oversaw the signing of some big names, including ex-West Ham United striker Freddie Sears and and the Zimbabwe international and former Colchester United, Leyton Orient and Southend United attacker Macauley Bonne.\n\nKevin Horlock, who once played for Manchester City, West Ham and Ipswich Town, was brought in as manager.\n\nThe arrivals made waves in the local football scene, as the Isthmian League North side, founded in 1946, are in the eighth tier of English football.\n\nIt was all the same to Drewitt-Barlow though.\n\nHe says: \"As a novice, you look at football and you see these crazy salaries from these big Premier League people - £300,000 a week – and it's not like that in this league.\n\n\"A lot of people still work regular jobs, this is a part-time thing for them.\n\n\"I didn't realise that kind of thing happened. I thought if you were a footballer, you're a footballer - you weren't a black cab driver or a roofer as well.\n\n\"But people have real lives and real jobs, that was the hardest thing for me to work out.\"\n\nAnother reality check for Drewitt-Barlow, who lives in Danbury, Essex, was the FA Cup.\n\nA series of impressive wins surged the Jammers into the first round proper of the prestigious English tournament.\n\nThere they faced Port Vale: a League One side who were 99 places above them in the footballing pyramid.\n\nWhat happened during the lead-up to the match quickly changed Drewitt-Barlow's entire outlook on the game.\n\n\"I'd heard about the FA Cup but I didn't understand the importance of it,\" he explains.\n\n\"I agreed with the FA to let the cup come here for an evening and I tell you now, the queues were round the block, down the street, for people to come in and see a piece of tin.\n\n\"It's like what the hell, people are actually that interested in this cup? Well, oh my God, they were.\n\n\"They were literally queuing, grown guys with their kids, waiting outside to come in and have a photograph taken with the FA Cup.\n\n\"Honestly, we felt the magic that night,\" he adds.\n\nIt was not just the excitement that Drewitt-Barlow, now club chief executive, was surprised by - it was the cash too.\n\nThe Jammers' match was chosen for TV coverage, earning them what he said was about £100,000.\n\nThe club also took half of the money earned on the gate, of which there were 4,551 fans in attendance, and won £15,800 in prize money for making it to the first round.\n\n\"I felt like all our Christmases came together with that FA Cup run,\" Drewitt-Barlow adds.\n\nEven before the match, which Maldon and Tiptree went on to lose 5-1, people were already talking about the businessman - who had been filmed during the cup draw.\n\n\"When it was announced on the TV I was like, 'Where the hell is Port Vale?',\" he recalls.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow has embraced becoming the pantomime villain on the terraces, but being targeted for his sexuality is where he draws the line.\n\n\"It's difficult on the terraces still,\" he says. \"That's where the bite comes from.\"\n\n\"There's still a massive stigma about being gay in football, but as time goes on those boundaries should break down.\n\n\"I don't mind being the whipping boy. They can call me all the names under the sun, I really couldn't give a flying hoot.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow claims to have been approached by footballers - three of which he says are currently playing in the Premier League - who are hiding being gay.\n\nHe is happy to help, but insists he does not want to become \"the poster boy for gay footballing\".\n\n\"I've already been classed as the poster boy for gay parenting or surrogacy and it doesn't get anybody anywhere,\" he adds.\n\n\"I don't think people want to [come out] because they're scared about what might happen in the dressing room, as well as on the pitch.\n\n\"I think the only people that can truly help and make it more normalised are the leagues and the FA.\"\n\nAway from the terraces, Drewitt-Barlow has been kept busy with renovations.\n\nFrom the clubhouse to the changing rooms, he has led an expensive overhaul of the facilities, which he described as \"semi-derelict\" when he arrived.\n\nEven purchasing grass for each goalmouth set him back £40,000.\n\nIt is very much a family operation, with husband Scott and son Aspen also overseeing the project.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow says: \"It was unloved, the place was tired. It needed somebody to come in, give it some love and show it some attention - and that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nUnder his stewardship, he claims Maldon and Tiptree have gone from attracting 70 spectators to an average crowd of 800.\n\n\"There's a lot of players who want to come here now, big players,\" he boasts.\n\n\"I can't walk around Tesco now without somebody telling me who we should be employing as a footballer.\"\n\nThe chief executive wants to take his club, which is in second place, into the English Football League and is chasing back-to-back promotions.\n\nHe reveals half the squad are being paid full-time, while the other half remain part-time.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow believes his club is now sustainable and will end the year in profit, boosted by the launch of a BTEC sports course in September.\n\nBut does he feel tired after his first year in football?\n\n\"Honestly, it's given me a fresh lease of life, I feel regenerated. I can't believe I didn't do this sooner,\" Drewitt-Barlow says.\n\n\"People love football, I never got it before now. I just did not get what people saw in football.\n\n\"Now I get it, I totally get it.\"\n\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nZimbabwe's Bonne leaves Maldon & Tiptree\n\nJammers boss enjoying first FA Cup run\n\nProspective owners 'plan to rebuild club's ground'",

    "description": "ICE activity and tariffs are making for an especially tough month for Perennial Cycle in Minneapolis. The owner is focusing on the community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Luke Breen, co-owner of specialty bike shop Perennial Cycle in uptown Minneapolis. The following conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nPerennial is a specialty bike shop. We do cargo bikes, city utility bikes, and commuting bikes, and have been a niche business for 33 years.\n\nPerennial focuses on community events. Last year, we did 35 organized community rides. So, while we do rely on selling bikes, we're very community-driven. That's always been a big piece of Perennial Cycle.\n\nYou cannot be in Minneapolis without ICE's presence impacting your day-to-day. You just simply cannot. Imagine: We had to shut down our schools to keep children safe. It is insane what is happening right now.\n\nAs a bike shop, we've had meetings so we can be aware of each other's levels of anxiety — how we're doing, is everybody OK? For some people, it's going to affect them a little differently, and we've come up with a plan for if ICE is on the block.\n\nWe were closed on Friday, January 23, for the ICE OUT protest. To me, it's a big ask to have small businesses go on strike, and later I heard that it was the first general strike in 80 years. I'm really glad that Perennial did that.\n\nI also went to the march in downtown Minneapolis last Friday afternoon and was a little overwhelmed with emotions. I had no idea how massive it was. When you're in a march like that, you can kind of see the few thousand people that are around you. It isn't until later when you see those overhead videos posted online, and it's like, 'Oh my God.'\n\nIt had an amazing vibe. There was not a lot to cheer about, and yet there's a lot to be together about. It took a lot of awesome organizing to pull that off. There were restaurants that were handing out food. There were tables with cases and cases and cases of hand warmers. It was minus 10 when I went down there, and the wind was blowing. I did not expect that many people because it was so cold.\n\nWe held a fundraiser for MIRAC, a local immigrant rights organization, scheduled for Sunday. I talked with Brieanna, the artist and screenprinter I am working with. We considered canceling. Brieanna and I decided that canceling is exactly what ICE would want us to do. We did not cancel the event.\n\nThere was a line outside the door that was a half-block long at one point. Tons of people showed up. Everybody was just happy to be part of the community. A couple of legal observers explained what it's like to be an observer, knowing that lots of people are very curious about it, but it's pretty intimidating when you just go by what you're seeing on the news and on Instagram. That was part of the aim of the fundraiser: to foster observer conversations.\n\nWe raised over $4,000. We brought in, I don't know, probably like 20 grocery bags of food for a food shelf. All those things were great, but the most appreciation came from people saying they were happy to be together, happy to have a place to go and be around other people who were kind of in mourning.\n\nWe had little cheat sheets with information about the event that we handed out when visitors walked in the door. One of the things was, \"Yes, we're a bike shop Monday through Saturday, but today we're not. Please don't ask us questions about bikes.\" We just didn't have the capacity to do bike stuff.\n\nThere were plenty of people at the fundraiser who weren't familiar with the bike shop. But plenty of people who were like, \"Wow, this is kind of weird. Why is this happening in a bike shop?\" And that was kind of fun explaining that, actually, this is very normal because we focus on community events. We have Cambros containers for serving coffee to 100 people. We have serving trays for treats. We have all the things that are necessary to organize an event like this. The bike shop actually already has the musicians who were singing.\n\nIt's off-season for me. I am really happy to have found a place to plug in to be useful during what's happening in Minneapolis right now. Numerous people came up and thanked me for opening the shop and doing the fundraiser. Most of the kind words were about community and not about raising money.\n\nHopefully, the shop will make it through, but honestly, it is a real challenge.\n\nOur city's under siege, but in reality, we all know it's our country that's under siege. We know a lot of people are super challenged by what's going on right now. I sell pretty expensive bicycles. These cargo bikes are not cheap. So for me, the tariffs have completely turned my life upside down. I'm learning that there is a plural for the word crisis, and it's crises. And that's what I'm looking at — one crisis on top of another.\n\nI have high seasons and low seasons. It's a low season, so I have to be very protective with my money right now. Any loss of income is a big deal because we're barely going to cover expenses for the month. This is a typical cycle for a business in Minnesota, a very seasonal business, so none of that is overwhelming. But, yeah, that's why the strike was definitely a big ask, and I'm so happy I did it. I believe that the store will reap rewards on the other side of this.",

    "fullText": "Paris Hilton shared the secret sauce behind her entrepreneurial success: her ADHD.\n\nThe 44-year-old original influencer, reality star, and founder of a laundry list of business ventures, said on the January 21 episode of \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty\" that her neurodivergent brain helps her \"think outside the box.\"\n\n\"I never wanted to be in one lane. I wanted to create my own lane. And I just have always been someone who just loves to do things and take risks and do things before anyone else,\" she said.\n\nHilton was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and although she struggled to cope with some of the symptoms as a teen, she now calls it her \"superpower.\"\n\n\"I know I would not be the woman I am today or the entrepreneur without it, because it just gives me such drive and curiosity and creativity and having a million ideas all the time, and just my brain just never stops,\" Hilton added.\n\nShe said that she is able to \"hyperfocus\" and enter a flow state when something interests her. \"That's where the magic happens,\" she said.\n\nPeople with ADHD, which stands for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, can have trouble concentrating or sitting still, because their brains work differently to most people. Signs and symptoms can include having high levels of energy, being impulsive, finding it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, and being very talkative.\n\nBefore Hilton was diagnosed with ADHD, she often worried something was \"wrong\" with her, and didn't understand why she struggled at school.\n\n\"No matter how hard I would study or try, I would constantly just not be able to remember things in school, be losing my homework, failing tests,\" she said.\n\nShe also experienced severe emotional pain when she felt rejected or criticized, a condition known as rejection-sensitive dysphoria, which is linked to ADHD.\n\n\"It's exhausting. And it's painful, and it's very difficult to go through,\" she said.\n\nNow, she is spreading the message across her music, documentaries, and media interviews that ADHD can be \"a good thing,\" she added.\n\n\"You can be successful in life, and some of the most creative people I know and brilliant geniuses all have ADHD as well,\" Hilton said.",

    "description": "Gina Jaguttis shared how two solo trips to Bali led her to start her slow fashion business as a side hustle.",
    "fullText": "On a Monday morning in early December, I met Gina Jaguttis as we loaded our surfboards into the camp van just before sunrise. We only got to talking on a choppy boat ride that took us a mile off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe 26-year-old real estate project manager from Munich came to the surf camp to improve her skills on the water. I came to talk with adventurous travelers about their big ideas, from new businesses to life after layoffs.\n\nAt our camp's bonfire that night, she began to tell me why she made a second solo expedition to the tropical island. As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",

    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft, saying he deserves the \"wrongful gains\" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing ​on Friday.\n\nOpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding what ‌was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial ‌against the two companies.\n\n\"Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of the seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,\" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment outside ⁠business hours on the amount of compensation ‌Musk is seeking.\n\nMICROSOFT AND OPENAI ALSO FILE SUITS\n\nDuring the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and part of a \"harassment\" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.\n\nMusk may seek punitive damages and other penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any ‍injunction might take.\n\nIn their own ⁠filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as \"made up,\" \"unverifiable\" and \"unprecedented\" and as seeking an \"implausible\" transfer of billions from a nonprofit ⁠to a former donor-turned-competitor.",

    "description": "I left the Marines to become an entrepreneur. While the skills I learned in the military helped my transition, I struggled with civilian work life.",
    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

    "description": "Justine Tello shares the lessons she learned from leaving public relations for teaching, then pivoting to running a small business with her spouse.",
    "fullText": "In July 2024, five years into my career, I made a drastic job switch that I would soon come to regret.\n\nFollowing about a year of disenchantment at my workplace, I left my job at a public relations agency to become a high school English teacher. I took a nearly 36% pay cut.\n\nI wasn't concerned about my paycheck because I desired a more meaningful and impactful role. I soon found myself underprepared and overwhelmed by the switch, and I left my teaching role after my first semester.\n\nAt first, I relied on my savings, my family's support, and my meager earnings as a part-time yoga teacher. My then-boyfriend and I got engaged and were married six months later.\n\nNow, we co-own a small HVAC and electrical company, where I lead the communications and marketing strategy.\n\nI loved getting to know the students and having the opportunity to mentor some of them. I learned many new skills while preparing lessons and grading papers.\n\nWhen it came to my career and my goals, the position didn't align with what I had historically wanted, and I didn't accept the job with a strategy in mind — I accepted it to pursue something new, whether I was prepared for it or not.\n\nTruthfully, I switched careers because I was dissatisfied with my original place of work, feeling stagnant in my personal growth, and lacking interest in my clients' missions. Instead of reframing my perspective or setting a new career goal, I sought a quick escape.\n\nAfter a year of reflection, I've identified three crucial mistakes that led to my unsatisfying career change.\n\nIn my final year at my PR agency, I found myself more easily discouraged by problems that were smaller than I initially perceived, or by those that had been resolved yet still lingered in my mind, like a delayed promotion, company layoffs, and a dissonant relationship with a supervisor.\n\nThese were challenging, but for the most part, I believe that the company and my managers handled problems well, and things began to smooth out over time.\n\nUnfortunately, my attitude toward my workplace remained negative after a handful of poor, back-to-back experiences. Although I was working with several amazing team members and continued to take on tasks I enjoyed, my dissatisfaction with my workplace persisted.\n\nI was burned out and a little lonely. I had been working remotely for over four years, which takes a toll on an extrovert like me, despite spending many evenings and weekends with friends and family. I longed for a position that included in-person connections, and I latched onto the idea that I could only solve my issues by switching to a new workplace.\n\nI halfheartedly applied to new PR jobs, but nothing panned out. I applied for a position as a high school English teacher on the recommendation of a family member, not because teaching was my ultimate passion, but because people are, and it felt like a way to contribute something meaningful.\n\nThe offer letter was framed as a call to something greater, and it felt like I would be filling a role that desperately needed someone. While I longed to have a positive impact on their lives, I also felt an obligation to accept the position.\n\nIf I could step back in time to the middle of my discontent in my PR role, I would try to reframe my perspective and approach my job with a different attitude. Every job can be impactful and meaningful if approached with the perspective of doing your best for yourself and for others.\n\nIf I still found my PR job no longer a fit and longed to have a greater impact on the world, the next step shouldn't have been to bail, but rather to determine clear career goals that aligned with my personal values and mission.\n\nI tried to pursue a shiny, new calling rather than develop a solid career plan. It didn't work out because I gave significant weight to one over the other, but the two can fit hand in hand.\n\nIt's better to approach a career change intentionally and with an overarching goal, rather than latching onto a new idea and pursuing it blindly. Oftentimes, it's frightening to define our goals and a solid plan, because we feel that once we decide on a direction, we can never change our path. That's inaccurate.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would've drawn up a clear plan — perhaps including multiple potential pathways — before switching fields. If the desire to teach high school English was lying dormant somewhere inside my heart, it surely would've made itself known in a new-career-ideas brainstorm.\n\nI would recommend that anyone looking to discover their true passion or calling jot down a mix of their skills and interests, and then research which jobs align with both. If a new career of interest arises, pursue it intentionally by identifying existing or gaining new relevant experience and by connecting with people in the field.\n\nI quit my teaching role because of long work hours, emotional exhaustion, and a sense that I was operating in a silo. A few other teachers occasionally offered me encouragement or advice, but I was still required to create curricula from scratch and develop my lessons on my own.\n\nWhile I would like to change some of my past career choices, I don't regret the lessons I learned and the students and coworkers I met.\n\nI'm grateful to have had the opportunity to discover more about myself through this process — to see where I can change my attitude, set new goals, and achieve greater things in the future. Every failure is a learning experience, and I'll try to make this one count.",

    "description": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson said AI isn't going away, but it's not quite at the level it needs to be to bring about major changes.",
    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",
