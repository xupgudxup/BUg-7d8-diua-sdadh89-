    "title": "When I left the Marines, I struggled to adjust to civilian life. Finding work in the real world was the most challenging.",
    "description": "I left the Marines to become an entrepreneur. While the skills I learned in the military helped my transition, I struggled with civilian work life.",
    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

    "description": "Justine Tello shares the lessons she learned from leaving public relations for teaching, then pivoting to running a small business with her spouse.",
    "fullText": "In July 2024, five years into my career, I made a drastic job switch that I would soon come to regret.\n\nFollowing about a year of disenchantment at my workplace, I left my job at a public relations agency to become a high school English teacher. I took a nearly 36% pay cut.\n\nI wasn't concerned about my paycheck because I desired a more meaningful and impactful role. I soon found myself underprepared and overwhelmed by the switch, and I left my teaching role after my first semester.\n\nAt first, I relied on my savings, my family's support, and my meager earnings as a part-time yoga teacher. My then-boyfriend and I got engaged and were married six months later.\n\nNow, we co-own a small HVAC and electrical company, where I lead the communications and marketing strategy.\n\nI loved getting to know the students and having the opportunity to mentor some of them. I learned many new skills while preparing lessons and grading papers.\n\nWhen it came to my career and my goals, the position didn't align with what I had historically wanted, and I didn't accept the job with a strategy in mind — I accepted it to pursue something new, whether I was prepared for it or not.\n\nTruthfully, I switched careers because I was dissatisfied with my original place of work, feeling stagnant in my personal growth, and lacking interest in my clients' missions. Instead of reframing my perspective or setting a new career goal, I sought a quick escape.\n\nAfter a year of reflection, I've identified three crucial mistakes that led to my unsatisfying career change.\n\nIn my final year at my PR agency, I found myself more easily discouraged by problems that were smaller than I initially perceived, or by those that had been resolved yet still lingered in my mind, like a delayed promotion, company layoffs, and a dissonant relationship with a supervisor.\n\nThese were challenging, but for the most part, I believe that the company and my managers handled problems well, and things began to smooth out over time.\n\nUnfortunately, my attitude toward my workplace remained negative after a handful of poor, back-to-back experiences. Although I was working with several amazing team members and continued to take on tasks I enjoyed, my dissatisfaction with my workplace persisted.\n\nI was burned out and a little lonely. I had been working remotely for over four years, which takes a toll on an extrovert like me, despite spending many evenings and weekends with friends and family. I longed for a position that included in-person connections, and I latched onto the idea that I could only solve my issues by switching to a new workplace.\n\nI halfheartedly applied to new PR jobs, but nothing panned out. I applied for a position as a high school English teacher on the recommendation of a family member, not because teaching was my ultimate passion, but because people are, and it felt like a way to contribute something meaningful.\n\nThe offer letter was framed as a call to something greater, and it felt like I would be filling a role that desperately needed someone. While I longed to have a positive impact on their lives, I also felt an obligation to accept the position.\n\nIf I could step back in time to the middle of my discontent in my PR role, I would try to reframe my perspective and approach my job with a different attitude. Every job can be impactful and meaningful if approached with the perspective of doing your best for yourself and for others.\n\nIf I still found my PR job no longer a fit and longed to have a greater impact on the world, the next step shouldn't have been to bail, but rather to determine clear career goals that aligned with my personal values and mission.\n\nI tried to pursue a shiny, new calling rather than develop a solid career plan. It didn't work out because I gave significant weight to one over the other, but the two can fit hand in hand.\n\nIt's better to approach a career change intentionally and with an overarching goal, rather than latching onto a new idea and pursuing it blindly. Oftentimes, it's frightening to define our goals and a solid plan, because we feel that once we decide on a direction, we can never change our path. That's inaccurate.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would've drawn up a clear plan — perhaps including multiple potential pathways — before switching fields. If the desire to teach high school English was lying dormant somewhere inside my heart, it surely would've made itself known in a new-career-ideas brainstorm.\n\nI would recommend that anyone looking to discover their true passion or calling jot down a mix of their skills and interests, and then research which jobs align with both. If a new career of interest arises, pursue it intentionally by identifying existing or gaining new relevant experience and by connecting with people in the field.\n\nI quit my teaching role because of long work hours, emotional exhaustion, and a sense that I was operating in a silo. A few other teachers occasionally offered me encouragement or advice, but I was still required to create curricula from scratch and develop my lessons on my own.\n\nWhile I would like to change some of my past career choices, I don't regret the lessons I learned and the students and coworkers I met.\n\nI'm grateful to have had the opportunity to discover more about myself through this process — to see where I can change my attitude, set new goals, and achieve greater things in the future. Every failure is a learning experience, and I'll try to make this one count.",

    "description": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson said AI isn't going away, but it's not quite at the level it needs to be to bring about major changes.",
    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",
