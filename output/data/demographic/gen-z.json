    "description": "The generation has shared in droves on social media about the little ways they’re treating themselves.",
    "fullText": "Sydney Lake is an associate editor at Fortune, where she writes and edits news for the publication's global news desk.\n\nGetting out of bed to go to work or lugging yourself to the grocery store can feel tough. And for that, you deserve a little treat.\n\nAt least that’s the way many Gen Zers see it. Despite a lack of income, Gen Z finds ways to reward themselves frequently: 57% buy themselves a small treat at least once a week, according to a Bank of America report from late July. This could be good news for retailers like Starbucks and Dunkin’, since coffee and other beverages are popular and relatively low-cost treats. Trader Joe’s could also benefit from this trend since they’re known for unique food and beverages, as well as Sephora and Ulta as self-care and cosmetics become increasingly popular among younger generations.\n\nBut for nearly 60% of Gen Zers, this leads to overspending, “making little treats a slippery slope,” according to the report. Yet, the generation has shared in droves on social media about the little ways they’re treating themselves, whether it’s buying a simple ice cream cone or splurging on a new clothing haul.\n\nGen Zers reward themselves for small wins, but also use little treats as pick-me-ups after a bad day. And some don’t even really have a reason.\n\n“Buying myself a little treat because today would’ve been my birthday if I was born today,” one TikTok user posted.\n\nAnd it’s important to remember that 💙 #fyp #fypage #greenvillesc #daydrinkers #localcoffee #cutecoffeeshop #trend #littletreat ♬ original sound – Theo\n\nTerran Fielder, a 23-year-old media specialist, told Fortune she treats herself to lunch during the day and that many of her small indulgences have to do with making her life easier or more time to rest when the day is over.\n\n“When I treat myself, it’s usually in ways that give me more shut eye,” she said. “So, if I am not making lunch, that’s another 20 minutes in bed in the morning. It feels like I’m not just spending money: I’m investing in my well-being.” She said she estimates she spends about $200 to $250 per month on treating herself.\n\nTo be sure, Gen Z isn’t the first generation—and likely isn’t the last—to participate in treat culture. Most recently, older generations scorned millennials for their proclivity toward treating themselves with avocado toast and a daily Starbucks coffee, arguing they could’ve saved or invested that money instead.\n\nWhile treat culture isn’t new, Gen Z is taking it to a “new level,” Daniel Levine, director of consumer trends consulting firm Avant Guide Institute, told Fortune.\n\n“While members of the Silent Generation treated themselves to a new dress for a special occasion, and baby boomers splurged on a new car or a vacation after reaching a career milestone, Gen X indulges in late-night runs for their favorite junk food to de-stress,” Levine said. “The low barrier to entry makes it a daily habit.”\n\nMeanwhile, online shopping as well as food delivery have made it easier to indulge in treats. Indeed, Gen Z uses grocery subscriptions 133% more often than Gen X, according to a 2024 PYMNTS survey of more than 67,000 consumers across 11 countries accounting for nearly half the world’s GDP.\n\nPart of treat culture goes back to the basic psychological concept of positive reinforcement. When you do something positive or are trying to reinforce habits, earning a treat or reward can help cement that behavior.\n\nTreat culture, for younger generations, also serves as a coping mechanism or a form of resistance to societal pressures and stressors, Jillian Amodio, a licensed master social worker at Waypoint Wellness Center, told Fortune. That’s because Gen Z has come of age during a time of economic instability, a global pandemic, climate anxiety and widespread social upheaval, she said. Meanwhile, some younger generations have experienced career whiplash from working in an office, then working remotely during the pandemic, then being forced back to in-person during the past few years.\n\n“Small, intentional joys become a way of reclaiming agency and grounding oneself in the present,” Amodio said. “Pair that with the influence of social media, where trends, aesthetics, and ‘little luxuries’ are celebrated and shared widely, and we have the perfect conditions for treat culture to thrive in the spotlight.”\n\nAnother study by Intuit Credit Karma also showed Gen Z justifies certain non-essential purchases like streaming services, skincare, meals out, fitness classes, and more as “necessities” rather than discretionary purchases. Indeed, more than half of Gen Z views spending on hobbies and interests as a necessity, not a luxury, and they’re putting them above other financial goals.\n\n“If I’m working away from home, buying lunch instead of packing it feels like a small luxury that makes my day easier,” Fielder said. “When things get really busy, I’ll skip the store altogether and order things online, just to avoid another errand.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on August 19, 2025.",

    "description": "Gen Z is starting to drink more alcohol, but data shows they feel the need to prepare an excuse if they're not indulging. It's forcing bars to change.",
    "fullText": "Gen Z drinks less than the generations before them, but the awkwardness they feel talking about alcohol is starting to transform where they go out, what they order, and how bars are built for them.\n\nYounger consumers say they feel more awkward than older consumers when explaining why they aren't drinking, new research from Heineken shows. While an increasing percentage of Americans feel comfortable declining an alcoholic drink with a simple \"no thanks\" (72%) or opting for a non-alcoholic alternative at parties (86%), only about half of Americans under 35 are comfortable drinking low or no-alcohol drinks in public.\n\nThey're also more likely to expect someone will question them, and more likely to feel they need an excuse for not drinking — a paradox, given that Gen Z drinks less overall.\n\nAs younger adults pull back from drinking while still worrying about how to justify it, nightlife operators are rebuilding their menus, spaces, and social experiences around a generation that wants to go out without having to explain what's in their glass.\n\nLaura Fenton, a research associate at the University of Sheffield's School of Medicine and Population Health who studies youth drinking behavior, said the tension around talking about drinking likely stems from social expectations. Even for Gen Z consumers, she said, \"drinking together can be really important to friendship and to negotiating kind of a sense of belonging.\"\n\nA Danish study she cited found that young people feel like they have to give a good reason when they don't drink or when they turn down alcohol with their friends, because \"drinking is kind of a demonstration of reciprocity.\"\n\n\"So if you're going to not be on the same level, you have to have a good reason,\" Fenton said.\n\nGen Z's approach to alcohol is also shaped by a notable anxiety about health concerns and other risks associated with drinking, as well as an aversion to the high costs. With cocktails priced at $15 or \n\n\"They're just a much more conscious consumer,\" Marten Lodewijks, president of the beverage market data firm, IWSR, told Business Insider. \"It's not that they just don't want to drink. They enjoy it, and they enjoy it as much as other generations. It's just that they're conscious that it's not good for them, and so they don't do it as frequently.\"\n\nOperators say the shift isn't theoretical; they're seeing it in real time.\n\nMichelin-starred chef David Chang said in a November interview with TBPN talk-show hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays that the decline in Gen Z's drinking is a \"real existential threat\" to restaurants if they don't pivot, given the industry's already thin margins.\n\nSober bars are cropping up across major metropolitan areas — and one operator told Business Insider in January that every bar will have to expand its non-alcoholic offerings to stay competitive.\n\nThat change is already taking place: mocktails now appear on menus not as afterthoughts but as full-fledged offerings that look, feel, and cost like traditional cocktails, Stacy Molnar, a designer who has worked on restaurant and bar concepts for more than 30 years, told Business Insider.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's about revenue per seat,\" said Molnar. \"If someone wants to order a $15 mocktail instead of a $15 cocktail, great — it makes them feel included, and the operator still hits their numbers.\"\n\nHeineken USA's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Anne de Graaf, told Business Insider that \"Zebra Striping,\" which is when people choose to alternate between alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks, is also on the rise.\n\nBut it's not just the drink list that's changing; it's the overall bar experience.\n\nYounger consumers want something to gather around when they go out, such as board games, trivia nights, themed environments, Instagrammable bathrooms, striking focal points, and distinctive décor.\n\nIn other words, Molnar said, they want atmosphere.\n\n\"They're not going to a bar just to sit,\" Molnar, who has two Gen Z kids of his own, said. \"They want an activity. They want a vibe.\"\n\nFrom all-pink cafés trending on TikTok to bars built around entertainment, the industry is shifting away from alcohol as the main draw. Instead, it's centering aesthetic experiences that make socializing feel low-stakes — and alcohol optional.\n\n\"This isn't just about alcohol,\" Fenton, the youth-drinking researcher, said. \"It's about what young adults want from social life. If you think about it, for young adults, drinking is a social behavior, and it's largely geared toward forming and maintaining social bonds.\"\n\nBars that succeed with younger customers aren't just offering alcohol-free options; they're de-emphasizing alcohol altogether. They're transforming into multi-experience spaces where friends can hang out without feeling judged, pressured, or out of sync with the group, Molnar said.\n\nSo, what comes next? Expect to see more bars that are less about booze and more about belonging — and more spaces where saying \"I'm not drinking tonight\" doesn't require a speech.",

    "fullText": "Gen Z is embracing one decades-old phenomenon: Trading card games like Pokémon.\n\nCollectible card games were the most-purchased secondhand product category for Gen Z in the US on eBay so far this year, according to data from the e-commerce platform.\n\nThe trend was especially clear among Gen Z men, who collectively shifted spending from electronics to trading cards and other collectibles, according to eBay. Trading cards were also the top secondhand sales category among Gen Z women on the platform, followed by books and cameras.\n\nWhile trading cards for franchises such as Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! initially became popular with kids and teens in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the data shows that the cards remain popular, even among those who were born as they were taking off.\n\nPart of the enduring popularity is because those people who grew up with trading cards are now passing the interest on to their own kids, Aaron Ottensmann, a 29-year-old who runs card sales business SassyTCG, told Business Insider.\n\n\"You're starting to see people like me having kids, and they're picking up starter decks and playing with their kids,\" Ottensmann said.\n\nWhile Ottensmann said he sources cards from distributors, the business has become competitive enough that some newer sellers buy cards at retailers like Walmart and Costco, then resell them.\n\nOther customers are after high-dollar cards, with some turning to trading cards as an alternative to investing in the stock market.\n\nIn early December on Ottensmann's eBay shop, shoppers could find about two dozen cards or packs of cards priced over $1,000. His most expensive sale over the past year, a set of 127 early Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, sold for about $75,000 through eBay.\n\nTrading cards are one part of the broader secondhand sales market, which eBay said is expanding in a report released last month.\n\nAbout 82% of survey respondents said they planned to spend more on secondhand items this holiday season than they did in 2024, according to the company's Recommerce Report.\n\nShopping secondhand has gained popularity this year, especially as President Donald Trump's tariffs have raised the price of some goods and added costs to items ordered from outside the US.\n\nDo you have a story idea?

    "description": "Asics Novablasts have become popular among Gen Z runners, beating out similar Nike and Hoka models.",
    "fullText": "While Nike and Hoka have been some of the buzziest running brands in recent years, a new shoe reigned supreme this year: the Asics Novablast.\n\nA recent Strava report, which tracked which optional \"gear\" users selected on their uploaded runs, found that Asics' $150 sneakers beat out Nike Pegasus and Hoka Clifton models, both of which can retail for slightly more (depending on the exact model).\n\n\"After run number one, my feet were feeling happy,\" Keltie O'Connor, a runner and YouTuber, said in her 2024 TikTok review. She raved about how soft they were, without feeling like a memory foam mattress.\n\nMichael Mazzara, the CEO of Half Marathon Guide and Rogue Expeditions, a running tour company, said the data made sense; both complete beginners and more experienced runners gravitate toward the shoes' extreme cushioning.\n\nThey also make it easier to run faster — so much so that some formal races, like the Ironman, ban them for giving runners too much of an advantage.\n\n\"It's become a lot more common that people want really, really springy shoes to feel like they're going faster or to reduce the impact on their joints,\" Mazzara said. \"They created a really accessible shoe to feel like you felt pretty invincible, even if you just got out there.\"\n\nWhile wearing bouncier shoes can feel great, even exhilarating, there are some long-term drawbacks. When it comes to long-distance running and extensive training, extreme comfort can be too much of a good thing, masking injuries around the corner.\n\nBecause of its high stack height, Mazzara said the shoe can feel very forgiving, especially for beginners. \"You feel like you just have to think a little bit less about your cadence and your stride because the shoe's doing a lot of the work for you.\"\n\nIt's also very fun to run in, he said, even though it's not technically a race shoe. Novablasts are made for daily training and long runs, unlike carbon-plated race shoes such as Nike Alphaflys, which are designed to increase speed and shouldn't be worn as frequently.\n\nEven so, Novablasts feel like race shoes. \"They're really springy, and you feel like you're running very fast,\" he said. \"It's something that people haven't really felt before about a daily trainer.\"\n\nIn general, running brands like Asics, Nike, Hoka, and Brooks have been investing in foamier, bouncier shoes.\n\nAylin Woodward of The Wall Street Journal reported that \"super shoes\" — sneakers with both carbon-plating and high stack heights — have blown up in the past decade after professional marathoners shaved minutes off their finish times with them.\n\nUltra-bouncy shoes like Novablasts can also feel like a solution to both new and burned-out runners alike, Mazzara said. If you're a total beginner, new aches and pains can feel concerning — even discouraging. \"Then, all of a sudden, you try on a shoe that feels like a Moon Boot to run in.\" You're immediately faster than ever, with no immediate downsides.\n\nFor long-term runners who've been running in the same, less-cushioned trainers for years, the sudden switch can be a much-needed mental refresh. Feeling automatically faster \"reinvigorates the excitement of daily training and racing,\" he said.\n\nThere are some downsides to the shoe-cushioning arms race.\n\nDr. Courtney Conley, chiropractic physician specializing in foot and gait mechanics, said in a Diary of a CEO interview that tall, bouncy shoes like Nike Alphaflys can weaken muscles in the foot.\n\n\"If you train in them all the time, and you never let your foot get stronger, it's just a matter of time,\" she said, before you start feeling hamstring issues.\n\nIn his own experience wearing Novablasts, Mazzara said he felt like he didn't have to think about his running form as much. That eventually caught up with him: \"I got injured disproportionately more than using a more conventional, less springy shoe,\" he said.\n\nAsics did not respond to Business Insider's request to comment.\n\nMazzara and runners he knows, especially longtime ones in their 40s to 60s, prefer shoes like the Nike Pegasus or Hoka Clifton because they offer ample support without as much bounciness, Mazzara said. The shoes feel stabler in the long run, even if they're a little less exciting.\n\nFor running beginners who don't know where to start, Mazzara recommended going to a running store to find the perfect fit for your foot shape and stride.\n\nThe best principle to follow is also the simplest, he said: \"When it comes to running, find something that you love to run in until you love running.\"",

Business Insider got an exclusive look at the episode's transcript.\n\nCoach zeroed in on Gen Z out of necessity. Roe told Langley that the company was looking at data, which estimated that, by 2030, about 70% of handbag purchases were going to be made by either Gen Z or millennial buyers. But the average age of Coach buyers was 40, he said.\n\n\"We said, well, that's a problem,\" Roe recounted. \"We got to get younger.\"\n\nDuring Tapestry's November earnings call, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told investors that Coach had acquired 1.7 million new customers in its most recent quarter, driven by Gen Z. Tapestry also reported revenue of $1.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.\n\nJust like Coach, Kate Spade is \"targeting\" Gen Z, Roe said.\n\n\"We like 18 years as a point of entry. That's when a young lady goes from upper school or high school into college,\" Roe said. \"They typically go from a backpack to a bag.\"\n\nFirst on Tapestry's \"road map\" to bring Kate Spade into the zeitgeist is getting young buyers to \"be aware that Kate Spade exists,\" Roe said, which means increasing marketing spend on the brand.\n\nOne example of a buzzy product that Kate Spade is pushing is its Duo Crossbody Bag, which Roe said is \"already a big bag\" and expects it to be a hit over the holidays.\n\nSocial media, such as videos on YouTube or posts on Reddit, play a role in getting Gen Z to \"consider whether they want to buy the brand,\" Roe said. (He didn't go into detail on Tapestry's strategy of paid social media partnerships with creators, however.)\n\nSome members of the younger Gen Z cohort have more spending power than meets the eye, Roe said.\n\n\"They have six wallets, right? Two grandparents and their parents,\" Roe said.\n\nGoing after Gen Z doesn't come without hurdles, however.\n\n\"As we thought about how we become more relevant to that younger generation, we were also faced with some dilemmas,\" Roe said.\n\nThe biggest obstacle: Gen Z has an endless array of options when it comes to shopping.\n\n\"Because there's so many more choices for them, it's more difficult to break through,\" Roe said.\n\nHow to break through? Marketing. And then more marketing.\n\nRoe said that Tapestry \"more than tripled\" its marketing spend. \"It's our intent to keep doing that.\"",

Here are some of their reactions:- Mumbai: 'Nothing is black or white' -At the seafront in India's Mumbai, 19-year-old Pratigya Jena scrolls with her friends through Instagram videos of a posing influencer and a camel at a beach.Social media \"should be partially banned because according to me nothing is either black or white\", the student said.\"Gen Z are very active, they are doing really well on social media.",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Gen Z are the first generation to have grown up with social media, they were the earliest adopters, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. Now they are fighting back\n\nLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed a Snapchat post by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this. These fisha accounts are really not OK. Girls, please protect yourselves.’ And I’m like: ‘What is fisha?’ I was 21, but I felt old,” she says.\n\nShe went into her sister’s bedroom, where her sibling showed her a Snapchat account named “fisha” plus the code of their Paris suburb. Fisha is French slang for publicly shaming someone – from the verb “afficher”, meaning to display or make public. The account contained intimate images of girls from her sister’s school and dozens of others, “along with the personal data of the victims – their names, phone numbers, addresses, everything to find them, everything to put them in danger”.\n\nMcLaren, her sister and their friends reported the account to Snapchat dozens of times, but received no response. Then they discovered there were fisha accounts for different suburbs, towns and cities across France and beyond. Faced with the impunity of the social media platforms, and their lack of moderation, they launched the hashtag #StopFisha.\n\nIt went viral, online and in the media. #StopFisha became a rallying cry, a safe space to share information and advice, a protest movement. Now it was the social media companies being shamed. “The wave became a counter-wave,” says McLaren, who is now 26. The French government got involved, and launched an online campaign on the dangers and legal consequences of fisha accounts. The social media companies began to moderate at last, and #StopFisha is now a “trusted flagger” with Snapchat and TikTok, so when they report fisha content, it is taken down within hours. “I realised that if you want change in your societies, if you come with your idea alone, it won’t work. You need support behind you.”\n\nFour years later, this strategy is playing out on an even larger scale. McLaren and other young activists across Europe are banding together against social media and its ruinous effects on their generation. Individually, young people are powerless to sway big tech, but they are also a substantial part of its business model – so, collectively, they are powerful.\n\nThis is the first generation to have grown up with social media: they were the earliest adopters of it, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. The array of problems is ever-expanding: misogynistic, hateful and disturbing content; addictive and skewed algorithms; invasion of privacy; online forums encouraging harmful behaviours; sextortion; screen addiction; deepfake pornography; misinformation and disinformation; radicalisation; surveillance; biased AI – the list goes on. As the use of social media has risen, there has been a corresponding increase in youth mental health problems, anxiety, depression, self-harm and even suicide.\n\n“Across Europe, a generation is suffering through a silent crisis,” says a new report from People vs Big Tech – a coalition of more than 140 digital rights NGOs from around Europe – and Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, their youth-led spin-off. A big factor is “the design and dominance of social media platforms”.\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim, for people aged 15 to 29, came about in September last year when People vs Big Tech put out a call – on social media, paradoxically. About 20 young people who were already active on these issues came together at a “boot camp” in London. “We were really given the tools to create the movement that we wanted to build,” says McLaren, who attended with her partner. “They booked a big room, they brought the food, pencils, paper, everything we needed. And they were like: ‘This is your space, and we’re here to help.’”\n\nThe group is Europe’s first digital justice movement by and for young people. Their demands are very simple, or at least they ought to be: inclusion of young people in decision-making; a safer, healthier, more equitable social media environment; control and transparency over personal data and how it is used; and an end to the stranglehold a handful of US-based corporations have over social media and online spaces. The overarching principle is: “Nothing for us, without us.”\n\n“This is not just us being angry; it’s us having the right to speak,” says McLaren, who is now a youth mobilisation lead for Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim. Debates over digital rights are already going on, of course, but, she says: “We find it really unfair that we’re not at the table. Young people have so much to say, and they’re real experts, because they have lived experience … So why aren’t they given the proper space?”\n\nMcLaren’s work with #StopFisha took her on a journey into a wider, murkier world of gender-based digital rights: misogynist trolling and sexism, cyberstalking, deepfake pornography – but she realised this was just one facet of the problem. What women were experiencing online, other groups were experiencing in their own ways.\n\nA fellow activist, Yassine, 23, is well aware of this. Originally from north Africa and now living in Germany, Yassine identifies as non-binary. They fled to Europe to escape intolerance in their own country, but the reality of life, even in a supposedly liberal country such as Germany, hit them like a “slap”, they say. “You’re here for your safety, but then you’re trying to fight not only the system that is punishing the queerness of you, but you also have another layer of being a migrant. So you have two battles instead of one.”\n\nAs a migrant they are seen as a threat, Yassine says. “Our bodies and movements must be tracked, fingerprinted and surveilled through intrusive digital systems designed to protect the EU.” For queer people, there are similar challenges. These include “shadow-banning”, for example, by which tech platforms “silence conversations about queer rights, racism or anything that is challenging the dominant system”, either wilfully or algorithmically, through built-in biases.\n\nMeasures such as identity verification “are also putting a lot of people at risk of being erased from these spaces”, says Yassine. There can be good reasons for them, but they can also end up discriminating against non-binary or transgender people – who are often presented with binary gender options; male or female – as well as against refugees and undocumented people, who may be afraid or unable to submit their details online. Given their often tenuous residency status, and sometimes limited digital literacy and access, migrants tend not to speak out, Yassine says. “It definitely feels like you are in a position of: ‘You need to be grateful that you are here, and you should not question the laws.’ But the laws are harming my data.”\n\nOn a more day-to-day level, Yassine says, they must “walk through online spaces knowing they could do harm to me”. If they click on the comments under a social media post, for example, they know they are likely to find racist, homophobic or hateful attacks. Like McLaren, Yassine says that complaining is futile. “I know that they will come back with, ‘This is not a community guidelines breach’, and all of that.”\n\nThese are not mere glitches in the system, says Yassine, who now leads on digital rights at IGLYO, a long-running LGBTQ+ youth rights organisation, founded in Brussels, with a network of groups across Europe. “The systems we design inherit the very structures they arise from, so they inevitably become systems that are patriarchal and racist by design.”\n\nAdele Zeynep Walton’s participation in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim came through personal experience of online harm. In 2022, Walton’s 21-year-old sister, Aimee, took her own life. She had been struggling with her mental health, but had also been spending time on online suicide and self-harm forums, which Walton believes contributed to her death. After that, Walton began to question the digital realm she had grown up in, and her own screen addiction.\n\nWalton’s parents made her first Facebook account when she was 10, she says. She has been on Instagram since she was 12. Her own feelings of body dysmorphia began when she was 13, sparked by pro-anorexia content her friends were sharing. “I became a consumer of that, then I got immersed in this world,” she says. “Generations like mine thought it was totally normal, having this everyday battle with this addictive thing, having this constant need for external validation. I thought those were things that were just wrong with me.”\n\nIn researching her book Logging Off: The Human Cost of our Digital World, Walton, 26, also became aware of how little control young people have over the content that is algorithmically served up to them. “We don’t really have any choice over what our feeds look like. Despite the fact there are things where you can say, ‘I don’t want to see this type of content’, within a week, you’re still seeing it again.”\n\nAlycia Colijn, 29, another member of Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, knows something about this. She studied data science and marketing analytics at university in Rotterdam, researching AI-driven algorithms – how they can be used to manipulate behaviour, and in whose interests. During her studies she began to think: “It’s weird that I’m trained to gather as much data as I can, and to build a model that can respond to or predict what people want to buy, but I’ve never had a conversation around ethics.” Now she is researching these issues as co-founder of Encode Europe, which advocates for human-centric AI. “I realised how much power these algorithms have over us; over our society, but also over our democracies,” she says. “Can we still speak of free will if the best psychologists in the world are building algorithms that make us addicted?”\n\nThe more she learned, the more concerned Colijn became. “We made social media into a social experiment,” she says. “It turned out to be the place where you could best gather personal data from individuals. Data turned into the new gold, and then tech bros became some of the most powerful people in the world, even though they aren’t necessarily known for caring about society.”\n\nSocial media companies have had ample opportunities to respond to these myriad harms, but invariably they have chosen not to. Just as McLaren found with Snapchat and the fisha accounts, hateful and racist content is still minimally moderated on platforms such as X, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. After Donald Trump’s re-election, Mark Zuckerberg stated at the start of this year that Meta would be reducing factcheckers across Facebook and Instagram, just as X has under Elon Musk. This has facilitated the free flow of misinformation. Meta, Amazon and Google were also among the companies announcing they were rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, post-Trump’s election. The shift towards the right politically, in the US and Europe, has inevitably affected these platforms’ tolerance of hateful and racist content, says Yassine. “People feel like now they have more rights to be harmful than rights to be protected.”\n\nAll the while, the tech CEOs have become more powerful, economically, politically and in terms of information control. “We don’t believe that power should be in those hands,” says Colijn. “That’s not a true democracy.”\n\nEurope’s politicians aren’t doing much better. Having drafted the Digital Services Act in 2023, which threatened social media companies with fines or bans if they failed to regulate harmful content, the European Commission announced last month it would be rolling back some of its data privacy laws, to allow big tech companies to use people’s personal data for training AI systems.\n\n“Big tech, combined with the AI innovators, say they are the growth of tomorrow’s economy, and that we have to trust them. I don’t think that’s true,” says Colijn. She also disagrees with their argument that regulation harms innovation. “The only thing deregulation fosters is harmful innovation. If we want responsible innovation, we need regulation in place.”\n\nWalton agrees. “Governments and MPs are shooting themselves in the foot by pandering to tech giants, because that just tells young people that they don’t care about our future,” she says. “There’s this massive knowledge gap between the people who are making the decisions, and the tech justice movement and everyday people who are experiencing the harms.”\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim is not calling for the wholesale destruction of social media. All these activists say they have found community, solidarity and joy in online spaces: “We’re fighting for these spaces to accommodate us,” says Yassine. “We’re not protesting to cancel them. We know how harmful they are, but they are still spaces where we have hope.”\n\nColijn echoes this. “Social media used to be a fun place with the promise of connecting the world,” she says. “That’s where we started.” And that’s what they want it to be again.\n\nWill big tech pay attention? They might not have a choice, as countries and legislators begin to take action. This week Australia will become the first country to ban social media accounts for under-16s on major platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and X. Last week, after a two-year deliberation, X was fined €120m (£105m) by the EU for breaching data laws. But these companies continue to platform content that is hateful, racist, harmful, misleading or inflammatory, with impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim is just getting started. Other discussions on the table include campaigning for an EU-funded social media platform, an alternative to the big tech oligopoly, created by and for the public. Another alternative is direct action, either protest or consumer activism such as coordinated boycotts. “I think it’s lazy for us to be like: we don’t have any power,” says Walton. “Because we could literally say that about anything: fast fashion, fossil fuels … OK, but how do we change things?”\n\nThe other alternative is simply to log off. “The other side of the coin to this movement of tech justice, and a sort of liberation from the harms that we’ve experienced over the past 20 years, is reducing our screen time,” says Walton. “It is spending more time in community. It is connecting with people who maybe you would have never spoken to on social media, because you’d be in different echo chambers.”\n\nAlmost all the activists in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim attest to having had some form of screen addiction. As much as social media has brought them together, it has also led to much less face-to-face socialising. “I’ve had to sort of rewire my brain to get used to the awkwardness and get comfortable with being in a social setting and not knowing anyone,” says Walton. “Actually, it would be really nice to return to proper connection.”\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
