    "fullText": "Secondhand shopping is becoming the first choice for many consumers — especially Gen Z.\n\nThe trend is reshaping the fashion industry.\n\nThe secondhand fashion and luxury market is forecast to grow two to three times as fast as the firsthand market through 2027, according to a November report from The Business of Fashion and McKinsey. Online resale is driving a lot of that growth, and is forecast to grow 16% annually in the next two years.\n\nPart of that growth is driven by a search for value, but there are also more platforms than ever to shop for secondhand goods.\n\nGen Z has been gravitating toward resale platforms like eBay, Depop, Pickle, and Vinted. Online marketplaces like these accounted for 88% of resale spending in 2024, according to the November report.\n\nShopping for vintage clothes ignites a sense of individuality that fast-fashion can't always achieve, three Gen Zers said at a retail conference in January.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs also helped boost the US secondhand market in 2025. Negotiations and uncertainty around imported goods pushed some US shoppers towards more stable options, such as thrifting.\n\nIt's a new year, and the resale market is on track to keep growing. We want to hear where you're shopping in 2026. Please fill out the survey below.",

    "title": "Should You Be 'Fibermaxxing'?",
    "description": "A familiar concept gets a Gen Z rebranding. But is it nutritionist-approved?",
    "fullText": "First came smellmaxxing. And then sleepmaxxing. Don’t forget flavormaxxing. Now there is a newcomer to the scene. Fibermaxxing.\n\nIn the latest example of social media users fixating on something — only to have some take it to an extreme — proponents of the fibermaxxing trend are loading up their meals with soaked chia seeds and cruciferous vegetables in an effort to increase their fiber intake, and often to also lose weight.\n\n“Fiber is super cool — I think more people should be eating fiber,” said Pamela Corral, a 25-year-old wellness content creator who said she tried to eat more than the recommended daily amount of fiber, which is approximately 25 grams for women in the United States.\n\nMs. Corral’s TikToks, which often extoll the virtues of the nutrient in text laid over footage of her morning chia seed puddings, have found a huge audience. A recent video garnered more than 10 million views.\n\nMs. Corral said inspiration for her videos tended to strike when she was eating things, like her fiber-rich pudding. “I try to eat it often,” she said, “so I can make videos.”\n\nElsewhere, fibermaxxing proponents are talking up the health benefits of a fiber-rich diet, citing common foods you most likely already have in your house that are packed with fiber and talking about how it’s the rare food trend that is about what you should add to your diet, rather than what to cut out of it.\n\nFibermaxxing is, essentially, a catchy Gen Z-style label for a niche trend, and the origins of the term remain unclear. (Ms. Corral said she first heard the term on X, where she follows other wellness creators.) But it ties into a broader movement of social media users who routinely call for increased fiber consumption. That message has been driven by a coalition of health-conscious content creators, dietitians with online followings and people pushing their own gut health products.\n\nAs with many other trends, too much of a good thing has the potential to be a problem, with experts cautioning against going overboard. But most participants, at this point, are simply adding more fiber to their meals with intention, giving the fibermaxxing trend a rare accolade among internet fads: a seal of approval from nutrition experts.\n\n“This is a fun trend to see happening,” said Emily Haller, a registered dietitian. Most people do not eat enough fiber, which is good for your gut, heart and brain, she said.\n\n“A lot of times we see people obsessing about things that really don’t move the needle in terms of health,” Ms. Haller said, “whereas eating more plants and ingesting more fiber is going to have a positive health benefit.”\n\nFiber-rich diets are linked to numerous health benefits, including healthier guts and longer lives. And it’s a very satiating nutrient, meaning it can help you feel fuller longer, which can help with weight loss, said Kate Mintz, a registered dietitian at U.C.L.A. Health.\n\nOf course, loading up on fiber all at once, especially when you have not been including it in your meals, may leave you with bloating and discomfort, several nutrition experts said.\n\n“Many people don’t get enough fiber, but it’s just important to be thoughtful about how you’re doing it so that it’s not too much too fast,” Ms. Mintz said.",

    "description": "Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang thinks privileged Gen Z grads should lower their expectations if they want success.",
    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nWe are often told that setting the bar high is key to success. After all, if you shoot for the moon and miss, at least you’ll land with the stars. But Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang wants privileged Gen Z grads to lower their expectations.\n\n“People with very high expectations have very low resilience—and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,” Huang said during an interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “One of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.”\n\nIndeed, as the billionaire boss pointed out, those at elite institutions like Stanford probably have higher expectations for their future than your average Joe.\n\nThe university is one of the most selective in the United States—it ranks third best in the country, according to the QS World University Rankings, and the few students who get picked to study there are charged more than $68,000 in tuition fees for the premium, compared to the average $38,270 per annum cost.\n\nBut, unfortunately for those saddled with student debt, not even the best universities in the world can teach you resilience.\n\n“I don’t know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you,” Huang added.\n\nHuang’s advice for America’s next-gen elite comes from a place of experience: His life now is a world away from his childhood, which was, by his own admission, steeped in adversity.\n\nThe tech genius—who with a net worth of $155 billion is one of the world’s wealthiest people—was born in Taiwan in 1963 and spent the bulk of his early life in Thailand, before moving to the U.S. at 9 years old.\n\nHis serendipitous Stateside move came after his dad, who worked for an air conditioner manufacturer, did some training in the country and set his sights on the American Dream.\n\n“I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful on the one hand,” he said. “But there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering.”\n\nOne example of Huang’s hardship was his daily high school experience: The teenager had to cross a dangerous footbridge with missing planks over a river to get to his public school in Kentucky, where he was then relentlessly tormented.\n\n“The way you described Chinese people back then was ‘Ch-nks,’ ” Huang previously told the New Yorker, adding that bullies even tried to toss him off the bridge.\n\nIn the Stanford interview, he also credited his success and work ethic with his first job at Denny’s, where he was the “best dishwasher” before getting promoted to busboy and giving that his “best” also.\n\n“I never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,” Huang added. “Anyways, eventually I became a CEO. I’m still working on being a good CEO.”\n\nCoincidentally, it was at Denny’s where he cooked up the idea for a company that specialized in computer chips to render graphics, over a Super Bird sandwich with his friends Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The trio went on to cofound Nvidia, and the rest is history.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to never have personally experienced hardship growing up, Huang doesn’t have any advice on how to welcome more of it into your life now. But he did have some advice on embracing tough times.\n\n“I don’t know how to do it [but] for all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,” Huang said. “Greatness comes from character and character isn’t formed out of smart people—it’s formed out of people who suffered.”\n\nIt’s why despite Nvidia’s success—the company has a $2 trillion market cap—Huang would still welcome hardship at his organization.\n\n“To this day I use the phrase ‘pain and suffering’ inside our company with great glee,” he added. “I mean that in a happy way because you want to refine the character of your company.”\n\nEssentially, if you want your workforce to always be on their A game, don’t let them rest on their laurels.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on March 13, 2024.",

    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "fullText": "South Korea's It Boy, the Seventeen vocalist Joshua Hong, gave his fans something to scream about on Sunday night.\n\nThe first male K-pop star to attend the Golden Globes first strutted the red carpet in a slick black fit, accessorizing with silver Chaumet jewelry. Then he went backstage and met with two rising stars from the steamy hockey romance, \"Heated Rivalry,\" and caused a small meltdown on social media.\n\nConnor Storrie and Hudson Williams were seen in a video posted by MTV saying hello to Hong backstage, then posing for a photo together.\n\n\"Fellow Koreans!\" Williams was heard saying in MTV's video. Williams is half-Korean.\n\nStorrie and Williams were at the Globes to present the award for best female supporting actor in television. The duo is fresh off promotions for their HBO Max smash hit, which, thanks to the power of TikTok, has become one of the most popular releases of 2025 in terms of viewership.\n\nAfter footage of the backstage huddle was posted, X and Instagram were inundated with comments from both fandoms, with people saying they'd \"manifested\" the meeting after Hong's attendance at the awards ceremony was confirmed.\n\nHong said on the red carpet on Sunday that he hadn't seen the show, which is about a torrid love affair between two pro hockey players.\n\n\"A lot of fans have been recommending that to me, so, definitely gonna check it out,\" he said.\n\nThis might not be the last time this year that Hong's fans see him stateside, as he's now working with the California-based United Talent Agency in a bid to secure acting gigs. He's also still on tour with his band members in Seventeen, who hit up Southeast Asia in their next stops.",

    "title": "Despite getting flak for being woke and lazy, an exec at $62 billion giant Colgate says Gen Z workers are actually ‘pushing us to get better’",
    "description": "Sally Massey, the chief human resources officer at the $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive, is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be.",
    "fullText": "Stereotypes stick, and some bosses have already made up their minds on Gen Z workers. Oscar-winning star Jodie Foster slammed the young staffers she encountered on the set of True Detective as “really annoying, especially in the workplace,” while fellow actress Whoopi Goldberg claimed that Gen Zers “only want to work four hours” yet expect to live in comfort.\n\nBut the chief human resources officer at $62 billion giant Colgate-Palmolive is hitting back that young staffers aren’t the career sloths some typecast them to be. Sally Massey credits Gen Z as being ambitious, and incredibly tech savvy—critical skills that the consumer products company behind Colgate toothpaste and Irish Spring soap is looking for in talent.\n\n“[Gen Z] have grown up with technology. They’ve grown up in a very different way than some of the other generations in the organization,” the CHRO tells Fortune.\n\n“They bring with them new ideas, new perspectives, curiosity,” Massey adds. “They’re pushing us to get better and to do things differently—I think it’s great.”\n\nMassey admits that Gen Z are bringing their own distinct “perspectives and expectations” to the workplace. And with 34,000 Colgate employees spread out among four generations, bridging the divide between age groups is especially daunting. So to ensure that everyone is working in harmony, the exec is revamping the usual chain of command; Colgate’s top leaders are hearing out entry-level staffers, stimulating the flow of ideas between ranks and generations to generate the best possible outcome.\n\n“We’re not siloed by generation or tenure, the senior leaders at Colgate want to hear ideas and thoughts from the more junior employees,” Massey says. “It’s how we get better, because as you get more senior, you can get further away. So it’s important for all of us to stay close, connected, and to learn from each other—regardless of the role.”\n\nMassey’s not alone. Not all employers have given up on hiring Gen Zers—despite headlines that suggest otherwise. In fact, many are still scoping out young talent with standout AI skills.\n\nEmily Glassberg Sands, Stripe’s head of data and AI, revealed she’s all-in on hiring recent graduates at the $91.5 billion financial services company. Just like Massey, she singled out Gen Z’s tech adaptability as one of the in-demand skills she’s looking for in Stripe employees.\n\n“I’m actually hiring more new grads—now, they’re largely new grad PhDs—but more new grads than ever before,” Glassberg Sands said on the Forward Future podcast last year. “Because they have the cutting edge skills, and they come in with fresh ideas, and they know how to think, and they know how to use the latest tools.”\n\nEven when young employees drive their bosses up the wall, CEOs are still embracing Gen Z as movers and shakers. Matt Huang, the cofounder of the $12 billion crypto investment firm Paradigm, is all too familiar with the temperament of young workers. The company’s first hire, then-19-year-old college dropout Charlie Noyes, once showed up five hours late to his first 10 a.m. meeting. The business has also embraced Gen Z-coded, unorthodox ways of choosing its top executives; Paradigm’s chief technology officer, Georgios Konstantopoulos, was discovered on a Discord server while he was still a teenager.\n\nHiring these innovative—albeit, sometimes finicky—Gen Zers may sound like a gamble for traditional workplaces. The Paradigm CEO admitted that the young staffers can come with drawbacks, but the value they generate is worth any havoc they wreak in the office.\n\n“They create an absurd amount of chaos sometimes and you want to pull your hair out,” Huang told Colossus Review last year. “But then you see what they can do and it’s like, holy crap. Nobody else in the world could do that.”\n\nEven the seasoned business experts teaching legions of Gen Z students are cutting in on criticism. Suzy Welch, a best-selling author and professor of management practice at New York University, hit back against those who brand the young generation lazy by reminiscing on her career journey. The baby boomer professor recalled having hope that she could one day be more successful than her parents—but for Gen Zers, that dream of prosperity is out of reach. Welch encouraged bosses to empathize with their unique job and economic vulnerabilities.\n\n“Gen Z [has] no reason to believe that they’re ever going to have economic security,” Welch said on a podcast last year. “I don’t know about you, but I’m old enough that when I was in college, I thought ‘For sure, I’m going to have more money than my parents.’ And that ‘If I work very very hard I’m going to buy a house someday,’ and this was the assumption.”\n\n“A lot of Gen Z [are] just saying ‘I’m not even sure we’re going to be alive in 20 years because of global warming,’” Welch continued. “And ‘The world is probably going to end anyway because of the stupidity of decisions your generations made.’”\n\nMillionaire podcaster and former CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins also came to Gen Z’s defense. In response to stereotypes that young people are anxious, addicted to social media, and lazy, she posed one question: “Have you stopped to consider what it’s like to be a twentysomething today?” Chances are if critics try and envision stepping into their shoes, they’ll be met with the harsh reality that Gen Zers are under immense stress and pressure that didn’t exist just five years ago.\n\n“The world is in chaos—and most twentysomethings had parents that lived in a very predictable, stable economy,” Robbins said in a TikTok video posted last year. “They went to a corporate job, they reported to the office, they had a network of friends at work. That’s not the typical 20-year-old experience.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "Gen Z’s hiring nightmare is real. These are the curveball questions CEOs are asking to catch out job seekers: ‘Design a car for a deaf person’",
    "description": "Gen Z’s hiring nightmare is real. With fewer jobs and fiercer competition, employers are using curveball interview questions to separate candidates from the pack.",
    "fullText": "It’s no secret that getting a new job is hard, with candidates constantly complaining about the endless hoops that recruiters are making them jump through to prove they’re the perfect match, from endless rounds of interviews to 90-minute tests and presentations.\n\nBut for young people in particular, the challenge is even steeper. About a fifth of Gen Zers worldwide are classified as “NEETs” and are currently locked out of the job market. Last year in the U.K. alone, more than 1.2 million applications were submitted for fewer than 17,000 graduate roles.\n\nEven Goldman economists have admitted Gen Z’s hiring nightmare is real—and it isn’t going away anytime soon.\n\nAs millions of Gen Zers face unemployment and entry-level office roles becoming scarcer, hiring managers are being forced to get creative to find the very best candidates. So Fortune has rounded up the curveball make-or-break interview questions now shaping hiring decisions.\n\nDo you think we’re in an AI bubble? Even the experts who’ve predicted past crashes can’t seem to agree. But if you’re looking for a job right now, your opinion on all this could decide whether you get the job. Dave McCann, IBM’s managing partner for EMEA, says he now throws the curveball question in interviews as a make-or-break test.\n\nThere’s no right or wrong answer, but actually knowing where you stand could give you an edge and pique the exec’s interest. McCann doesn’t care which side you pick—he cares whether you’ve thought it through.\n\nLyft CEO David Risher likes to ask candidates: “Design a car for a deaf person.” The curveball question may sound unusual, but for Risher, it’s a quick way to “suss out” whether a candidate can put themselves in the shoes of a customer—and he got the idea from his time working with Jeff Bezos.\n\n“I want to see the candidate close their eyes and ears and imagine what that feels like, then be able to describe the experience to me in detail, including what someone in that position might need,” Risher said. “That’s how I know I’ve got someone who can build great customer-obsessed experiences.”\n\nThe question that turns its head on the interviewee and enables them to put the hiring manager in the hot seat isn’t an unusual one. But for Twilio’s CEO Khozema Shipchandler, it’s what comes next that matters most.\n\nIf your answer is a blank stare or “Nope, I’m fine,” consider yourself on thin ice.\n\n“The number one red flag for me is when someone doesn’t ask questions towards the end of an interview,” Shipchandler exclusively told Fortune. “That’s a pretty significant mark against them being curious about what they’re interviewing, the company, the way we might work together, chemistry, culture, all of those things.”\n\nAnd Denny’s CEO Kelli Valade echoed that it doesn’t really matter what you ask employers at the end of the interview—the fact that you do ask something shows you did your homework, are seriously interested and is a big green flag.\n\nPicture this: You’ve spent hours applying for the dream job and sitting through multiple interviews. Finally, you think you’ve won over the hiring manager when they ask, “when can you start?”\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking the right answer, is “straight away.” After all, you want to seem eager. But Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of U.S. trade association Consumer Technology Association, revealed that he turns candidates down who say they’re available within two weeks. “They don’t get the job, because they’ll treat us the way they treat that former employer.”\n\nIt’s not just what you say in the interview that could cost you the job. Hiring managers are also watching what you do—as early as when you walk through the revolving doors and great reception. They’re looking at how you treat staff before and after your interview, as well as, what you do with the coffee (or tea) cup you were drinking from. Hint: offering to clean it up will go down will.\n\nOther hiring managers take their prospective new hires out for a lunch interview and watch for whether they season their food before taking a bite. Why? Because putting salt (or anything) on your food before tasting it is the equivalent of judging a book by its cover and apparently, highlights a lack of patience.\n\nThat’s not all. They’re also testing you for how quickly you order, whether you wait for others to sit before sitting down to eat, the price of the items you order, and how you treat wait staff.\n\nOne consultant even revealed on X that he knows a CEO who goes as far as taking candidates for breakfast and secretly asking the servers to mess up their order “to see how they’d react.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "The college-to-office path is dead: CEO of the world’s biggest recruiter says Gen Z grads need to consider trade and hospitality jobs that don’t even require degrees",
    "description": "Struggling Gen Z and millennial grads should consider turning their back on their degrees and retraining to become hospitality and trade workers, Randstad’s CEO warns.",
    "fullText": "Millions of Gen Zers are facing unemployment as entry-level office roles get absorbed by AI, and millennials are regretting taking out thousands in student loans for careers that now have significantly diminished prospects. Now, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company, Randstad, has confirmed what many young grads are already fearing: The traditional college-to-office pipeline is dead.\n\n“People need to reflect on—taking a student loan, going to college and being trained or educated for a profession that is rapidly changing—whether that’s still the right path,” Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, told Fortune.\n\n“We all grew up, with our parents saying, ‘go do something in college or university and then do something in an office,’ that path that used to work for a long time is starting to break,” he added.\n\n“You already see that with the graduates finding it harder to find a job. You see that in professions like marketing, communications, design… just look at how good AI already is at some of that.”\n\nUnder his helm, the staffing company places around half a million workers in jobs every week—and he has bad news for those who have already forked out thousands for their degree in the hopes of nabbing a cushy office role: You may have more luck landing bartending, barista, or building jobs.\n\nTech leaders have consistently warned that AI is already as good as entry-level workers and that it could halve white-collar jobs by 2030. In fact, a “first-of-its-kind” Stanford University study has warned that the new technology is already having “significant and disproportionate impact” on Gen Z. Bartenders and baristas are even seeing bigger pay raises than desk workers, right now.\n\n“Jobs will change—and are changing—but also new jobs will emerge,” van ’t Noordende echoed. “There is a massive demand in skilled trades, mechanical engineers, machine operators, maintenance engineers, forklift drivers, truck drivers—you name it.”\n\nWith the white-collar job market seemingly frozen, van ’t Noordende said it’s no longer “good advice” to tell young people to follow their passions.\n\n“No, learn a craft or a trade or a skill or a profession, where you can make a good living and provide for you and your family, is much better advice than follow your passion.”\n\nFurther making his case: The U.K. government has just announced it’ll be splurging $965 million into apprenticeships to help place tens of thousands of unemployed young people into the jobs that they think are the future—and they’re all in hospitality, retail, and AI.\n\nBut for those hell-bent on going to college, van ’t Noordende stressed that STEM subjects—which are studied in China at twice the rate of the U.S. and parts of Europe—will likely remain in demand.\n\nAnd his advice to those who’ve already wasted time and money on a degree that’s dwindling in relevance? “Retrain. Learning new skills always good.”\n\n“Look around you, and where you see the opportunities that match with your skills and your background and go there,” van ’t Noordende added. But he warned that at some point, you may just “have to bite the bullet and say, ‘Okay, this is not working.’”\n\nThe CEO stressed that you’re not alone; many people are currently doing exactly that. And that ultimately, going from a desk job to becoming a plumber, teacher, or nurse, van ’t Noordende says, requires a mindset shift. It’s not a failure if you end up doing work outside your field of study—it’s just adjusting to what actually works. “You have to come off your chair and build skills,” he added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "title": "Bank of America CEO confirms Gen Z’s hiring nightmare is real: He just hired 2,000 recent grads from 200,000 applications",
    "description": "Brian Moynihan says the fears are understandable, but urges young grads not to lose hope about the job market.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan says the headlines about Gen Z’s fears about AI and the job market are real.\n\nThe bank recently hired 2,000 top grads from 200,000 applications, the executive said in an interview with CBS News‘ Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation. As companies cite AI for widespread layoffs, Moynihan acknowledges that many young people feel scared and uncertain about the future.\n\n“My advice to those kids, if you ask them if they’re worried about, they say they’re worried about—these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people.” Moynihan added that “if you ask them if they’re scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I say, harness it … It’ll be your world ahead of you,” Moynihan said.\n\nMoynihan said it’s too soon to say how AI will play out in the job market, but he hopes to use efficiencies created by the technology to invest in more growth.\n\n“We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent—the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think,” he said.\n\nMoynihan also said Americans are focusing too much on the Fed and its impact on the economy. He argued that the private sector is a more important driver of economic growth.\n\n“The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we’ve gotten out of whack,” he said.\n\nJerome Powell and multiple economists have validated that Gen Z is facing a genuine “hiring nightmare,” especially for recent college graduates trying to land their first white-collar job. This is tied to a low‑hire, low‑fire labor market, the rapid automation of entry‑level roles, and a tech industry whose workforce is getting older as Gen Z’s presence shrinks.\n\nIn September 2025, Powell used his post‑meeting press conference to highlight an “interesting labor market” where “kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs.” He emphasized that the job-finding rate is “very, very low” even as layoffs remain subdued, creating a stagnant low‑hiring, low‑firing environment that is particularly punishing for new entrants. Asked whether AI was to blame, he called it “probably a factor” but not the main driver, suggesting that slower overall job creation plus some AI substitution is squeezing young workers at precisely the moment they try to get on the ladder.\n\nEmployers are using AI to automate the predictable, process‑heavy tasks that once justified many junior roles, especially in corporate and tech settings. Platforms that track early‑career hiring, like Handshake, point to a double squeeze: entry‑level job postings in corporate roles are down roughly 15% year over year, while references to “AI” in job descriptions have jumped about 400% over two years. Economists like Dartmouth’s David Blanchflower tell Fortune that even when young people do find work, they report rising “despair” and a pervasive “this job sucks” sentiment, compounding the effect of higher recent‑grad unemployment rates compared with the national average.",

    "fullText": "Platform is now Britain’s fourth most visited social media site as users seek out human-generated content\n\nReddit, the online discussion platform, has overtaken TikTok as Britain’s fourth most visited social media service, as search algorithms and gen Z have dramatically transformed its prominence.\n\nThe platform has undergone huge growth over the last two years, with an 88% increase in the proportion of UK internet users it reaches. Three in five Brits online now encounter the site, up from a third in 2023, according to Ofcom.\n\nIts popularity is rising fastest with younger internet users. It is now the sixth most visited organisation of any kind by UK users aged between 18 and 24, up from 10th a year earlier. More than three-quarters of that cohort now visit it.\n\nThe rapid growth marks a shift in the site’s standing, with its numerous forums once seen as arenas for hostile exchanges between largely anonymous users. The UK is a boom market for the platform, with the second largest user base behind the US, according to company records.\n\nA series of factors are behind its rise. However, a change in Google’s search algorithms last year to prioritise helpful content from discussion forums appears to have been a significant driver.\n\nA recent deal with Google that allows the company to train its AI model on Reddit’s content also appears to have provided a boost. Reddit is the most-cited source for Google AI overviews, which is likely to see more people directed to its forums. It has a similar deal with OpenAI, which owns the most popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nThe company believes it is also benefiting from shifting internet habits, as younger users seek out human-generated reviews and opinions on issues including parenting, skincare and sports.\n\nMore than half its UK users are women. Internal company research suggests 71% of women on Reddit in the UK have a personal interest in skincare, beauty and cosmetics, prompting higher traffic for specific UK Reddit forums on those issues, known as subreddits.\n\n“Reddit started with this perception, rightfully so, for a male skew – gaming and tech as the anchor,” said Jen Wong, Reddit’s chief operating officer, who said she spent a lot of time in the UK gardening subreddit. “Reddit has become very diverse – it is gender-balanced in the UK now … what’s interesting is that one in three are gen Z women on the platform.\n\n“Gen Z are very open to looking online for advice around these life stage moments, like leaving home and renting for the first time, which happens a little bit later for some of this generation. It’s a very safe place to ask questions about balancing a cheque book, or how to pay for a wedding.”\n\nUK subreddits on pregnancy and parenting have doubled in size over the last year.\n\nThere is also a growing trend for supporters of Premier League clubs to watch games while logged on to their team’s subreddit. The Premier League subreddit has grown by more than a billion views in the last year, according to company records.\n\nIt also appears to be a popular discussion ground for women’s football, which has less dedicated coverage than the men’s game. There has been a doubling of views for subreddits covering Arsenal’s women’s team and the Lionesses in the last year.\n\nWong said the company was focused on convincing users to come straight to the platform, rather than via a search result. She also touted Reddit as an antidote to AI-generated content.\n\n“You see these accidents of AI slop and AI advice – Reddit doesn’t have that,” she said. “It’s not clean. It’s messy, in that it has lots of different pieces of advice that you have to sift through. It’s not manicured down to one answer for you, but that’s kind of the point.”\n\nAmid the rise in prominence of the site, the UK government has launched its own account, UKGovNews, in the last year. It has posted about the cost of living, rail ticket prices and immigration. Steve Reed, the housing secretary, recently held an “ask me anything” session.\n\nConfrontational exchanges are still easy to find on the platform. Wong said it was part of the site’s culture but that all subreddits had their own rules and moderators.\n\n“Reddit is really honest and I think that’s one of the things that makes Reddit,” she said. “Every person who joins Reddit is a moderator, because you get to vote up or down on a post – and a down vote is incredibly powerful. ‘Be civil’ is one of the most common rules in communities.”",

    "description": "Gen Z is redefining drinking culture to skip hangovers entirely, prioritizing non-alcoholic options and THC drinks over a traditional boozy night out.",
    "fullText": "Gen Z drinks like they've got plans tomorrow.\n\nIt's no secret that young adults are drinking less than previous generations, and they're doing it deliberately. Rather than swearing off alcohol entirely, many Gen Z consumers are \"zebra striping\" — alternating their alcoholic drinks with nonalcoholic, functional, or THC-infused beverage options — to stay social without the next-day hangover.\n\n\"People still want to feel something,\" Jon Kreidler, cofounder of Tattersall Distilling Company, told Business Insider. \"They still want to partake and have something adult and feel something different to help them relax, help them calm down. But a lot of people, especially younger consumers, are just fed up with the hangovers and the negative effects, and so they're shifting away from alcohol.\"\n\nLaurel Tiedeman, a 28-year-old from San Diego, told Business Insider she has a ritual on nights she drinks to stave off hangovers. First, she downs a \"big glass of salty electrolytes\" and has a snack — usually a sandwich or eggs on toast.\n\nWhen she does drink, Tiedeman said she prioritizes quality alcohol, like quadruple-distilled vodkas or high-end whiskeys. Then, she likes to zebra stripe.\n\n\"I'll have an alcoholic drink, and then a Diet Coke, another alcoholic drink, and then a water, repeat,\" Tiedeman said. \"I love the caffeine boost from the Diet Coke, and it still feels like a fun drink to have while out.\"\n\nOnce home, she has more electrolytes, then another snack, calling the process her \"golden ticket\" to hangover prevention, and a key part of how she plans ahead to make her night out feel celebratory and indulgent, without risking any ill effects the next day.\n\nAshleigh Ewald, a 23-year-old from Georgia, has a similar process, alternating sips of water from her Owala bottle for every sip of alcohol she takes during a night out, as part of a conscious effort to prevent getting drunk. In her friend group, she told Business Insider that avoiding hangovers reflects their values, being goal-oriented, and a mindset shift \"where fun doesn't have to come with a hangover.\"\n\n\"A lot of us would rather pace ourselves, zebra stripe, or skip alcohol entirely than lose a whole day recovering,\" Ewald said, adding that \"not wanting a hangover isn't about being boring — it's about wanting energy for your life the next day.\"\n\nFor many young adults, a hangover isn't just unpleasant. It's financially draining, as alcoholic drinks increasingly cost upward of $15 a piece, and nursing a headache after a big night out simultaneously eats into work, side hustles, or already-limited free time.\n\nSearch and social media momentum for \"zebra striping\" is up 30% year-over-year, and \"no hangover Gen Z\" is up over 101% in the same timeframe, according to data from Tastewise, a consumer intelligence platform for food brands. The shift reflects broader changes in how Gen Z approaches nightlife, wellness, and control, fueling the rise of mindful bars, mocktail menus, and drinks marketed for benefits beyond a buzz.\n\nIt's Gen Z's preferences around alcohol that prompted Tattersall Distilling Company, a high-end craft distillery, to start experimenting with THC and CBD drinks, Kreidler told Business Insider.\n\n\"Younger drinkers are just not drinking as much alcohol, and we've definitely felt it,\" Kreidler said. \"It wasn't until the bottled THC beverages started popping up, and people started asking us to bottle them, that we really started to dig in. And then when we started, it was just kind of shocking, the shift.\"\n\nKreidler added that older consumers are also starting to pivot toward THC beverages. He said that other adaptogens, which are plants and mushrooms that proponents argue support overall well-being and help the body respond to stress — such as ashwagandha, ginseng, and reishi — are also gaining popularity as consumers seek mood-altering effects without the use of alcohol.\n\nMajor alcohol companies, such as Heineken and AB InBev, have expanded their alcohol-free offerings in recent years, which have bolstered sales. Search interest for \"alcohol alternatives,\" \"THC drinks,\" and \"ashwagandha drink\" has steadily increased over the last five years.\n\n\"I think that's where the next wave is: drinking things that, maybe, will help your gut, or your mind in general — calm you down, relax you,\" Kreidler said. \"We're adding these things to foods and drinks that people just didn't even think were possible before.\"\n\nThere's money to be made in the burgeoning better-for-you market. In May, PepsiCo acquired prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion. A similar trend is emerging in the protein snack market, as brands rush to establish themselves as the next big name by serving up smaller portions of healthier foods.\n\nThe shift isn't solely about seeking out more functional ingredients. Gen Z's broader approach to risk-taking, both independently and in their relationships, also influences how — and how much — they drink.\n\nLaura Fenton, a research associate at the University of Sheffield's School of Medicine and Population Health, who studies youth drinking behavior, said that Gen Z is \"on the whole, more risk-averse than previous generations, and we see the decline in youth drinking as kind of a reflection of that kind of risk aversion.\"\n\nGen Z talks openly about avoiding drinking and driving, even when alcohol consumption is minimal. Fenton said that many young adults view social responsibility and avoiding risky behavior as a core part of their identity — a stark contrast to the individualistic norms of earlier generations.\n\n\"They're also more aware of the effects of things on their bodies, on their health, and so they're just a much more conscious consumer, which I think is one of the drivers of their drinking less,\" IWSR president Marten Lodewijks told Business Insider. IWSR is a global provider of drinks data and insights.\n\n\"It's not that they just don't want to drink,\" Lodewiks said. \"They enjoy it, and they enjoy it as much as other generations. It's just that they're conscious that it's not good for them, and so they don't do it as frequently.\"\n\nIn many Gen Z communities, avoiding excess isn't seen as restrictive — it's seen as responsible, self-aware, and even aspirational.\n\n\"It's about self-accountability,\" 23-year-old Ewald said. \"In my social circle, we don't have to worry about hangovers because we wouldn't let ourselves get to a place to experience that. Some of my friends have experienced them; they've drunk a lot or partied hard, but they want to make sure they learn from their mistakes.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about generational trends related to drinking or sobriety?

    "description": "A Pinterest executive said Gen Z uses the platform to figure out their aesthetic, which means looking at interview outfits or dorm room ideas.",
    "fullText": "Millennials use Pinterest for finding the right wall art for their living rooms. Gen Z is using it to figure out who they are.\n\nAyumi Nakajima, a senior director at Pinterest in Singapore, who heads the company's Asia-Pacific content partnerships, told Business Insider that Gen Z use Pinterest very differently from older cohorts.\n\nGen Z is a big deal for Pinterest. The age group makes up 50% of the platform's 600 million monthly active users globally, a company representative told Business Insider.\n\nNakajima said that what she loves about Gen Z is that they value self-discovery and use Pinterest as a means to that end.\n\n\"For millennials, if you ask them what their styles or preferences were, you'd get a cheerleader or an athlete, or nerdy or gothic — you had sort of one label that you had to fit into,\" Nakajima said. \"With our Gen Z audience, we're seeing that it's very different.\"\n\n\"So they're much more multifaceted, in that it's OK to be many of these things. A lot of what Gen Z users are searching for is things to do with aesthetics,\" she added.\n\nShe said that while millennials like herself are more likely to look for project-based inspiration on Pinterest, such as home renovations and wedding decor, Gen Zers are using it in a more targeted manner.\n\n\"For Gen Zs, instead of business casual, they might be looking for interview outfits,\" she said. \"So even within the fashion category, we've seen different search terms trending across the generations.\"\n\n\"If it's in the home decor category, it's more about dorm room designs, or small room decor, for Gen Z,\" Nakajima added.\n\nShe said other search terms popular among Gen Z include journaling, Minecraft layouts, Labubu, and charm bracelets.\n\nCollectible items like Labubu dolls, Lego sets, and Pokémon cards have exploded in popularity in recent years, as adults around the world turn to buying toys out of nostalgia.\n\n\"It's about what your hobbies are, and it's not about comparing yourself to others or worrying about how others perceive you,\" she said. \"I think that's part of the magic of Pinterest, and also what keeps Gen Zs coming back.\"",

    "description": "Gen Z isn’t shy about splurging—whether it’s doom spending for a dopamine hit, spoiling their pets, or splashing out on rent. But soon they’ll actually have the financial power to afford it.",
    "fullText": "Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance. Before joining the Success desk, she co-authored Fortune’s CHRO Daily newsletter, extensively covering the workplace and the future of jobs. Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master’s degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies.\n\nGen Z is living the paycheck-to-paycheck twenties lifestyle—splurging on high rent costs and dishing out 99-cent ramen noodles. Yet in just a decade, they’ll be the most powerful economic force.\n\nOnly two years ago, Gen Z had amassed $9 trillion in income, but by 2030 they’re expected to have $36 trillion. And by 2040, that number rises to $74 trillion. A 2025 Bank of America report showed this will place them as the richest—and largest—generation by 2035, as Gen Z is expected to grow to 30% of the global population in the next decade.\n\nGen Z’s projected economic dominance can feel worlds away from their current economic situation. But there might be light at the end of the tunnel as they climb up the corporate ladder and take on their family’s inheritance.\n\nMany young people are strapped for cash, stepping out of college and into an uncertain job market. Gen Zers are having to turn down job opportunities because they can’t afford commuting expenses. They’re spoiling their pets in lieu of having children, which have become too expensive to raise, and abandoning the pipe dream of purchasing a home—unless they receive an inheritance.\n\nGen Z is also struggling with holding down a job. Young households receiving unemployment surged 32% year over year in February, according to the report. But it’s not for a lack of trying, despite the naysayers. The report said Gen Zers are “overeducated and underemployed,” and amid a tough white-collar labor market, unemployment for new entrants was up over 9% year over year in February. This results in Gen Z taking gigs that they may be overqualified or not the right fit for, which can have long-term career ramifications.\n\nYet in just 10 years, this could all flip on its head. The Bank of America report noted that wage growth for Gen Z increased by 8% year over year in February. A part of this bump can be attributed to the generation finally entering the full-time job market, leading to higher wages. But the biggest contributing factor in their financial boost is the Great Wealth Transfer, expected to hit Gen Z bank accounts in the years to come.\n\nWith the odds stacked against them, Gen Z’s best bet on living comfortably is coming into wealth.\n\nAbout $84 trillion is anticipated to pass down from seniors and baby boomers to Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z by 2045, according to a 2021 report from Cerulli Associates. Most of the money will be handed over to Gen X and millennials—but 38% of Gen Z still anticipate they will receive an inheritance, according to a separate survey.\n\nGen Z’s share of the pie, alongside their stark wage increases, will lead to a ballooning of their economic power. Even in the current day, the young generation is a force to be reckoned with. They have higher discretionary spending habits compared to others, and their global spending is expected to reach $12.6 trillion by 2030, compared to $2.7 trillion in 2024. Their spending growth per household has also been stronger than the overall population, including both necessity and discretionary spending, according to the report.\n\nThere’s a few reasons why Gen Z spends so much of their money: They’re pouring funds into their high rents and education costs; “doom spending” on essentials and small luxuries, instead of saving up for bigger investments that feel unattainable; and trying to escape their high credit card and student loan debt.\n\nBut businesses should take note: Once Gen Zers have money to burn, they’ll be in the driver’s seat of the economy. Companies are already taking note of their preferences: luxury, e-commerce, wellness and beauty, and pets. Gen Z is also deeply invested in fintech, new media, gaming, and big tech, according to the Bank of America report. Their tastes will shape which business will thrive in 2035.\n\n“It’s likely they will be among the most disruptive generations to economies, markets, and social systems,” the Bank of America report says. “Whether it’s due to changing diets or reduced alcohol consumption or saving and housing, Gen Z will redefine what it means to be a U.S. consumer.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 17, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nTrying to summarize every job you’ve ever had and then distill that onto a two-page résumé has been the bane of job hunter’s existence since around the 1950s. Fortunately, for Gen Z, it’s something they might never have to bore themselves with.\n\nThat’s because research shows many companies are moving away from relying on the traditional job application requirement.\n\nIn fact, almost three-quarters of companies now use skills-based assessments throughout their hiring process, according to TestGorilla’s The State of Skills-Based Hiring 2023 report which surveyed 3,000 employees and employers around the world. This is up from 56% in the previous year.\n\nAlthough many of those employers are still also using CVs, it might not be long until they’re a thing of the past because most bosses are already favoring the new hiring practice and reporting big results.\n\nThe employers surveyed who use skills-based hiring—which includes role-specific skills assessments, instead of simply scanning someone’s listed career experience—reported massive gains.\n\nAccording to TestGorilla’s research, it reduced the number of mis-hires by 88%, total time spent searching for the perfect candidate by 82%, and hiring-related costs by 74%.\n\nOverall, 92% of the employers surveyed reported that skills-based hiring is more effective at identifying talented candidates than a traditional CV. Meanwhile, over 80% said it’s more predictive of on-job success and leads to new hires staying longer in their roles.\n\nAs Khyati Sundaram, CEO of the skill-based recruitment platform Applied, previously told Fortune, just because someone has listed on their résumé that they’ve worked with the SEO team at somewhere alluring like Google, it doesn’t actually mean they know the ins and outs of search engine optimization to the extent that’s required for a role.\n\n“We are trying to make sure the test or the question is as relevant to the job as possible,” Sundaram said, adding, “That’s the reason that candidates love it too.”\n\nIntuitively people may assume that taking multiple skills-based tests would feel like more of a nuisance for job seekers than simply blasting their CV at hundreds of roles—but the data shows otherwise.\n\nMost of the workers that TestGorilla surveyed think that skills-based hiring levels the playing field and improves their chances of bagging their dream jobs.\n\nThis is especially true for candidates who are often overlooked. In fact, around three-quarters of the Black, Asian, and Arab employees that TestGorilla surveyed have already reportedly gained access to new employment opportunities through skills-based assessments.\n\nThe uptick in skills-based hiring comes as degrees have slidden down the priority list for employers.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple previously eliminated their long-held degree requirements to remove barriers to entry and recruit more diverse talent. Meanwhile, recruiters globally are five times more likely to search for new hires by skills over higher education.\n\nA former Cisco top executive in the U.K. also said young aspiring workers would be better off skipping out on college to join the world of work straight away.\n\n“In university, you come out with whatever degree you may get, but it’s almost certainly saddled with debt,” David Meads, former Cisco’s U.K. and Ireland CEO, told Fortune. “Is that better than on-the-job experience where you’re rotating through different parts of our organization, and living the reality and not just the theory?”\n\n“For me, attitude and aptitude are more important than whatever letters you have after your name, or whatever qualifications you’ve got on a sheet,” he added.\n\nBut research has shown that skeptical Gen Z remain unconvinced: They’re shunning apprenticeship schemes in favor of going down the traditional route of college. So perhaps they will still go through the bore of writing a résumé—even if, like a college degree, it’s no longer needed.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on November 23, 2023.",

    "title": "Gen Z is talking openly about sobriety — and the stories are darker than you think",
    "description": "They’re sober, in their 20s and sharing it all — hospital stays, blackouts and rehab — online.",
    "fullText": "\"I'm either going to get sober or die.” This was the startling realization Parker Schley came to after his battle with alcoholism reached what he describes as the point of no return. “I couldn’t continue like that,” Schley, 26, tells Yahoo. “I was asking to die, basically.”\n\nSchley, who works as an assistant property manager in Virginia, represents a growing number of Gen Z-ers (born between 1997 and 2012) who are openly discussing their relationship with alcohol and their journeys to sobriety online. A quick search of \"sobriety in your 20s\" on TikTok yields thousands upon thousands of videos of people talking candidly about giving up drinking alcohol at a young age. The public-facing nature of this phenomenon stands in stark contrast to the narratives portraying Gen Z as teetotaler totalitarians.\n\nSure, Gen Z is drinking less than previous generations, but they are still susceptible to the perils of addiction, notes Daniel Siconolfi, a behavioral and social scientist at RAND whose research includes the sober-curious movement and social challenges like Dry January.\n\n\"Gen Z is drinking less in young adulthood than millennials (born between 1981and 1996) or Gen X ( born between 1965 and 1980) did. In fact, 20% to 30% of Gen Z adults don't drink at all,\" Siconolfi says. \"That said, young adults in their 20s still have the highest rates of risky drinking and are the least likely to receive treatment compared to other age groups.”\n\nThis reluctance to seek help is largely due to the shame and judgment surrounding sobriety and rehab. But with the help of social media, many Gen Z-ers are pushing back against these stigmas. From recurring ER visits to frat party crashouts, these young creators are coming clean about their rocky relationships with alcohol, for all the world to see.\n\n\"I was waking up at the hospital with complete alcohol poisoning — unconscious, shallow breathing and my lips turning blue,\" Schley says of one particularly pivotal night out during his senior year of college at the University of New Hampshire. But he brushed off his hospital stay as a one-off — not a warning sign.\n\nOn his page, Schley details experiences like this and traces back to the start of his drinking issues. He says he was always aware of the dangers of alcohol but was naive to how it could, and would, affect him. \"I thought that was for other people to worry about. That wasn't going to happen to me,\" he says.\n\nBut as soon as those first few sips of chilled raspberry Smirnoff passed his lips at a high school homecoming party during his freshman year, Schley was hooked.\n\n\"I fell in love with alcohol the very first time,\" says Schley, adding that drinking helped him silence the noise that plagued him as a closeted gay man. \"Alcohol took away the stress from that. When I was drinking it was easier to be me.”\n\nLike many of his Gen Z peers, Schley, who got sober in February, was blessed with the gift of digital gab and has no qualms about sharing the raw, vulnerable realities of his sobriety journey with his 87K TikTok followers. The decision to share online might seem scary at first, but Schley says that being able to use his platform to help others has been life-changing.\n\n\"I got a message from someone's dad that was like, 'I used to blame myself so much for not being there for my son, and you helped me realize that he wasn't ready to accept that he had an issue, and there wasn't much that I could have done to save him from his struggles with alcohol,'\" Schley says. \"That was a really cool message to get, because my relationship with my dad was about to be done before I went to rehab, so to be able to have helped not only the kid that's going through it but someone in his family as well is the biggest gift I could ever ask for.”\n\nSiconolfi agrees that there are real benefits to sharing these stories online. \"Social media can be a powerful space for information, connection and social support, whether someone is just reassessing their relationship with alcohol or seeking treatment for alcohol-use disorder,\" he says.\n\nAlkhuzama Zaini, a 24-year-old college student living in Virginia, says posting about going sober helps keep her accountable. Like Schley, Zaini's relationship with alcohol started pretty early. \"My junior year of high school, I was 15, and there was a big football game and my friends and I pregamed,” she tells Yahoo. “I ended up getting alcohol poisoning at the game, and the ambulance had to come.” The consequences of this infraction were swift: Zaini was suspended from school for five days, which also caused a rift between her and her family.\n\n\"My family is from Saudi Arabia, and I come from a Muslim family, so it was a big deal within my culture and my religion,\" she says. Still, she continued to drink, and her relationship with alcohol only soured further when she went to college.\n\nOne night, Zaini got so drunk that she blacked out and had to be told what had happened by her friends.\n\n\"Apparently, I got so drunk I threw up on this frat guy's lap, and he had to drive me home and the dorm RA had to call 911,\" says Zaini. This hazy night landed her in the hospital, where she recalls having significant trouble breathing and throwing up acid.\n\nBut she still wasn’t ready to give up booze. \"The next day after I got out of the hospital, I was drinking at a football tailgate. I guess I took it as a joke. But it wasn't,\" says Zaini. It wasn't until her personal relationships with friends and family members started to fracture that she decided to go to rehab this past summer.\n\n\"I knew I wanted to go to rehab because it was either get sober or death for me,\" says Zaini, adding that she was flunking out of school and hiding the extent of her drinking from those closest to her. \"I was drinking full handles [half-gallons] a day, hiding the bottles and lying about it. Now I'm just so grateful that we're all still good friends now.” She’s back on track at school too and will be graduating in 2026.\n\nFor many people, sobriety is a lifetime commitment. But in some cases, it can be a temporary change to help reevaluate existing behaviors with alcohol. This approach is a less-intimidating avenue for some Gen Z-ers who have more apprehensions regarding full-on sobriety.\n\nEmily Gleason, 27, is one of them. She grew up seeing unhealthy relationships with alcohol throughout her entire childhood and early adolescence, which made her hesitant to drink at all. Even when she started drinking occasionally, she was always hyper-aware of the negative ways in which it impacted her.\n\n\"Most weekends I would go out with my friends, party, all the things that most college people do. But even then, I knew I really didn't like the way I'd feel when I was hungover or the things I'd do or say when I was drunk,\" Gleason tells Yahoo.\n\nIt wasn't until 2020, when the pandemic forced her to move back in with her parents, that she had to reconcile with the behaviors that shaped her relationship with drinking.\n\n\"That was the household in which the alcoholism was prevalent in my childhood, and it still is prevalent,” Gleason says. “Seeing it as an adult, it was like I had to confront that, and that's when I started to look at drinking as a question in my life.” This questioning is something Gleason is still playing around with. She currently still drinks occasionally, but she did have a period of sobriety for about a year.\n\n\"Now I've matured to a point where I have a very healthy boundary and relationship with alcohol, where I don't need to be 100% sober,” she says. “But alcohol is definitely not a big part of my life at all.”",

    "description": "The tech billionaire said there would be “a lot of cool stuff” for 20-year-olds to build now.",
    "fullText": "Nino Paoli is a former Dow Jones News Fund news fellow at Fortune.\n\nSam Altman, one of the most powerful leaders in Silicon Valley, is jealous of Gen Z college dropouts.\n\n“I’m envious of the current generation of 20-year-old dropouts,” the OpenAI CEO told Rowan Cheung during an interview at the DevDay conference. “Because the amount of stuff you can build… the opportunity space is so incredibly wide.”\n\nAltman said in the past couple of years he has not had a “real chunk of free mental space” to think about what he’d build now. “But I know that there would be a lot of cool stuff to build,” he said.\n\nAltman dropped out of Stanford University in 2005 after two years of studying computer science. An “unexpected opportunity arose” for 19-year-old Altman, who left Stanford to cofound the location-sharing app Loopt.\n\nAs CEO of the company, Altman helped bring in more than $30 million in funding including from notable VC firms like Sequoia Capital. Loopt went through startup accelerator Y Combinator, and after the app was acquired, he became the president of YC. He later cofounded OpenAI in December 2015 with a slew of people, including the world’s richest man, Elon Musk.\n\nDespite his rise to success with tech startups, Altman said he longs to brainstorm other businesses.\n\n“The degree to which OpenAI is, like, taking over all of my mental space, and I don’t get to go think about how to build a new startup, is a little bit sad,” Altman said.\n\nAltman joins a list of college dropouts that have become tech leaders in Silicon Valley, including Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe tech billionaire also said in August he’s envious of young people because current early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison to jobs in 10 years’ time.\n\nAs Gen Z is in the midst of a job crisis, higher education is being scrutinized even more as the right path for tech entrepreneurs and startup hopefuls.\n\nIn September, GV CEO David Krane—and employee No. 84 at Google—said his son spent the entire summer break between college semesters working in AI, and was questioning if higher education was a “scam.”\n\nOnly 41% of junior U.S. professionals say a college degree is necessary for career success, according to a new LinkedIn Workforce Confidence survey. And CEOs of big tech companies are echoing similar sentiments.\n\n“There’s going to have to be a reckoning,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Theo Von in a “This Past Weekend” episode in April. “Maybe not everyone needs to go to college,” because there are a lot of jobs that don’t require it, he added.\n\n“People are probably coming around to that opinion a little more now than maybe, like, 10 years ago,” Zuckerberg said.\n\nA version of this story published on Fortune.com on October 8, 2025.",

    "title": "Gen Z spends hundreds a month on ‘treat culture,’ justifying it with the challenges of daily life—but that’s a ‘slippery slope,’ Bank of America says",
    "description": "The generation has shared in droves on social media about the little ways they’re treating themselves.",
    "fullText": "Sydney Lake is an associate editor at Fortune, where she writes and edits news for the publication's global news desk.\n\nGetting out of bed to go to work or lugging yourself to the grocery store can feel tough. And for that, you deserve a little treat.\n\nAt least that’s the way many Gen Zers see it. Despite a lack of income, Gen Z finds ways to reward themselves frequently: 57% buy themselves a small treat at least once a week, according to a Bank of America report from late July. This could be good news for retailers like Starbucks and Dunkin’, since coffee and other beverages are popular and relatively low-cost treats. Trader Joe’s could also benefit from this trend since they’re known for unique food and beverages, as well as Sephora and Ulta as self-care and cosmetics become increasingly popular among younger generations.\n\nBut for nearly 60% of Gen Zers, this leads to overspending, “making little treats a slippery slope,” according to the report. Yet, the generation has shared in droves on social media about the little ways they’re treating themselves, whether it’s buying a simple ice cream cone or splurging on a new clothing haul.\n\nGen Zers reward themselves for small wins, but also use little treats as pick-me-ups after a bad day. And some don’t even really have a reason.\n\n“Buying myself a little treat because today would’ve been my birthday if I was born today,” one TikTok user posted.\n\nAnd it’s important to remember that 💙 #fyp #fypage #greenvillesc #daydrinkers #localcoffee #cutecoffeeshop #trend #littletreat ♬ original sound – Theo\n\nTerran Fielder, a 23-year-old media specialist, told Fortune she treats herself to lunch during the day and that many of her small indulgences have to do with making her life easier or more time to rest when the day is over.\n\n“When I treat myself, it’s usually in ways that give me more shut eye,” she said. “So, if I am not making lunch, that’s another 20 minutes in bed in the morning. It feels like I’m not just spending money: I’m investing in my well-being.” She said she estimates she spends about $200 to $250 per month on treating herself.\n\nTo be sure, Gen Z isn’t the first generation—and likely isn’t the last—to participate in treat culture. Most recently, older generations scorned millennials for their proclivity toward treating themselves with avocado toast and a daily Starbucks coffee, arguing they could’ve saved or invested that money instead.\n\nWhile treat culture isn’t new, Gen Z is taking it to a “new level,” Daniel Levine, director of consumer trends consulting firm Avant Guide Institute, told Fortune.\n\n“While members of the Silent Generation treated themselves to a new dress for a special occasion, and baby boomers splurged on a new car or a vacation after reaching a career milestone, Gen X indulges in late-night runs for their favorite junk food to de-stress,” Levine said. “The low barrier to entry makes it a daily habit.”\n\nMeanwhile, online shopping as well as food delivery have made it easier to indulge in treats. Indeed, Gen Z uses grocery subscriptions 133% more often than Gen X, according to a 2024 PYMNTS survey of more than 67,000 consumers across 11 countries accounting for nearly half the world’s GDP.\n\nPart of treat culture goes back to the basic psychological concept of positive reinforcement. When you do something positive or are trying to reinforce habits, earning a treat or reward can help cement that behavior.\n\nTreat culture, for younger generations, also serves as a coping mechanism or a form of resistance to societal pressures and stressors, Jillian Amodio, a licensed master social worker at Waypoint Wellness Center, told Fortune. That’s because Gen Z has come of age during a time of economic instability, a global pandemic, climate anxiety and widespread social upheaval, she said. Meanwhile, some younger generations have experienced career whiplash from working in an office, then working remotely during the pandemic, then being forced back to in-person during the past few years.\n\n“Small, intentional joys become a way of reclaiming agency and grounding oneself in the present,” Amodio said. “Pair that with the influence of social media, where trends, aesthetics, and ‘little luxuries’ are celebrated and shared widely, and we have the perfect conditions for treat culture to thrive in the spotlight.”\n\nAnother study by Intuit Credit Karma also showed Gen Z justifies certain non-essential purchases like streaming services, skincare, meals out, fitness classes, and more as “necessities” rather than discretionary purchases. Indeed, more than half of Gen Z views spending on hobbies and interests as a necessity, not a luxury, and they’re putting them above other financial goals.\n\n“If I’m working away from home, buying lunch instead of packing it feels like a small luxury that makes my day easier,” Fielder said. “When things get really busy, I’ll skip the store altogether and order things online, just to avoid another errand.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on August 19, 2025.",

    "description": "Gen Z is starting to drink more alcohol, but data shows they feel the need to prepare an excuse if they're not indulging. It's forcing bars to change.",
    "fullText": "Gen Z drinks less than the generations before them, but the awkwardness they feel talking about alcohol is starting to transform where they go out, what they order, and how bars are built for them.\n\nYounger consumers say they feel more awkward than older consumers when explaining why they aren't drinking, new research from Heineken shows. While an increasing percentage of Americans feel comfortable declining an alcoholic drink with a simple \"no thanks\" (72%) or opting for a non-alcoholic alternative at parties (86%), only about half of Americans under 35 are comfortable drinking low or no-alcohol drinks in public.\n\nThey're also more likely to expect someone will question them, and more likely to feel they need an excuse for not drinking — a paradox, given that Gen Z drinks less overall.\n\nAs younger adults pull back from drinking while still worrying about how to justify it, nightlife operators are rebuilding their menus, spaces, and social experiences around a generation that wants to go out without having to explain what's in their glass.\n\nLaura Fenton, a research associate at the University of Sheffield's School of Medicine and Population Health who studies youth drinking behavior, said the tension around talking about drinking likely stems from social expectations. Even for Gen Z consumers, she said, \"drinking together can be really important to friendship and to negotiating kind of a sense of belonging.\"\n\nA Danish study she cited found that young people feel like they have to give a good reason when they don't drink or when they turn down alcohol with their friends, because \"drinking is kind of a demonstration of reciprocity.\"\n\n\"So if you're going to not be on the same level, you have to have a good reason,\" Fenton said.\n\nGen Z's approach to alcohol is also shaped by a notable anxiety about health concerns and other risks associated with drinking, as well as an aversion to the high costs. With cocktails priced at $15 or \n\n\"They're just a much more conscious consumer,\" Marten Lodewijks, president of the beverage market data firm, IWSR, told Business Insider. \"It's not that they just don't want to drink. They enjoy it, and they enjoy it as much as other generations. It's just that they're conscious that it's not good for them, and so they don't do it as frequently.\"\n\nOperators say the shift isn't theoretical; they're seeing it in real time.\n\nMichelin-starred chef David Chang said in a November interview with TBPN talk-show hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays that the decline in Gen Z's drinking is a \"real existential threat\" to restaurants if they don't pivot, given the industry's already thin margins.\n\nSober bars are cropping up across major metropolitan areas — and one operator told Business Insider in January that every bar will have to expand its non-alcoholic offerings to stay competitive.\n\nThat change is already taking place: mocktails now appear on menus not as afterthoughts but as full-fledged offerings that look, feel, and cost like traditional cocktails, Stacy Molnar, a designer who has worked on restaurant and bar concepts for more than 30 years, told Business Insider.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's about revenue per seat,\" said Molnar. \"If someone wants to order a $15 mocktail instead of a $15 cocktail, great — it makes them feel included, and the operator still hits their numbers.\"\n\nHeineken USA's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Anne de Graaf, told Business Insider that \"Zebra Striping,\" which is when people choose to alternate between alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks, is also on the rise.\n\nBut it's not just the drink list that's changing; it's the overall bar experience.\n\nYounger consumers want something to gather around when they go out, such as board games, trivia nights, themed environments, Instagrammable bathrooms, striking focal points, and distinctive décor.\n\nIn other words, Molnar said, they want atmosphere.\n\n\"They're not going to a bar just to sit,\" Molnar, who has two Gen Z kids of his own, said. \"They want an activity. They want a vibe.\"\n\nFrom all-pink cafés trending on TikTok to bars built around entertainment, the industry is shifting away from alcohol as the main draw. Instead, it's centering aesthetic experiences that make socializing feel low-stakes — and alcohol optional.\n\n\"This isn't just about alcohol,\" Fenton, the youth-drinking researcher, said. \"It's about what young adults want from social life. If you think about it, for young adults, drinking is a social behavior, and it's largely geared toward forming and maintaining social bonds.\"\n\nBars that succeed with younger customers aren't just offering alcohol-free options; they're de-emphasizing alcohol altogether. They're transforming into multi-experience spaces where friends can hang out without feeling judged, pressured, or out of sync with the group, Molnar said.\n\nSo, what comes next? Expect to see more bars that are less about booze and more about belonging — and more spaces where saying \"I'm not drinking tonight\" doesn't require a speech.",

    "fullText": "Gen Z is embracing one decades-old phenomenon: Trading card games like Pokémon.\n\nCollectible card games were the most-purchased secondhand product category for Gen Z in the US on eBay so far this year, according to data from the e-commerce platform.\n\nThe trend was especially clear among Gen Z men, who collectively shifted spending from electronics to trading cards and other collectibles, according to eBay. Trading cards were also the top secondhand sales category among Gen Z women on the platform, followed by books and cameras.\n\nWhile trading cards for franchises such as Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! initially became popular with kids and teens in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the data shows that the cards remain popular, even among those who were born as they were taking off.\n\nPart of the enduring popularity is because those people who grew up with trading cards are now passing the interest on to their own kids, Aaron Ottensmann, a 29-year-old who runs card sales business SassyTCG, told Business Insider.\n\n\"You're starting to see people like me having kids, and they're picking up starter decks and playing with their kids,\" Ottensmann said.\n\nWhile Ottensmann said he sources cards from distributors, the business has become competitive enough that some newer sellers buy cards at retailers like Walmart and Costco, then resell them.\n\nOther customers are after high-dollar cards, with some turning to trading cards as an alternative to investing in the stock market.\n\nIn early December on Ottensmann's eBay shop, shoppers could find about two dozen cards or packs of cards priced over $1,000. His most expensive sale over the past year, a set of 127 early Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, sold for about $75,000 through eBay.\n\nTrading cards are one part of the broader secondhand sales market, which eBay said is expanding in a report released last month.\n\nAbout 82% of survey respondents said they planned to spend more on secondhand items this holiday season than they did in 2024, according to the company's Recommerce Report.\n\nShopping secondhand has gained popularity this year, especially as President Donald Trump's tariffs have raised the price of some goods and added costs to items ordered from outside the US.\n\nDo you have a story idea?

    "description": "Asics Novablasts have become popular among Gen Z runners, beating out similar Nike and Hoka models.",
    "fullText": "While Nike and Hoka have been some of the buzziest running brands in recent years, a new shoe reigned supreme this year: the Asics Novablast.\n\nA recent Strava report, which tracked which optional \"gear\" users selected on their uploaded runs, found that Asics' $150 sneakers beat out Nike Pegasus and Hoka Clifton models, both of which can retail for slightly more (depending on the exact model).\n\n\"After run number one, my feet were feeling happy,\" Keltie O'Connor, a runner and YouTuber, said in her 2024 TikTok review. She raved about how soft they were, without feeling like a memory foam mattress.\n\nMichael Mazzara, the CEO of Half Marathon Guide and Rogue Expeditions, a running tour company, said the data made sense; both complete beginners and more experienced runners gravitate toward the shoes' extreme cushioning.\n\nThey also make it easier to run faster — so much so that some formal races, like the Ironman, ban them for giving runners too much of an advantage.\n\n\"It's become a lot more common that people want really, really springy shoes to feel like they're going faster or to reduce the impact on their joints,\" Mazzara said. \"They created a really accessible shoe to feel like you felt pretty invincible, even if you just got out there.\"\n\nWhile wearing bouncier shoes can feel great, even exhilarating, there are some long-term drawbacks. When it comes to long-distance running and extensive training, extreme comfort can be too much of a good thing, masking injuries around the corner.\n\nBecause of its high stack height, Mazzara said the shoe can feel very forgiving, especially for beginners. \"You feel like you just have to think a little bit less about your cadence and your stride because the shoe's doing a lot of the work for you.\"\n\nIt's also very fun to run in, he said, even though it's not technically a race shoe. Novablasts are made for daily training and long runs, unlike carbon-plated race shoes such as Nike Alphaflys, which are designed to increase speed and shouldn't be worn as frequently.\n\nEven so, Novablasts feel like race shoes. \"They're really springy, and you feel like you're running very fast,\" he said. \"It's something that people haven't really felt before about a daily trainer.\"\n\nIn general, running brands like Asics, Nike, Hoka, and Brooks have been investing in foamier, bouncier shoes.\n\nAylin Woodward of The Wall Street Journal reported that \"super shoes\" — sneakers with both carbon-plating and high stack heights — have blown up in the past decade after professional marathoners shaved minutes off their finish times with them.\n\nUltra-bouncy shoes like Novablasts can also feel like a solution to both new and burned-out runners alike, Mazzara said. If you're a total beginner, new aches and pains can feel concerning — even discouraging. \"Then, all of a sudden, you try on a shoe that feels like a Moon Boot to run in.\" You're immediately faster than ever, with no immediate downsides.\n\nFor long-term runners who've been running in the same, less-cushioned trainers for years, the sudden switch can be a much-needed mental refresh. Feeling automatically faster \"reinvigorates the excitement of daily training and racing,\" he said.\n\nThere are some downsides to the shoe-cushioning arms race.\n\nDr. Courtney Conley, chiropractic physician specializing in foot and gait mechanics, said in a Diary of a CEO interview that tall, bouncy shoes like Nike Alphaflys can weaken muscles in the foot.\n\n\"If you train in them all the time, and you never let your foot get stronger, it's just a matter of time,\" she said, before you start feeling hamstring issues.\n\nIn his own experience wearing Novablasts, Mazzara said he felt like he didn't have to think about his running form as much. That eventually caught up with him: \"I got injured disproportionately more than using a more conventional, less springy shoe,\" he said.\n\nAsics did not respond to Business Insider's request to comment.\n\nMazzara and runners he knows, especially longtime ones in their 40s to 60s, prefer shoes like the Nike Pegasus or Hoka Clifton because they offer ample support without as much bounciness, Mazzara said. The shoes feel stabler in the long run, even if they're a little less exciting.\n\nFor running beginners who don't know where to start, Mazzara recommended going to a running store to find the perfect fit for your foot shape and stride.\n\nThe best principle to follow is also the simplest, he said: \"When it comes to running, find something that you love to run in until you love running.\"",

    "description": "Tapestry, the parent company of Coach, is applying its Gen Z \"road map\" to Kate Spade as it looks to boost the brand.",
    "fullText": "Gen Z is carrying Coach — literally and figuratively.\n\nThat demographic of shoppers, born between 1997 and 2012, is the \"center of the bull's-eye\" for the luxury handbag brand, according to Scott Roe, CFO and COO of Coach's parent company Tapestry.\n\nNow, Tapestry wants to replicate the success it has had with Coach for Kate Spade, which it acquired in 2017.\n\nRoe talked at length about Tapestry's focus on Gen Z during an upcoming episode of Monica Langley's \"Office Hours: Business Edition\" podcast, set to release on Wednesday. Business Insider got an exclusive look at the episode's transcript.\n\nCoach zeroed in on Gen Z out of necessity. Roe told Langley that the company was looking at data, which estimated that, by 2030, about 70% of handbag purchases were going to be made by either Gen Z or millennial buyers. But the average age of Coach buyers was 40, he said.\n\n\"We said, well, that's a problem,\" Roe recounted. \"We got to get younger.\"\n\nDuring Tapestry's November earnings call, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told investors that Coach had acquired 1.7 million new customers in its most recent quarter, driven by Gen Z. Tapestry also reported revenue of $1.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.\n\nJust like Coach, Kate Spade is \"targeting\" Gen Z, Roe said.\n\n\"We like 18 years as a point of entry. That's when a young lady goes from upper school or high school into college,\" Roe said. \"They typically go from a backpack to a bag.\"\n\nFirst on Tapestry's \"road map\" to bring Kate Spade into the zeitgeist is getting young buyers to \"be aware that Kate Spade exists,\" Roe said, which means increasing marketing spend on the brand.\n\nOne example of a buzzy product that Kate Spade is pushing is its Duo Crossbody Bag, which Roe said is \"already a big bag\" and expects it to be a hit over the holidays.\n\nSocial media, such as videos on YouTube or posts on Reddit, play a role in getting Gen Z to \"consider whether they want to buy the brand,\" Roe said. (He didn't go into detail on Tapestry's strategy of paid social media partnerships with creators, however.)\n\nSome members of the younger Gen Z cohort have more spending power than meets the eye, Roe said.\n\n\"They have six wallets, right? Two grandparents and their parents,\" Roe said.\n\nGoing after Gen Z doesn't come without hurdles, however.\n\n\"As we thought about how we become more relevant to that younger generation, we were also faced with some dilemmas,\" Roe said.\n\nThe biggest obstacle: Gen Z has an endless array of options when it comes to shopping.\n\n\"Because there's so many more choices for them, it's more difficult to break through,\" Roe said.\n\nHow to break through? Marketing. And then more marketing.\n\nRoe said that Tapestry \"more than tripled\" its marketing spend. \"It's our intent to keep doing that.\"",

    "description": "Australia's landmark move to ban under-16s from social media will be closely watched by other countries, which could follow suit with similar laws.AFP spoke to teenagers and adults around the world about the Australian ban, which comes in on Wednesday. Here are some of their reactions:- Mumbai: 'Nothing is black or white' -At the seafront in India's Mumbai, 19-year-old Pratigya Jena scrolls with her friends through Instagram videos of a posing influencer and a camel at a beach.Social media \"should be partially banned because according to me nothing is either black or white\", the student said.\"Gen Z are very active, they are doing really well on social media.",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "description": "Gen Z are the first generation to have grown up with social media, they were the earliest adopters, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. Now they are fighting back\nLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed a Snapchat post by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this.

    "fullText": "Gen Z are the first generation to have grown up with social media, they were the earliest adopters, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. Now they are fighting back\n\nLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed a Snapchat post by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this. These fisha accounts are really not OK. Girls, please protect yourselves.’ And I’m like: ‘What is fisha?’ I was 21, but I felt old,” she says.\n\nShe went into her sister’s bedroom, where her sibling showed her a Snapchat account named “fisha” plus the code of their Paris suburb. Fisha is French slang for publicly shaming someone – from the verb “afficher”, meaning to display or make public. The account contained intimate images of girls from her sister’s school and dozens of others, “along with the personal data of the victims – their names, phone numbers, addresses, everything to find them, everything to put them in danger”.\n\nMcLaren, her sister and their friends reported the account to Snapchat dozens of times, but received no response. Then they discovered there were fisha accounts for different suburbs, towns and cities across France and beyond. Faced with the impunity of the social media platforms, and their lack of moderation, they launched the hashtag #StopFisha.\n\nIt went viral, online and in the media. #StopFisha became a rallying cry, a safe space to share information and advice, a protest movement. Now it was the social media companies being shamed. “The wave became a counter-wave,” says McLaren, who is now 26. The French government got involved, and launched an online campaign on the dangers and legal consequences of fisha accounts. The social media companies began to moderate at last, and #StopFisha is now a “trusted flagger” with Snapchat and TikTok, so when they report fisha content, it is taken down within hours. “I realised that if you want change in your societies, if you come with your idea alone, it won’t work. You need support behind you.”\n\nFour years later, this strategy is playing out on an even larger scale. McLaren and other young activists across Europe are banding together against social media and its ruinous effects on their generation. Individually, young people are powerless to sway big tech, but they are also a substantial part of its business model – so, collectively, they are powerful.\n\nThis is the first generation to have grown up with social media: they were the earliest adopters of it, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. The array of problems is ever-expanding: misogynistic, hateful and disturbing content; addictive and skewed algorithms; invasion of privacy; online forums encouraging harmful behaviours; sextortion; screen addiction; deepfake pornography; misinformation and disinformation; radicalisation; surveillance; biased AI – the list goes on. As the use of social media has risen, there has been a corresponding increase in youth mental health problems, anxiety, depression, self-harm and even suicide.\n\n“Across Europe, a generation is suffering through a silent crisis,” says a new report from People vs Big Tech – a coalition of more than 140 digital rights NGOs from around Europe – and Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, their youth-led spin-off. A big factor is “the design and dominance of social media platforms”.\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim, for people aged 15 to 29, came about in September last year when People vs Big Tech put out a call – on social media, paradoxically. About 20 young people who were already active on these issues came together at a “boot camp” in London. “We were really given the tools to create the movement that we wanted to build,” says McLaren, who attended with her partner. “They booked a big room, they brought the food, pencils, paper, everything we needed. And they were like: ‘This is your space, and we’re here to help.’”\n\nThe group is Europe’s first digital justice movement by and for young people. Their demands are very simple, or at least they ought to be: inclusion of young people in decision-making; a safer, healthier, more equitable social media environment; control and transparency over personal data and how it is used; and an end to the stranglehold a handful of US-based corporations have over social media and online spaces. The overarching principle is: “Nothing for us, without us.”\n\n“This is not just us being angry; it’s us having the right to speak,” says McLaren, who is now a youth mobilisation lead for Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim. Debates over digital rights are already going on, of course, but, she says: “We find it really unfair that we’re not at the table. Young people have so much to say, and they’re real experts, because they have lived experience … So why aren’t they given the proper space?”\n\nMcLaren’s work with #StopFisha took her on a journey into a wider, murkier world of gender-based digital rights: misogynist trolling and sexism, cyberstalking, deepfake pornography – but she realised this was just one facet of the problem. What women were experiencing online, other groups were experiencing in their own ways.\n\nA fellow activist, Yassine, 23, is well aware of this. Originally from north Africa and now living in Germany, Yassine identifies as non-binary. They fled to Europe to escape intolerance in their own country, but the reality of life, even in a supposedly liberal country such as Germany, hit them like a “slap”, they say. “You’re here for your safety, but then you’re trying to fight not only the system that is punishing the queerness of you, but you also have another layer of being a migrant. So you have two battles instead of one.”\n\nAs a migrant they are seen as a threat, Yassine says. “Our bodies and movements must be tracked, fingerprinted and surveilled through intrusive digital systems designed to protect the EU.” For queer people, there are similar challenges. These include “shadow-banning”, for example, by which tech platforms “silence conversations about queer rights, racism or anything that is challenging the dominant system”, either wilfully or algorithmically, through built-in biases.\n\nMeasures such as identity verification “are also putting a lot of people at risk of being erased from these spaces”, says Yassine. There can be good reasons for them, but they can also end up discriminating against non-binary or transgender people – who are often presented with binary gender options; male or female – as well as against refugees and undocumented people, who may be afraid or unable to submit their details online. Given their often tenuous residency status, and sometimes limited digital literacy and access, migrants tend not to speak out, Yassine says. “It definitely feels like you are in a position of: ‘You need to be grateful that you are here, and you should not question the laws.’ But the laws are harming my data.”\n\nOn a more day-to-day level, Yassine says, they must “walk through online spaces knowing they could do harm to me”. If they click on the comments under a social media post, for example, they know they are likely to find racist, homophobic or hateful attacks. Like McLaren, Yassine says that complaining is futile. “I know that they will come back with, ‘This is not a community guidelines breach’, and all of that.”\n\nThese are not mere glitches in the system, says Yassine, who now leads on digital rights at IGLYO, a long-running LGBTQ+ youth rights organisation, founded in Brussels, with a network of groups across Europe. “The systems we design inherit the very structures they arise from, so they inevitably become systems that are patriarchal and racist by design.”\n\nAdele Zeynep Walton’s participation in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim came through personal experience of online harm. In 2022, Walton’s 21-year-old sister, Aimee, took her own life. She had been struggling with her mental health, but had also been spending time on online suicide and self-harm forums, which Walton believes contributed to her death. After that, Walton began to question the digital realm she had grown up in, and her own screen addiction.\n\nWalton’s parents made her first Facebook account when she was 10, she says. She has been on Instagram since she was 12. Her own feelings of body dysmorphia began when she was 13, sparked by pro-anorexia content her friends were sharing. “I became a consumer of that, then I got immersed in this world,” she says. “Generations like mine thought it was totally normal, having this everyday battle with this addictive thing, having this constant need for external validation. I thought those were things that were just wrong with me.”\n\nIn researching her book Logging Off: The Human Cost of our Digital World, Walton, 26, also became aware of how little control young people have over the content that is algorithmically served up to them. “We don’t really have any choice over what our feeds look like. Despite the fact there are things where you can say, ‘I don’t want to see this type of content’, within a week, you’re still seeing it again.”\n\nAlycia Colijn, 29, another member of Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, knows something about this. She studied data science and marketing analytics at university in Rotterdam, researching AI-driven algorithms – how they can be used to manipulate behaviour, and in whose interests. During her studies she began to think: “It’s weird that I’m trained to gather as much data as I can, and to build a model that can respond to or predict what people want to buy, but I’ve never had a conversation around ethics.” Now she is researching these issues as co-founder of Encode Europe, which advocates for human-centric AI. “I realised how much power these algorithms have over us; over our society, but also over our democracies,” she says. “Can we still speak of free will if the best psychologists in the world are building algorithms that make us addicted?”\n\nThe more she learned, the more concerned Colijn became. “We made social media into a social experiment,” she says. “It turned out to be the place where you could best gather personal data from individuals. Data turned into the new gold, and then tech bros became some of the most powerful people in the world, even though they aren’t necessarily known for caring about society.”\n\nSocial media companies have had ample opportunities to respond to these myriad harms, but invariably they have chosen not to. Just as McLaren found with Snapchat and the fisha accounts, hateful and racist content is still minimally moderated on platforms such as X, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. After Donald Trump’s re-election, Mark Zuckerberg stated at the start of this year that Meta would be reducing factcheckers across Facebook and Instagram, just as X has under Elon Musk. This has facilitated the free flow of misinformation. Meta, Amazon and Google were also among the companies announcing they were rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, post-Trump’s election. The shift towards the right politically, in the US and Europe, has inevitably affected these platforms’ tolerance of hateful and racist content, says Yassine. “People feel like now they have more rights to be harmful than rights to be protected.”\n\nAll the while, the tech CEOs have become more powerful, economically, politically and in terms of information control. “We don’t believe that power should be in those hands,” says Colijn. “That’s not a true democracy.”\n\nEurope’s politicians aren’t doing much better. Having drafted the Digital Services Act in 2023, which threatened social media companies with fines or bans if they failed to regulate harmful content, the European Commission announced last month it would be rolling back some of its data privacy laws, to allow big tech companies to use people’s personal data for training AI systems.\n\n“Big tech, combined with the AI innovators, say they are the growth of tomorrow’s economy, and that we have to trust them. I don’t think that’s true,” says Colijn. She also disagrees with their argument that regulation harms innovation. “The only thing deregulation fosters is harmful innovation. If we want responsible innovation, we need regulation in place.”\n\nWalton agrees. “Governments and MPs are shooting themselves in the foot by pandering to tech giants, because that just tells young people that they don’t care about our future,” she says. “There’s this massive knowledge gap between the people who are making the decisions, and the tech justice movement and everyday people who are experiencing the harms.”\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim is not calling for the wholesale destruction of social media. All these activists say they have found community, solidarity and joy in online spaces: “We’re fighting for these spaces to accommodate us,” says Yassine. “We’re not protesting to cancel them. We know how harmful they are, but they are still spaces where we have hope.”\n\nColijn echoes this. “Social media used to be a fun place with the promise of connecting the world,” she says. “That’s where we started.” And that’s what they want it to be again.\n\nWill big tech pay attention? They might not have a choice, as countries and legislators begin to take action. This week Australia will become the first country to ban social media accounts for under-16s on major platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and X. Last week, after a two-year deliberation, X was fined €120m (£105m) by the EU for breaching data laws. But these companies continue to platform content that is hateful, racist, harmful, misleading or inflammatory, with impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim is just getting started. Other discussions on the table include campaigning for an EU-funded social media platform, an alternative to the big tech oligopoly, created by and for the public. Another alternative is direct action, either protest or consumer activism such as coordinated boycotts. “I think it’s lazy for us to be like: we don’t have any power,” says Walton. “Because we could literally say that about anything: fast fashion, fossil fuels … OK, but how do we change things?”\n\nThe other alternative is simply to log off. “The other side of the coin to this movement of tech justice, and a sort of liberation from the harms that we’ve experienced over the past 20 years, is reducing our screen time,” says Walton. “It is spending more time in community. It is connecting with people who maybe you would have never spoken to on social media, because you’d be in different echo chambers.”\n\nAlmost all the activists in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim attest to having had some form of screen addiction. As much as social media has brought them together, it has also led to much less face-to-face socialising. “I’ve had to sort of rewire my brain to get used to the awkwardness and get comfortable with being in a social setting and not knowing anyone,” says Walton. “Actually, it would be really nice to return to proper connection.”\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
