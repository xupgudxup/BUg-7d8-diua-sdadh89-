    "title": "A real estate investor and agent explains why 2 days before Christmas is her 'favorite day of the year' to submit home offers — and other 'pockets' when you can score a good deal",
    "description": "\"It's always a good time to be deal hunting during a distracted market,\" says real-estate agent and investor Dana Bull.",
    "fullText": "The holiday season might not seem like a big window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers to get their bids seen by sellers, but one real estate agent argues it's actually an ideal time to score a deal.\n\nIf real-estate investor and agent Dana Bull was looking to expand her portfolio, she'd be putting in offers in late December — specifically, two days before Christmas.\n\nDecember 23 is her \"favorite day of the year to submit an offer,\" she told Business Insider. \"I find that sellers are very interested in getting a deal done going into the holidays or going into this year.\"\n\nBull works in real estate in a variety of capacities: She's a licensed agent, does real-estate consulting and coaching, and is a seasoned investor who owns multi-family and single-family homes throughout Massachusetts.\n\nShe's learned that if you want to land a good deal on a property, timing matters.\n\n\"It's always a good time to be deal hunting during a distracted market,\" Bull said — and people tend to be distracted over the holidays. \"Most people are just in coast mode, but if you're not in coast mode or if you can take yourself out of coast mode, this is such a great time.\"\n\nStarting a negotiation a few days before Christmas is a good time for several reasons.\n\n\"In general, people are in good spirits, and sellers tend to feel a sense of relief if they receive an offer because they usually aren't expecting one,\" she said. \"Christmas Eve puts a deadline to get things wrapped up with the negotiating and creates a sense of urgency.\"\n\nShe says she would avoid submitting an offer on actual holidays — \"it's a bit rude and unrealistic to get a response\" — but the days following Christmas are fair game. \"I almost always submit an offer that week. It's a time of great reflection, and sellers are generally motivated to put a deal together so they can enter the new year with a plan in place.\"\n\nThe holiday window of opportunity is small. A couple of weeks into January, \"it's like a light switch comes back on,\" she said, noting that mid-January is one of her busiest times of the year for consultations. \"What I've noticed is this herd mentality where everybody just ebbs and flows at the same time, so if you can be flowing when everybody else is ebbing, this is when you can negotiate.\"\n\nThat said, \"You don't want to make a bad purchase just because it's a good time of year,\" Bull added, but if you can carve out time to look for deals when most other investors aren't, you could be rewarded.\n\n\"There are always these pockets, like the Fourth of July is another great time where people have signed off, and I'm almost always working with somebody that weekend to try to scrounge something up.\"\n\nSeasonal swings aren't a myth, and they can be significant. In her market, for example, \"Massachusetts has huge seasonal swings in average pricing by like $100,000.\"\n\nIn the markets where Bull is active, in the winter, \"prices always come down,\" she added. \"And then they're going to start to climb. Then, in the summer they come back down again and they climb again in the fall. Every year it's the same quarterly trend, so if you are looking to buy a house, right now is one of the best times.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on December 9, 2024.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "description": "Diameter Capital Partners made successful telecom and satellite bets as AI demand spread beyond chips.",
    "fullText": "The artificial intelligence boom is real — but there's more to the AI trade than chips alone, according to a credit investor.\n\n\"This is a super-duper micro cycle that will outlast many investing careers,\" said Scott Goodwin, the cofounder and managing partner of Diameter Capital Partners, a quote he attributed to his partner Jonathan Lewinsohn.\n\nAI represents what Diameter Capital sees as a long-running, disruptive cycle — but buying the most obvious winners isn't the only way to play it, he said on the \"Goldman Sachs Exchanges\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nDiameter Capital, which manages approximately $25 billion in assets, has focused on where AI demand could create less obvious bottlenecks — and where those bottlenecks show up in credit markets.\n\nThat view led Diameter to buy the unsecured debt of a midsize telecommunications company in 2023.\n\nGoodwin said the bet was rooted in the idea that as companies move from training AI models to actually using them, demand shifts away from chips alone and toward the networks that carry data.\n\n\"It had to leave the data center. How would it leave? It would leave on the commercial fiber, the pipes,\" he said.\n\nThe telco went on to sign more than $10 billion in contracts with hyperscale cloud providers, and the debt has rebounded to face value, Goodwin said.\n\nDiameter Capital also made \"a big bet\" on a satellite company tied to the wireless spectrum — a wager that later paid off after the company sold spectrum assets and the debt returned to face value.\n\nGoodwin's comments come amid growing debate over whether sky-high AI valuations are sustainable and whether investors are overlooking other opportunities tied to the technology.\n\nGoodwin warned that parts of the AI-credit boom may be taking on risk that's hard to price, especially in chip finance.\n\nSome investors, he said, are taking on \"residual risk,\" or the riskiest slice of chip-financing deals — betting on what the hardware might be worth years from now. Cutting-edge firms refresh their technology often, so chips can quickly become outdated for some customers.\n\n\"We call up really smart people in Silicon Valley, we call up really smart people at Big Tech companies and ask them what the residual value is on these chips three, four, five, six, seven years forward,\" he said. \"None of them have a clue.\"\n\nGoodwin said the next phase isn't just about spending on infrastructure — it's about competitive disruption rather than capital expenditure.\n\n\"Who are the companies, who are the entities that are going to adopt AI and take a step forward versus their peers? And who are going to be the losers?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is actually a longer cycle than the capex cycle, so that's really interesting,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Peter Schiff warned that Bitcoin is unlikely to find a durable bottom at $50,000.\n\nSchiff argued that Strategy’s valuation is vulnerable to further declines.\n\nMichael Saylor and Strategy have downplayed downside risks and continue to add to their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nBitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Wednesday issued a renewed warning about BTC, arguing that prices will fall well below $50,000 over the long term.\n\nIn the same outburst, Schiff also accused Michael Saylor of disregarding shareholder value as Strategy continues one of the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulation campaigns on record, despite prices falling steeply in recent weeks.\n\nIn a reply on X, Schiff said Bitcoin would not establish a lasting bottom at $50,000, describing that level as merely a short-term reference point.\n\n“No, that’s just a very short-term price target based on MSTR. Long-term Bitcoin will go much lower than $50,000,” Schiff wrote, responding to a user who asked whether prices would rebound after reaching that level.\n\nIn a separate post, Schiff added that Bitcoin would be trading well below $50,000 by the time Strategy’s executive chairman ultimately exits his holdings.\n\n“Bitcoin will be much lower than $50,000 when that happens,” Schiff wrote in response to a user who said they planned to buy once Saylor sells his Bitcoin.\n\nSchiff also targeted Strategy’s stock, arguing that its valuation remains exposed to further downside and is closely linked to Bitcoin’s performance.\n\n“It’s hard to find a chart that looks worse than $MSTR,” Schiff wrote on X. “At a minimum, the stock should drop to about $80, which is half its current price.”\n\nHe added that such a decline in Strategy’s shares would likely coincide with another sharp drop in Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine MSTR dropping that much without a significant decline in Bitcoin as well,” Schiff said. “I’d say a minimum target for BTC is about $50K.”\n\nSchiff has repeatedly argued that Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused strategy prioritizes cryptocurrency exposure over the interests of equity investors.\n\nSaylor and Strategy have consistently minimized perceived risk during periods of Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAfter Bitcoin fell last month, Strategy stated on X that even if BTC declined to its average purchase price of roughly $74,000, the company’s holdings would still cover its outstanding convertible debt multiple times over.\n\nIn November, Strategy CEO Phong Le suggested the company could be forced to sell Bitcoin if its shares traded below the value of its underlying holdings.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, dismissed bitcoin as \"worthless,\" and revisited his GameStop bet.",
    "fullText": "The mysterious Michael Burry has pulled back the curtain over the past six weeks, revealing his views on everything from bitcoin and meme stocks to the AI boom and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame was previously known for posting cryptic warnings on X, only to swiftly delete them and go silent for months or years at a time.\n\nHe has now closed his hedge fund to outside cash, and shifted his focus to writing about his personal investments and sharing his financial analyses on Substack.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through Burry's Substack, X posts, and a recent podcast interview with author Michael Lewis to gather the key insights and details he has shared so far.\n\nBurry returned to X in late October after going quiet in April 2023. His commentary since then has centered on concerns of a historic bubble in AI.\n\nHe has warned that the tech companies leading the charge are seeing a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, overinvesting in equipment such as Nvidia chips and data centers, dragging out depreciation to inflate their short-term earnings, destroying shareholder value through excessive stock-based compensation, and signing \"give-and-take\" contracts with one another to keep the buzz going.\n\nBurry — who shot to fame after his lucrative bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled by Lewis in \"The Big Short\" — has also compared AI mania to the dot-com and housing bubbles, predicting it too will end in disaster.\n\nHe has labeled OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time,\" saying it's \"hemorrhaging cash.\" He has disclosed bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir, and predicted the AI bubble will burst within two years. He has also advised investors who've won big on high-flying assets to cash out their winnings.\n\n\"I think the stock market could be in for a number of bad years,\" he told Lewis during what might be his final interview, per his Substack.\n\nBurry also said that bitcoin trading at $100,000 was \"the most ridiculous thing\" as it's \"not worth anything,\" and called it \"worse than a tulip bulb\" because it has enabled so much crime. The most popular cryptocurrency now trades below $90,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Burry revealed that he has owned gold since 2005, and described Google-parent Alphabet as the \"value investor's favorite\" among mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nBurry told Lewis that the Fed has \"done a lot of damage\" since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nHe said the US central bank doesn't do \"anything very helpful,\" and the Treasury could just have a department to set interest rates and control the money supply instead.\n\nBurry has also warned that the US banking system is showing signs of \"fragility,\" and banks are \"getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nMoreover, he has defended his past comments on the regional banking fiasco, pandemic-fueled inflation, and a potential meme-stock crash, saying his calls were largely on the money.\n\nHe has shared details of his personal portfolio, including that he has emulated most of his fund's positions and owns shares of Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn a Monday post, he revisited his sale of GameStop shortly before the meme stock skyrocketed in January 2021, saying he had \"no idea what was coming.\" He also teased a future post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\nBurry's other revelations so far include the fact that he has known Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, for years, and bought the chipmaker's stock in 2017 or 2018.\n\nAs promised in his Substack's name, \"Cassandra Unchained,\" Burry is speaking freely for the first time in many years — and may just be getting started.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is planning an executive order that would limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defense contractors whose projects are over-budget and delayed, according to three ​sources briefed on the order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched ‌nature of the defense industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.\n\nIndustry groups have been on high alert about the ‌closely-held proposal, which is tied to a Treasury Department initiative, two of the sources said.\n\nA White House official said: \"Until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential executive orders is purely speculation.\"\n\nShares ⁠of Lockheed fell 1.6% and Northrop Grumman sank ‌2% in after-hours trading after some aspects of the news were first reported by online political news service Punchbowl.\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS OFTEN BUY BACK SHARES\n\nShare buybacks are common among defense firms, and several pay a ‍dividend. Lockheed in October, for example, raised its dividend for the 23rd year in a row, to $3.45 per share. At the same time, it authorized the purchase of up to $2 billion of its shares, raising the total amount promised for repurchases to $9.1 billion.\n\nLockheed's F-35 fighter jet, one of ​the most expensive U.S. defense programs, has been plagued by rising costs and delays. Many big defense programs take much longer ‌to deliver a product than initially promised and at a far higher price.\n\nThe $140 billion Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program that will replace aging Minuteman III missiles, designed and managed by Northrop Grumman, will be years behind schedule and 81% over budget, the U.S. military said last year.\n\nThe biggest defense firms, including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the executive order.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth unveiled sweeping changes in November to how the Pentagon purchases weapons, ⁠allowing the military to more rapidly acquire technology amid growing global threats, ​in accordance with an executive order signed by Trump in April.\n\nThat restructuring will ​have direct authority over major weapons programs to eliminate bureaucracy.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame wrote on Substack that a \"crappy business\" became the \"belle of the ball.\"",
    "fullText": "When it comes to regrets, Michael Burry has a few.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who bet on GameStop years before it became a meme, explained why he sold the stock before it skyrocketed in a Substack post on Monday night.\n\nBurry, who recently pivoted from hedge fund manager to online writer, first invested in GameStop in the summer of 2018. The video-game retailer's stock looked undervalued to him, and he saw an array of catalysts that could send it higher, he wrote.\n\nThey included a console refresh in 2020, the possibility of a buyout, the potential sale of the Spring Mobile business, and strong cash flows and a large cash pile offering scope for a \"very big and consequential buyback,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe exited the position in the second quarter of 2019 after the stock failed to budge. But he reinvested in July 2019, buying the stock \"with both hands\" and making it one of his larger holdings, in part because high short interest presented a fresh catalyst, he wrote.\n\n\"I visited a GameStop store to make sure I was not crazy,\" Burry wrote. \"It did not work. Even the stuff that was not on sale looked like it should be on sale.\"\n\nBurry wrote to GameStop's board to push for changes at the company. He shared that his public activism drew emails from Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, a retail investor who would become the face of the GameStop meme mania, and Chewy cofounder Ryan Cohen, who would go on to become GameStop's CEO.\n\nBurry said he bought into GameStop the second time at a split-adjusted average price of 83 cents, or less than 1/26 of the current $22 stock price.\n\nHe purchased an almost 5% stake and held it for more than 16 months. \"Most of that time, I lent my shares out at very good rates — high double digits — which was lucrative and a big part of the trade,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry cashed out by the end of November 2020, selling his shares for an average of $3.38 each, or more than four times what he paid.\n\nWeeks later, retail investors on forums such as r/WallStreetBets executed a historic squeeze on GameStop short sellers, sending the stock to an intraday high of over $120 on January 28, 2021.\n\n\"At the peak my yearslong investment might have turned $12 million into $1 billion, but that was never a possibility,\" Burry wrote, noting that he would have sold long before that point.\n\nBurry — best known for predicting and profiting from the housing crash that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, a story told in the book and movie \"The Big Short\" — reflected on whether he should have played his hand differently.\n\n\"I could have analyzed that situation better,\" he said. \"I knew GameStop inside and out, and I thought I understood the volume, short interest, and other dynamics. However, I was blinded by what I saw as execution risk.\"\n\nHe'd also lost faith in a huge stock rebound. \"As well, I am human,\" he wrote, adding that large-scale buybacks, board changes, and the sale of Spring Mobile had been \"home run/slam dunk activist successes with concrete results but zero impact on price or short interest.\"\n\nBurry seized the chance to close out his bet after GameStop shares spiked following Cohen's disclosure of his stake.\n\n\"I had no idea what was coming,\" he wrote. \"I had no idea that a Roaring Kitty existed.\"\n\n\"And I had no idea that a widely distributed gamma squeeze would thread the needle to become the one and only legal market corner,\" he added.\n\nAround 50 days after he exited, that \"ignominious crappy business\" had become the \"belle of the ball,\" Burry wrote. \"The entire world could not take their eyes off her. And neither could I.\"\n\nBurry said he had mixed feelings about the meme-stock mania of early 2021: \"It was spectacular. It was hilarious. It was tragic in turn.\"\n\nBut he decided it was \"less fun\" by the middle of 2021, when non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were soaring in value along with \"watches, shoes, just about everything.\"\n\nBurry said he feared retail investors would be \"shredded on this meme thing,\" and warned them to watch out. He spoke out because \"if there is one thing I wish I could have done, it was to have effectively warned or spoken about what was happening in 2005-2007,\" he wrote.\n\nThe deep-value investor, who moonlighted as an investment blogger in medical school, also teased an upcoming post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\n\"As a melting ice cube and a capital structure with some optionality, GameStop is roughly as I approached it in 2018, except it is only 16% shorted, all the numbers are 10 times bigger and Ryan is running it, for better or worse,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "In a lengthy blog post, Bury advised against attempting to short the current AI bubble and said the bubble may grow even larger.",
    "fullText": "If you're waiting for Michael Burry to tell you when the AI bubble will burst, don't hold your breath.\n\nIn Burry's new post on his Substack, the famed \"Big Short\" investor said that there \"is no way to time or predict\" the bubble pop, especially when the bubble may still have room to grow.\n\n\"Shorts are almost always short-term trades. Usually less than a year, maybe a couple years at most,\" wrote Burry. \"Not 5 years, not 10 years.\"\n\n\"I believe today the stock market is in a phase that could become a blow off top of extreme magnitude on the upside, while at any time, maybe even today or tomorrow, making a generational top,\" Burry added.\n\nIn the lengthy blog post, Burry answered reader questions on his earlier posts. He argued that there is \"supply-side gluttony,\" meaning massive data-center build-outs, GPU orders, and multibillion-dollar commitments without real end-user demand, which investors are mistaking for supply-chain activity. He attributed much of the hype to being driven by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's marketing.\n\n\"Even when it finally tops, it will not be for any specific reason,\" Burry said later in the post. \"Even if the reason is an AI buildout bubble popping, that will likely not be apparent until a year or two later.\"\n\n\"Mostly, it is prudent neither to short stocks nor to buy puts on stocks. Stocks that are obviously overvalued tend to have the most upward momentum yet have puts that are very expensive,\" Burry added.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's latest digs.\n\nIn November, Burry launched a paywalled Substack called Cassandra Unchained. After posting charts on X that show circulatory investment deals between Nvidia and other tech giants, his first post took aim at Nvidia. He called the chipmaking giant \"a Cisco\" in the AI bubble debate, referring to the internet-networking giant whose stock plunged by over 75% during the dot-com crash.\n\nNvidia released a note to Wall Street analysts in late November, pushing back against some of Burry's claims.\n\nEarlier in November, during Nvidia's Q3 earnings call, the CEO addressed concerns about the AI bubble.\n\n\"From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang told investors, \"We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\"",

    "description": "Michael Burry pointed to the Fed's plan to start purchasing short-term Treasurys as a sign of weakness in the banking system.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry thinks he's spotted another sign of trouble in the US financial system.\n\nThe famed investor of \"The Big Short\" said he was eyeing one comment in particular that came out the Fed's meeting on Wednesday. That's the mention that the FOMC believes the Fed's reserve balances had declined to \"ample levels\" — and that the central bank would start making \"reserve management purchases.\"\n\nIt's a jargony way of saying the Fed will start purchasing short-term US Treasurys \"on an ongoing basis,\" per the committee's statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPurchasing short-term T-bills — which the Fed will start doing on December 12 and total around $40 billion a month — is one way the central bank can boost liquidity in markets and the banking sector. It's slightly different from quantitative easing, which is when the Fed purchases long-term Treasurys to stimulate the economy by keeping a lid on borrowing costs. However, in the short term, it has a similar effect of boosting the amount of money circulating through the financial system, making it easier for banks to meet their reserve requirements.\n\nBut the fact that the Fed has to provide that support at all is a worrying sign, in Burry's view. The Fed's reserve balances currently hover around $2.8 trillion, according to the latest weekly data from the central bank.\n\n\"I would add if the US banking system can't function without $3+ trillion in reserves/life support from the Fed, that is not a sign of strength but a sign of fragility,\" Burry wrote in a post on X Wednesday evening. \"So I'd say US Banks are getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nStocks surged after the Fed's policy meeting, largely fueled by optimism about the central bank's plan to purchase short-term Treasury bills, JPMorgan's market intelligence team wrote in a note.\n\nThe purchase of short-term Treasurys marks the first time the Fed has meaningfully expanded its balance sheet since it ended its quantitative easing prgram in 2022, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.\n\n\"Seems that after every crisis now the Fed needs to expand its balance sheet permanently or guarantee a bank funding crisis. No wonder stocks are doing well,\" Burry said, adding that he was avoiding bank stocks and choosings to keep his money in cash accounts or Treasury money market funds.\n\n\"Rip QT; long live 'reserve management purchases,'\" he added.\n\nBurry, who correctly called the subprime mortgage crisis, has cemented his reputation as a permabear in recent years. Since returning to social media this year, he has repeatedly sounded the alarm on a stock market bubble, unveiled fresh bets against AI titans like Nvidia, and warned about the huge amounts of spending by the biggest tech companies.",

    "fullText": "PepsiCo plans to cut prices and eliminate some of its products under a deal with an activist investor announced Monday.\n\nThe Purchase, New York-based company, which makes Cheetos, Tostitos and other Frito-Lay products as well as beverages, said it will cut nearly 20% of its product offerings by early next year. PepsiCo said it will use the savings to invest in marketing and improved value for consumers. It didn't disclose which products or how much it would cut prices.\n\nPepsiCo said it also plans to accelerate the introduction of new offerings with simpler and more functional ingredients, including Doritos Protein and Simply NKD Cheetos and Doritos, which contain no artificial flavors or colors. The company also recently introduced a prebiotic version of its signature cola.\n\nPepsiCo is making the changes after prodding from Elliott Investment Management, which took a $4 billion stake in the company in September. In a letter to PepsiCo’s board, Elliott said the company is being hurt by a lack of strategic clarity, decelerating growth and eroding profitability in its North American food and beverage businesses.\n\nIn a joint statement with PepsiCo Monday, Elliott Partner Marc Steinberg said the firm is confident that PepsiCo can create value for shareholders as it executes on its new plan.\n\n“We appreciate our collaborative engagement with PepsiCo’s management team and the urgency they have demonstrated,” Steinberg said. “We believe the plan announced today to invest in affordability, accelerate innovation and aggressively reduce costs will drive greater revenue and profit growth.”\n\nElliott said it plans to continue working closely with the company.\n\nPepsiCo shares were flat in after-hours trading Monday.\n\nPepsiCo said it expects organic revenue to grow between 2% and 4% in 2026. The company’s organic revenue rose 1.5%. the first nine months of this year.\n\nPepsiCo also said it plans to review its supply chain and continue to make changes to its board, with a focus on global leaders who can help it reach its growth and profitability goals.\n\n“We feel encouraged about the actions and initiatives we are implementing with urgency to improve both marketplace and financial performance,” PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.\n\nPepsiCo said in February that years of double-digit price increases and changing customer preferences have weakened demand for its drinks and snacks. In July, the company said it was trying to combat perceptions that its products are too expensive by expanding distribution of value brands like Chester’s and Santitas.",

    "fullText": "\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry sounded early alarms about the subprime mortgage market's excesses — the same risks that later engulfed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nNow, Burry wrote in a Substack post on Monday that he owns \"good size\" positions in both companies' common stock — and believes a long-awaited plan to take them public again may finally be approaching.\n\n\"Once each company is released from capital restraint by their IPOs, I expect growth to accelerate naturally,\" he wrote.\n\nIn his 6,000-word analysis, Burry wrote that the mortgage giants contributed to the housing bubble by buying large volumes of risky loans that eventually blew up during the financial crisis.\n\nBurry recalled that he saw the danger early. In 2003, he called Freddie \"Frauddie Mac\" in an investor letter and bought credit-default swaps that would pay off if the company faltered.\n\nNow in 2025, Burry argues the landscape has changed. Fannie and Freddie have rebuilt tens of billions in capital since 2021 and remain essential pillars of the US mortgage market, owning 62% of outstanding home loans.\n\nWith the Trump administration now signaling interest in releasing them from conservatorship, Burry believes their IPOs may be nearing.\n\nHowever, \"there remains a final steep, windy and rocky climb to IPO for both,\" he wrote, citing regulatory and policy roadblocks.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which trade over the counter, rose 2% and 2.4%, respectively, on Monday.\n\nBurry's post came a month after he closed his hedge fund to outside investors, after terminating Scion Asset Management's SEC registration.\n\nSince then, he has launched his \"Cassandra Unchained\" Substack that promises a \"front row seat to his analytical efforts and projections for stocks, markets, and bubbles, often with an eye to history and its remarkably timeless patterns.\" It now has over 146,000 subscribers.",
