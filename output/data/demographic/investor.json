The source of that £19.5m has not been made public.\n\nCardiff's turnover increased £2.6m to £25.8m, but their wage bill increased to £29.1m during the last campaign – although the accounts confirm most of the squad did include relegation clauses.\n\nThe £35.1m overall loss is a jump of £23m, although last year's finances were boosted by the sale of a percentage of any successful damages gained in their court action with French club Nantes over the death of the Argentinian striker Emiliano Sala.\n\nTheir operating loss remained relatively unchanged at £28.1m.\n\nIn the notes accompanying the accounts, the club state that relegation from the Championship meant they faced an \"immediate challenge\" of an \"incredibly significant drop in turnover and the actions that by necessity had to be taken around the club's cost base to bridge that gap\".\n\nThat has included pausing development of the club's proposed new training base until they return to the second tier, as well as utilising the club's academy talent as part of a squad restructuring.\n\nThat has proven successful so far with new manager Brian Barry-Murphy leading them to a healthy position at the top of League One.",

    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence may outperform most investors at sifting through data, but legendary investor Howard Marks says the best investors still have qualities it can't fully replicate.\n\n\"Great investors are much more than fast, unemotional processors of data,\" Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, wrote in a memo published Thursday. His firm manages $223 billion.\n\nThis includes dealing with genuinely new situations and the ability to make \"subjective decisions regarding qualitative factors and exercise taste and discernment,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile AI may be able to generate hypotheses from historical patterns, Marks questioned whether its speculation about new things would be \"consistently superior to that of all humans.\"\n\n\"Because a lot of the investing process comes down to speculation, and because of AI's less-than-total reliability, I think it's unlikely that AI will be infallible as an investor,\" Marks wrote.\n\nHe sees one more crucial difference.\n\n\"AI doesn't have skin in the game,\" Marks wrote. \"It doesn't feel the weight of concentrated positions or the fear of capital loss.\"\n\nTop investors have an instinctive feel for risk, which plays a major role in their success, he added.\n\nIf widely available information can't deliver an edge, Marks wrote, investment superiority has to be found in judgment and qualitative assessment — including \"divining companies' futures.\"\n\n\"By definition, few people are highly superior at performing these non-quantitative tasks — put simply, few possess exceptional insight,\" he wrote.\n\nThat leaves room, in his view, for a subset of investors to stand apart.\n\n\"I believe there will continue to be human investors who are superior to AI, since I don't think AI will be able to do an unbeatable job of these things,\" Marks wrote.\n\nFor many investors, however, the bar is rising.\n\nMarks argues that the advantage many active managers once sought in timely, readily available data is disappearing.\n\nThe competitive pressure in investing is part of a broader shift he sees unfolding.\n\nIn December, he called the technology's employment outlook \"terrifying.\"\n\n\"I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can't find jobs because of it,\" Marks wrote at the time.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame warned of a \"troubling\" surge in Nvidia's purchase obligations to $95 billion, labeling it a \"risky position.\"",
    "fullText": "Nvidia has put itself in a \"risky position\" to meet expected demand for its microchips, and could suffer a \"catastrophic\" blow to its finances if the AI boom wanes, Michael Burry says.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame wrote in a Substack post titled \"Nvidia Ratchets Up the Risk\" on Thursday that he'd spotted a \"troubling\" item in the company's annual report: a 12-month surge in its purchase obligations from around $16 billion to $95 billion.\n\nBurry said that was driven by key supplier TSMC insisting on lengthier contracts and cash in exchange for building out the capacity needed to build Nvidia's newest chips.\n\n\"To be clear, NVDA has been forced to place non-cancellable purchase orders well before demand is known,\" Burry wrote, adding that the company is taking longer to convert inventory into sales.\n\n\"This new reality reflects a deliberate decision to lock up supply chain capacity further than Nvidia has ever done before.\"\n\nBurry pointed out that Nvidia's $117 billion in total supply obligations nearly matched its operating cash flow for the year ended January 25.\n\n\"This is not business as usual,\" he wrote. \"This is risk.\"\n\nBurry drew a comparison to Cisco during the dot-com bubble, when the internet networking giant extended its purchase commitments with suppliers to ensure it had the capacity to support the 50% yearly growth it expected.\n\n\"When enterprises' IT spending and data network spending collapsed almost overnight, Cisco wrote down ~40% of its supply chain obligations and inventory and the stock crashed severely,\" he added.\n\nMoreover, Burry said that Nvidia's lofty profit margins are partly a product of the pricing power it wields due to excessive demand for its products, so those margins could shrink if demand falters.\n\n\"Rather than a business that would normally roll comfortably through the hills and valleys of its industry, the weighty supply obligation relative to earnings and cash flow makes a valley more of a potential entity risk for Nvidia,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Any downturn, when it comes, will be more severe, perhaps even catastrophic, for Nvidia's earnings and balance sheet.\"\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry — one of the few people to predict and profit from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble — has previously said the AI boom is a bubble, and he's betting against Nvidia because he believes it's particularly vulnerable to it popping.\n\nHe wrote in January that Nvidia is \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" he added. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang was directly asked by a reporter in November what he thought of Burry's warning that AI was a bubble about to burst. He replied that \"we're a long, long ways from that\" and only at the beginning of a multi-year infrastructure buildout.\n\nNvidia stock was down close to 3% early on Thursday, despite the company growing both its revenue and net income by 65% in 12 months to $216 billion and $120 billion, respectively. Nvidia also projected its year-on-year revenue growth this quarter could be as high as 80%.\n\nNvidia shares have slid 8% from all-time highs in October. But they're still up more than 13-fold since the start of 2023, making Nvidia the world's most valuable public company with a $4.6 trillion market capitalization.",

    "description": "Ruchir Sharma says gold's parabolic rally doesn't make sense, with investor coming up with stories that justify its rapid rise in the last year.",
    "fullText": "The explosive rally lifting gold prices since the start of last year looks alarmingly disconnected from any fundamental reality, with investors coming up with narratives explain its rise, a veteran investor says.\n\nRuchir Sharma, the famed economist and chairman of Rockefeller International, flagged the blistering rally in gold prices as a potential concern for investors. The precious metal saw a historic sell-off in late January, but is still up 74% over the last year, making it one of the market's best-performing investments.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC on Monday, he pointed to how the metal's current rally didn't look supported by fundamentals, similar to the rally that took place in the 1970s before fizzling.\n\n\"I've been quite bullish on gold for many years but what I have to admit, given the parabolic price action of the last few months, is that it's totally disconnected from any fundamental story,\" Sharma said, referring to how gold rallies have historically been fueled by more concrete factors, like rate changes or inflation.\n\nInvestors have come up with \"stories\" over the past year to explain gold's increase, Sharma said. He pointed to talk about how gold's rally has been fueled by uncertainty around tariffs, rising deficits, and the potential for hotter inflation in the US. However, those risks don't seem to be reflected in other safe-haven assets, he added, pointing to relative stability in bonds and the US dollar in recent months.\n\nGold's record-breaking streak in the 70s ended when the Fed began raising interest rates in 1980 to combat inflation. Higher rates make the US dollar more competitive as a store of wealth compared to other hard assets, which led bullion to plummet more than 50% from its peak in 1980 through mid-1982.\n\nThough Sharma said he saw \"little chance\" of the Fed raising interest rates anytime soon, he said he recommended investors \"spread out a bit\" by investing in other commodities.\n\nIn a column for the Financial Times this week, he added that his view on gold had shifted from \"bullish\" to \"more agnostic.\"\n\n\"In a market divorced from fundamentals and driven by an increasing number of random stories, it is hard to know which narrative is for real and will hold,\" he wrote.",

    "title": "Meet Tekmerion: The classics-obsessed macro investor spinning out of Brevan Howard with $1 billion",
    "description": "\"There's an opportunity right now where macro is hot and en vogue, and we want to be out there fundraising,\" said Zachary Squire, the firm's CIO.",
    "fullText": "In a way, Tekmerion Capital is a throwback to an earlier era of hedge funds.\n\nBefore mega funds like Millennium and Citadel shifted the $5.2 trillion industry toward more institutional \"skill factories,\" hedge funds were dominated by quirky characters trading niche markets and esoteric instruments.\n\nZachary Squire certainly fits that bill. The chief investment officer of Tekmerion Capital, which will spin out of Brevan Howard next month with $1 billion in assets, Squire has the investing bona fides — with stops at D.E. Shaw, Bridgewater, and HBK — that would catch any allocator's eye.\n\nEven in the eccentric world of macro investors, though, Squire stands out. A Princeton valedictorian who majored in Latin and ancient Greek, he's turning his undergraduate thesis — a deep dive into property rights in the works of Roman philosopher Cicero — into a book. He sang opera as a child growing up in New York City.\n\nSquire and his partner, Reed Morrissey, the firm's CEO, are now pitching to new backers. The pair is in South Beach this week for the annual iConnections conference to meet with potential investors — and to add to his many conversation starters, Squire drove from New York to Miami.\n\nTekmerion counts multimanager quant fund, Engineers Gate, and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz as investors and is positioning itself as a diversifier for institutions heavily exposed to US stocks, driven by differentiated macro research.\n\n\"There's an opportunity right now where macro is hot and en vogue, and we want to be out there fundraising,\" said Squire in an interview last week at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Balcony Lounge restaurant.\n\n\"We want investors who understand what macro is, we want investors who understand hedge funds,\" he added.\n\nSquire initially had no interest in money management. He was set to pursue a Master's in philosophy at Cambridge University when a cold email from legendary fund D.E. Shaw changed his trajectory.\n\n\"I still don't know how they found me,\" he said. He joined the firm's entry-level rotational associates program, in part because Cambridge allowed him to defer his enrollment for a year.\n\nD.E. Shaw is known for its focus on talent that, at first glance, doesn't fit the typical Wall Street mold. Squire said the pitch was basically \"everything in the finance industry is learning.\" Winning, for asset managers, requires \"sheer intellectual horsepower.\"\n\nHe spent the bulk of his two years there on risk management, where he was exposed to the entire catalogue of markets, asset classes, and instruments the firm trades. He then joined Bridgewater, the Ray Dalio-founded firm that holds the title of largest hedge fund in the world, researching and trading global rates and currencies. An internal trading game — where employees could invest part of their pay in ideas they believed in — ultimately helped Tekmerion come about.\n\nHis strong performance in the game \"gave me confidence I could do something like this,\" Squire said.\n\nAdding to his macro toolkit, Squire spent the next three years in London for credit investor HBK, focused on emerging markets.\n\nThe Tekmerion framework began to emerge, in large part thanks to Morrissey, a childhood friend who majored in international relations at Georgetown and worked in Malawi during his Fulbright scholarship.\n\nMorrissey \"saw the vision before I did,\" Squire said, and soon the pair, along with a fellow Bridgewater alum, Lawrence Minicone, set out to raise money for the new venture. A mutual connection living in Puerto Rico brought them into Novogratz's orbit, who backed them.\n\nTekmerion — a Greek word that, in academic texts, means irrefutable proof but in everyday language translates to \"boundary stone\" or a marker to delineate two sides — was launched in early 2017 with a small team and a relative pittance of capital.\n\nThe firm's launch quickly caught the attention of the executive team at Bridgewater, including Dalio. Bridgewater's legal team kept its complaints in private arbitration, where the mega fund alleged Tekmerion had run amok of past employee agreements thanks to a \"misappropriation of trade secrets, breaches of contract, and unfair competition.\"\n\nTekmerion eventually won a positive ruling from the panel, which found that Bridgewater had \"manufactured false evidence.\" The case spilled into public view in 2020 because Tekmerion sued Bridgewater to recover millions in legal fees, though that case was settled in August 2020.\n\nBridgewater declined to comment. Despite the frustration with Bridgewater and its legal strategy, Squire appreciates his former employer's focus on publishing research, something Tekmerion has continued.\n\nIn that stressful time for the young fund, Minicone stepped away from the fund to work at RB Venture Partners as a private market investor.\n\nIn the years following the pandemic, the fund began to gain traction, delivering returns of nearly 30% in 2022, when global equity markets tanked, and 9.3% in 2023, outperforming larger macro players like Rokos Capital and Bridgewater. The manager caught the eye of billionaire Brevan Howard cofounder Alan Howard, who personally backed the young fund.\n\nThat relationship kicked off a relationship between not just Tekmerion and Howard, but also his firm. In 2024, the manager merged into the Brevan platform, where they continued to manage their own branded fund under Brevan's umbrella of strategies.\n\nSquire and Morrissey are excited to be back on their own again, though with a bigger team and much more capital. An undisclosed number of Brevan employees who worked under them are a part of the relaunch team. While Howard and Brevan are not investors in the relaunch, the firm retains the right to invest later and gets a share of Tekmerion's revenue going forward.\n\nThe firm's main partnership is now Engineers Gate, the multimanager systematic firm run by Greg Eisner. The fund will work from Engineers Gate's midtown Manhattan offices in a building that also houses multistrategy giant Balyasny. (They eventually hope to find their own space downtown, closer to the Chinatown neighborhood Squire and Morrissey call home).\n\nWith many operational headaches settled thanks to the Engineers Gate relationship, the focus can now be on research and the firm's models more than ever. Despite being a systematic macro manager, Squire said, \"We don't like to be called a quant.\"\n\nTekmerion's process starts with discretionary macro research to determine which investment signals and data inputs are worth weighing more heavily than others in an algorithm. Because of the slow frequency of many macro datasets, the firm typically holds positions for weeks at a time, Morrissey said.\n\nSquire and Morrissey believe the firm's nowcasting — their projection of what the macro environment is in the moment, since many economic data points are produced on a delay, such as the unemployment rate — is a key part of the pitch for potential LPs, which would get access to both the research and the fund's returns.\n\nIn the meantime, the pair keep their history and shared background top of mind. When Miles Johnson, a student from their old high school, reached out in 2022 with a passion for the classics but uncertainty about his career path, the firm brought him on as an intern. They said he's been a \"rockstar\" for the manager as he's matriculated at Columbia and continues doing research for the manager.\n\n\"Talent doesn't have a blueprint,\" Morrissey said.\n\n\"You don't need the same degree or background; people are people, and it's their grit and drive that we're interested in.\"",

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\n\nASML Holding (ENXTAM:ASML) reports a breakthrough in EUV lithography that can enable up to 50% higher chip production efficiency.\n\nThe company says its latest EUV machines use a much more powerful light source to help customers process significantly more chips by 2030.\n\nThis development reinforces ASML's position in advanced semiconductor manufacturing as competitors in the U.S. and China work on rival technologies.\n\nASML Holding sits at the center of high end chip production, supplying EUV lithography tools that many chipmakers use for leading edge manufacturing. The new machine design directly targets growing demand for next generation AI chips, an area that has become a key focus across the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor investors watching ENXTAM:ASML, the bigger question is how this technology shift could influence customer investment plans and the competitive gap with other equipment makers. The reported 50% efficiency potential by 2030 may shape long term capacity decisions across foundries and integrated device manufacturers that rely on EUV tools.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for ASML Holding by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on ASML Holding.\n\n2 things going right for ASML Holding that this headline doesn't cover.\n\nThis EUV light-source breakthrough goes straight to the economics of chip production. If a tool can process around 50% more wafers per hour without needing extra floor space or duplicate systems, it can change how customers such as TSMC and Intel think about their long term fab build outs. For ASML, that can translate into a stronger case for its most advanced EUV platforms as fabs push to supply AI and high performance computing chips. It also reinforces why ASML is often treated as a way to get exposure to AI chip demand without choosing a specific chip designer. At the same time, a more productive tool could slow the need for incremental units at the margin if customers can get more output from each system, so investors may want to watch how pricing, service and upgrade revenues evolve alongside unit volumes, especially as U.S. and Chinese equipment makers work on competing technologies.\n\nThis EUV advance aligns with the narrative that ASML’s EUV and High NA platforms support productivity and cost reductions for chipmakers, which can support equipment adoption tied to AI demand.\n\nIf High NA adoption timing or tool maturity proves more complex than expected, the focus on current generation EUV power gains could delay some of the earnings contribution that narrative writers associate with future platforms.\n\nThe news puts more weight on ASML’s installed base and upgrade potential, which is mentioned in the narrative, but the specific impact of higher light output on long term service and upgrade revenue may not yet be fully reflected.",

    "description": "Investor fears over private credit have reached the desk of the Treasury secretary.",
    "fullText": "Pressure on Blue Owl Capital (OWL) isn't letting up after an asset sale meant to calm investor worries last week sparked new concern from top government officials about the $1.8 trillion private credit industry.\n\n\"We are concerned,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday when asked about the growth of Blue Owl and other private lenders over recent years. \"If there is something rotten, it is not going to be handed to the individual investors,\" Bessent said.\n\nHow are analysts viewing Blue Owl's loan sale decision?\n\nWhy did Treasury Secretary Bessent express concern about Blue Owl?\n\nWhat risks exist from private credit industry interconnectedness?\n\nWhat was Blue Owl's $1.4 billion asset sale strategy?\n\nLast Wednesday, Blue Owl said it sold $1.4 billion in loans and lending commitments from three of its funds, with some proceeds used to repay investors 30% of their capital from the oldest of those private credit funds, known as Blue Owl Development Corporation II (OBDC II), which is winding down after scrapping a planned merger late last year.\n\nBut what drew outsized attention was Blue Owl's decision to eliminate the optionality for investors to cash out of OBDC II on a quarterly basis and instead institute a program of quarterly capital distributions based on the fund's future earnings and asset sales.\n\nThe move drew fresh scrutiny to the opaque world of private debt, which has boomed in recent years but has never truly faced a crisis — and is now garnering mounting scrutiny as it is gradually making its way into millions of US brokerage and retirement accounts following an executive order President Trump signed last summer.\n\nBlue Owl's stock fell 5% Monday morning.\n\nWall Street analysts, who generally approved of Blue Owl's loan sale, still aren't worried about the firm or the wider private credit industry having significant credit problems.\n\n\"We don't believe there is a serious concern about a deterioration in private credit quality,\" Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Kotowski said last week Blue Owl's sale \"should have been greeted favorably,\" adding that the marginal haircut of 99.7% on the dollar for the sold loans served as proof that private loan valuations \"reflect market realities.\"\n\nBlue Owl co-CEO Marc Lipschultz said earlier this month the company sees no \"red flags\" in the credit quality of its software-tied loans. \"We don't have yellow flags. We actually have largely green flags,\" he told analysts.\n\nOne aspect of Blue Owl's sale did raise some eyebrows, as Bloomberg reported one of the buyers for its assets included Kuvare, a insurance focused asset manager Blue Owl acquired in 2024. Like Blue Owl, Apollo (APO), Ares (ARES), Blackstone (BX), KKR & Co. (KKR), and other major private credit lenders own insurance companies.

    "fullText": "Y Combinator startup Letter AI has raised $40 million in fresh funding just four months after its $10.6 million Series A, underscoring investor appetite for AI tools to reshape sales.\n\nThe Chicago-based startup's post-money valuation is now in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Letter cofounder and CEO Ali Akhtar told Business Insider.\n\nAkhtar says companies have long relied on disparate tools for tasks such as sales content, training, and buyer engagement. Letter's software unites these systems into a single \"command center,\" Akhtar said, displacing other tools and enabling sellers to spend more time interacting with customers.\n\nAlongside announcing the Battery Ventures-led Series B, the company is also rolling out Letter Compass, a new product that provides personalized, deal-specific guidance during sales, including coaching tailored to a specific employee or opportunity and suggestions for messaging and next steps.\n\nAkhtar said Battery approached him and cofounder Armen Forget, the CTO, about funding. He attributed the quick succession of rounds to \"phenomenal traction\" and retention. Y Combinator, Lightbank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, and Stage 2 Capital also participated in the Series B alongside existing investors.\n\nLetter counts customers across 30 countries, including Lenovo, Adobe, Novo Nordisk, and Plaid. It will use the funding to expand product development and grow the team globally — which counts 25 employees — across sales, engineering, and customer success, Akhtar said.\n\nLetter is growing in a crowded field, as stalwarts like Salesforce increasingly incorporate AI features and sales AI startups emerge. Gong analyzes sales interactions, for instance, while Seismic and Highspot, which help train salespeople, have announced plans to merge.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Letter AI used to raise its $40 million Series B.

    "description": "As Snoop Dogg attends his first Swansea City game, BBC Sport Wales looks at how the sport-loving American rapper became an investor in the Welsh club.",
    "fullText": "Microphone in hand, shades on despite the dimmed lights, Snoop Dogg is going through a back catalogue of hits that has made him one of the biggest hip hop stars in the world.\n\nAll while wearing a Swansea City beanie hat and hoodie.\n\nIf the social media videos from Monday night's private party in an industrial estate on the outskirts of the city don't seem surreal enough, Tuesday night will see Snoop take his seat at the Swansea.Com Stadium for his first game since becoming an investor in the Championship club.\n\nAfter the introduction of Hollywood to EFL ownership at Wrexham with Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, here is Swansea City's next episode.\n\n\"It's a bit different, I think you can say that,\" says Swans supporter and fanzine editor Steven Carroll, understatedly summing up the feeling of a fanbase.\n\n\"But it's definitely captured the imagination and that can only be a positive.\"\n\nSwansea have 'job to do' as Snoop Dogg visits\n\nSnoop Dogg aiming to make Swansea a 'global name'\n\nResponsible for selling 35 million records worldwide, Snoop Dogg can now add record ticket sales to his resume.\n\nThe club have opened up sections of the away end because of the spike in interest, meaning not only have the 'sold out' signs gone up for the visit of Preston North End, the game is also set to see more Swansea fans in the ground than ever before.\n\nIt's a short term hit of buzz for a club that lost its way after relegation from the Premier League in 2018.\n\nEyes, however, are now on a return - with the involvement of Snoop part of a longer-term plan that Swansea chief executive Tom Gorringe says has \"no limits\".\n\nBrought on board by the club's US owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen in July, Snoop's minority stake didn't mean a large injection of cash.\n\nBut it did mean a huge boost to its ability to sell itself.\n\n\"The reality is that if we operated within our natural resources we couldn't compete financially,\" says Gorringe, speaking just after helping show Snoop around the club's training base on Monday afternoon where he met players and staff.\n\n\"PSR (profit and sustainability rules) is our biggest constraint. We are up against sides with parachute payments and we have one of the lowest turnovers.\n\n\"We have to think of new ways to generate income. We are an underdog and part of the attraction for him is the difference he can make with the pull he naturally has.\"\n\nThat pull includes more than 100 million social media followers – more than Wrexham's ownership combined – that Swansea have already looked to make the most of.\n\nBeyond growing the brand and the wider fan base, which Gorringe admits \"takes time\", there have already been tangible benefits.\n\nIncome has seen tie-ins, including clothing collaborations with Snoop's own publishing label, the iconic Death Row Records that was once the home of Dr Dre and Tupac Shakur.\n\n\"By December, our retail business surpassed last year's revenue,\" says Gorringe, who has previously suggested that sponsorship deals for next year are set to be bigger and better than any previous agreement.\n\nWhy Swansea would want to have Snoop on board – and in the stadium – is obvious. Why Snoop is at Swansea could seem less so.\n\nHis history, though, suggests he's not short of entrepreneurialism, including investing in social news site Reddit in 2014.\n\nThe opportunity at Swansea combined that interest with his long-held association with sport, most recently seen during his role as Team USA's 'honorary coach' at the Winter Olympics.\n\nWhether cheering on competitors or trying out the sports themselves – including curling - he combined his role with work for US broadcasters, as he did at the Summer Games in Paris for which he won an Emmy. Views of his videos for NBC in Milan-Cortina are reported to have hit 73 million.\n\nHis love of NFL is well known too. A Pittsburgh fan, he's arranged for every fan at tomorrow's game to have a Snoop and Swansea branded towel to emulate the twirling performed by Steelers crowds.\n\nQuite how the Preston fans respond to that sight is another thing.\n\n\"That's actually part of the attraction,\" laughs Gorringe when asked if he's told the self-confessed 'soccer' fan about what to expect. \"He's watched enough of how fans interact here and that it's very different to US sports. He loves that passion and tribalism.\"\n\nSnoop's friend and fellow minority investor, US TV personality and billionaire businesswoman Martha Stewart, has already sampled the EFL environment after attending the December win over Wrexham.\n\nGiven how long it has taken Snoop to experience such atmospheres for himself, there will be those who wonder if this is more gimmick that genuine.\n\nUnlike at Wrexham, Snoop has no formal role, no decision-making power, just contributions and offers to help in the ways he can.\n\nBut similarly to how Reynolds and Mac have emotionally invested in north Wales, buying into something bigger is seen as part of the desire to get involved.\n\n\"There's a definite excitement about being part of things and he was really engaged in it all - but it's clear he's aware there's a responsibility,\" adds Gorringe. \"He wants to learn more about the city and the community because he sees that as an important role.\n\n\"It would be easy for this to be done as a PR stunt but understanding the city is the heart of who we are and who he is.\"\n\nIn other words, someone who didn't always find life easy has an affinity for the 'underdog', predominantly working class, city.\n\nIt's why some of the first meetings at the training ground were with the kitmen and team chef, not only long-serving members of staff but very much of the local area and die-hard fans.\n\nIt is also why Snoop bought up a number of tickets for Tuesday's game himself so he can donate to community groups.\n\n\"Who knows, the weather might be nice and he might think the Gower is better than LA,\" laughs Steven Carroll of the SoS (Save our Swans) fanzine.\n\n\"We'll see what happens, but he's the biggest celebrity to ever step foot in Swansea and its an association we seem to be benefitting from.\n\n\"It doesn't even matter if he doesn't know the players' names, that's not what he's here for.\"\n\nStewart joins Snoop and Modric as Swans co-owner\n\nBallon d'Or to boardroom – why Swansea for Modric?\n\nSwansea's third high-profile investor is more likely to have an influence on that front.\n\nFormer Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric is also a minority shareholder - but is yet to make his first visit as he continues to perform at the top level with AC Milan.\n\nThe 40-year-old Croatia captain is described by Gorringe as \"an unbelievable asset\" who watches every game and is \"really integrated\" as he prepares for a life after playing.\n\nHe has spoken to Snoop on Swansea, just as Snoop met and spoke with manager Vitor Matos on Monday, with the Swans' former Liverpool coach denying the spotlight is a distraction as they aim to keep the play-offs in range.\n\n\"It's always good and exciting for the club, for the city, having someone like him with his profile,\" said Matos, whose side are six points off the top six.\n\n\"When you have people who care about the club on the top of the organisation it's always good.\n\n\"But what motivates us and what needs to motivate us is the fans, the noise of the people in the stands, it's about a granddad taking his grandchild to the stadium, the legacy that you bring to the stadium from old times to now.\n\n\"I think that's what we want to build from and Snoop is another person to help us do that.\"\n\nEven it does all seem a little surreal.\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views",

    "description": "New tariffs chaos means investor should focus on AI and sectors of the S&P 500 that have outperformed this year, investing experts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

    "title": "Starbucks investor group gears up for board fight over backsliding labor relations",
    "description": "Some Starbucks investors are urging against re-electing two board members who they say are responsible for \"backsliding\" labor relations.",
    "fullText": "A group of Starbucks investors is escalating their pressure campaign over the coffee giant's ongoing labor turmoil — and this time, they're targeting the board.\n\nAhead of the company's March 25 annual meeting, a coalition of long-term shareholders that have advocated for workers' rights is urging investors to vote against the reelection of Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, the lead independent director, and Beth Ford, the chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee. The group cites what they call \"sustained oversight failures of labor relations.\"\n\n\"We have a world‑class board of directors with deep, relevant expertise, who is supporting our management team in driving a business turnaround,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nUS baristas began unionizing in late 2021. More than four years — and four strikes, supported by politicians like Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani — later, the company has not reached its first collective bargaining agreement.\n\nStarbucks Workers United says it represents more than 12,000 baristas at over 600 locations. After Starbucks shuttered hundreds of US stores in September, a Starbucks spokesperson said the union represents closer to 550, or less than 5%, of its company-owned stores.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider in October that the company offers \"best-in-class benefits\" and said the union's demands for a 77% increase in the minimum wage for hourly partners over the life of a three-year contract are \"not sustainable.\"\n\nThe company also said in a public statement that union delegates \"prematurely ended\" its last bargaining session in late December 2024.\n\nThe investors organizing against the board members include New York City Comptroller Mark Levine, Trillium ESG Global Equity Mutual Fund, Merseyside Pension Fund, and the Shareholder Association for Research and Education. These activist shareholders argue that Starbucks' board has retreated from its prior commitments to strengthen labor relations as tensions have flared again.\n\n\"The sudden U-turn on labor relations oversight by Starbucks' Board is inconsistent with the Company's turnaround strategy and commitments — and changes have not been explained to shareholders,\" the shareholder letter reads.\n\nThe letter points to mounting legal and reputational risks facing the company. In the first three years of organizing, workers filed over 700 charges of labor rights violations with the National Labor Relations Board against Starbucks and its outside counsel. The Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, found the number of charges filed was \"almost certainly\" the highest number in history.\n\nSince January 2025, workers have filed more than 125 unfair labor practice charges, including allegations of failure to bargain in good faith and retaliatory firings. They also launched three work stoppages, the latest of which began in November and is ongoing at 17 locations. Starbucks has 16,911 locations in the US.\n\nStarbucks has also faced a $38.9 million settlement with New York City in December over alleged Fair Workweek Law violations affecting more than 15,000 workers — \"the largest labor law settlement in the city's history,\" the letter says.\n\nJonas Kron, the chief advocacy officer at $4.2 billion Trillium Asset Management, one of the investor groups that signed the letter, told Business Insider that Starbucks' labor reputation is \"enormously important\" for shareholder value.\n\n\"And reputation can slip in the world of social media relatively quickly and with some pretty small episodes,\" Kron said. \"It's not that many stores, that may be true, but that doesn't diminish the impact that it can have.\"\n\nStarbucks has acknowledged the risks posed by its ongoing labor battle. In its most recent annual report, the company said work stoppages from unionized baristas can \"have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\"\n\nThe investor group argues that the board initially appeared to take those risks seriously. In late 2023, following a shareholder proposal supported by a majority and the threat of a proxy contest, Starbucks created an Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact (EPCI) Committee, tasked primarily with overseeing labor relations.\n\nThat committee was \"quietly eliminated\" in November, with the board taking over three months to \"provide an unpersuasive justification\" of its breakup, the investors wrote.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson said the move gave the full board responsibility for labor oversight to ensure accountability, consistency, and alignment with company priorities.\n\nThe investor group has concerns.\n\n\"This inconsistency and abrupt reversal raise legitimate concerns about whether the Board is retreating from the focused, independent oversight it previously deemed necessary,\" the letter states.\n\nThe governance shift comes as Starbucks continues its turnaround under CEO Brian Niccol, whose strategy centers on improving service and strengthening connections between staff and customers.\n\n\"Starbucks' turnaround plan depends on an engaged workforce and improved in-store experience, both of which are strained by ongoing labor conflict,\" the investors wrote.\n\nMichelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the Starbucks Workers United union and a 15-year veteran barista, told Business Insider in a statement that Starbucks \"doesn't work\" without its baristas.\n\n\"We also know that Starbucks could be the 'Best Job in Retail,' as company executives say, but it isn't right now and hasn't been for a very long time,\" Eisen said. \"Bringing about long-term stability at Starbucks begins with a fair union contract.\"\n\nThe investor coalition argues that Knudstorp and Ford are \"uniquely accountable\" for the labor tensions, given their roles. Knudstorp chaired the nominating and corporate governance committee from 2019 through 2025, served on the EPCI committee, and became lead independent director in 2025. Ford joined the board in 2023, chaired the EPCI committee, and now leads the nominating and corporate governance committee.\n\nThe investors also point to what they describe as waning transparency and engagement. In proxy statements, Starbucks reported at least 30 shareholder engagements in both 2023 and 2024, and 18 in 2025.\n\n\"Taken together, these changes suggest a troubling retreat from transparency, responsiveness, and commitment to engage on labor oversight matters material to shareholder value,\" the investors wrote.",

    "fullText": "The once relentless rally in AI-fueled stocks has lost momentum, as investors confront the unsettling idea that advances in artificial intelligence could erode the very value propositions that made tech giants dominant in the first place. Yet some executives and market veterans warn against short-term panic, calling the selloff a rare opportunity to buy into the next phase of the AI boom.\n\nThe AI growth story has been tempered by a widespread selloff in software stocks. Call it the software-mageddon or the SaaSpocalypse, but companies who specialize in designing, selling, and maintaining digital software products are getting battered. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts wrote that software companies had lost around $2 trillion in value over the past year, calling it “the largest non-recessionary 12-month drawdown in over 30 years.”\n\nThe culprit has been an increasingly widespread feeling among investors that AI is sorting tech players into winners and losers. Under this view, software companies could fall into the latter camp as the capabilities of newer AI models promise to replace expensive digital services, rendering the business models of companies like Salesforce and Atlassian obsolete.\n\nBut not all investors are convinced these companies are destined for irrelevance. Hidden within the chaos could lie an undervalued chance to buy these tech stocks at a discount, a relative rarity in an age of soaring valuations and speculative growth. It all depends on whether bullish buyers consider AI as complementary to existing software services, or capable enough to replace them entirely.\n\n“I think this software selloff will go down as a generational opportunity to own some of the stalwarts,” Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Yahoo Finance interview Friday. “I feel more emboldened about the bull thesis on tech and AI this year, despite obviously this massive pullback.”\n\nIves named three industry leaders that he sees as being unfairly punished in today’s market, and that could be in for a powerful rebound:\n\nIves called the software stock correction a “structural selloff” that was the largest in scale he’d seen in 25 years. But instead of spelling doom for these companies, he framed the wipeout as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in enterprise technology, arguing that software developers will remain a “core part of the use cases,” even in an AI-powered future.",

    "fullText": "If artificial intelligence eliminates millions of jobs, it might make sense to scrap income taxes for the vast majority of Americans and target capital instead, Vinod Khosla says.\n\n\"AI will transform economies and need a rethink of capitalism & equity,\" the billionaire venture capitalist wrote in an X post on Monday. \"Labor portion of economy (vs capital) will decline sharply. Should we eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains tax and equalize to ordinary income?\"\n\nKhosla — who cofounded Sun Microsystems and made the first VC investment in OpenAI — was making the point that AI replacing labor on a grand scale might warrant greater taxes on assets such as stocks and real estate.\n\nThe veteran financier, who founded Khosla Ventures after leaving Kleiner Perkins, attached a video highlighting some of the jobs that could be taken by AI, from accountants and therapists to truck drivers and chip designers.\n\nAI will transform economies and need a rethink of capitalism & equity. Labor portion of economy (vs capital) will decline sharply. Should we eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains tax and equalize to ordinary income? 40% of capital gains taxes are paid by those with… pic.twitter.com/7oSA9xj5Ko\n\nKhosla said in a follow-up post that ramping up taxes on capital would generate so much revenue that the government could scrap taxes for most of the roughly 150 million US taxpayers.\n\n\"Could easily eliminate bottom 125 million taxpayers from the tax rolls and be revenue neutral at the same time with a capital gains tax equal to ordinary income and a few other tweaks,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that tax breaks such as carrying over tax losses and tax-free borrowing against unrealized gains — which he called a \"true abuse!\" — are \"special interest goodies inserted by lobbyists and campaign contributions, not true capitalism.\"\n\nKhosla didn't address common critiques of higher taxes, including that they can discourage entrepreneurship and investment, that collecting them can be tricky, and that wealthy people may leave the country to avoid them.\n\nKhosla has previously underscored that the advent of AI may require sweeping policy changes. He estimated in late 2024 that in 25 years' time, AI could be doing 80% of the work in 80% of all jobs, and universal basic income might be needed to compensate for job destruction.\n\n\"As AI reduces the need for human labor, UBI could become crucial, with governments playing a key role in regulating AI's impact and ensuring equitable wealth distribution,\" he wrote on his firm's website.\n\nKhosla isn't alone in predicting AI will change the fabric of society. Elon Musk suggested late last year that work could become \"optional\" and money might become \"irrelevant\" if advances in AI and robotics generate abundant resources for all.\n\nMoreover, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO recently said that retirement savings may not be needed in 10 or 20 years, as everyone might have \"whatever stuff they want.\"\n\nHowever, skeptics such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame have cautioned the AI boom is a speculative bubble, tech companies are overinvesting in microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, and true AI is further away than many think.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has shifted from virtual silence to answering questions about his personal and professional life on Substack.",
    "fullText": "\"You have a very nice haircut. Did you cut it yourself?\"\n\nMichael Burry, played by Christian Bale, earnestly poses that question to a bewildered analyst in the movie \"The Big Short,\" which chronicles the investor's massive bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble.\n\nThe memorable scene is based on a misguided comment the real-life Burry once made, which he revealed in a comment on his Substack.\n\n\"That is a riff on something similar when I complimented a woman on her dress and asked if it was homemade,\" Burry wrote. \"The pained look was similar.\"\n\nSharing a personal anecdote like that marks a sea change for Burry. Until recently, he was one of finance's most enigmatic figures, known for posting cryptic warnings on X, then deleting them, and vanishing from social media for months or years at a time.\n\nThat changed in November, when Burry closed his hedge fund to outside cash and reinvented himself as a newsletter writer. His posts diagnosing an AI bubble and explaining his bets against Nvidia and Palantir have drawn plenty of attention. But his detailed answers to dozens of questions on myriad topics have largely gone unnoticed.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through the comment sections and discussion threads on Burry's Substack to read all of his responses to subscribers as of Friday last week.\n\nThey offered wide-ranging, unprecedented insights into the personal and professional life of a renowned yet mysterious investor.\n\nElite investors tend to keep a low profile. Even the newly retired Warren Buffett only communicated with Berkshire Hathaway shareholders a handful of times a year.\n\nBurry has broken that mold, shifting from virtual silence as a fund manager to pretty much running a 24/7 \"Ask Me Anything.\"\n\nHe's freely shared his thoughts on the day's headlines and latest market moves.\n\n\"I think there is no doubt a SpaceX-X merger — and even an xAI merger — would be accretive to shareholder value for Tesla,\" he recently wrote. \"However, share value is different than share price.\"\n\n\"It does seem to me that Trump's kryptonite is the American stock market,\" reads another of his comments. \"Nothing else touches him.\"\n\n\"In my view, there are no bigger shoes to fill than Warren's,\" he wrote on another occasion. \"I do not believe anyone can fill them, especially at Berkshire.\"\n\nBurry has also spilled the beans on the contents of his portfolio, down to what stock he bought on a particular day and the average price he paid.\n\nMoreover, he's pulled back the curtain on how he approaches investing. He's discussed earnings calls, analyzed stock charts, held forth on human psychology, and outlined his macroeconomic views in comments and messages to subscribers.\n\nBurry has delved into subjects as esoteric as the dynamics of health insurance marketplaces. He's also shed light on his daily habits and interests, often with humor and humility.\n\n\"Young people sometimes don't know how playful and goofy us older guys are,\" he recently wrote.\n\nWhen a reader queried if he'd consider starring in a documentary, Burry quipped: \"Me sitting in front of a computer in my shorts? Or sitting in a chair reading? Doesn't sound too compelling.\"\n\nAsked how he felt on a scale of 1-10, Burry replied: \"I am pretty much a 5 all the time. My wife can attest. My 54-year-old face is not etched by many smiles.\"\n\nResponding to a follow-up question about how he felt when his \"Big Short\" initially went south, he wrote: \"That manifested in my gut. Not fun. I was headed to surgery. Then the trade worked out and I was cured.\"\n\n\"Sir you need sleep,\" one thoughtful subscriber wrote. \"Thank you. I got four hours in,\" Burry replied.\n\nOnce a closed book, the investor has revealed that he's reading \"The Sun Eater\" book series by sci-fi writer Christopher Ruocchio, had a \"heck of a time\" at an Aerosmith concert in the '80s, played Pokémon with his kids, and titled one post after a heavy-metal song called \"The Jig Is Up\" by Ice Nine Kills.\n\nHe's also disclosed some of his favorite investments. He wrote that he's been holding gold and silver for more than 20 years now, and snaps up Samsung Electronics stock every time it gets cheap — a strategy that has \"worked spectacularly several times\" in the past two decades.\n\nBurry, whose Substack is titled \"Cassandra Unchained,\" has also lived up to his reputation for doom-and-gloom predictions.\n\n\"But before a couple of years pass, I see a 100 car wreck that will hurt a lot of AI bulls,\" he wrote, underlining his concern about where the market is headed.",

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

But if what you're saying is follows the last model, it's almost like it wouldn't necessarily be a positive catalyst, it might be a negative sort of like that last capitulation catalyst.\n\nYeah. Right. We need Correct. Correct.\n\nWhat are the what what could be that catalyst?\n\nSo, you know, some people thought uh FTX. Uh, maybe there's another similar type of thing out there.\n\nLike there's a blow up waiting in the wings somewhere.\n\nYeah, like, you know, most people have said that the acceleration down really started after October 10th. You know, October 10th there was a flash crash.\n\nAnd we're we've had flash crashes in the traditional markets. I was in the hedge fund business in the old world for 25 years. I saw many flash crashes. They're normal.\n\nAnd in crypto, you've have flash crashes all the time. It used to be, I don't know if you remember but in 2016, 17, 18, Coinbase would go down and people would say, oh, Coinbase is down and you would have a flash crash.\n\nAnd so we had a very severe moment on October 10th that is yet to be sort of resolved. The person who was maybe forced to liquidate, uh or the entity that was forced to liquidate, uh it seems is still, uh, is still liquidating. Maybe there is an entity, maybe there isn't. We don't know, but I think um there has to be sort of a capitulative moment, a moment of realization where people say, oh my goodness,\n\nit's over. And we've already been seeing that, oh Bitcoin's going to zero. Someone asked me the other day at dinner whether Bitcoin was going to zero. Um, so it's sort of unfortunate, but that's sort of the way markets work.

    "fullText": "One year into Donald Trump's presidency, bitcoin is worth less than it was before he was elected, and the entire market is in the throes of a crypto winter. According to famed investor Ross Gerber, blame the meme coin ecosystem for the broader decline.\n\nThe CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management thinks the launch of the Trump and Melania coins around the time of the inauguration, followed by a subsequent boom in meme tokens, has left investors fatigued and wary of digital assets.\n\nIn his view, meme coins either endorsed or launched by celebrities are either rug pulls or end up looking like one. In either case, normal investors are left holding the bag while celebrity boosters get rich.\n\nHe pointed to World Liberty Financial Coin and the Melania token, which have both plummeted in price, while the Trump meme coin has also shed about 80% of its value in the last year.\n\n\"People dive in and buy this stuff because they buy into the fraud, basically, and then they get burned, and that money doesn't come back. It's stolen from them.\"\n\nThis is only part of the problem that Gerber sees. When people lose money betting on meme coins, he added, they typically turn their back on crypto and don't come back. He also thinks the Trump administration's looser approach to crypto regulation is making the market less appealing to everyday investors.\n\nHe said it is extremely difficult for bitcoin to rally when investors are being scared away from crypto, as demand rises only when new participants enter the market.\n\nGerber also cited other celebrity-launched cryptos, such as the token launched by former NYC mayor Eric Adams and the $HAWK coin launched by internet personality Haliey Welch, as examples of celebrities meme coins that plummeted shortly after they debuted, while leaving investors holding the bag.\n\nGerber isn't the only one arguing that a growing lack of faith in crypto is compromising bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently argued that it will be hard for bitcoin to rise again until institutional investors increase their participation.",

Who knows if this is the right one, but we won’t know until we actually do the deep dive, have the discussions and figure out what’s best for our constituents,” said Harris of Senate Bill 954 that he is sponsoring.\n\nThe bill, which lays out a pathway for investor-owned electric utilities to use ratepayer dollars to build power generation infrastructure in Maryland, has the support of Exelon — the owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco. The Chicago-based utility has been campaigning hard for the idea, including in TV commercials that aired in Maryland during the Super Bowl.\n\nBut consumer advocates and environmental groups argue that putting additional costs on the backs of customers would be deeply harmful amid already-high costs. They warn that high infrastructure spending by utilities is part of the reason for the current high rates, and allowing further construction would make matters worse.\n\nMaryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who is tasked with representing utility ratepayers in the state, said in a statement that he believes “the Exelon bill is anything but affordable.”\n\n“Turning new business over to Exelon unnecessarily exposes customers to the Exelon utilities’ long record of exceeding cost projections and of cost overruns,” Lapp said.\n\nIn Maryland, the utilities, which control the distribution of power to homes and businesses across the state, are separate from the companies that generate power and supply it to the grid.\n\nThe utilities enjoy monopolies in their service territories and are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which presides over the costs they can pass on to customers. Utilities receive reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs, and a guaranteed profit on top of that, often 9% or higher.\n\nCurrent law technically states that the PSC “may require or allow investor-owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities … subject to appropriate cost recovery.”\n\nHarris’ bill is considerably more specific.\n\nThe bill directs the PSC to require one or more electric companies to submit plans involving power generation, if it determines that there is a power scarcity, or that an event impacting “price stability” has occurred. The commission then has one year to approve or deny the plans.\n\nHarris said that his bill, called the Affordable Energy Act, would only allow the utilities to build renewable energy projects, but not fossil fuel projects.\n\nValencia McClure, senior vice president of government, regulatory and external affairs for Exelon’s Maryland utilities, said her company wants to focus on operating community solar farms and battery storage infrastructure, not natural gas generation. She noted that power customers who \n\n“We really are focusing on: How can we support our customers during this affordability crisis?” McClure said. “The way to do that is to — if called upon by the state — to be able to build new generation.”\n\nBut Lapp said Maryland consumers should not be paying for any increased power generation in the state through their rates, since much of the predicted strain on the regional grid isn’t actually coming from Maryland. It’s largely coming from data centers projected for other states, he said.\n\nHouse caps amount of utility employee salaries that can come out of ratepayers’ pockets\n\n“PJM projects that the Maryland Exelon utilities’ power demands decrease — not increase — through 2029.” Lapp wrote. “Aside from some relatively small data center growth in Maryland compared to PJM — growth that existing customers should not be responsible for — the Exelon utilities’ energy demands only go up modestly starting in 2030, at a growth rate much lower than historical growth rates.”\n\nHarris’ bill explicitly states that the electric utilities required or authorized to construct power facilities can recover all of their costs from ratepayers — even if some of those costs are stranded, including if the infrastructure is never built.\n\n“That’s one of the things that we would be discussing further and see what is actually needed and what is not needed,” Harris said.\n\nLapp argues that the provision is alarming.\n\n“It would give utilities unprecedented statutory protection from the consequences of building power plants that turn out to be unnecessary — a real possibility given the vast evidence suggesting that projections of data center energy demands are inflated,” Lapp wrote.\n\nIn a statement, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the company supports the measure “to make sure a large generation project doesn’t jeopardize the utility’s health or lead to higher debt costs overall, which would adversely impact customers.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the bill will be able to advance: Senate President Bill Ferguson said Tuesday that “there is a level of skepticism that exists across the caucus, and across the Senate membership” about whether it will reduce ratepayer costs.\n\n“That’s going to be the lens that we are really trying to hone in on, is whether or not a policy is going to provide long-term savings for the ratepayer,” Ferguson said.\n\nMcClure said Exelon estimates that average customer bills would increase about $2 per month for a few years, but those would turn to savings of $5 to $10 a month in the future. The company’s analysis was based on construction of 2,700 megawatts of battery storage and 1,200 megawatts of solar.\n\nFerguson said that he would “prefer that that the risk” of investment “land with investors.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\n“But there is a question that if there is a strike price or point where … the market is not generating sufficient domestic generation, whether that has to be some other market intervention to push it,” Ferguson said.\n\nLast year, lawmakers passed the Next Generation Energy Act, which included a fast-track permitting process for “dispatchable” energy projects, which can provide energy for the grid when called upon during peak times. Only two projects have been approved to move through the fast-track, under the legislation’s requirements: Two different concepts for a natural gas plant in Harford County, submitted by Constellation.\n\nConstellation, formerly an Exelon subsidiary, also proposed a battery storage project, but it did not meet requirements of the fast-track bill, even though it created a procurement specifically for battery storage.\n\nConstellation has been opposed to Exelon’s push to enter the generation game, arguing that it would crowd out competitive power producers, and that Exelon is ill-suited to enter the generation fray.\n\n“BGE doesn’t need new law to build new generation,” said Constellation spokesman Paul Adams. “BGE wants new law to guarantee a return on any investment, whether or not that investment is in the best interests of Maryland ratepayers or at the lowest cost. Unlike them, Constellation is ready and willing to put our own capital on the line, with no guarantee of profit. It seems only reasonable that if you aren’t willing to take on any risk, you should take no profit.”",

    "fullText": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — As major energy companies announce plans to move their headquarters from Oklahoma City to Houston, experts say the reasons may have less to do with what Oklahoma is doing wrong and more about publicly-traded companies’ priority to serve shareholders above others.\n\nExperts say that while there are certain things the state can improve upon, in the case of Devon Energy and Expand Energy, the deck was already stacked against Oklahoma outside of the state’s control.\n\n“The joke around my part of the city is that we’d rather live in Oklahoma City because we have less traffic, better weather, and a better basketball team,” Former Oklahoma City University Business School Dean Steve Agee told News 4.\n\nExpand Energy to move headquarters to Houston\n\nAgee said he believes the moves can mostly be blamed on the fact that Devon and Expand are publicly-traded companies, which prioritize shareholders before their communities, employees, or customers.\n\n“I think we all have to step back and make sure that we understand corporations like this are in business to make money and they’re in business to provide good returns for their shareholders,” Agee said.\n\n“Devon and Expand are thinking that—in order to enhance shareholder value—a move like this would probably be the appropriate thing to do,” Agee said.\n\nOver the past decade, other publicly-traded energy companies have also moved to Houston, including ExxonMobil, leaving the Dallas–Fort Worth area, and Chevron leaving California.\n\nWalt Duncan, president of privately-held Oklahoma City-based Duncan Oil Properties, said publicly traded companies often want to position themselves near each other to serve as a one-stop shop for industry analysts.\n\n“The public companies want to have as much coverage as they can by industry analysts,” Duncan said. “And so, you know, most of these analysts are coming out of New York. You know, if they can stop in one city and, you know, hit 20 different companies that they have to cover, that’s much easier for them.”\n\nDuncan said boards overseeing Devon and Expand have included fewer and fewer Oklahomans over the years, leaving fewer leaders with ties to the community.\n\nIt’s different for privately-held companies like Continental Resources—soon to be Oklahoma City’s largest remaining energy company.\n\nState and local leaders react to Devon and Coterra merger\n\nContinental Resources CEO Harold Hamm told The Oklahoman Monday he’s committed to keeping the company in Oklahoma.\n\n“I don’t have any concern that Continental being private is ever going to is ever going to want to go to Houston,” Duncan said. “You really do have to think about it, and you have to take sort of the executive management team, I do not know very many people in the industry, you know, kind of rank and file, that I have ever heard of being excited to move to Houston.”",

    "description": "Thomas Kaplan championed the lifelong benefits of being grateful, acting with conviction, and being willing to say \"I don't know.\"",
    "fullText": "Gratitude, humility, and conviction are key ingredients for a happy and successful life, Thomas Kaplan says.\n\nThe billionaire investor, who owns the world's largest private collection of artworks by Rembrandt van Rijn, spoke to Business Insider ahead of the auction of \"Young Lion Resting\" at Sotheby's New York on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rembrandt drawing, which Kaplan co-owned, sold for nearly $18 million — with the proceeds going to Panthera, the \"big cat\" conservation nonprofit he cofounded.\n\nKaplan said that protecting endangered felines has been his greatest passion since he was six years old. He dreamed of studying big cats as a felid zoologist, only to realize a few years later that he lacked the flair for science required.\n\n\"But I made a vow to myself — I think I was about 12 — if I ever make enough money, I'm going to come back to the subject, and I will support and enable all of those conservationists who had the aptitude that I didn't have,\" Kaplan said.\n\nHe went on to make a fortune in the energy and precious metal industries. True to his word, he cofounded Panthera in 2006 with leading cat conservationist the late Alan Rabinowitz, and the pair built the organization into a world leader in the field.\n\n\"I'm very mission-driven, and I will do anything to move the needle on those things that move me,\" Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan shared three pieces of life advice with Business Insider.\n\nAsked how he kept his three children grounded in an ultrawealthy household, he said they were simply \"not motivated by money.\"\n\n\"No bling, no social media, no cars or watches or any accoutrements of wealth. None,\" he added.\n\nKaplan said he drilled into them the importance of giving back and being thankful, as he believes the \"basis for all happiness is living a life of gratitude.\"\n\nHe's made sure they \"understand if you are an ungrateful person, you will be miserable and deserve to be.\"\n\nKaplan also underscored the need to recognize the limits of your knowledge and resist speculating beyond what you deeply understand. Warren Buffett would describe that as staying within one's \"circle of competence.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid to say, 'I don't know,'\" Kaplan said. \"Credibility is hard won, easily lost.\"\n\nThe NovaGold Resources chairman said that people respect his expertise in certain subjects, and he never wants to \"debase that currency by being flippant.\"\n\n\"Be disciplined enough not to feel that because you're asked something, you have to answer it,\" he said.\n\nKaplan's final piece of advice was \n\n\"If you're going to go down, go down for something that wasn't flippant, but was thought through,\" he said.\n\n\"When you have a relative advantage, push the pedal to the metal,\" Kaplan added. \"If you don't have a relative advantage, don't play.\"",

    "description": "After co-creating Amazon Alexa, William Tunstall-Pedoe became an angel investor. When he started his second business, he drew on the invaluable experience of his mentees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, an angel investor and founder based in the UK. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "title": "Hollywood superagent and investor Michael Ovitz praised Jeffrey Epstein and was invited to his island, files reveal",
    "description": "Michael Ovitz, cofounder of CAA and a tech investor, praised Jeffrey Epstein's \"outstanding multiple talents\" in one email to the disgraced financier.",
    "fullText": "Michael Ovitz, the cofounder of powerhouse Los Angeles talent agency Creative Artists Agency and a prolific tech investor, effusively praised Jeffrey Epstein and made arrangements to meet him at his New York home and off the coast of St. Barts, newly released files reveal.\n\nThe disgraced financier invited Ovitz to his private Caribbean island in 2012 and said he knew Ovitz \"well\" in emails to a Microsoft executive and his publicist, Peggy Siegal. In 2013, Ovitz emailed Epstein, lauding his \"outstanding multiple talents,\" with Epstein emailing Ovitz, \"great to see you smiling again,\" later that year.\n\nA spokesperson for Ovitz denied that he was on anything more than cordial terms with Epstein.\n\n\"Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did not know each other well, no matter what Mr. Epstein said to Peggy Siegal. They had very limited interaction and correspondence,\" a spokesperson for Ovitz told Business Insider. \"When Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did correspond, Mr. Ovitz was cordial.\"\n\nOvitz co-founded CAA in 1975, where he represented stars like Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro, leaving the firm in 1995 for a stint as president of Disney. The superagent later built deep links to Silicon Valley: he has invested in hundreds of startups, and has served as an advisor to the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nOvitz is also a senior advisor to Palantir and has recently invested in AI startups, including the Google-backed AI studio Promise and the image generator Black Forest Labs, where he serves as an advisor.\n\nDocuments released last week by the Justice Department from its investigation into Epstein provide a deeper look at his ties to Ovitz. It's not the first time Ovitz's name comes up in relation to Epstein: in 2023, Ovitz was subpoenaed by the US Virgin Islands as part of its lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase for banking with Epstein. That lawsuit has since been settled.\n\nThe new material shows communication between Ovitz and Epstein in the early and mid-2010s — after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor, but before his 2019 arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges — which ended with his death by suicide in a jail cell.\n\nIn a 2010 email exchange, Ovitz wrote to Epstein, \"hope you are well\" and \"been a while\" after a dinner with Jes Staley, the former Barclays CEO who later came under close scrutiny for his Epstein dealings.\n\n\"Had dinner with Jes last night and your ears should still be burning,\" Ovitz wrote, adding that he and Epstein should get together.\n\nJPMorgan Chase declined to comment to Business Insider for this article.\n\nIn February 2012, Epstein planned to see Ovitz at an undisclosed location, according to a Google Calendar reminder. A few months later, in April, Ovitz emailed Epstein that he would drop by the financier's Manhattan home for a drink, writing, \"would love to see you.\"\n\nIn December 2012, after learning that Ovitz was wintering in St. Barts in the Caribbean, Epstein invited him to his private island, Little Saint James, writing, \"will you be near my island, come visit.\"\n\nOvitz declined, saying his boat was stuck in St. Barts after he dropped a rudder. He told Epstein his boat was located about 500 yards from the yacht Al Mirqab, owned by former Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani — which Epstein said he was visiting at the time — and suggested Epstein could stop by. The potential meetup didn't take place, Ovitz's spokesperson told Business Insider after publication.\n\nIn a January 2013 email, Ovitz wrote to Epstein that he and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, had been \"raving about you and your outstanding multiple talents.\" Sinofsky had been relying on Epstein to negotiate his Microsoft exit at the time.\n\nSinofsky later asked Epstein in an email if he knew Ovitz, whom he had just met at Andreessen Horowitz, and Epstein replied, \"very very well.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Epstein emailed Ovitz again, writing, \"great to see you smiling again.\"\n\nIn 2014, Andrew Farkas, a real estate magnate who co-owned a marina with Epstein in St. Thomas, also asked Epstein for an introduction to Ovitz to discuss naming a new performing arts degree at Harvard University.\n\nEpstein's most recent reference to Ovitz in the files is from 2017, when Epstein emailed his publicist Siegal that he knew Ovitz \"WELL.\"\n\nThe Epstein files are full of recognizable names who had correspondence with him, and some of the content is anodyne. The latest documents have caused headaches for some of the movers and shakers whose names appear on them.\n\nOn Wednesday night, powerhouse lawyer Brad Karp stepped down from the chairmanship of his firm, Paul Weiss, saying his ties to Epstein had become a \"distraction\" for it. Prominent longevity influencer Peter Attia publicly apologized for his crude email exchanges with Epstein and stepped down as chief science officer for a protein bar company.\n\nOvitz's CAA has become one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies. The firm rose to prominence by driving ever-higher actor paydays by demanding larger box-office cuts for stars like Brad Pitt.\n\nCAA served as an inspiration for Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz when they built Andreessen Horowitz, which prides itself on being founder-friendly.\n\n\"An important part of A16z's origin story, which you may already know, is that we were founded by Marc & Ben to be 'CAA for the tech industry,'\" reads the firm's website.\n\nBesides his involvement with A16z, Ovitz also chairs the VC firm Treville Capital Group and announced last year that he was launching his own startup, SoundPatrol, that uses AI to fight copyright infringement in music.",

    "description": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he believes gold is still a safe-haven asset, given its large presence in central bank reserves.",
    "fullText": "For Ray Dalio, gold hasn't lost its shine.\n\nWhile many metal investors are likely still shaken by gold's 12% plunge last Friday, the famed hedge fund founder said he wasn't fazed by gold's big drop. That's because bullion is still a safe-haven asset, Dalio said, making the case for why gold should still be a part of investors' portfolios at the World Governments Summit on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking at the conference in Dubai, the Bridgewater founder noted that gold was still held in large amounts by the world's central banks. Bullion surpassed the euro as the second-largest reserve asset last year.\n\n\"I think if people were to make — those who are running policies and so on — were to say, they would say gold is the safest money in this kind of environment,\" Dalio said.\n\nThe safety of the metal also doesn't \"change by the day,\" Dalio added, referring to the gold's long-standing status as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to fiat money.\n\nWhile gold is still down 7% from its all-time high, its price is up 71% in the last year.\n\n\"I think people make the mistake of thinking, 'Is it going to go up or down, and should I buy it?'\" Dalio said, suggesting that a better question would be how much an investor should allocate to gold as a percentage of their total portfolio.\n\nGold sold off hard alongside other metals last week as investors took in President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed Chair. Investors quickly repriced their outlook for rates and the dollar, prompting a rapid unwind of their metal positions.\n\nPart of gold's allure in the past year has also been fueled by perceived economic risks, such as the fear that debt levels could rise to unsustainable levels or that the US dollar could weaken alongside other fiat currencies.\n\nDalio, who has regularly warned markets of such risks, said he still believes the US is \"on the brink\" of a capital war, a situation where geopolitical tensions make global investors hesitant to lend money to the US by buying its bonds.\n\n\"Gold is a diversifier. In other words, when the bad times come along, it does uniquely well,\" Dalio said. \"I'd say the most important thing is to have a well-diversified portfolio.\"\n\nDalio is known for being a proponent of gold investing. In the past, he's recommended that investors allocate 15% of their portfolios to gold and bitcoin, pointing to concerns about currency debasement.",

    "description": "Longtime fund manager George Noble said the Fed under Kevin Warsh will keep fueling the forces that have boosted gold in the last year.",
    "fullText": "The metal market's tantrum in the aftermath of Donald Trump's nomination of a new Fed chief was wrongheaded, one longtime investor says.\n\nThat's because, according to veteran fund manager George Noble, Kevin Warsh is a dove who will keep adding fuel to the debasement trade, rather than the hawk markets have perceived him to be.\n\nNoble, the former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund and founder of two hedge funds, said in a post on X that Warsh has expressed a desire to lower rates, continuing a trend that's boosted haven assets like gold and silver over the last year.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty and waning investor confidence in risk assets spurred gold and silver to historic highs in 2025. Warsh's nomination spurred a reassessment of the debasement trade, but Noble doesn't see any reversal coming, pointing to a recent Fox News interview in which Warsh hinted at his dovish stance.\n\n\"The 'hawk' wants to slash rates by 200 basis points into a 'booming' economy,\" Noble wrote. \"That's not hawkish. That's pouring gasoline on a bonfire.\"\n\nIn Noble's view, the narrative that kicked off the precious metals plunge—that higher rates will boost the dollar and hurt the appeal of gold—collapses when you examine Warsh's history and statements from a macro perspective.\n\n\"The debasement trade isn't about who chairs the Fed, \"Noble said. \"It's about math. And if Warsh actually executes the plan he outlined on Fox News - slashing rates to 2% - gold at $4,500 is going to look like the bargain of the century.\"\n\nNoble doesn't think investors should rush to buy the dip in gold right now, given the extreme volatility. He speculated that gold and silver could still have further to fall and that investors should tread carefully.\n\n\"Let the market tell you where the bottom is. Then buy,\" he said.\n\"And when you do - favor the equities over the metals. The miners have lagged badly and offer better risk/reward from here.\"",

    "fullText": "Close to two years after losing a proxy fight to longtime Disney boss Bob Iger, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is still a skeptic.\n\nActivist investor and Trian Partners founder Nelson Peltz said at a Florida event on Tuesday that Disney picked Josh D'Amaro as its new CEO because \"Iger needs a reason to stay on.\"\n\nPeltz said to expect an announcement from Iger saying, \"Josh doesn't know anything about the movie business, the entertainment business; therefore, I'm going to stay on and guide him.\"\n\n\"Poor Josh,\" Peltz said, with a laugh.\n\nD'Amaro's appointment as CEO was approved by Disney's board in a unanimous vote led by former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who managed his own succession at the bank.\n\nD'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace,\" Gorman said in a statement, and the division he leads was more than 70% of the company's operating income last quarter. Iger, meanwhile, called D'Amaro the \"right person to become our next CEO.\"\n\nIger will remain at the company in a senior advisor role until the end of the year. This is Iger's second retirement from Disney. He previously tapped Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger returned from retirement in 2022 after Chapek's bumpy, tumultuous tenure.\n\nPeltz waged a proxy battle with Disney to gain board seats in early 2024, while criticizing its streaming division's losses, unstable stock, and uncertain succession plans. He sold his Disney shares after shareholders voted to support Iger.\n\nPeltz said D'Amaro has his work cut out for him when he takes over on March 18.\n\n\"I hope he's given the opportunity to do it,\" Peltz said.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett isn't known for overcomplicating things—and when it comes to investing, he doesn't think you should either. At the 2008 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett was asked, \"If you were 30 years old again and had your first million in the bank, how would you invest it assuming you're not a full-time investor, you have another full-time job, you can cover your expenses with other savings for about 18 months, and you have no dependents.\" \"I'll be very simple,\" he repli",

Buffett wasn't advising someone to watch the markets or make investing a second job. He was saying to get on with life. Keep earning. Let compound interest take the wheel. With steady income and decades ahead, the real advantage isn't perfect timing—it's not touching the money at all. When the plan is simple and automatic, the hardest part is knowing when to leave it alone.\n\nBuffett has long maintained that most investors shouldn't try to beat the market. It's not about intelligence—it's about realism. He doesn't just invest in companies—he buys entire businesses, with full access to management, operations, and long-term strategy. That's not something the average investor can replicate.\n\nInstead, he recommends simplicity and discipline. A low-cost index fund—like one that tracks the S&P 500—spreads your money across hundreds of large U.S. companies. There's no guesswork involved. You're not betting on the next Apple or Amazon. You're owning a slice of the entire market and letting it grow over time.\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nAt Berkshire's 2020 shareholders meeting, Buffett doubled down on the same principle. \"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" he said. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it.\"",

    "description": "Two Business Insider reporters attended Starbucks' Investor Day and got a firsthand look at how the brand plans to build momentum with its turnaround.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks' new \"Ristretto\" concept, as the company called it — named after the short-pulled espresso shot — aims to reduce average build costs by about 20% while optimizing overall footprint, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said.\n\nThe walk-thru mockup featured cushy furniture, digital menus, merch displays, and a callback to Starbucks' 1971 founding above the door.\n\nSmith forecast 600 to 650 new stores opening globally in the current fiscal year, rising to over 2,000 in fiscal year 2028. Roughly 400 of the new US coffeehouses coming by 2028 are expected to be company-owned.\n\nWalking through the coffeehouse setup, with Simple Plan's \"I'm Just a Kid\" playing on the speakers, it was hard not to think back to our teenage years when Starbucks was the hangout spot, which perhaps was the point.\n\nExecs stressed Starbucks' desire to become a \"third place.\"\n\n\"We have a unique opportunity to connect people over coffee during a time when loneliness is pervasive,\" Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said.\n\nThe furniture, including the \"Starbucks lounge icon,\" as the display next to the chair pictured above read, was designed to get people to sit and hang out for a while.\n\nNiccol said the company plans to add 25,000 additional seats to its US company-operated stores by the end of its fiscal year and replace thousands more with \"more comfortable options.\"\n\n\"Customers are already responding with longer dwell times and, frankly, improved customer satisfaction and connections,\" he added.\n\nStarbucks plans to introduce digital menu boards in all of its US company-operated stores over the next 18 months, separating its morning and afternoon menus to better target customer preferences.\n\n\"The morning is very much a ritual,\" Niccol said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. \"The afternoon is really a reset — and depending on where you are in that reset, you sometimes want a blended drink, you sometimes want an energy drink, you sometimes want a sparkling drink, and you sometimes want protein.\"\n\nStarbucks plans to expand its wellness offerings to meet that demand.\n\nStarbucks offered samples of global flavors like an ube macchiatto, a reformulated Chai latte with mango cold foam, and a strawberry açaí refresher, available three ways: decaffeinated, caffeinated, or with an energy boost.\n\nWe also sampled some bakery items, including a croissant-like uzu citrus blossom with a tasty uzu filling.\n\nStarbucks is rolling out new front and back-end technologies to make baristas' jobs easier — and help you get your order faster.\n\nThe company's mobile app has gotten a facelift, and a new loyalty program is rolling out in March. Its new point-of-sale system, also coming this year, aims to reduce staff training time and the time it takes to place an order.\n\nThe Mastrena III espresso machine, rolling out in 2027, halves the time it takes to brew espresso while maintaining the quality, Starbucks says.\n\nStarbucks also showed off Green Dot Assist, an AI-powered assistant that gives baristas recipes and other information about an order on a tablet to speed up production.\n\nThe Q&A session lasted nearly an hour, during which analysts pressed the executives for more specifics on their plan.\n\nDespite the optimism onstage, investors pressed executives on the company's long-term plan. Shares slid about 1% during the presentations, after a brief pop earlier in the week before earnings.\n\nThe execs responded to several questions about Starbucks' operating margins and its recent deal with Boyu Capital to sell off 60% of its China business. Investors also wanted more details on how Starbucks will navigate ongoing supply chain snarls and encourage employees to have an \"ownership mentality\" to grow with the brand.\n\nAbout five hours after it began, Rodriguez left investor day buzzing with caffeine and headed back to Business Insider's New York headquarters.\n\nOn the West Coast, Business Insider's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert — equally caffeinated after a 3 a.m. wake-up — was already on the phone with analysts. Their verdict: Starbucks has gone on offense, laying out growth plans that are credible, if not exactly blockbuster.\n\nTogether, the two reporters walked away with a sharper view of where Starbucks' strategy is headed next.\n\nThe company hopes it can reignite momentum by making its cafés more inviting and pushing harder on menu innovation. There's still work to do — but Starbucks believes its comeback is no longer theoretical.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Starbucks?

    "title": "'Shoulder to shoulder with Michael Burry': A day trader details his bearish thesis on one of the Reddit crowd's favorite stocks",
    "description": "Palantir is a darling of the Reddit day-trader crowd. One everyday investor unpacks why he isn't buying the hype.",
    "fullText": "It's well known that retail traders love the meme culture of Wall Street Bets, but Reddit has become a fertile ground for genuine stock-market debate in the years since Roaring Kitty sparked the great GameStop short-squeeze.\n\nEvery so often, a well-argued thesis on a particular stock stands out. Of course, there's Keith Gill's famous posts unpacking why GameStop would soar. More recently, in October, a post from a retail trader disclosing a massive bet on struggling Beyond Meat blew up and quickly led to a major short squeeze.\n\nThis week, in a forum dedicated to \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry, one user posted their reasoning for betting against one of retail's favorite stocks: Palantir Technologies.\n\nPalantir stock is down 17% year to date, though it is still up 83% in the last year. Laurence Bradingmunn (u/Gerbil12345) thinks there's no reason shares should be as high as they are.\n\nBradingmunn spoke to Business Insider about his bearish take on Palantir, noting that Burry's short position inspired him to bet against the stock. Like Burry, he sees the company as highly overvalued but also has concerns about the broader AI space.\n\n\"I'm going shoulder to shoulder with Michael Burry on his thesis that the AI bubble is about to burst—specifically focusing on Palantir's extreme overvaluation and how the AI bubble (Government) has managed to shoot their stock to the moon,\" Bradingmunn wrote.\n\nThe 20-year-old Bradingmunn doesn't work in finance, but he told Business Insider that he's been following Burry for years. And while he isn't technically shorting Palantir but buying put options against it with strike prices in 2027 and 2028, similar to Burry, he maintains that the stock is pointed down.\n\nBradingmunn provided further context on the stock, laying out why he finds Palantir's $350 billion market cap concerning. He compared it to several other prominent tech stocks that he thinks Wall Street is valuing much more realistically.\n\n\"If you compare it to the companies with similar market caps, like AMD, Salesforce, Adobe, and you look at their actual profits, it's a stark contrast,\" he said. \"I don't believe [Palantir] can grow quick enough to meet the current valuation.\"\n\nThe retail trader said that he found it unusually difficult to learn what Palantir actually does to make money, another factor that's fed his bearish thesis. However, he added that he's equally concerned by Palantir's status as a stock highly dedicated cult following.\n\nPalantir stock is a well known favorite among retail investors, who have shown a deep admiration for CEO Alex Karp. Yet Bradingmunn speculated that many retail traders aren't taking time to assess the company's fundamentals.\n\n\"It can be very easy to follow someone's Reddit post talking about how great a stock is, and just fall for that,\" he acknowledged. \"I'm trying to take a more constructive thesis and to try and look at the actual numbers of all these stocks and see how I can have a different side of the story.\"\n\nBradingmunn acknowledges that the company may benefit from lucrative defense contracts with the US government, but he also sees significant risk from the company's share dilution. As of late 2025, it had roughly 2.38 billion shares outstanding, a major spike from the 1 billion when it first listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nBradingmunn thinks investors should be concerned by this. \"I believe it should be worth about $50 per share.\" The stock closed on Friday at $146.59.",

    "fullText": "Every time the crypto market enters a dramatic phase, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is one of the first investors I turn to in order to understand the changing dynamics on the charts.\n\nWood is a veteran investor in the digital assets market. In fact, she claimed that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to gain Bitcoin (BTC) exposure in 2015.\n\nBitcoin hadn't reached even the $500 price mark in 2015, but it was a significant uptick since its launch in 2009. But Wood's pro-crypto move was met with sharp criticism.\n\nHowever, the confidence seems to have paid off over the years as Bitcoin kept hitting new highs. ARK Invest estimates the cryptocurrency's price will hit $1 million in 2030.\n\nWood also keeps buying shares of crypto companies such as:\n\nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.\n\nRobinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), an e-trading platform with crypto and tokenized stock offerings\n\nBlock (NYSE: SQ), Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin technology company\n\nBitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum (ETH) treasury company\n\nBullish (NYSE: BLSH), the crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel\n\nGiven Wood's deep expertise in crypto investments, it is worth understanding her perspective in the wake of Bitcoin's crash below $80,000 on Jan. 31.\n\nLorenzo Valente, ARK Invest's Director of Research, Digital Assets, recently shared an analysis in which he compared gold's market cap as a percentage of the U.S. M2 money supply.\n\nM2 is a broad measure of the U.S. money supply (cash, checking, savings, money market funds).\n\nAs per the analysis, gold's market cap is 170% of the entire U.S. money supply right now.\n\nThe figure is an all-time high (ATH); in fact, it is as high as it was in 1934 during the Great Depression and only slightly above the figure in 1980 when inflation peaked, the chart showed.\n\nIn simple words, gold is as expensive as it can be. Such peaks usually happen during periods of economic stress and dollar regime shift and often mark turning points, Valente said. For instance, gold crashed 60% after 1980.\n\nEven right now, it feels like a \"pivot moment\" and while nobody knows what happens next, those who know can make huge gains, he added.\n\nWhen ARK Invest shared its 2026 outlook on Jan. 15, the asset manager noted that the correlation between the Bitcoin and gold prices has been very low at 0.14 since early 2020.\n\nThis is exactly what Wood reiterated in response to Valente's X post. In simple terms, Bitcoin and gold usually don't move together on a daily or monthly basis.",

    "fullText": "Redwood Materials has landed Google as a new investor, capping an upsized funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage company at more than $6 billion.\n\nThe development underscores rising Big Tech interest in power infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nThe Nevada-based startup said Wednesday it completed the final close of its Series E financing, bringing the total raised to $425 million.\n\nThe round was increased from a previously announced $350 million amid strong investor demand. Google joined the final closing of the round alongside existing backers, including Capricorn and Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoogle's participation adds another tech giant to Redwood's cap table, following Nvidia's investment earlier in the round through its venture arm NVentures.\n\nThe growing interest reflects a bet that Redwood's energy storage business — which repurposes used electric-vehicle batteries to store power — could become critical infrastructure as electricity demand surges from AI, data centers, and broader electrification.\n\nFounded by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials originally built its business on recycling lithium-ion batteries and recovering key metals, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. More recently, it has expanded into grid-scale energy storage through a new unit called Redwood Energy, which uses second-life EV batteries to stabilize power supply and support energy-hungry data centers.\n\nThe company has argued that energy storage is no longer optional but essential as AI workloads strain existing grids. Redwood says the new capital will help it scale its energy storage platform while continuing to invest in recycling and critical minerals processing in the US.\n\nWith Google now on board, Redwood is positioning itself at the intersection of AI infrastructure, energy security, and domestic supply chains — a combination investors increasingly see as strategic as the power demands of the AI economy accelerate.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio warned the U.S. stands “on the brink” of transitioning from Stage 5 pre-breakdown to Stage 6 systemic collapse as Bitcoin is trading defensively at $88,000, trapped in a 60-day range by record institutional selling pressure from American counterparties.\n\nThe billionaire investor’s latest analysis of the “Big Cycle” coincides with Bitcoin’s failure to live up to its “digital gold” narrative, while traditional safe havens surge to all-time highs.\n\nDalio’s framework identifies bankrupt government finances and wealth gaps as the “single most reliable leading indicator of civil war or revolution,” conditions he argues now characterize American reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Wintermute’s desk reports that Bitcoin remains stuck between $85,000 and $94,000 as U.S. spot ETF products hemorrhage capital and the Coinbase premium trades at a persistent discount, indicating that domestic institutions are driving bearish momentum.\n\nDalio’s long essay positions current American conditions within Stage 5 of his Big Cycle framework, where “bad financial conditions and intense conflict” precede systemic breakdown.\n\n“We are now clearly on the brink of crossing from Stage 5 (pre-breakdown) to Stage 6 (breakdown),” he wrote, pointing to unsustainable debt loads that force governments to either “print a lot of money, which depreciates its value” or implement painful austerity.\n\nThe analysis comes as Bitcoin trades range-bound for 60 consecutive days, an unusual pattern for an asset class often marketed as protection against exactly the monetary debasement Dalio describes.\n\nGold climbed above $5,066 per ounce on Tuesday while silver surged 6.4% to $110.60, both setting fresh records as investors sought traditional inflation hedges.\n\nDalio warned that “later stages may involve capital controls, reserve freezes, and cross-border restrictions, turning funds into political tools,” conditions that typically favor “freely transferable assets” and investments “prioritizing resistance to freezing and blockades.“\n\nBitcoin proponents have long argued that crypto fits this profile, yet the asset has failed to attract safe-haven flows amid elevated macro uncertainty.\n\nWintermute’s OTC desk identified American selling pressure as the primary force keeping Bitcoin suppressed within its trading range.",

Charlie Munger's didn't A few years before his death in late 2023, the Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman offered a brutally clear-eyed perspective on love, life, and investing—and managed to tie all three together in under 30 seconds.\n\nAt the 2017 Daily Journal shareholder meeting, Munger was asked about how Berkshire's investment strategy had shifted over the years. His answer, as usual, cut through the noise. \"We used to shoot fish in a barrel,\" he said. \"But it was so easy, we didn't want to shoot fish while they were moving, so we waited until they slowed down and then we shot them with a shotgun.\"\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nBut the good old days were long gone. Investing had changed. The edges were smaller. The bets were trickier. \"We're adapting reasonably to a business that's gotten much more difficult,\" Munger said. \"I don't think we have a cinch. I think we have the odds a little bit in our favor. We have to live on the advantages we can get.\"\n\nThen came the kicker: \"I used to say you have to marry the best person who will have you. I'm afraid that's a rule of life. You have to get by in life on the best advantage you can get.\"\n\nThat wasn't some offhand dating tip. It was Munger's entire worldview. Take what's available, what's real, what will actually have you—and make the most of it. Whether it's stocks, software, or spouses, perfection is a fantasy. Leverage is real.\n\nTrending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started.\n\nWarren Buffett, his longtime business partner and closest friend, has echoed similar themes in his own way. In the 2017 HBO documentary, \"Becoming Warren Buffett,\" he said his late wife Susie was one of the two defining moments of his life. \"What happened with me would not have happened without her,\" he said. \"She believed in me. She put me together. I would not only have turned out to be the person I turned out to be, but I would not have been as successful in business without that.\"\n\nThat same year, in a conversation with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Buffett reiterated the importance of choosing the right partner. \"You want to associate with people who are the kind of person you'd like to be,\" he said. \"And the most important person by far in that respect is your spouse.\"",

    "description": "\"The Big Short\" investor wrote on his Substack on Monday that he's been buying the OG meme stock, causing shares to jump during the session.",
    "fullText": "Michel Burry says he's betting on the market's most famous meme stock.\n\nThe investor, best known for his role in Michael Lewis's financial crisis saga \"The Big Short,\" said on Monday that he's been buying shares of GameStop, one of the original and most famous meme stocks.\n\nBurry announced his position in a post on his Substack, Cassandra Unchained, on Monday. It sent shares of the video game retailer up as much as 6%.\n\nRather than betting on a new bout of meme-stock mania to send the stock higher, Burry said his investment is a long-term play. This isn't Burry's first time dabbling in the OG meme stock. In an earlier Substack post, he discussed his decision to offload his position in the company weeks before the short squeeze of 2021. In his follow-up on Monday, Burry revealed he owns GameStop again and has been buying shares recently and that he sees significant growth potential with Ryan Cohen as CEO.\n\n\"I expect I am buying at what may soon be 1x tangible book value / 1x net asset value,\" he said. \"And getting a young Ryan Cohen investing and deploying the company's capital and cash flows. Perhaps for the next 50 years.\"\n\nThat may sound like a long window for growth, particularly given GameStop's history as a meme stock that's often driven more by hype than fundamentals. Burry acknowledged that his bet may come across as unorthodox but backed it up with more analysis in his post.\n\n\"That is not a common occurrence in the U.S. stock market today,\" he wrote. \"With the downside protected by its tangible asset value, being long GameStop is almost as asymmetric as it gets these days in U.S. common stocks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burry said he sees solid potential for a turnaround under Cohen. The CEO and founder of online pet supply company Chewy is a popular figure among retail traders.\n\n\"I am not counting on a short squeeze to realize long-term value,\" Burry said.\n\n\"I believe in Ryan. I like the setup, the governance, the strategy as I see it. I am willing to hold long-term, and I am excited to see where this goes. I am fifteen years his senior, but not too old to be patient.\"\n\nBurry's bullishness spurred a jump in GameStop on Monday, though it didn't spill over to other meme stocks. Data from retail trading activity platform ApeWisdom shows that retail traders have been highly focused on GameStop since Burry announced his position, but other favorites like AMC and Koss haven't entered the spotlight.",

CoreWeave is targeting to build more than 5 gigawatts in AI data center ‍capacity by 2030.\n\nNvidia will invest in CoreWeave at a purchase price of $87.20 per share, the companies said. That represents an addition of roughly 23 million shares, nearly doubling ​Nvidia's stake in the firm, according to Reuters calculations based on data ‌compiled by LSEG.\n\nNvidia was CoreWeave's third largest shareholder with a 6.3% stake, or 24.3 million shares, in the company.\n\nThe chip giant has drawn scrutiny for pouring billions of dollars into AI firms including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and neoclouds, raising investor concerns about potential circular financing.\n\nA CoreWeave spokesperson told Reuters that the ⁠cash from the new investment will not ​be used to purchase Nvidia processors, but directed ​toward accelerating other data center investments, research and development, and scaling its workforce.\n\nOnce a cryptocurrency miner, CoreWeave has pivoted to capitalize ‍on the AI ⁠boom by repurposing its infrastructure to lease Nvidia GPUs to tech and AI firms.\n\n\"Nvidia is the leading and most requested computing platform at every ⁠phase of AI ...

    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "description": "Real estate investor Grant Cardone said that talks with administration insiders hint at a few things Trump could do next to boost the market.",
    "fullText": "Grant Cardone thinks the Trump administration is gearing up to do more to stimulate the US housing market.\n\nThe longtime real estate investor says he's bullish on housing as the market enters a new year, even as home prices remain high and mortgage rates are elevated.\n\nCardone told Business Insider that he recently spoke with administration insiders about what he thinks can still be done to open up the market to more Americans.\n\nPresident Trump has made affordability a primary focus in 2026 ahead of the midterm elections. In his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, he discussed high housing costs as well as interest rates, stating that the goal of homeownership is out of reach for many Americans.\n\nTrump so far has focused on mortgage rates and housing availability, pitching plans to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac load up on mortgage bonds while also banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\nNext, Cardone thinks Trump could address issues in the tax code to make the market easier to navigate.\n\nHe predicts that the White House will adjust capital gains taxes for home sales to make it less prohibitive to sell a property that has appreciated in value.\n\nCurrently, homeowners can exclude $500,000 in capital gains for married filers or $250,000 for single filers when they sell their home. Cardone expects the caps to be raised, which would make the tax bill much less burdensome and potentially bring more homes to market.\n\nOther commentators have flagged this as a simple fix to the market that can be done with relative ease. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, said last year that the caps should be raised to $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe other potential change Trump could make would allow more people to invest in real estate.\n\n\"I think he's going to come out and say, 'hey, I want to extend that bonus depreciation that was approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA),\" Cardone said. \"He's going to extend it to single-family homes.\"\n\n\"Bonus depreciation\" is a mechanism that allows investors to deduct the cost of a property from their taxes. The landmark tax and spending bill signed into law last year allows investors to deduct 100% of qualifying investment properties immediately.\n\n\"When I buy these big assets, I get to write them off basically in year one,\" Cardone explained. \"And when you buy a single-family home, you write it off over 27 years, you get a tax loss spread over that period.\"\n\nCardone thinks this would be significant, as it has never been done in the US and could stimulate more housing market activity by extending buying power to those seeking income-producing properties.\n\nWhile Cardone said his predictions have been informed by talks with administration insiders, a spokesperson denied that any specific policy moves were under discussion.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to put an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Administration is constantly exploring new policy actions to do just that, \"White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Business Insider. \"Until policy announcements are officially made by the Administration, however, any reporting about potential action is pure speculation.\"",

    "description": "TikTok has closed a joint-venture deal for its US business, handing over some operational control to an investor group.",
    "fullText": "TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group.\n\n\"The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,\" the company said.\n\nAdam Presser is leading the new venture, according to the company's announcement. Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.\n\nTikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.\n\nWhile Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.\n\nThe company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.\n\nFollowing the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok.\"\n\nHe said the deal had reached a \"very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.\"\n\nThe deal has been in the works for a year. At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.\n\nSince then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.",

    "description": "Hedge fund founder George Noble says OpenAI is a warning for the wider AI boom. He says the \"low hanging fruit is gone\" as AI costs increase.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI has laid out some ambitious plans for 2026, but according to George Noble, the ChatGPT maker is a cautionary tale for the wider AI theme.\n\nThe hedge fund investor and former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund doesn't think the AI startup will be able to justify its lofty growth projections, but more than that, he thinks investors should avoid the AI trade and shift their focus to other areas of the market before the tide turns.\n\nThe hedge fund founder laid out his thesis on OpenAI's red flags in a detailed X post on Tuesday, highlighting the \"code red\" moment announced by CEO Sam Altman in December 2025.\n\nIn his view, it all comes down to financials, specifically a math problem that isn't being widely discussed. \n\n\"It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better,\" he said. \"The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.\"\n\nNoble thinks OpenAI's annual revenue has to reach $200 billion by 2030 in order for the company's projections to be justified.\n\nPointing to the broader market, he advised AI startup founders to exit their companies while the boom is still going, adding that he believes the AI hype cycle is nearing its peak. He thinks investors should shift their focus to other parts of the market, as both the AI trade and the Magnificent Seven will be impacted if OpenAI begins to struggle.\n\n\"If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming,\" he advised. \"The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.\"\n\nThe particular sector in this case is small-mid cap stocks, which is where Noble sees real value and growth potential. He added that there is a value disconnect between Big Tech stocks and their small-cap peers, which are trading at near-decade lows.\n\nFor that reason, Noble sees an opportunity for investors to move away from the most crowded stocks that carried the AI trade in 2025 and focus on the lesser-known value plays that have been quietly making progress while AI-linked names continue to dominate the headlines.\n\n\"Markets can price risk,\" he noted. \"But they can't price chaos.\nAnd OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.\"",

    "fullText": "Jeremy Grantham says AI is one of the biggest bubbles in history — and it's likely to tank the stock market when it bursts.\n\n\"I think it's obviously a bubble, and I think it's quite a simple story,\" the veteran investor and GMO cofounder said during the latest episode of the \"Merryn Talks Money\" podcast.\n\nGrantham compared AI to the railroad and the internet, two world-changing inventions marked by early investment bubbles which, when they popped, \"brought the economy to its knees for a year or two\" and \"everybody lost their money.\"\n\nContrary to common belief, \"bubbles don't occur when there's some crummy idea that gets touted,\" Grantham said. \"All the bubbles are associated with serious things, and the more serious, the bigger the bubble.\"\n\nGrantham emphasized the \"iron law\" that when an asset doubles in price, the return from holding it halves from that point forward.\n\n\"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward,\" he said. \"And it will happen this time. And my guess is after a while, sooner or later, the market will become a whole lot cheaper.\"\n\nGrantham, who had predicted an epic market crash four years ago, said the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2023 generated immense buzz around AI and sparked major capital outlays by companies, ultimately staving off an economic slump.\n\nThe market historian said that Big Tech companies have used their dominant market positions and influence to boost their profit margins to \"excessive levels,\" but that won't stop the bubble he sees from bursting.\n\nThe \"probabilities that AI will not bust are slim to none,\" he said. \"It meets every condition of the railroads and the Internet. It's a powerful idea that's attracted everybody's money.\"\n\n\"And so my guess is Nvidia will lead it down, and all the others will follow for a while, and then out of the ashes several of them will once again inherit the world,\" he said.\n\nGrantham also flagged institutional inertia and herd mentality as factors preventing the market from coming to its senses.\n\nPut differently, industry professionals aren't sounding the alarm on valuations out of fear that the bubble will keep growing and they'll underperform their rivals, hurt their reputations, and lose clients or even their jobs.\n\n\"They all look around nervously at each other, but they keep going,\" he said. \"As long as the music's playing, they're going to be dancing. Doesn't matter that they know the market is silly.\"\n\nGrantham is one of several high-profile investors, including Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame, who have warned AI stocks are overvalued and predicted a market downturn is coming.\n\nYet the US stock market has continued to march higher in spite of the skeptics, with the benchmark S&P 500 rising around 80% over the past five years.\n\n\"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed comparisons between the AI boom and dot-com bubble in interviews with Business Insider last fall.\n\nO'Leary said \"you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis,\" while Gerber said today's valuations are warranted as AI companies have enormous growth potential and their profitability is \"just insane.\"",

    "description": "Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio said at Davos that \"capital wars\" could be the result of deficits and trade wars.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio thinks the world could be on the verge of \"capital wars.\"\n\nThe billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder isn't shy about sounding the alarm on economic problems he sees brewing. At this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he says Donald Trump's aggressive policies could spark global financial conflict.\n\nThe president looms large over Davos this year, with his threatening rhetoric related to Greenland, which he says the US must control for security reasons.\n\nWhile Trump's latest comments are in focus, Dalio says they're just another part of a troubling trend that could shift the global financial order. Speaking with CNBC at the event, Dalio said the possibility of capital wars represents a threat with widespread ramifications for markets and the economy.\n\n\"On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio stated. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at US debt and so on.\"\n\nIn his view, trade conflicts such as the one playing out between the US and much of the rest of the world, don't actually resolve global imbalances. They do, however, put strong tensions on capital flows, as countries grapple with who is financing deficits and which nations are willing to hold certain assets. In particular, eroding trust in the US could make global investors less willing to lend to the country by buying Treasurys.\n\n\"We know that both the holders of US dollar-denominated debt…and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other,\" he said. \"If you have other countries who are holding it and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue.\"\n\nIf foreign demand slumps, he says the US may be forced to rely on internal measures to provide the funding it needs. This could lead to higher inflation or currency debasement, two factors that would likely reinforce concerns among foreign investors.\n\nDalio also reiterated his positive view of gold as a reserve asset in the event of capital wars. He said that in normal times, gold should account for between 5% and 15% of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n\"I have been clear for quite a while that I would tilt away from bronze, and I would be tilting toward gold, and have a greater than normal amount of that,\" he said.\n\nIn his 2025 market reflections, though, Dalio said that gold's strong price rally may be a warning for investors and urged caution on what the metal's big rally could mean for the economy in 2026.",

He said the writing of today's AI chatbots is \"really shitty\" and \"not reliable.\"\n\n\"I just can't stand to see what it writes,\" said Affleck, who cowrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for \"Good Will Hunting\" and directed, produced, and starred in Best Picture winner \"Argo.\"\n\nHe predicted that filmmakers would use AI as a tool to save time and money — similar to visual effects — but it probably won't \"write anything meaningful\" or make entire movies.\n\nAffleck said that most AI users are using chatbots as virtual companions, so \"there's no work, there's no productivity, there's no value to it.\"\n\nHe also cast doubt on the social value of people engaging with AI friends who are \"telling you that you're great and listening to everything you say and being sycophantic.\"\n\nBurry has struck a similar tone on AI in recent weeks. He's best known for his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short.\" Christian Bale, Affleck's predecessor as Batman, portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nAfter more than two years of virtual silence, Burry returned to X late last year with a flurry of warnings about a dangerous AI bubble. He also closed his hedge fund to outside cash, shifting his focus to writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nBurry's central thesis is that AI stocks are overvalued. He's said they're overinvesting in microchips and data centers that will quickly become outdated, to power a tech that will become commoditized and won't yield a return for them, paving the way for large writedowns and sharp stock declines in the future.\n\nHe recently posted on X that \"return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off.\"",

    "title": "Legendary investor Rob Arnott outlines the 2-part strategy that's helped his personal stock portfolio double the S&P 500 over 8 months",
    "description": "Rob Arnott's personal investment strategy takes advantage of a flaw in passive indexing  that his firm has also tried to capitalize on with a recent ETF.",
    "fullText": "Rob Arnott is revered in the investing world for his alternative passive index strategies, but when it comes to his own portfolio, the Research Affiliates founder likes to have a little fun playing the role of hedge-fund manager, too.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Arnott detailed a leveraged long-short strategy that has allowed him to double the returns of the S&P 500 over the last eight months. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of his personal brokerage account showing this strategy having produced a 36.67% return since mid-May. The S&P 500 has returned about 14% in that time.\n\nThe strategy comes from the idea behind the ETF Arnott launched in September: the RACWI US ETF (RAUS). The fund takes a fundamental approach to indexing, identifying companies with attractive qualities and valuations, and then weighting them by market capitalization.\n\nIt essentially seeks to correct what Arnott sees as flaws in passive indexes like the S&P 500, which add stocks following periods of outperformance, only to dump them when they've underperformed. RAUS has a 95% overlap with the S&P 500.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on this concept outside the index, Arnott had the idea to take long positions on the stocks that his index includes which the S&P 500 does not, and take short positions on stocks that the S&P 500 includes but his index does not. He then amplified those positions with leverage.\n\n\"One really fun strategy, and I wish this had occurred to me back in '21, is what if we go long our non-overlap holdings, strip out the whole 95% that's overlapped, just go long our 5% non overlap and let's short the S&P's 5% non overlap,\" Arnott said, referencing when Research Affiliates launched its Cap-Weighted Index, on which RAUS is based. \"Why stop there? Why not go 200% long and 200% short? I did that in my personal portfolio.\"\n\nArnott could not share the names of individual stocks in his portfolio for compliance reasons. However, in September, he listed Palantir (PLTR), DoorDash (DASH), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as examples of S&P 500 stocks not in RAUS. Examining a list of RAUS's holdings, a few examples of stocks held in RAUS that are not in the S&P 500 include Xerox (XRX), Zoom Communications (ZM), and Rivian Motors (RIVN).\n\n\"One of my colleagues likes to say, 'Suppose I come to you and I say I've got this great strategy: I'm going to buy stocks when they've just doubled and when they're trading at twice the market multiple, and I'm going to sell stocks when they've just fallen in half and are trading at half the market multiple. Why don't you invest with me?'\" Arnott said. \"Most people would listen to that and say that's stupid, but that's the way index funds trade.\"\n\nIn September, Arnott illustrated this inefficiency in passive index funds with Dillard's Department Store, a repeat constituent of the Russell 1000 index.\n\n\"In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times,\" Arnott said at the time. \"So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading.\"\n\n\"How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%,\" he continued. \"In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000.\"",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame relayed a Warren Buffett story to warn of wasteful tech spending, and took aim at Nvidia and Palantir again.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOwning a home might be the American dream, but Kevin O'Leary thinks too many people are rushing into a nightmare.\n\nIn a Facebook post shared alongside his Fox Business interview in November, the \"Shark Tank\" investor gave blunt advice to young adults debating whether to rent or buy. When asked outright which path to take, O'Leary didn't hesitate: \"Rent.\"\n\nHis reasoning? \"Start by renting until you start a family and keep it small, 1,500 feet or less if you've got the average salary of $70,000 annually,\" he wrote. \"Once you decide to have a child, you gotta expand a little bit, get that second bedroom and also have an office in the house. Then you buy a home.\"\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nIn the accompanying video, he doubled down, warning buyers not to jump into homeownership unless they plan to stay put for at least five years. \"The issue around a home, if you're gonna buy and go through expenses of buying it, paying all the commissions and all the taxes and everything else, you gotta be there for five years,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThat five-year rule is a common benchmark among financial experts. Closing costs, property taxes, realtor commissions, and interest-heavy mortgage payments make it difficult to build any real equity in the first few years. If you sell too soon, you may walk away with little to nothing—sometimes even a loss.\n\nO'Leary hinted at another reason for the wait: stability. \"There's a good chance you'll be there for five years, assuming the marriage lasts,\" he added dryly, suggesting that homeownership should follow—not precede—big life decisions like starting a family.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nFor singles or couples still figuring it out, his advice is clear: rent something manageable, don't overextend, and keep your housing budget in line with your income. At a $70,000 salary, even modest homes can stretch affordability—especially with current mortgage rates hovering around 7%.\n\nInstead of viewing renting as \"throwing money away,\" O'Leary frames it as a strategic placeholder. It buys time, flexibility, and lets young adults figure out where they want to live long term, what kind of space they actually need, and whether buying makes sense in their city.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "description": "“The dreaded mortgage rate ‘lock-in’ effect is fading,” said real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli.",
    "fullText": "During the pandemic-era housing market, homebuyers enjoyed sub-3% rates, ushering in a wave of homebuying among younger generations. But in the following few years, the American Dream came crashing down as mortgage rates and home prices rose, and inflation and wage stagnation set in.\n\nThat meant more homeowners in the U.S. had sub-3% mortgage rates compared with today’s 6%-range rates, creating a lock-in effect in which current homeowners refused to let go of their low mortgage rates and sell their homes only to turn around and face a much higher mortgage rate.\n\nBut now there’s a crack in the lock-in effect: Real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli recently said that as of the end of 2025, there are actually now more homeowners with mortgage rates higher than 6% than borrowers locked into sub-3% rates, ending one of the most generous eras for home financing in modern history.\n\n“Something big just happened in the U.S. Housing Market,” Gerli wrote in a Jan. 3 X post, referring to the change in share of homeowners with sub-3% mortgage rates. That means the “the dreaded Mortgage Rate ‘Lock-In’ Effect is fading.”\n\nDuring the lock-in effect period, millions of existing homeowners with ultra-low rates have been financially disincentivized to move or “trade up,” i.e., buy a more expensive or larger home, which made the number of homes for sale scarce for would-be homebuyers. This led to younger-generation bidding wars for a limited pool of starter homes and kept many locked out of the market. In fact, the average first-time homebuyer age skyrocketed to 40 in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors, and the share of first-time home buyers plummeted to a record low of 21%.\n\n“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research, said in a statement. “The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007—right before the Great Recession.”\n\nBut that all could change, Gerli said, since fewer homeowners have the attractive sub-3% mortgage rate.\n\n“Since more existing owners have a higher rate, that means more have a payment and rate closer to ‘market,’” he explained, “which means there will be more incentive to sell – which is actually good news.” Gerli analyzed Q3 2025 data from Fannie Mae’s mortgage database .\n\nGerli’s analysis shows the share of mortgages with rates of 6% or higher has surged from about 7% in 2022 to roughly 20% by late 2025, overtaking the once‑dominant pool of pandemic‑era borrowers with sub-3 % rates. Those pandemic-era loans peaked at nearly 25% of all outstanding loans in 2021, the analysis shows, but that share has been steadily shrinking as new buyers take out higher‑cost loans and older-generation buyers move or refinance.​",

    "description": "Michael Burry, the investor from \"The Big Short,\" said return on invested capital is the \"measure to beat all measures\" when looking at AI companies.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

Follow MrBeast's playbook and embrace your peers instead of seeing them purely as rivals, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley said.\n\nGurley, who is best known for his early investments in Uber, Zillow, and Grubhub, told \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" that success in any field requires being knowledgeable about it and going to its physical epicenter, such as a city where the action happens.\n\nHowever, he added in the episode, published in December, that virtual relationships with peers and mentors can also be valuable, and gave the example of MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, the most-followed YouTuber with 459 million subscribers.\n\n\"I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers, because they think they're climbing the ladder and they've got to beat these people, and the world's just way too prosperous to have that mindset,\" he said, adding: \"You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that.\"\n\nGurley said that Donaldson was \"infatuated\" with YouTube early on and would have long Skype meetings with others who shared his passion, exchanging best practices for social media success. Gurley said he first heard Donaldson share the story on a podcast, but had also spoken to him about it.\n\nGurley said Donaldson's story exemplified the importance of embracing peers, which is one of the six principles mentioned in his upcoming book on success, \"Runnin' Down a Dream.\"\n\nDonaldson shared the story on a 2022 episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" where he said that after graduating from high school, he'd talk daily on Skype with a group of four small YouTubers, sometimes from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m.\n\n\"We basically talked every day for a thousand days in a row, and did nothing but hyperstudy what makes a good video, what makes a good thumbnail, what's good pacing, how to go viral,\" he said.",

Vice-chair Greg Abel took over the top job as of Jan. 1, 2026 while Buffett will remain as chairman.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

One of his most famous rules is to buy and hold for as long as possible.\n\n“You’ve got to be prepared when you buy a stock to have it go down 50% or more, and be comfortable with it … but some people are not really careful,” Buffett said during Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 annual shareholder meeting (3).\n\n“Some people are more subject to fear than others.”\n\nHere’s how to fight the fear and build a better future.\n\nMarket volatility isn’t exactly a foreign concept for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett began investing when he was 11, back in 1942. Having lived through several recessions, Buffett has, time and again, shrugged off short-term market volatility.\n\n“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good,” Buffett wrote in an Op-Ed for the NY Times in 2008 (4).\n\n“In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president.

It's common practice in the industry to turn to proxy advisory firms for data collection, advice, and voting recommendations.\n\nThe practice has come under fire from the Trump administration, which signed an executive order in December calling for increased oversight of the proxy advisor industry.\n\n\"Proxy advisors regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,\" the executive order said.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, were two proxy advisory firms previously used by JPMorgan and named in the Trump administration's December executive order.\n\nA spokesperson for ISS declined to comment on the news of JP Morgan cutting ties with proxy advisory firms.

    "description": "Shareholders voted down a takeover bid for Core Scientific late last year because it wasn't rich enough. Here's why they think the bet will pay off.",
    "fullText": "The investment manager who helped scuttle one of the biggest data center acquisitions of 2025 believes that his bet against the multibillion-dollar buyout is about to pay off in the new year.\n\nTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of the Memphis-based investment firm Gullane Capital Partners, believes that Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, is on the cusp of large new customer deals that will boost its value.\n\n\"I think over the next 90 days, you'll see them announce greater than a hundred megawatts of deals,\" Miller said. \"It would show that there was a lot more value to be tapped there than we were getting paid for under the CoreWeave deal.\"\n\nIn October, Miller, a major shareholder in Core Scientific, opposed an offer by the artificial intelligence cloud firm CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that he felt undervalued the company. The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal's weakened economics.\n\nMiller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company's management. He projected that the company will find takers for a total of roughly 400 megawatts this year, citing strong demand for AI computing power.\n\nAsked about the potential for upcoming leasing, a spokeswoman for Core Scientific said the company \"does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\n\nThe commitments, if they materialize, would show that data center developers with a runway for growth are increasingly valuable in an energy-constrained building boom.\n\nCore Scientific has disclosed that it has about 1 gigawatt of data center capacity and another 1.5 gigawatts of power for expansion, according to an October investor presentation.\n\nIt would also offer a competing view that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, computer chips, and power infrastructure are in support of a durable AI boom, not a bubble.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we're likely to be systematically short compute —where the demand for compute will outstrip the supply,\" Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley's global head of thematic research and sustainability research, said.\n\nIn a report published in December, Morgan Stanley suggested that one of the most significant hurdles for the AI industry will be the gargantuan loads of power required to drive its computing.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that data centers, the vast facilities that handle the training for large language AI models and the inference computations that put them to work in everyday applications, face a 47 gigawatt shortfall of electricity from the grid nationally by 2028 — a gap almost 10 times the size of New York City's energy footprint on an average day.\n\nAmong the chief beneficiaries are crypto mining firms that have access to in-place power and utility contracts to light up new facilities quickly.\n\nBoth Core Scientific and CoreWeave were former crypto mining companies before repurposing their businesses to focus on AI in recent years.\n\nAmid the mounting shortage of power — along with headwinds in the crypto mining business — more of the industry is turning to data center computing.\n\nByrd said Morgan Stanley anticipates that about 12 gigawatts of mining facilities, about 60% the mining industry's current gigawattage, will convert over to AI and high-performance computing in the next three years.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining announced it would build a data center in Colorado City, Texas, with 168 megawatts of computing capacity that will be leased to the AI cloud company, Fluidstack. Cipher's stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.\n\nIren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.\n\n\"Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,\" Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.\n\nIn July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave's shares declined and Core Scientific's rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave's offer.\n\nSince the deal's collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share — less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.\n\nGolding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company's stock in October, more than double its current market price — upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is \"based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,\" Golding said.\n\nCoreWeave is Core Scientific's only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.\n\nMiller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.\n\n\"I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,\" Miller said.",

    "title": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio says gold's rapid rally is a warning for markets and the economy",
    "description": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgwater Associates, says the blistering rally in gold last year is a reflection of precarious macro developments.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio spent 2025 expressing fear and urging caution, and he's remaining cautious as the US economy enters a new year.\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates sounded alarms throughout 2025 over what he sees as a budding global debt crisis and the waning value of fiat currency.\n\nThe surge in gold last year—the biggest gain for the metal since 1979—contains a warning for investors, specifically as it relates to the depreciating value of fiat money, Dalio said in a post on Monday.\n\nA potent cocktail of central bank buying, geopolitical worries, and appetite from individuals pushed gold to records all year, but Dalio argues that the gold rally is mainly a result of fiat money losing real value. In his view, that was the biggest story in markets in 2025.\n\n\"The best major investment of the year was long gold (returning 65% in dollar terms), which outperformed the S&P index (which returned 18% in dollars) by 47%,\" he said. \"Or, said differently, the S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms.\"\n\nDalio urged investors to consider a few key factors when evaluating the forces that drove markets in 2025. Specifically, he highlighted that examining investment through calculations made in a depreciating currency can be misleading, as it can make returns appear stronger than they actually were.\n\nFrom Dalio's perspective, the stock market's 2025 performance varied greatly based on the measuring stick.\n\n\"When one's own currency goes down, it makes it look like the things measured in it went up,\" he said. \"In this case, the S&P returned 18% for a dollar-based investor, 17% for a yen-based investor, 13% for a renminbi-based investor, only 4% for a euro-based investor, only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor, and, for a gold-based investor, it returned -28%.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the economic benefits of a weakening US dollar, attempting to frame it as beneficial for US exports. But economic think tanks such as the Cato Institute have argued against this perspective, claiming that it ignores negative spillover effects for US consumers.\n\nDalio seems to share that mindset, noting that a weaker currency tends to lower the cost of a nation's exported goods for international buyers while increasing the price of domestic imports.\n\n\"When one's currency goes down, it reduces one's wealth and one's buying power, it makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies, and it makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency.\"\n\nIn his view, rising gold prices reflect a weakening economy and a national currency that is decreasing in value. For that reason, Dalio sees the continued strength of the so-called debasement trade as a warning for the US.\n\nThe stock market's big bull run in recent years might also be making it easier for investors to disregard other warning signals flashing in the economy. Dalio emphasized that the gold rally is a reason to reassess the macro picture and take a more cautious position.\n\nThe billionaire investor added that stocks and gold benefited from monetary policy easing in 2025, but as both assets are no longer cheap, they're at risk of a pullback if conditions shift again.\n\n\"Whether or not you are currency hedged matters a lot,\" Dalio said. \"You should always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if you think you are capable of making them well.\"",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says the US raid on Venezuela is a much bigger deal than the markets' muted reaction suggests.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, published a post early Monday saying the \"game just changed\" in the mid to long term, and \"markets are not pricing in all that may come of this weekend's events.\"\n\n\"This is a paradigm shift despite the markets yawning,\" he later wrote on X.\n\nBenchmark oil prices climbed less than 1% on Monday, and US stock futures opened higher, after the US captured President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and President Trump said America would \"run\" the oil-rich country for the time being.\n\nThe seizure was a \"shot across China's bow,\" Burry wrote, pointing to billions of dollars in loans that China has made to Venezuela under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which were collateralized using future oil output that is \"now in US hands.\"\n\nThe investor, who shot to fame after his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" wrote that China may now have a \"blueprint\" for how to take control of Taiwan, but \"must be in awe of Trumpian America's infuriating gall and decisive power.\"\n\nBurry said that China stocks strike him as \"somewhat riskier\" now in terms of running afoul of sanctions. He wrote that Alibaba, Baidu, and other potential sanction targets \"could be in for some volatility\" if China escalates its aggression in the South China Sea or targets Taiwan.\n\nThe contrarian bargain hunter also wrote that \"Putin's jaw has to be on the floor\" after the US did in \"practically seconds\" what Russia has been trying to do in Ukraine for three years.\n\nHe added that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid to long term, as tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nBurry also suggested that Canada and Mexico could \"lose a good amount of leverage\" in trade with the US if American refineries switch out Canadian crude for Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe veteran investor also said US oil-services companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes \"should benefit significantly\" as US contractors will be tasked with fixing and modernizing Venezuela's pipelines and refineries.\n\nBurry also forecast a \"long term tailwind\" for the US as inflows of Venezuelan oil will mean gas, diesel, and jet fuel prices will drop. He said that could push down prices to the benefit of consumers, especially lower-income ones, cut supply chain costs, and ease some uncertainty about the future for business owners.",

    "fullText": "The S&P 500 advanced 16% in 2025, notching double-digit gains for the third straight year.\n\nFederal Reserve research suggests President Trump's tariffs will slow economic growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at the most expensive valuation since the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) added 16% in 2025, marking the third consecutive year in which the benchmark index has recorded double-digit gains. Unfortunately, investors have reason to think 2026 will more challenging. Evidence suggests President Trump's tariffs are hurting the economy, and the stock market just flashed a warning last seen during the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nIn 2025, President Donald Trump broke with decades of trade-policy precedent and imposed sweeping tariffs that raised the average tax on U.S. imports to 16.8%, the highest level since 1935, per the Budget Lab at Yale. And Trump -- who once called tariffs \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary -- has made many misleading or inaccurate statements to drum up support for his signature trade policies.\n\nTrump said foreign exporters would absorb the tariffs for the \"privilege of access\" to the American market. However, Goldman Sachs says U.S. companies and consumers collectively paid 82% of the tariffs in October 2025, and 67% of the burden will fall on consumers alone by July 2026.\n\nTrump said tariffs would bring manufacturing work back to America. However, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) says U.S. manufacturing activity has now contracted in nine consecutive months due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs.\n\nTrump said tariffs would protect American workers and create millions of jobs. However, unemployment is at a four-year high and (excluding the pandemic) hiring slowed more profoundly in 2025 than any other year since the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump said tariffs would make America wealthy again and people would be \"very happy\" with the result. However, consumer sentiment in 2025 recorded its lowest annual average since the University of Michigan started collecting data in 1960.\n\nImportantly, U.S. GDP increased an annual 4.3% during the third quarter, the most robust growth in two years. President Trump credited tariffs for the booming economy. However, GDP growth was artificially high because imports (which are subtracted from GDP) were artificially low. Why were imports low? Companies stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs earlier this year.",

    "fullText": "A major Groq investor said data center development was \"speculative\" and would put \"stress on the system.\"\n\nAlex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday.\n\nHe said he was concerned about landlords who were building data centers based on speculation about future demand.\n\n\"I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market,\" Davis wrote in his letter. \"The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.",
