    "description": "Some Starbucks investors are urging against re-electing two board members who they say are responsible for \"backsliding\" labor relations.",
    "fullText": "A group of Starbucks investors is escalating their pressure campaign over the coffee giant's ongoing labor turmoil — and this time, they're targeting the board.\n\nAhead of the company's March 25 annual meeting, a coalition of long-term shareholders that have advocated for workers' rights is urging investors to vote against the reelection of Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, the lead independent director, and Beth Ford, the chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee. The group cites what they call \"sustained oversight failures of labor relations.\"\n\n\"We have a world‑class board of directors with deep, relevant expertise, who is supporting our management team in driving a business turnaround,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nUS baristas began unionizing in late 2021. More than four years — and four strikes, supported by politicians like Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani — later, the company has not reached its first collective bargaining agreement.\n\nStarbucks Workers United says it represents more than 12,000 baristas at over 600 locations. After Starbucks shuttered hundreds of US stores in September, a Starbucks spokesperson said the union represents closer to 550, or less than 5%, of its company-owned stores.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider in October that the company offers \"best-in-class benefits\" and said the union's demands for a 77% increase in the minimum wage for hourly partners over the life of a three-year contract are \"not sustainable.\"\n\nThe company also said in a public statement that union delegates \"prematurely ended\" its last bargaining session in late December 2024.\n\nThe investors organizing against the board members include New York City Comptroller Mark Levine, Trillium ESG Global Equity Mutual Fund, Merseyside Pension Fund, and the Shareholder Association for Research and Education. These activist shareholders argue that Starbucks' board has retreated from its prior commitments to strengthen labor relations as tensions have flared again.\n\n\"The sudden U-turn on labor relations oversight by Starbucks' Board is inconsistent with the Company's turnaround strategy and commitments — and changes have not been explained to shareholders,\" the shareholder letter reads.\n\nThe letter points to mounting legal and reputational risks facing the company. In the first three years of organizing, workers filed over 700 charges of labor rights violations with the National Labor Relations Board against Starbucks and its outside counsel. The Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, found the number of charges filed was \"almost certainly\" the highest number in history.\n\nSince January 2025, workers have filed more than 125 unfair labor practice charges, including allegations of failure to bargain in good faith and retaliatory firings. They also launched three work stoppages, the latest of which began in November and is ongoing at 17 locations. Starbucks has 16,911 locations in the US.\n\nStarbucks has also faced a $38.9 million settlement with New York City in December over alleged Fair Workweek Law violations affecting more than 15,000 workers — \"the largest labor law settlement in the city's history,\" the letter says.\n\nJonas Kron, the chief advocacy officer at $4.2 billion Trillium Asset Management, one of the investor groups that signed the letter, told Business Insider that Starbucks' labor reputation is \"enormously important\" for shareholder value.\n\n\"And reputation can slip in the world of social media relatively quickly and with some pretty small episodes,\" Kron said. \"It's not that many stores, that may be true, but that doesn't diminish the impact that it can have.\"\n\nStarbucks has acknowledged the risks posed by its ongoing labor battle. In its most recent annual report, the company said work stoppages from unionized baristas can \"have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\"\n\nThe investor group argues that the board initially appeared to take those risks seriously. In late 2023, following a shareholder proposal supported by a majority and the threat of a proxy contest, Starbucks created an Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact (EPCI) Committee, tasked primarily with overseeing labor relations.\n\nThat committee was \"quietly eliminated\" in November, with the board taking over three months to \"provide an unpersuasive justification\" of its breakup, the investors wrote.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson said the move gave the full board responsibility for labor oversight to ensure accountability, consistency, and alignment with company priorities.\n\nThe investor group has concerns.\n\n\"This inconsistency and abrupt reversal raise legitimate concerns about whether the Board is retreating from the focused, independent oversight it previously deemed necessary,\" the letter states.\n\nThe governance shift comes as Starbucks continues its turnaround under CEO Brian Niccol, whose strategy centers on improving service and strengthening connections between staff and customers.\n\n\"Starbucks' turnaround plan depends on an engaged workforce and improved in-store experience, both of which are strained by ongoing labor conflict,\" the investors wrote.\n\nMichelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the Starbucks Workers United union and a 15-year veteran barista, told Business Insider in a statement that Starbucks \"doesn't work\" without its baristas.\n\n\"We also know that Starbucks could be the 'Best Job in Retail,' as company executives say, but it isn't right now and hasn't been for a very long time,\" Eisen said. \"Bringing about long-term stability at Starbucks begins with a fair union contract.\"\n\nThe investor coalition argues that Knudstorp and Ford are \"uniquely accountable\" for the labor tensions, given their roles. Knudstorp chaired the nominating and corporate governance committee from 2019 through 2025, served on the EPCI committee, and became lead independent director in 2025. Ford joined the board in 2023, chaired the EPCI committee, and now leads the nominating and corporate governance committee.\n\nThe investors also point to what they describe as waning transparency and engagement. In proxy statements, Starbucks reported at least 30 shareholder engagements in both 2023 and 2024, and 18 in 2025.\n\n\"Taken together, these changes suggest a troubling retreat from transparency, responsiveness, and commitment to engage on labor oversight matters material to shareholder value,\" the investors wrote.",

    "fullText": "The once relentless rally in AI-fueled stocks has lost momentum, as investors confront the unsettling idea that advances in artificial intelligence could erode the very value propositions that made tech giants dominant in the first place. Yet some executives and market veterans warn against short-term panic, calling the selloff a rare opportunity to buy into the next phase of the AI boom.\n\nThe AI growth story has been tempered by a widespread selloff in software stocks. Call it the software-mageddon or the SaaSpocalypse, but companies who specialize in designing, selling, and maintaining digital software products are getting battered. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts wrote that software companies had lost around $2 trillion in value over the past year, calling it “the largest non-recessionary 12-month drawdown in over 30 years.”\n\nThe culprit has been an increasingly widespread feeling among investors that AI is sorting tech players into winners and losers. Under this view, software companies could fall into the latter camp as the capabilities of newer AI models promise to replace expensive digital services, rendering the business models of companies like Salesforce and Atlassian obsolete.\n\nBut not all investors are convinced these companies are destined for irrelevance. Hidden within the chaos could lie an undervalued chance to buy these tech stocks at a discount, a relative rarity in an age of soaring valuations and speculative growth. It all depends on whether bullish buyers consider AI as complementary to existing software services, or capable enough to replace them entirely.\n\n“I think this software selloff will go down as a generational opportunity to own some of the stalwarts,” Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Yahoo Finance interview Friday. “I feel more emboldened about the bull thesis on tech and AI this year, despite obviously this massive pullback.”\n\nIves named three industry leaders that he sees as being unfairly punished in today’s market, and that could be in for a powerful rebound:\n\nIves called the software stock correction a “structural selloff” that was the largest in scale he’d seen in 25 years. But instead of spelling doom for these companies, he framed the wipeout as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in enterprise technology, arguing that software developers will remain a “core part of the use cases,” even in an AI-powered future.",

    "description": "Vinod Khosla said AI warrants a \"rethink of capitalism,\" and taxing capital more could allow 125 million people to be removed from US tax rolls.",
    "fullText": "If artificial intelligence eliminates millions of jobs, it might make sense to scrap income taxes for the vast majority of Americans and target capital instead, Vinod Khosla says.\n\n\"AI will transform economies and need a rethink of capitalism & equity,\" the billionaire venture capitalist wrote in an X post on Monday. \"Labor portion of economy (vs capital) will decline sharply. Should we eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains tax and equalize to ordinary income?\"\n\nKhosla — who cofounded Sun Microsystems and made the first VC investment in OpenAI — was making the point that AI replacing labor on a grand scale might warrant greater taxes on assets such as stocks and real estate.\n\nThe veteran financier, who founded Khosla Ventures after leaving Kleiner Perkins, attached a video highlighting some of the jobs that could be taken by AI, from accountants and therapists to truck drivers and chip designers.\n\nAI will transform economies and need a rethink of capitalism & equity. Labor portion of economy (vs capital) will decline sharply. Should we eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains tax and equalize to ordinary income? 40% of capital gains taxes are paid by those with… pic.twitter.com/7oSA9xj5Ko\n\nKhosla said in a follow-up post that ramping up taxes on capital would generate so much revenue that the government could scrap taxes for most of the roughly 150 million US taxpayers.\n\n\"Could easily eliminate bottom 125 million taxpayers from the tax rolls and be revenue neutral at the same time with a capital gains tax equal to ordinary income and a few other tweaks,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added that tax breaks such as carrying over tax losses and tax-free borrowing against unrealized gains — which he called a \"true abuse!\" — are \"special interest goodies inserted by lobbyists and campaign contributions, not true capitalism.\"\n\nKhosla didn't address common critiques of higher taxes, including that they can discourage entrepreneurship and investment, that collecting them can be tricky, and that wealthy people may leave the country to avoid them.\n\nKhosla has previously underscored that the advent of AI may require sweeping policy changes. He estimated in late 2024 that in 25 years' time, AI could be doing 80% of the work in 80% of all jobs, and universal basic income might be needed to compensate for job destruction.\n\n\"As AI reduces the need for human labor, UBI could become crucial, with governments playing a key role in regulating AI's impact and ensuring equitable wealth distribution,\" he wrote on his firm's website.\n\nKhosla isn't alone in predicting AI will change the fabric of society. Elon Musk suggested late last year that work could become \"optional\" and money might become \"irrelevant\" if advances in AI and robotics generate abundant resources for all.\n\nMoreover, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO recently said that retirement savings may not be needed in 10 or 20 years, as everyone might have \"whatever stuff they want.\"\n\nHowever, skeptics such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame have cautioned the AI boom is a speculative bubble, tech companies are overinvesting in microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, and true AI is further away than many think.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has shifted from virtual silence to answering questions about his personal and professional life on Substack.",
    "fullText": "\"You have a very nice haircut. Did you cut it yourself?\"\n\nMichael Burry, played by Christian Bale, earnestly poses that question to a bewildered analyst in the movie \"The Big Short,\" which chronicles the investor's massive bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble.\n\nThe memorable scene is based on a misguided comment the real-life Burry once made, which he revealed in a comment on his Substack.\n\n\"That is a riff on something similar when I complimented a woman on her dress and asked if it was homemade,\" Burry wrote. \"The pained look was similar.\"\n\nSharing a personal anecdote like that marks a sea change for Burry. Until recently, he was one of finance's most enigmatic figures, known for posting cryptic warnings on X, then deleting them, and vanishing from social media for months or years at a time.\n\nThat changed in November, when Burry closed his hedge fund to outside cash and reinvented himself as a newsletter writer. His posts diagnosing an AI bubble and explaining his bets against Nvidia and Palantir have drawn plenty of attention. But his detailed answers to dozens of questions on myriad topics have largely gone unnoticed.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through the comment sections and discussion threads on Burry's Substack to read all of his responses to subscribers as of Friday last week.\n\nThey offered wide-ranging, unprecedented insights into the personal and professional life of a renowned yet mysterious investor.\n\nElite investors tend to keep a low profile. Even the newly retired Warren Buffett only communicated with Berkshire Hathaway shareholders a handful of times a year.\n\nBurry has broken that mold, shifting from virtual silence as a fund manager to pretty much running a 24/7 \"Ask Me Anything.\"\n\nHe's freely shared his thoughts on the day's headlines and latest market moves.\n\n\"I think there is no doubt a SpaceX-X merger — and even an xAI merger — would be accretive to shareholder value for Tesla,\" he recently wrote. \"However, share value is different than share price.\"\n\n\"It does seem to me that Trump's kryptonite is the American stock market,\" reads another of his comments. \"Nothing else touches him.\"\n\n\"In my view, there are no bigger shoes to fill than Warren's,\" he wrote on another occasion. \"I do not believe anyone can fill them, especially at Berkshire.\"\n\nBurry has also spilled the beans on the contents of his portfolio, down to what stock he bought on a particular day and the average price he paid.\n\nMoreover, he's pulled back the curtain on how he approaches investing. He's discussed earnings calls, analyzed stock charts, held forth on human psychology, and outlined his macroeconomic views in comments and messages to subscribers.\n\nBurry has delved into subjects as esoteric as the dynamics of health insurance marketplaces. He's also shed light on his daily habits and interests, often with humor and humility.\n\n\"Young people sometimes don't know how playful and goofy us older guys are,\" he recently wrote.\n\nWhen a reader queried if he'd consider starring in a documentary, Burry quipped: \"Me sitting in front of a computer in my shorts? Or sitting in a chair reading? Doesn't sound too compelling.\"\n\nAsked how he felt on a scale of 1-10, Burry replied: \"I am pretty much a 5 all the time. My wife can attest. My 54-year-old face is not etched by many smiles.\"\n\nResponding to a follow-up question about how he felt when his \"Big Short\" initially went south, he wrote: \"That manifested in my gut. Not fun. I was headed to surgery. Then the trade worked out and I was cured.\"\n\n\"Sir you need sleep,\" one thoughtful subscriber wrote. \"Thank you. I got four hours in,\" Burry replied.\n\nOnce a closed book, the investor has revealed that he's reading \"The Sun Eater\" book series by sci-fi writer Christopher Ruocchio, had a \"heck of a time\" at an Aerosmith concert in the '80s, played Pokémon with his kids, and titled one post after a heavy-metal song called \"The Jig Is Up\" by Ice Nine Kills.\n\nHe's also disclosed some of his favorite investments. He wrote that he's been holding gold and silver for more than 20 years now, and snaps up Samsung Electronics stock every time it gets cheap — a strategy that has \"worked spectacularly several times\" in the past two decades.\n\nBurry, whose Substack is titled \"Cassandra Unchained,\" has also lived up to his reputation for doom-and-gloom predictions.\n\n\"But before a couple of years pass, I see a 100 car wreck that will hurt a lot of AI bulls,\" he wrote, underlining his concern about where the market is headed.",

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

But if what you're saying is follows the last model, it's almost like it wouldn't necessarily be a positive catalyst, it might be a negative sort of like that last capitulation catalyst.\n\nYeah. Right. We need Correct. Correct.\n\nWhat are the what what could be that catalyst?\n\nSo, you know, some people thought uh FTX. Uh, maybe there's another similar type of thing out there.\n\nLike there's a blow up waiting in the wings somewhere.\n\nYeah, like, you know, most people have said that the acceleration down really started after October 10th. You know, October 10th there was a flash crash.\n\nAnd we're we've had flash crashes in the traditional markets. I was in the hedge fund business in the old world for 25 years. I saw many flash crashes. They're normal.\n\nAnd in crypto, you've have flash crashes all the time. It used to be, I don't know if you remember but in 2016, 17, 18, Coinbase would go down and people would say, oh, Coinbase is down and you would have a flash crash.\n\nAnd so we had a very severe moment on October 10th that is yet to be sort of resolved. The person who was maybe forced to liquidate, uh or the entity that was forced to liquidate, uh it seems is still, uh, is still liquidating. Maybe there is an entity, maybe there isn't. We don't know, but I think um there has to be sort of a capitulative moment, a moment of realization where people say, oh my goodness,\n\nit's over. And we've already been seeing that, oh Bitcoin's going to zero. Someone asked me the other day at dinner whether Bitcoin was going to zero. Um, so it's sort of unfortunate, but that's sort of the way markets work. And unfortunately with this specific crypto blockchain market, you have a lot of individuals, a lot of retail of non-professional investor.",

    "fullText": "One year into Donald Trump's presidency, bitcoin is worth less than it was before he was elected, and the entire market is in the throes of a crypto winter. According to famed investor Ross Gerber, blame the meme coin ecosystem for the broader decline.\n\nThe CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management thinks the launch of the Trump and Melania coins around the time of the inauguration, followed by a subsequent boom in meme tokens, has left investors fatigued and wary of digital assets.\n\nIn his view, meme coins either endorsed or launched by celebrities are either rug pulls or end up looking like one. In either case, normal investors are left holding the bag while celebrity boosters get rich.\n\nHe pointed to World Liberty Financial Coin and the Melania token, which have both plummeted in price, while the Trump meme coin has also shed about 80% of its value in the last year.\n\n\"People dive in and buy this stuff because they buy into the fraud, basically, and then they get burned, and that money doesn't come back. It's stolen from them.\"\n\nThis is only part of the problem that Gerber sees. When people lose money betting on meme coins, he added, they typically turn their back on crypto and don't come back. He also thinks the Trump administration's looser approach to crypto regulation is making the market less appealing to everyday investors.\n\nHe said it is extremely difficult for bitcoin to rally when investors are being scared away from crypto, as demand rises only when new participants enter the market.\n\nGerber also cited other celebrity-launched cryptos, such as the token launched by former NYC mayor Eric Adams and the $HAWK coin launched by internet personality Haliey Welch, as examples of celebrities meme coins that plummeted shortly after they debuted, while leaving investors holding the bag.\n\nGerber isn't the only one arguing that a growing lack of faith in crypto is compromising bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently argued that it will be hard for bitcoin to rise again until institutional investors increase their participation.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Kevin Harris (D-Prince George's) speaks with Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery) on the Senate floor Tuesday. Harris introduced a bill that could let utility companies to build and operate power-generation infrastructure. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)\n\nSen. Kevin Harris is not sure his bill allowing investor-owned utilities to get back in the business of generating power — and using ratepayer dollars to do so — is the answer to high energy prices and constrained demand in the state.\n\nBut the Prince George’s County Democrat is sure that something needs to be done.\n\n“We need to have all possible options out there for the state of Maryland. Who knows if this is the right one, but we won’t know until we actually do the deep dive, have the discussions and figure out what’s best for our constituents,” said Harris of Senate Bill 954 that he is sponsoring.\n\nThe bill, which lays out a pathway for investor-owned electric utilities to use ratepayer dollars to build power generation infrastructure in Maryland, has the support of Exelon — the owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco. The Chicago-based utility has been campaigning hard for the idea, including in TV commercials that aired in Maryland during the Super Bowl.\n\nBut consumer advocates and environmental groups argue that putting additional costs on the backs of customers would be deeply harmful amid already-high costs. They warn that high infrastructure spending by utilities is part of the reason for the current high rates, and allowing further construction would make matters worse.\n\nMaryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who is tasked with representing utility ratepayers in the state, said in a statement that he believes “the Exelon bill is anything but affordable.”\n\n“Turning new business over to Exelon unnecessarily exposes customers to the Exelon utilities’ long record of exceeding cost projections and of cost overruns,” Lapp said.\n\nIn Maryland, the utilities, which control the distribution of power to homes and businesses across the state, are separate from the companies that generate power and supply it to the grid.\n\nThe utilities enjoy monopolies in their service territories and are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which presides over the costs they can pass on to customers. Utilities receive reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs, and a guaranteed profit on top of that, often 9% or higher.\n\nCurrent law technically states that the PSC “may require or allow investor-owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities … subject to appropriate cost recovery.”\n\nHarris’ bill is considerably more specific.\n\nThe bill directs the PSC to require one or more electric companies to submit plans involving power generation, if it determines that there is a power scarcity, or that an event impacting “price stability” has occurred. The commission then has one year to approve or deny the plans.\n\nHarris said that his bill, called the Affordable Energy Act, would only allow the utilities to build renewable energy projects, but not fossil fuel projects.\n\nValencia McClure, senior vice president of government, regulatory and external affairs for Exelon’s Maryland utilities, said her company wants to focus on operating community solar farms and battery storage infrastructure, not natural gas generation. She noted that power customers who \n\n“We really are focusing on: How can we support our customers during this affordability crisis?” McClure said. “The way to do that is to — if called upon by the state — to be able to build new generation.”\n\nBut Lapp said Maryland consumers should not be paying for any increased power generation in the state through their rates, since much of the predicted strain on the regional grid isn’t actually coming from Maryland. It’s largely coming from data centers projected for other states, he said.\n\nHouse caps amount of utility employee salaries that can come out of ratepayers’ pockets\n\n“PJM projects that the Maryland Exelon utilities’ power demands decrease — not increase — through 2029.” Lapp wrote. “Aside from some relatively small data center growth in Maryland compared to PJM — growth that existing customers should not be responsible for — the Exelon utilities’ energy demands only go up modestly starting in 2030, at a growth rate much lower than historical growth rates.”\n\nHarris’ bill explicitly states that the electric utilities required or authorized to construct power facilities can recover all of their costs from ratepayers — even if some of those costs are stranded, including if the infrastructure is never built.\n\n“That’s one of the things that we would be discussing further and see what is actually needed and what is not needed,” Harris said.\n\nLapp argues that the provision is alarming.\n\n“It would give utilities unprecedented statutory protection from the consequences of building power plants that turn out to be unnecessary — a real possibility given the vast evidence suggesting that projections of data center energy demands are inflated,” Lapp wrote.\n\nIn a statement, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the company supports the measure “to make sure a large generation project doesn’t jeopardize the utility’s health or lead to higher debt costs overall, which would adversely impact customers.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the bill will be able to advance: Senate President Bill Ferguson said Tuesday that “there is a level of skepticism that exists across the caucus, and across the Senate membership” about whether it will reduce ratepayer costs.\n\n“That’s going to be the lens that we are really trying to hone in on, is whether or not a policy is going to provide long-term savings for the ratepayer,” Ferguson said.\n\nMcClure said Exelon estimates that average customer bills would increase about $2 per month for a few years, but those would turn to savings of $5 to $10 a month in the future. The company’s analysis was based on construction of 2,700 megawatts of battery storage and 1,200 megawatts of solar.\n\nFerguson said that he would “prefer that that the risk” of investment “land with investors.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\n“But there is a question that if there is a strike price or point where … the market is not generating sufficient domestic generation, whether that has to be some other market intervention to push it,” Ferguson said.\n\nLast year, lawmakers passed the Next Generation Energy Act, which included a fast-track permitting process for “dispatchable” energy projects, which can provide energy for the grid when called upon during peak times. Only two projects have been approved to move through the fast-track, under the legislation’s requirements: Two different concepts for a natural gas plant in Harford County, submitted by Constellation.\n\nConstellation, formerly an Exelon subsidiary, also proposed a battery storage project, but it did not meet requirements of the fast-track bill, even though it created a procurement specifically for battery storage.\n\nConstellation has been opposed to Exelon’s push to enter the generation game, arguing that it would crowd out competitive power producers, and that Exelon is ill-suited to enter the generation fray.\n\n“BGE doesn’t need new law to build new generation,” said Constellation spokesman Paul Adams. “BGE wants new law to guarantee a return on any investment, whether or not that investment is in the best interests of Maryland ratepayers or at the lowest cost. Unlike them, Constellation is ready and willing to put our own capital on the line, with no guarantee of profit. It seems only reasonable that if you aren’t willing to take on any risk, you should take no profit.”",

    "fullText": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — As major energy companies announce plans to move their headquarters from Oklahoma City to Houston, experts say the reasons may have less to do with what Oklahoma is doing wrong and more about publicly-traded companies’ priority to serve shareholders above others.\n\nExperts say that while there are certain things the state can improve upon, in the case of Devon Energy and Expand Energy, the deck was already stacked against Oklahoma outside of the state’s control.\n\n“The joke around my part of the city is that we’d rather live in Oklahoma City because we have less traffic, better weather, and a better basketball team,” Former Oklahoma City University Business School Dean Steve Agee told News 4.\n\nExpand Energy to move headquarters to Houston\n\nAgee said he believes the moves can mostly be blamed on the fact that Devon and Expand are publicly-traded companies, which prioritize shareholders before their communities, employees, or customers.\n\n“I think we all have to step back and make sure that we understand corporations like this are in business to make money and they’re in business to provide good returns for their shareholders,” Agee said.\n\n“Devon and Expand are thinking that—in order to enhance shareholder value—a move like this would probably be the appropriate thing to do,” Agee said.\n\nOver the past decade, other publicly-traded energy companies have also moved to Houston, including ExxonMobil, leaving the Dallas–Fort Worth area, and Chevron leaving California.\n\nWalt Duncan, president of privately-held Oklahoma City-based Duncan Oil Properties, said publicly traded companies often want to position themselves near each other to serve as a one-stop shop for industry analysts.\n\n“The public companies want to have as much coverage as they can by industry analysts,” Duncan said. “And so, you know, most of these analysts are coming out of New York. You know, if they can stop in one city and, you know, hit 20 different companies that they have to cover, that’s much easier for them.”\n\nDuncan said boards overseeing Devon and Expand have included fewer and fewer Oklahomans over the years, leaving fewer leaders with ties to the community.\n\nIt’s different for privately-held companies like Continental Resources—soon to be Oklahoma City’s largest remaining energy company.\n\nState and local leaders react to Devon and Coterra merger\n\nContinental Resources CEO Harold Hamm told The Oklahoman Monday he’s committed to keeping the company in Oklahoma.\n\n“I don’t have any concern that Continental being private is ever going to is ever going to want to go to Houston,” Duncan said. “You really do have to think about it, and you have to take sort of the executive management team, I do not know very many people in the industry, you know, kind of rank and file, that I have ever heard of being excited to move to Houston.”",

    "description": "Thomas Kaplan championed the lifelong benefits of being grateful, acting with conviction, and being willing to say \"I don't know.\"",
    "fullText": "Gratitude, humility, and conviction are key ingredients for a happy and successful life, Thomas Kaplan says.\n\nThe billionaire investor, who owns the world's largest private collection of artworks by Rembrandt van Rijn, spoke to Business Insider ahead of the auction of \"Young Lion Resting\" at Sotheby's New York on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rembrandt drawing, which Kaplan co-owned, sold for nearly $18 million — with the proceeds going to Panthera, the \"big cat\" conservation nonprofit he cofounded.\n\nKaplan said that protecting endangered felines has been his greatest passion since he was six years old. He dreamed of studying big cats as a felid zoologist, only to realize a few years later that he lacked the flair for science required.\n\n\"But I made a vow to myself — I think I was about 12 — if I ever make enough money, I'm going to come back to the subject, and I will support and enable all of those conservationists who had the aptitude that I didn't have,\" Kaplan said.\n\nHe went on to make a fortune in the energy and precious metal industries. True to his word, he cofounded Panthera in 2006 with leading cat conservationist the late Alan Rabinowitz, and the pair built the organization into a world leader in the field.\n\n\"I'm very mission-driven, and I will do anything to move the needle on those things that move me,\" Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan shared three pieces of life advice with Business Insider.\n\nAsked how he kept his three children grounded in an ultrawealthy household, he said they were simply \"not motivated by money.\"\n\n\"No bling, no social media, no cars or watches or any accoutrements of wealth. None,\" he added.\n\nKaplan said he drilled into them the importance of giving back and being thankful, as he believes the \"basis for all happiness is living a life of gratitude.\"\n\nHe's made sure they \"understand if you are an ungrateful person, you will be miserable and deserve to be.\"\n\nKaplan also underscored the need to recognize the limits of your knowledge and resist speculating beyond what you deeply understand. Warren Buffett would describe that as staying within one's \"circle of competence.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid to say, 'I don't know,'\" Kaplan said. \"Credibility is hard won, easily lost.\"\n\nThe NovaGold Resources chairman said that people respect his expertise in certain subjects, and he never wants to \"debase that currency by being flippant.\"\n\n\"Be disciplined enough not to feel that because you're asked something, you have to answer it,\" he said.\n\nKaplan's final piece of advice was \n\n\"If you're going to go down, go down for something that wasn't flippant, but was thought through,\" he said.\n\n\"When you have a relative advantage, push the pedal to the metal,\" Kaplan added. \"If you don't have a relative advantage, don't play.\"",

    "title": "I left Amazon and became an angel investor. Mentoring startups for 6 years made me a better founder.",
    "description": "After co-creating Amazon Alexa, William Tunstall-Pedoe became an angel investor. When he started his second business, he drew on the invaluable experience of his mentees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, an angel investor and founder based in the UK. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "title": "Hollywood superagent and investor Michael Ovitz praised Jeffrey Epstein and was invited to his island, files reveal",
    "description": "Michael Ovitz, cofounder of CAA and a tech investor, praised Jeffrey Epstein's \"outstanding multiple talents\" in one email to the disgraced financier.",
    "fullText": "Michael Ovitz, the cofounder of powerhouse Los Angeles talent agency Creative Artists Agency and a prolific tech investor, effusively praised Jeffrey Epstein and made arrangements to meet him at his New York home and off the coast of St. Barts, newly released files reveal.\n\nThe disgraced financier invited Ovitz to his private Caribbean island in 2012 and said he knew Ovitz \"well\" in emails to a Microsoft executive and his publicist, Peggy Siegal. In 2013, Ovitz emailed Epstein, lauding his \"outstanding multiple talents,\" with Epstein emailing Ovitz, \"great to see you smiling again,\" later that year.\n\nA spokesperson for Ovitz denied that he was on anything more than cordial terms with Epstein.\n\n\"Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did not know each other well, no matter what Mr. Epstein said to Peggy Siegal. They had very limited interaction and correspondence,\" a spokesperson for Ovitz told Business Insider. \"When Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Epstein did correspond, Mr. Ovitz was cordial.\"\n\nOvitz co-founded CAA in 1975, where he represented stars like Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro, leaving the firm in 1995 for a stint as president of Disney. The superagent later built deep links to Silicon Valley: he has invested in hundreds of startups, and has served as an advisor to the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nOvitz is also a senior advisor to Palantir and has recently invested in AI startups, including the Google-backed AI studio Promise and the image generator Black Forest Labs, where he serves as an advisor.\n\nDocuments released last week by the Justice Department from its investigation into Epstein provide a deeper look at his ties to Ovitz. It's not the first time Ovitz's name comes up in relation to Epstein: in 2023, Ovitz was subpoenaed by the US Virgin Islands as part of its lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase for banking with Epstein. That lawsuit has since been settled.\n\nThe new material shows communication between Ovitz and Epstein in the early and mid-2010s — after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor, but before his 2019 arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges — which ended with his death by suicide in a jail cell.\n\nIn a 2010 email exchange, Ovitz wrote to Epstein, \"hope you are well\" and \"been a while\" after a dinner with Jes Staley, the former Barclays CEO who later came under close scrutiny for his Epstein dealings.\n\n\"Had dinner with Jes last night and your ears should still be burning,\" Ovitz wrote, adding that he and Epstein should get together.\n\nJPMorgan Chase declined to comment to Business Insider for this article.\n\nIn February 2012, Epstein planned to see Ovitz at an undisclosed location, according to a Google Calendar reminder. A few months later, in April, Ovitz emailed Epstein that he would drop by the financier's Manhattan home for a drink, writing, \"would love to see you.\"\n\nIn December 2012, after learning that Ovitz was wintering in St. Barts in the Caribbean, Epstein invited him to his private island, Little Saint James, writing, \"will you be near my island, come visit.\"\n\nOvitz declined, saying his boat was stuck in St. Barts after he dropped a rudder. He told Epstein his boat was located about 500 yards from the yacht Al Mirqab, owned by former Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani — which Epstein said he was visiting at the time — and suggested Epstein could stop by. The potential meetup didn't take place, Ovitz's spokesperson told Business Insider after publication.\n\nIn a January 2013 email, Ovitz wrote to Epstein that he and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, had been \"raving about you and your outstanding multiple talents.\" Sinofsky had been relying on Epstein to negotiate his Microsoft exit at the time.\n\nSinofsky later asked Epstein in an email if he knew Ovitz, whom he had just met at Andreessen Horowitz, and Epstein replied, \"very very well.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Epstein emailed Ovitz again, writing, \"great to see you smiling again.\"\n\nIn 2014, Andrew Farkas, a real estate magnate who co-owned a marina with Epstein in St. Thomas, also asked Epstein for an introduction to Ovitz to discuss naming a new performing arts degree at Harvard University.\n\nEpstein's most recent reference to Ovitz in the files is from 2017, when Epstein emailed his publicist Siegal that he knew Ovitz \"WELL.\"\n\nThe Epstein files are full of recognizable names who had correspondence with him, and some of the content is anodyne. The latest documents have caused headaches for some of the movers and shakers whose names appear on them.\n\nOn Wednesday night, powerhouse lawyer Brad Karp stepped down from the chairmanship of his firm, Paul Weiss, saying his ties to Epstein had become a \"distraction\" for it. Prominent longevity influencer Peter Attia publicly apologized for his crude email exchanges with Epstein and stepped down as chief science officer for a protein bar company.\n\nOvitz's CAA has become one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies. The firm rose to prominence by driving ever-higher actor paydays by demanding larger box-office cuts for stars like Brad Pitt.\n\nCAA served as an inspiration for Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz when they built Andreessen Horowitz, which prides itself on being founder-friendly.\n\n\"An important part of A16z's origin story, which you may already know, is that we were founded by Marc & Ben to be 'CAA for the tech industry,'\" reads the firm's website.\n\nBesides his involvement with A16z, Ovitz also chairs the VC firm Treville Capital Group and announced last year that he was launching his own startup, SoundPatrol, that uses AI to fight copyright infringement in music.",

    "description": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he believes gold is still a safe-haven asset, given its large presence in central bank reserves.",
    "fullText": "For Ray Dalio, gold hasn't lost its shine.\n\nWhile many metal investors are likely still shaken by gold's 12% plunge last Friday, the famed hedge fund founder said he wasn't fazed by gold's big drop. That's because bullion is still a safe-haven asset, Dalio said, making the case for why gold should still be a part of investors' portfolios at the World Governments Summit on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking at the conference in Dubai, the Bridgewater founder noted that gold was still held in large amounts by the world's central banks. Bullion surpassed the euro as the second-largest reserve asset last year.\n\n\"I think if people were to make — those who are running policies and so on — were to say, they would say gold is the safest money in this kind of environment,\" Dalio said.\n\nThe safety of the metal also doesn't \"change by the day,\" Dalio added, referring to the gold's long-standing status as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to fiat money.\n\nWhile gold is still down 7% from its all-time high, its price is up 71% in the last year.\n\n\"I think people make the mistake of thinking, 'Is it going to go up or down, and should I buy it?'\" Dalio said, suggesting that a better question would be how much an investor should allocate to gold as a percentage of their total portfolio.\n\nGold sold off hard alongside other metals last week as investors took in President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed Chair. Investors quickly repriced their outlook for rates and the dollar, prompting a rapid unwind of their metal positions.\n\nPart of gold's allure in the past year has also been fueled by perceived economic risks, such as the fear that debt levels could rise to unsustainable levels or that the US dollar could weaken alongside other fiat currencies.\n\nDalio, who has regularly warned markets of such risks, said he still believes the US is \"on the brink\" of a capital war, a situation where geopolitical tensions make global investors hesitant to lend money to the US by buying its bonds.\n\n\"Gold is a diversifier. In other words, when the bad times come along, it does uniquely well,\" Dalio said. \"I'd say the most important thing is to have a well-diversified portfolio.\"\n\nDalio is known for being a proponent of gold investing. In the past, he's recommended that investors allocate 15% of their portfolios to gold and bitcoin, pointing to concerns about currency debasement.",

    "description": "Longtime fund manager George Noble said the Fed under Kevin Warsh will keep fueling the forces that have boosted gold in the last year.",
    "fullText": "The metal market's tantrum in the aftermath of Donald Trump's nomination of a new Fed chief was wrongheaded, one longtime investor says.\n\nThat's because, according to veteran fund manager George Noble, Kevin Warsh is a dove who will keep adding fuel to the debasement trade, rather than the hawk markets have perceived him to be.\n\nNoble, the former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund and founder of two hedge funds, said in a post on X that Warsh has expressed a desire to lower rates, continuing a trend that's boosted haven assets like gold and silver over the last year.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty and waning investor confidence in risk assets spurred gold and silver to historic highs in 2025. Warsh's nomination spurred a reassessment of the debasement trade, but Noble doesn't see any reversal coming, pointing to a recent Fox News interview in which Warsh hinted at his dovish stance.\n\n\"The 'hawk' wants to slash rates by 200 basis points into a 'booming' economy,\" Noble wrote. \"That's not hawkish. That's pouring gasoline on a bonfire.\"\n\nIn Noble's view, the narrative that kicked off the precious metals plunge—that higher rates will boost the dollar and hurt the appeal of gold—collapses when you examine Warsh's history and statements from a macro perspective.\n\n\"The debasement trade isn't about who chairs the Fed, \"Noble said. \"It's about math. And if Warsh actually executes the plan he outlined on Fox News - slashing rates to 2% - gold at $4,500 is going to look like the bargain of the century.\"\n\nNoble doesn't think investors should rush to buy the dip in gold right now, given the extreme volatility. He speculated that gold and silver could still have further to fall and that investors should tread carefully.\n\n\"Let the market tell you where the bottom is. Then buy,\" he said.\n\"And when you do - favor the equities over the metals. The miners have lagged badly and offer better risk/reward from here.\"",

    "fullText": "Close to two years after losing a proxy fight to longtime Disney boss Bob Iger, billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is still a skeptic.\n\nActivist investor and Trian Partners founder Nelson Peltz said at a Florida event on Tuesday that Disney picked Josh D'Amaro as its new CEO because \"Iger needs a reason to stay on.\"\n\nPeltz said to expect an announcement from Iger saying, \"Josh doesn't know anything about the movie business, the entertainment business; therefore, I'm going to stay on and guide him.\"\n\n\"Poor Josh,\" Peltz said, with a laugh.\n\nD'Amaro's appointment as CEO was approved by Disney's board in a unanimous vote led by former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who managed his own succession at the bank.\n\nD'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace,\" Gorman said in a statement, and the division he leads was more than 70% of the company's operating income last quarter. Iger, meanwhile, called D'Amaro the \"right person to become our next CEO.\"\n\nIger will remain at the company in a senior advisor role until the end of the year. This is Iger's second retirement from Disney. He previously tapped Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger returned from retirement in 2022 after Chapek's bumpy, tumultuous tenure.\n\nPeltz waged a proxy battle with Disney to gain board seats in early 2024, while criticizing its streaming division's losses, unstable stock, and uncertain succession plans. He sold his Disney shares after shareholders voted to support Iger.\n\nPeltz said D'Amaro has his work cut out for him when he takes over on March 18.\n\n\"I hope he's given the opportunity to do it,\" Peltz said.",

Buffett wasn't advising someone to watch the markets or make investing a second job. He was saying to get on with life. Keep earning. Let compound interest take the wheel. With steady income and decades ahead, the real advantage isn't perfect timing—it's not touching the money at all. When the plan is simple and automatic, the hardest part is knowing when to leave it alone.\n\nBuffett has long maintained that most investors shouldn't try to beat the market. It's not about intelligence—it's about realism. He doesn't just invest in companies—he buys entire businesses, with full access to management, operations, and long-term strategy. That's not something the average investor can replicate.\n\nInstead, he recommends simplicity and discipline. A low-cost index fund—like one that tracks the S&P 500—spreads your money across hundreds of large U.S. companies. There's no guesswork involved. You're not betting on the next Apple or Amazon. You're owning a slice of the entire market and letting it grow over time.\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nAt Berkshire's 2020 shareholders meeting, Buffett doubled down on the same principle. \"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" he said. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it.\"",

    "description": "Two Business Insider reporters attended Starbucks' Investor Day and got a firsthand look at how the brand plans to build momentum with its turnaround.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks' new \"Ristretto\" concept, as the company called it — named after the short-pulled espresso shot — aims to reduce average build costs by about 20% while optimizing overall footprint, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said.\n\nThe walk-thru mockup featured cushy furniture, digital menus, merch displays, and a callback to Starbucks' 1971 founding above the door.\n\nSmith forecast 600 to 650 new stores opening globally in the current fiscal year, rising to over 2,000 in fiscal year 2028. Roughly 400 of the new US coffeehouses coming by 2028 are expected to be company-owned.\n\nWalking through the coffeehouse setup, with Simple Plan's \"I'm Just a Kid\" playing on the speakers, it was hard not to think back to our teenage years when Starbucks was the hangout spot, which perhaps was the point.\n\nExecs stressed Starbucks' desire to become a \"third place.\"\n\n\"We have a unique opportunity to connect people over coffee during a time when loneliness is pervasive,\" Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said.\n\nThe furniture, including the \"Starbucks lounge icon,\" as the display next to the chair pictured above read, was designed to get people to sit and hang out for a while.\n\nNiccol said the company plans to add 25,000 additional seats to its US company-operated stores by the end of its fiscal year and replace thousands more with \"more comfortable options.\"\n\n\"Customers are already responding with longer dwell times and, frankly, improved customer satisfaction and connections,\" he added.\n\nStarbucks plans to introduce digital menu boards in all of its US company-operated stores over the next 18 months, separating its morning and afternoon menus to better target customer preferences.\n\n\"The morning is very much a ritual,\" Niccol said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. \"The afternoon is really a reset — and depending on where you are in that reset, you sometimes want a blended drink, you sometimes want an energy drink, you sometimes want a sparkling drink, and you sometimes want protein.\"\n\nStarbucks plans to expand its wellness offerings to meet that demand.\n\nStarbucks offered samples of global flavors like an ube macchiatto, a reformulated Chai latte with mango cold foam, and a strawberry açaí refresher, available three ways: decaffeinated, caffeinated, or with an energy boost.\n\nWe also sampled some bakery items, including a croissant-like uzu citrus blossom with a tasty uzu filling.\n\nStarbucks is rolling out new front and back-end technologies to make baristas' jobs easier — and help you get your order faster.\n\nThe company's mobile app has gotten a facelift, and a new loyalty program is rolling out in March. Its new point-of-sale system, also coming this year, aims to reduce staff training time and the time it takes to place an order.\n\nThe Mastrena III espresso machine, rolling out in 2027, halves the time it takes to brew espresso while maintaining the quality, Starbucks says.\n\nStarbucks also showed off Green Dot Assist, an AI-powered assistant that gives baristas recipes and other information about an order on a tablet to speed up production.\n\nThe Q&A session lasted nearly an hour, during which analysts pressed the executives for more specifics on their plan.\n\nDespite the optimism onstage, investors pressed executives on the company's long-term plan. Shares slid about 1% during the presentations, after a brief pop earlier in the week before earnings.\n\nThe execs responded to several questions about Starbucks' operating margins and its recent deal with Boyu Capital to sell off 60% of its China business. Investors also wanted more details on how Starbucks will navigate ongoing supply chain snarls and encourage employees to have an \"ownership mentality\" to grow with the brand.\n\nAbout five hours after it began, Rodriguez left investor day buzzing with caffeine and headed back to Business Insider's New York headquarters.\n\nOn the West Coast, Business Insider's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert — equally caffeinated after a 3 a.m. wake-up — was already on the phone with analysts. Their verdict: Starbucks has gone on offense, laying out growth plans that are credible, if not exactly blockbuster.\n\nTogether, the two reporters walked away with a sharper view of where Starbucks' strategy is headed next.\n\nThe company hopes it can reignite momentum by making its cafés more inviting and pushing harder on menu innovation. There's still work to do — but Starbucks believes its comeback is no longer theoretical.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Starbucks?

    "title": "'Shoulder to shoulder with Michael Burry': A day trader details his bearish thesis on one of the Reddit crowd's favorite stocks",
    "description": "Palantir is a darling of the Reddit day-trader crowd. One everyday investor unpacks why he isn't buying the hype.",
    "fullText": "It's well known that retail traders love the meme culture of Wall Street Bets, but Reddit has become a fertile ground for genuine stock-market debate in the years since Roaring Kitty sparked the great GameStop short-squeeze.\n\nEvery so often, a well-argued thesis on a particular stock stands out. Of course, there's Keith Gill's famous posts unpacking why GameStop would soar. More recently, in October, a post from a retail trader disclosing a massive bet on struggling Beyond Meat blew up and quickly led to a major short squeeze.\n\nThis week, in a forum dedicated to \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry, one user posted their reasoning for betting against one of retail's favorite stocks: Palantir Technologies.\n\nPalantir stock is down 17% year to date, though it is still up 83% in the last year. Laurence Bradingmunn (u/Gerbil12345) thinks there's no reason shares should be as high as they are.\n\nBradingmunn spoke to Business Insider about his bearish take on Palantir, noting that Burry's short position inspired him to bet against the stock. Like Burry, he sees the company as highly overvalued but also has concerns about the broader AI space.\n\n\"I'm going shoulder to shoulder with Michael Burry on his thesis that the AI bubble is about to burst—specifically focusing on Palantir's extreme overvaluation and how the AI bubble (Government) has managed to shoot their stock to the moon,\" Bradingmunn wrote.\n\nThe 20-year-old Bradingmunn doesn't work in finance, but he told Business Insider that he's been following Burry for years. And while he isn't technically shorting Palantir but buying put options against it with strike prices in 2027 and 2028, similar to Burry, he maintains that the stock is pointed down.\n\nBradingmunn provided further context on the stock, laying out why he finds Palantir's $350 billion market cap concerning. He compared it to several other prominent tech stocks that he thinks Wall Street is valuing much more realistically.\n\n\"If you compare it to the companies with similar market caps, like AMD, Salesforce, Adobe, and you look at their actual profits, it's a stark contrast,\" he said. \"I don't believe [Palantir] can grow quick enough to meet the current valuation.\"\n\nThe retail trader said that he found it unusually difficult to learn what Palantir actually does to make money, another factor that's fed his bearish thesis. However, he added that he's equally concerned by Palantir's status as a stock highly dedicated cult following.\n\nPalantir stock is a well known favorite among retail investors, who have shown a deep admiration for CEO Alex Karp. Yet Bradingmunn speculated that many retail traders aren't taking time to assess the company's fundamentals.\n\n\"It can be very easy to follow someone's Reddit post talking about how great a stock is, and just fall for that,\" he acknowledged. \"I'm trying to take a more constructive thesis and to try and look at the actual numbers of all these stocks and see how I can have a different side of the story.\"\n\nBradingmunn acknowledges that the company may benefit from lucrative defense contracts with the US government, but he also sees significant risk from the company's share dilution. As of late 2025, it had roughly 2.38 billion shares outstanding, a major spike from the 1 billion when it first listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nBradingmunn thinks investors should be concerned by this. \"I believe it should be worth about $50 per share.\" The stock closed on Friday at $146.59.",

    "fullText": "Every time the crypto market enters a dramatic phase, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is one of the first investors I turn to in order to understand the changing dynamics on the charts.\n\nWood is a veteran investor in the digital assets market. In fact, she claimed that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to gain Bitcoin (BTC) exposure in 2015.\n\nBitcoin hadn't reached even the $500 price mark in 2015, but it was a significant uptick since its launch in 2009. But Wood's pro-crypto move was met with sharp criticism.\n\nHowever, the confidence seems to have paid off over the years as Bitcoin kept hitting new highs. ARK Invest estimates the cryptocurrency's price will hit $1 million in 2030.\n\nWood also keeps buying shares of crypto companies such as:\n\nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.\n\nRobinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), an e-trading platform with crypto and tokenized stock offerings\n\nBlock (NYSE: SQ), Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin technology company\n\nBitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum (ETH) treasury company\n\nBullish (NYSE: BLSH), the crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel\n\nGiven Wood's deep expertise in crypto investments, it is worth understanding her perspective in the wake of Bitcoin's crash below $80,000 on Jan. 31.\n\nLorenzo Valente, ARK Invest's Director of Research, Digital Assets, recently shared an analysis in which he compared gold's market cap as a percentage of the U.S. M2 money supply.\n\nM2 is a broad measure of the U.S. money supply (cash, checking, savings, money market funds).\n\nAs per the analysis, gold's market cap is 170% of the entire U.S. money supply right now.\n\nThe figure is an all-time high (ATH); in fact, it is as high as it was in 1934 during the Great Depression and only slightly above the figure in 1980 when inflation peaked, the chart showed.\n\nIn simple words, gold is as expensive as it can be. Such peaks usually happen during periods of economic stress and dollar regime shift and often mark turning points, Valente said. For instance, gold crashed 60% after 1980.\n\nEven right now, it feels like a \"pivot moment\" and while nobody knows what happens next, those who know can make huge gains, he added.\n\nWhen ARK Invest shared its 2026 outlook on Jan. 15, the asset manager noted that the correlation between the Bitcoin and gold prices has been very low at 0.14 since early 2020.\n\nThis is exactly what Wood reiterated in response to Valente's X post. In simple terms, Bitcoin and gold usually don't move together on a daily or monthly basis.",

    "fullText": "Jan 28 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) are in talks to invest up to $60 billion in OpenAI, ​The Information reported on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia, an existing investor ‌whose chips power OpenAI's AI models, is in talks to invest up ‌to $30 billion, The Information said, citing a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\nMicrosoft, a longstanding backer, is in talks to invest less than $10 billion, the report said.

    "fullText": "Redwood Materials has landed Google as a new investor, capping an upsized funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage company at more than $6 billion.\n\nThe development underscores rising Big Tech interest in power infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nThe Nevada-based startup said Wednesday it completed the final close of its Series E financing, bringing the total raised to $425 million.\n\nThe round was increased from a previously announced $350 million amid strong investor demand. Google joined the final closing of the round alongside existing backers, including Capricorn and Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoogle's participation adds another tech giant to Redwood's cap table, following Nvidia's investment earlier in the round through its venture arm NVentures.\n\nThe growing interest reflects a bet that Redwood's energy storage business — which repurposes used electric-vehicle batteries to store power — could become critical infrastructure as electricity demand surges from AI, data centers, and broader electrification.\n\nFounded by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials originally built its business on recycling lithium-ion batteries and recovering key metals, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. More recently, it has expanded into grid-scale energy storage through a new unit called Redwood Energy, which uses second-life EV batteries to stabilize power supply and support energy-hungry data centers.\n\nThe company has argued that energy storage is no longer optional but essential as AI workloads strain existing grids. Redwood says the new capital will help it scale its energy storage platform while continuing to invest in recycling and critical minerals processing in the US.\n\nWith Google now on board, Redwood is positioning itself at the intersection of AI infrastructure, energy security, and domestic supply chains — a combination investors increasingly see as strategic as the power demands of the AI economy accelerate.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

Charlie Munger's didn't A few years before his death in late 2023, the Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman offered a brutally clear-eyed perspective on love, life, and investing—and managed to tie all three together in under 30 seconds.\n\nAt the 2017 Daily Journal shareholder meeting, Munger was asked about how Berkshire's investment strategy had shifted over the years. His answer, as usual, cut through the noise. \"We used to shoot fish in a barrel,\" he said. \"But it was so easy, we didn't want to shoot fish while they were moving, so we waited until they slowed down and then we shot them with a shotgun.\"\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nBut the good old days were long gone. Investing had changed. The edges were smaller. The bets were trickier. \"We're adapting reasonably to a business that's gotten much more difficult,\" Munger said. \"I don't think we have a cinch. I think we have the odds a little bit in our favor. We have to live on the advantages we can get.\"\n\nThen came the kicker: \"I used to say you have to marry the best person who will have you. I'm afraid that's a rule of life. You have to get by in life on the best advantage you can get.\"\n\nThat wasn't some offhand dating tip. It was Munger's entire worldview. Take what's available, what's real, what will actually have you—and make the most of it. Whether it's stocks, software, or spouses, perfection is a fantasy. Leverage is real.\n\nTrending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $250 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started.\n\nWarren Buffett, his longtime business partner and closest friend, has echoed similar themes in his own way. In the 2017 HBO documentary, \"Becoming Warren Buffett,\" he said his late wife Susie was one of the two defining moments of his life. \"What happened with me would not have happened without her,\" he said. \"She believed in me. She put me together. I would not only have turned out to be the person I turned out to be, but I would not have been as successful in business without that.\"\n\nThat same year, in a conversation with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Buffett reiterated the importance of choosing the right partner. \"You want to associate with people who are the kind of person you'd like to be,\" he said. \"And the most important person by far in that respect is your spouse.\"",

    "fullText": "Michel Burry says he's betting on the market's most famous meme stock.\n\nThe investor, best known for his role in Michael Lewis's financial crisis saga \"The Big Short,\" said on Monday that he's been buying shares of GameStop, one of the original and most famous meme stocks.\n\nBurry announced his position in a post on his Substack, Cassandra Unchained, on Monday. It sent shares of the video game retailer up as much as 6%.\n\nRather than betting on a new bout of meme-stock mania to send the stock higher, Burry said his investment is a long-term play. This isn't Burry's first time dabbling in the OG meme stock. In an earlier Substack post, he discussed his decision to offload his position in the company weeks before the short squeeze of 2021. In his follow-up on Monday, Burry revealed he owns GameStop again and has been buying shares recently and that he sees significant growth potential with Ryan Cohen as CEO.\n\n\"I expect I am buying at what may soon be 1x tangible book value / 1x net asset value,\" he said. \"And getting a young Ryan Cohen investing and deploying the company's capital and cash flows. Perhaps for the next 50 years.\"\n\nThat may sound like a long window for growth, particularly given GameStop's history as a meme stock that's often driven more by hype than fundamentals. Burry acknowledged that his bet may come across as unorthodox but backed it up with more analysis in his post.\n\n\"That is not a common occurrence in the U.S. stock market today,\" he wrote. \"With the downside protected by its tangible asset value, being long GameStop is almost as asymmetric as it gets these days in U.S. common stocks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burry said he sees solid potential for a turnaround under Cohen. The CEO and founder of online pet supply company Chewy is a popular figure among retail traders.\n\n\"I am not counting on a short squeeze to realize long-term value,\" Burry said.\n\n\"I believe in Ryan. I like the setup, the governance, the strategy as I see it. I am willing to hold long-term, and I am excited to see where this goes. I am fifteen years his senior, but not too old to be patient.\"\n\nBurry's bullishness spurred a jump in GameStop on Monday, though it didn't spill over to other meme stocks. Data from retail trading activity platform ApeWisdom shows that retail traders have been highly focused on GameStop since Burry announced his position, but other favorites like AMC and Koss haven't entered the spotlight.",

    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "title": "What Trump could do next to open up the housing market, according to famed real estate investor Grant Cardone",
    "description": "Real estate investor Grant Cardone said that talks with administration insiders hint at a few things Trump could do next to boost the market.",
    "fullText": "Grant Cardone thinks the Trump administration is gearing up to do more to stimulate the US housing market.\n\nThe longtime real estate investor says he's bullish on housing as the market enters a new year, even as home prices remain high and mortgage rates are elevated.\n\nCardone told Business Insider that he recently spoke with administration insiders about what he thinks can still be done to open up the market to more Americans.\n\nPresident Trump has made affordability a primary focus in 2026 ahead of the midterm elections. In his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, he discussed high housing costs as well as interest rates, stating that the goal of homeownership is out of reach for many Americans.\n\nTrump so far has focused on mortgage rates and housing availability, pitching plans to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac load up on mortgage bonds while also banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\nNext, Cardone thinks Trump could address issues in the tax code to make the market easier to navigate.\n\nHe predicts that the White House will adjust capital gains taxes for home sales to make it less prohibitive to sell a property that has appreciated in value.\n\nCurrently, homeowners can exclude $500,000 in capital gains for married filers or $250,000 for single filers when they sell their home. Cardone expects the caps to be raised, which would make the tax bill much less burdensome and potentially bring more homes to market.\n\nOther commentators have flagged this as a simple fix to the market that can be done with relative ease. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, said last year that the caps should be raised to $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe other potential change Trump could make would allow more people to invest in real estate.\n\n\"I think he's going to come out and say, 'hey, I want to extend that bonus depreciation that was approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA),\" Cardone said. \"He's going to extend it to single-family homes.\"\n\n\"Bonus depreciation\" is a mechanism that allows investors to deduct the cost of a property from their taxes. The landmark tax and spending bill signed into law last year allows investors to deduct 100% of qualifying investment properties immediately.\n\n\"When I buy these big assets, I get to write them off basically in year one,\" Cardone explained. \"And when you buy a single-family home, you write it off over 27 years, you get a tax loss spread over that period.\"\n\nCardone thinks this would be significant, as it has never been done in the US and could stimulate more housing market activity by extending buying power to those seeking income-producing properties.\n\nWhile Cardone said his predictions have been informed by talks with administration insiders, a spokesperson denied that any specific policy moves were under discussion.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to put an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Administration is constantly exploring new policy actions to do just that, \"White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Business Insider. \"Until policy announcements are officially made by the Administration, however, any reporting about potential action is pure speculation.\"",

    "description": "TikTok has closed a joint-venture deal for its US business, handing over some operational control to an investor group.",
    "fullText": "TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group.\n\n\"The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,\" the company said.\n\nAdam Presser is leading the new venture, according to the company's announcement. Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.\n\nTikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.\n\nWhile Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.\n\nThe company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.\n\nFollowing the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok.\"\n\nHe said the deal had reached a \"very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.\"\n\nThe deal has been in the works for a year. At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.\n\nSince then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.",

    "description": "Hedge fund founder George Noble says OpenAI is a warning for the wider AI boom. He says the \"low hanging fruit is gone\" as AI costs increase.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI has laid out some ambitious plans for 2026, but according to George Noble, the ChatGPT maker is a cautionary tale for the wider AI theme.\n\nThe hedge fund investor and former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund doesn't think the AI startup will be able to justify its lofty growth projections, but more than that, he thinks investors should avoid the AI trade and shift their focus to other areas of the market before the tide turns.\n\nThe hedge fund founder laid out his thesis on OpenAI's red flags in a detailed X post on Tuesday, highlighting the \"code red\" moment announced by CEO Sam Altman in December 2025.\n\nIn his view, it all comes down to financials, specifically a math problem that isn't being widely discussed. \n\n\"It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better,\" he said. \"The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.\"\n\nNoble thinks OpenAI's annual revenue has to reach $200 billion by 2030 in order for the company's projections to be justified.\n\nPointing to the broader market, he advised AI startup founders to exit their companies while the boom is still going, adding that he believes the AI hype cycle is nearing its peak. He thinks investors should shift their focus to other parts of the market, as both the AI trade and the Magnificent Seven will be impacted if OpenAI begins to struggle.\n\n\"If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming,\" he advised. \"The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.\"\n\nThe particular sector in this case is small-mid cap stocks, which is where Noble sees real value and growth potential. He added that there is a value disconnect between Big Tech stocks and their small-cap peers, which are trading at near-decade lows.\n\nFor that reason, Noble sees an opportunity for investors to move away from the most crowded stocks that carried the AI trade in 2025 and focus on the lesser-known value plays that have been quietly making progress while AI-linked names continue to dominate the headlines.\n\n\"Markets can price risk,\" he noted. \"But they can't price chaos.\nAnd OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.\"",

    "fullText": "Jeremy Grantham says AI is one of the biggest bubbles in history — and it's likely to tank the stock market when it bursts.\n\n\"I think it's obviously a bubble, and I think it's quite a simple story,\" the veteran investor and GMO cofounder said during the latest episode of the \"Merryn Talks Money\" podcast.\n\nGrantham compared AI to the railroad and the internet, two world-changing inventions marked by early investment bubbles which, when they popped, \"brought the economy to its knees for a year or two\" and \"everybody lost their money.\"\n\nContrary to common belief, \"bubbles don't occur when there's some crummy idea that gets touted,\" Grantham said. \"All the bubbles are associated with serious things, and the more serious, the bigger the bubble.\"\n\nGrantham emphasized the \"iron law\" that when an asset doubles in price, the return from holding it halves from that point forward.\n\n\"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward,\" he said. \"And it will happen this time. And my guess is after a while, sooner or later, the market will become a whole lot cheaper.\"\n\nGrantham, who had predicted an epic market crash four years ago, said the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2023 generated immense buzz around AI and sparked major capital outlays by companies, ultimately staving off an economic slump.\n\nThe market historian said that Big Tech companies have used their dominant market positions and influence to boost their profit margins to \"excessive levels,\" but that won't stop the bubble he sees from bursting.\n\nThe \"probabilities that AI will not bust are slim to none,\" he said. \"It meets every condition of the railroads and the Internet. It's a powerful idea that's attracted everybody's money.\"\n\n\"And so my guess is Nvidia will lead it down, and all the others will follow for a while, and then out of the ashes several of them will once again inherit the world,\" he said.\n\nGrantham also flagged institutional inertia and herd mentality as factors preventing the market from coming to its senses.\n\nPut differently, industry professionals aren't sounding the alarm on valuations out of fear that the bubble will keep growing and they'll underperform their rivals, hurt their reputations, and lose clients or even their jobs.\n\n\"They all look around nervously at each other, but they keep going,\" he said. \"As long as the music's playing, they're going to be dancing. Doesn't matter that they know the market is silly.\"\n\nGrantham is one of several high-profile investors, including Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame, who have warned AI stocks are overvalued and predicted a market downturn is coming.\n\nYet the US stock market has continued to march higher in spite of the skeptics, with the benchmark S&P 500 rising around 80% over the past five years.\n\n\"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed comparisons between the AI boom and dot-com bubble in interviews with Business Insider last fall.\n\nO'Leary said \"you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis,\" while Gerber said today's valuations are warranted as AI companies have enormous growth potential and their profitability is \"just insane.\"",

    "description": "Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio said at Davos that \"capital wars\" could be the result of deficits and trade wars.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio thinks the world could be on the verge of \"capital wars.\"\n\nThe billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder isn't shy about sounding the alarm on economic problems he sees brewing. At this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he says Donald Trump's aggressive policies could spark global financial conflict.\n\nThe president looms large over Davos this year, with his threatening rhetoric related to Greenland, which he says the US must control for security reasons.\n\nWhile Trump's latest comments are in focus, Dalio says they're just another part of a troubling trend that could shift the global financial order. Speaking with CNBC at the event, Dalio said the possibility of capital wars represents a threat with widespread ramifications for markets and the economy.\n\n\"On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio stated. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at US debt and so on.\"\n\nIn his view, trade conflicts such as the one playing out between the US and much of the rest of the world, don't actually resolve global imbalances. They do, however, put strong tensions on capital flows, as countries grapple with who is financing deficits and which nations are willing to hold certain assets. In particular, eroding trust in the US could make global investors less willing to lend to the country by buying Treasurys.\n\n\"We know that both the holders of US dollar-denominated debt…and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other,\" he said. \"If you have other countries who are holding it and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue.\"\n\nIf foreign demand slumps, he says the US may be forced to rely on internal measures to provide the funding it needs. This could lead to higher inflation or currency debasement, two factors that would likely reinforce concerns among foreign investors.\n\nDalio also reiterated his positive view of gold as a reserve asset in the event of capital wars. He said that in normal times, gold should account for between 5% and 15% of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n\"I have been clear for quite a while that I would tilt away from bronze, and I would be tilting toward gold, and have a greater than normal amount of that,\" he said.\n\nIn his 2025 market reflections, though, Dalio said that gold's strong price rally may be a warning for investors and urged caution on what the metal's big rally could mean for the economy in 2026.",

    "description": "Europe’s struggle to produce globally dominant companies is not a mystery—it is the predictable result of a weak and fragmented venture capital ecosystem. Despite an economy comparable in size to that of the United States, Europe invests only a fraction as much in venture-backed firms, and the gap is widening as capital concentrates around AI and other winner-take-all technologies. The consequences are visible in lower innovation, weaker returns for investors, and a steady outflow of entrepreneurial talent. But Europe’s venture deficit is not inevitable. While structural disadvantages exist, policy choices and investor behavior play a decisive role.",

Europe is no exception. In 2024, Mario Draghi, a former President of the European Central Bank and one-time Italian Prime Minister lamented in an influential report on European competitiveness that “no EU company with a market capitalization over EUR 100 billion…has been set up from scratch in the last fifty years, while all six U.S. companies with a valuation above EUR 1 trillion have been created in this period.”",

    "title": "'Big Short' investor Michael Burry has found an unlikely ally in his crusade against AI hype: Ben Affleck",
    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" said Ben Affleck was \"clearly a smart guy\" after he slammed AI chatbots and called out spending on data centers.",
    "fullText": "It rarely hurts to have Batman on your side. Michael Burry may have the next thing after Ben Affleck revealed he's also skeptical of the AI boom.\n\nThe Hollywood star, speaking on the latest episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, echoed the investor's skepticism of grand claims around AI and Big Tech's massive investments in the nascent tech.\n\n\"I think a lot of that rhetoric comes from people who are trying to justify valuations around companies, where they go: 'We're going to change everything in two years, there's going to be no more work,'\" Affleck said.\n\n\"Well, the reason they're saying that is because they need to ascribe a valuation for investment that can warrant the capex spend they're going to make on these data centers,\" he added.\n\nThe \"Justice League\" and \"Gone Girl\" actor said that historical adoption of new technologies has been \"slow\" and incremental.\"\n\nHe said that tech companies are trying to justify their huge outlays by promising they'll enable new AI models that will blow away existing ones — but in reality, each subsequent model is only moderately better and requires far more electricity and data to run.\n\n\"Ben Affleck is clearly a smart guy,\" Burry wrote in a weekend post on X. \"So this does not surprise me. It sounds familiar and on point.\"\n\nBen Affleck is clearly a smart guy. So this does not surprise me. It sounds familiar and on point. Delivered much better than I ever could. https://t.co/X1VvE9yX2N\n\nAffleck backed up Burry's critique of AI's value on the podcast. He said the writing of today's AI chatbots is \"really shitty\" and \"not reliable.\"\n\n\"I just can't stand to see what it writes,\" said Affleck, who cowrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for \"Good Will Hunting\" and directed, produced, and starred in Best Picture winner \"Argo.\"\n\nHe predicted that filmmakers would use AI as a tool to save time and money — similar to visual effects — but it probably won't \"write anything meaningful\" or make entire movies.\n\nAffleck said that most AI users are using chatbots as virtual companions, so \"there's no work, there's no productivity, there's no value to it.\"\n\nHe also cast doubt on the social value of people engaging with AI friends who are \"telling you that you're great and listening to everything you say and being sycophantic.\"\n\nBurry has struck a similar tone on AI in recent weeks. He's best known for his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short.\" Christian Bale, Affleck's predecessor as Batman, portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nAfter more than two years of virtual silence, Burry returned to X late last year with a flurry of warnings about a dangerous AI bubble. He also closed his hedge fund to outside cash, shifting his focus to writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nBurry's central thesis is that AI stocks are overvalued. He's said they're overinvesting in microchips and data centers that will quickly become outdated, to power a tech that will become commoditized and won't yield a return for them, paving the way for large writedowns and sharp stock declines in the future.\n\nHe recently posted on X that \"return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off.\"",

    "title": "Legendary investor Rob Arnott outlines the 2-part strategy that's helped his personal stock portfolio double the S&P 500 over 8 months",
    "description": "Rob Arnott's personal investment strategy takes advantage of a flaw in passive indexing  that his firm has also tried to capitalize on with a recent ETF.",
    "fullText": "Rob Arnott is revered in the investing world for his alternative passive index strategies, but when it comes to his own portfolio, the Research Affiliates founder likes to have a little fun playing the role of hedge-fund manager, too.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Arnott detailed a leveraged long-short strategy that has allowed him to double the returns of the S&P 500 over the last eight months. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of his personal brokerage account showing this strategy having produced a 36.67% return since mid-May. The S&P 500 has returned about 14% in that time.\n\nThe strategy comes from the idea behind the ETF Arnott launched in September: the RACWI US ETF (RAUS). The fund takes a fundamental approach to indexing, identifying companies with attractive qualities and valuations, and then weighting them by market capitalization.\n\nIt essentially seeks to correct what Arnott sees as flaws in passive indexes like the S&P 500, which add stocks following periods of outperformance, only to dump them when they've underperformed. RAUS has a 95% overlap with the S&P 500.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on this concept outside the index, Arnott had the idea to take long positions on the stocks that his index includes which the S&P 500 does not, and take short positions on stocks that the S&P 500 includes but his index does not. He then amplified those positions with leverage.\n\n\"One really fun strategy, and I wish this had occurred to me back in '21, is what if we go long our non-overlap holdings, strip out the whole 95% that's overlapped, just go long our 5% non overlap and let's short the S&P's 5% non overlap,\" Arnott said, referencing when Research Affiliates launched its Cap-Weighted Index, on which RAUS is based. \"Why stop there? Why not go 200% long and 200% short? I did that in my personal portfolio.\"\n\nArnott could not share the names of individual stocks in his portfolio for compliance reasons. However, in September, he listed Palantir (PLTR), DoorDash (DASH), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as examples of S&P 500 stocks not in RAUS. Examining a list of RAUS's holdings, a few examples of stocks held in RAUS that are not in the S&P 500 include Xerox (XRX), Zoom Communications (ZM), and Rivian Motors (RIVN).\n\n\"One of my colleagues likes to say, 'Suppose I come to you and I say I've got this great strategy: I'm going to buy stocks when they've just doubled and when they're trading at twice the market multiple, and I'm going to sell stocks when they've just fallen in half and are trading at half the market multiple. Why don't you invest with me?'\" Arnott said. \"Most people would listen to that and say that's stupid, but that's the way index funds trade.\"\n\nIn September, Arnott illustrated this inefficiency in passive index funds with Dillard's Department Store, a repeat constituent of the Russell 1000 index.\n\n\"In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times,\" Arnott said at the time. \"So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading.\"\n\n\"How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%,\" he continued. \"In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000.\"",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame relayed a Warren Buffett story to warn of wasteful tech spending, and took aim at Nvidia and Palantir again.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOwning a home might be the American dream, but Kevin O'Leary thinks too many people are rushing into a nightmare.\n\nIn a Facebook post shared alongside his Fox Business interview in November, the \"Shark Tank\" investor gave blunt advice to young adults debating whether to rent or buy. When asked outright which path to take, O'Leary didn't hesitate: \"Rent.\"\n\nHis reasoning? \"Start by renting until you start a family and keep it small, 1,500 feet or less if you've got the average salary of $70,000 annually,\" he wrote. \"Once you decide to have a child, you gotta expand a little bit, get that second bedroom and also have an office in the house. Then you buy a home.\"\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nIn the accompanying video, he doubled down, warning buyers not to jump into homeownership unless they plan to stay put for at least five years. \"The issue around a home, if you're gonna buy and go through expenses of buying it, paying all the commissions and all the taxes and everything else, you gotta be there for five years,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThat five-year rule is a common benchmark among financial experts. Closing costs, property taxes, realtor commissions, and interest-heavy mortgage payments make it difficult to build any real equity in the first few years. If you sell too soon, you may walk away with little to nothing—sometimes even a loss.\n\nO'Leary hinted at another reason for the wait: stability. \"There's a good chance you'll be there for five years, assuming the marriage lasts,\" he added dryly, suggesting that homeownership should follow—not precede—big life decisions like starting a family.\n\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nFor singles or couples still figuring it out, his advice is clear: rent something manageable, don't overextend, and keep your housing budget in line with your income. At a $70,000 salary, even modest homes can stretch affordability—especially with current mortgage rates hovering around 7%.\n\nInstead of viewing renting as \"throwing money away,\" O'Leary frames it as a strategic placeholder. It buys time, flexibility, and lets young adults figure out where they want to live long term, what kind of space they actually need, and whether buying makes sense in their city.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said Nvidia is \"simply the purest play\" for an investor to bet against the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "description": "“The dreaded mortgage rate ‘lock-in’ effect is fading,” said real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli.",
    "fullText": "During the pandemic-era housing market, homebuyers enjoyed sub-3% rates, ushering in a wave of homebuying among younger generations. But in the following few years, the American Dream came crashing down as mortgage rates and home prices rose, and inflation and wage stagnation set in.\n\nThat meant more homeowners in the U.S. had sub-3% mortgage rates compared with today’s 6%-range rates, creating a lock-in effect in which current homeowners refused to let go of their low mortgage rates and sell their homes only to turn around and face a much higher mortgage rate.\n\nBut now there’s a crack in the lock-in effect: Real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli recently said that as of the end of 2025, there are actually now more homeowners with mortgage rates higher than 6% than borrowers locked into sub-3% rates, ending one of the most generous eras for home financing in modern history.\n\n“Something big just happened in the U.S. Housing Market,” Gerli wrote in a Jan. 3 X post, referring to the change in share of homeowners with sub-3% mortgage rates. That means the “the dreaded Mortgage Rate ‘Lock-In’ Effect is fading.”\n\nDuring the lock-in effect period, millions of existing homeowners with ultra-low rates have been financially disincentivized to move or “trade up,” i.e., buy a more expensive or larger home, which made the number of homes for sale scarce for would-be homebuyers. This led to younger-generation bidding wars for a limited pool of starter homes and kept many locked out of the market. In fact, the average first-time homebuyer age skyrocketed to 40 in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors, and the share of first-time home buyers plummeted to a record low of 21%.\n\n“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research, said in a statement. “The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007—right before the Great Recession.”\n\nBut that all could change, Gerli said, since fewer homeowners have the attractive sub-3% mortgage rate.\n\n“Since more existing owners have a higher rate, that means more have a payment and rate closer to ‘market,’” he explained, “which means there will be more incentive to sell – which is actually good news.” Gerli analyzed Q3 2025 data from Fannie Mae’s mortgage database .\n\nGerli’s analysis shows the share of mortgages with rates of 6% or higher has surged from about 7% in 2022 to roughly 20% by late 2025, overtaking the once‑dominant pool of pandemic‑era borrowers with sub-3 % rates. Those pandemic-era loans peaked at nearly 25% of all outstanding loans in 2021, the analysis shows, but that share has been steadily shrinking as new buyers take out higher‑cost loans and older-generation buyers move or refinance.​",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

Follow MrBeast's playbook and embrace your peers instead of seeing them purely as rivals, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley said.\n\nGurley, who is best known for his early investments in Uber, Zillow, and Grubhub, told \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" that success in any field requires being knowledgeable about it and going to its physical epicenter, such as a city where the action happens.\n\nHowever, he added in the episode, published in December, that virtual relationships with peers and mentors can also be valuable, and gave the example of MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, the most-followed YouTuber with 459 million subscribers.\n\n\"I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers, because they think they're climbing the ladder and they've got to beat these people, and the world's just way too prosperous to have that mindset,\" he said, adding: \"You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that.\"\n\nGurley said that Donaldson was \"infatuated\" with YouTube early on and would have long Skype meetings with others who shared his passion, exchanging best practices for social media success. Gurley said he first heard Donaldson share the story on a podcast, but had also spoken to him about it.\n\nGurley said Donaldson's story exemplified the importance of embracing peers, which is one of the six principles mentioned in his upcoming book on success, \"Runnin' Down a Dream.\"\n\nDonaldson shared the story on a 2022 episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" where he said that after graduating from high school, he'd talk daily on Skype with a group of four small YouTubers, sometimes from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m.\n\n\"We basically talked every day for a thousand days in a row, and did nothing but hyperstudy what makes a good video, what makes a good thumbnail, what's good pacing, how to go viral,\" he said.",

Vice-chair Greg Abel took over the top job as of Jan. 1, 2026 while Buffett will remain as chairman.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

One of his most famous rules is to buy and hold for as long as possible.\n\n“You’ve got to be prepared when you buy a stock to have it go down 50% or more, and be comfortable with it … but some people are not really careful,” Buffett said during Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 annual shareholder meeting (3).\n\n“Some people are more subject to fear than others.”\n\nHere’s how to fight the fear and build a better future.\n\nMarket volatility isn’t exactly a foreign concept for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett began investing when he was 11, back in 1942. Having lived through several recessions, Buffett has, time and again, shrugged off short-term market volatility.\n\n“Over the long term, the stock market news will be good,” Buffett wrote in an Op-Ed for the NY Times in 2008 (4).\n\n“In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president.

It's common practice in the industry to turn to proxy advisory firms for data collection, advice, and voting recommendations.\n\nThe practice has come under fire from the Trump administration, which signed an executive order in December calling for increased oversight of the proxy advisor industry.\n\n\"Proxy advisors regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,\" the executive order said.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, were two proxy advisory firms previously used by JPMorgan and named in the Trump administration's December executive order.\n\nA spokesperson for ISS declined to comment on the news of JP Morgan cutting ties with proxy advisory firms.

Glass Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe move away from proxy firms reinforced JPMorgan's \"unwavering commitment to vote solely in clients' best interests, using our information advantage,\" the bank said in the memo.\n\nIn place of external human advisors, the asset and wealth management unit is launching an in-house AI platform, called Proxy IQ, to support shareholder decisions, according to the memo.\n\n\"Proxy IQ extends the high bar of independent analysis that our portfolio managers, research analysts and stewardship teams have always applied to every vote, using that same in-house expertise to cover all aspects of the voting process, including data and research selection, down to the smallest detail,\" JPMorgan said in the memo.\n\nThe tool will be able to aggregate and analyze proprietary data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings, it said.\n\nJPMorgan has a technology budget of $18 billion, and CEO Jamie Dimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race.",

    "fullText": "Exeter chief executive Tony Rowe hopes a new investor will be in place this year after the company that controls the Chiefs posted more than £10m in losses.\n\nExeter Rugby Group made an after-tax loss of £10.3m last season as the Chiefs finished a club-worst ninth in the top flight.\n\nThe company, which is also responsible for the conferencing business at Sandy Park, was forced to write off a loan of £6.2m, which contributed significantly to the losses.\n\nThe loan was associated with the hotel on the Sandy Park site that Rowe bought off the club in December 2022 to help repay some of the club's Covid-19 related debts - Exeter still owes a number of loans taken out during the pandemic when rugby matches were played behind closed doors.\n\nWithout the loan write-off Exeter's pre-tax losses were just over £3m, a rise of more than £2.5m on the previous year.\n\nTurnover dropped by around £1.5m while wages across the group went up by £1.4m.\n\nWhile Sandy Park's income through conferences and events was steady from the previous year at just over £2.5m, the rugby side of the business saw income drop by more than £1.5m as poor results on the field caused a fall in crowd numbers.\n\n\"I have no doubt that within the next two to three years you will find us back right at the top knocking on the door for Twickenham and wherever the European Championship final will be,\" Rowe told BBC Radio Devon.\n\n\"We're in a good place. It's taken a couple of years to get us back there, but if somebody's going to come along and wants to invest then they need to have an upside and I believe we have a lot of upside at Exeter.\"",

    "description": "Shareholders voted down a takeover bid for Core Scientific late last year because it wasn't rich enough. Here's why they think the bet will pay off.",
    "fullText": "The investment manager who helped scuttle one of the biggest data center acquisitions of 2025 believes that his bet against the multibillion-dollar buyout is about to pay off in the new year.\n\nTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of the Memphis-based investment firm Gullane Capital Partners, believes that Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, is on the cusp of large new customer deals that will boost its value.\n\n\"I think over the next 90 days, you'll see them announce greater than a hundred megawatts of deals,\" Miller said. \"It would show that there was a lot more value to be tapped there than we were getting paid for under the CoreWeave deal.\"\n\nIn October, Miller, a major shareholder in Core Scientific, opposed an offer by the artificial intelligence cloud firm CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that he felt undervalued the company. The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal's weakened economics.\n\nMiller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company's management. He projected that the company will find takers for a total of roughly 400 megawatts this year, citing strong demand for AI computing power.\n\nAsked about the potential for upcoming leasing, a spokeswoman for Core Scientific said the company \"does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\n\nThe commitments, if they materialize, would show that data center developers with a runway for growth are increasingly valuable in an energy-constrained building boom.\n\nCore Scientific has disclosed that it has about 1 gigawatt of data center capacity and another 1.5 gigawatts of power for expansion, according to an October investor presentation.\n\nIt would also offer a competing view that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, computer chips, and power infrastructure are in support of a durable AI boom, not a bubble.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we're likely to be systematically short compute —where the demand for compute will outstrip the supply,\" Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley's global head of thematic research and sustainability research, said.\n\nIn a report published in December, Morgan Stanley suggested that one of the most significant hurdles for the AI industry will be the gargantuan loads of power required to drive its computing.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that data centers, the vast facilities that handle the training for large language AI models and the inference computations that put them to work in everyday applications, face a 47 gigawatt shortfall of electricity from the grid nationally by 2028 — a gap almost 10 times the size of New York City's energy footprint on an average day.\n\nAmong the chief beneficiaries are crypto mining firms that have access to in-place power and utility contracts to light up new facilities quickly.\n\nBoth Core Scientific and CoreWeave were former crypto mining companies before repurposing their businesses to focus on AI in recent years.\n\nAmid the mounting shortage of power — along with headwinds in the crypto mining business — more of the industry is turning to data center computing.\n\nByrd said Morgan Stanley anticipates that about 12 gigawatts of mining facilities, about 60% the mining industry's current gigawattage, will convert over to AI and high-performance computing in the next three years.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining announced it would build a data center in Colorado City, Texas, with 168 megawatts of computing capacity that will be leased to the AI cloud company, Fluidstack. Cipher's stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.\n\nIren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.\n\n\"Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,\" Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.\n\nIn July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave's shares declined and Core Scientific's rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave's offer.\n\nSince the deal's collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share — less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.\n\nGolding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company's stock in October, more than double its current market price — upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is \"based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,\" Golding said.\n\nCoreWeave is Core Scientific's only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.\n\nMiller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.\n\n\"I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,\" Miller said.",

    "title": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio says gold's rapid rally is a warning for markets and the economy",
    "description": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgwater Associates, says the blistering rally in gold last year is a reflection of precarious macro developments.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio spent 2025 expressing fear and urging caution, and he's remaining cautious as the US economy enters a new year.\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates sounded alarms throughout 2025 over what he sees as a budding global debt crisis and the waning value of fiat currency.\n\nThe surge in gold last year—the biggest gain for the metal since 1979—contains a warning for investors, specifically as it relates to the depreciating value of fiat money, Dalio said in a post on Monday.\n\nA potent cocktail of central bank buying, geopolitical worries, and appetite from individuals pushed gold to records all year, but Dalio argues that the gold rally is mainly a result of fiat money losing real value. In his view, that was the biggest story in markets in 2025.\n\n\"The best major investment of the year was long gold (returning 65% in dollar terms), which outperformed the S&P index (which returned 18% in dollars) by 47%,\" he said. \"Or, said differently, the S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms.\"\n\nDalio urged investors to consider a few key factors when evaluating the forces that drove markets in 2025. Specifically, he highlighted that examining investment through calculations made in a depreciating currency can be misleading, as it can make returns appear stronger than they actually were.\n\nFrom Dalio's perspective, the stock market's 2025 performance varied greatly based on the measuring stick.\n\n\"When one's own currency goes down, it makes it look like the things measured in it went up,\" he said. \"In this case, the S&P returned 18% for a dollar-based investor, 17% for a yen-based investor, 13% for a renminbi-based investor, only 4% for a euro-based investor, only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor, and, for a gold-based investor, it returned -28%.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the economic benefits of a weakening US dollar, attempting to frame it as beneficial for US exports. But economic think tanks such as the Cato Institute have argued against this perspective, claiming that it ignores negative spillover effects for US consumers.\n\nDalio seems to share that mindset, noting that a weaker currency tends to lower the cost of a nation's exported goods for international buyers while increasing the price of domestic imports.\n\n\"When one's currency goes down, it reduces one's wealth and one's buying power, it makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies, and it makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency.\"\n\nIn his view, rising gold prices reflect a weakening economy and a national currency that is decreasing in value. For that reason, Dalio sees the continued strength of the so-called debasement trade as a warning for the US.\n\nThe stock market's big bull run in recent years might also be making it easier for investors to disregard other warning signals flashing in the economy. Dalio emphasized that the gold rally is a reason to reassess the macro picture and take a more cautious position.\n\nThe billionaire investor added that stocks and gold benefited from monetary policy easing in 2025, but as both assets are no longer cheap, they're at risk of a pullback if conditions shift again.\n\n\"Whether or not you are currency hedged matters a lot,\" Dalio said. \"You should always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if you think you are capable of making them well.\"",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says the US raid on Venezuela is a much bigger deal than the markets' muted reaction suggests.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, published a post early Monday saying the \"game just changed\" in the mid to long term, and \"markets are not pricing in all that may come of this weekend's events.\"\n\n\"This is a paradigm shift despite the markets yawning,\" he later wrote on X.\n\nBenchmark oil prices climbed less than 1% on Monday, and US stock futures opened higher, after the US captured President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and President Trump said America would \"run\" the oil-rich country for the time being.\n\nThe seizure was a \"shot across China's bow,\" Burry wrote, pointing to billions of dollars in loans that China has made to Venezuela under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which were collateralized using future oil output that is \"now in US hands.\"\n\nThe investor, who shot to fame after his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" wrote that China may now have a \"blueprint\" for how to take control of Taiwan, but \"must be in awe of Trumpian America's infuriating gall and decisive power.\"\n\nBurry said that China stocks strike him as \"somewhat riskier\" now in terms of running afoul of sanctions. He wrote that Alibaba, Baidu, and other potential sanction targets \"could be in for some volatility\" if China escalates its aggression in the South China Sea or targets Taiwan.\n\nThe contrarian bargain hunter also wrote that \"Putin's jaw has to be on the floor\" after the US did in \"practically seconds\" what Russia has been trying to do in Ukraine for three years.\n\nHe added that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid to long term, as tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nBurry also suggested that Canada and Mexico could \"lose a good amount of leverage\" in trade with the US if American refineries switch out Canadian crude for Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe veteran investor also said US oil-services companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes \"should benefit significantly\" as US contractors will be tasked with fixing and modernizing Venezuela's pipelines and refineries.\n\nBurry also forecast a \"long term tailwind\" for the US as inflows of Venezuelan oil will mean gas, diesel, and jet fuel prices will drop. He said that could push down prices to the benefit of consumers, especially lower-income ones, cut supply chain costs, and ease some uncertainty about the future for business owners.",

    "fullText": "The S&P 500 advanced 16% in 2025, notching double-digit gains for the third straight year.\n\nFederal Reserve research suggests President Trump's tariffs will slow economic growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at the most expensive valuation since the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) added 16% in 2025, marking the third consecutive year in which the benchmark index has recorded double-digit gains. Unfortunately, investors have reason to think 2026 will more challenging. Evidence suggests President Trump's tariffs are hurting the economy, and the stock market just flashed a warning last seen during the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nIn 2025, President Donald Trump broke with decades of trade-policy precedent and imposed sweeping tariffs that raised the average tax on U.S. imports to 16.8%, the highest level since 1935, per the Budget Lab at Yale. And Trump -- who once called tariffs \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary -- has made many misleading or inaccurate statements to drum up support for his signature trade policies.\n\nTrump said foreign exporters would absorb the tariffs for the \"privilege of access\" to the American market. However, Goldman Sachs says U.S. companies and consumers collectively paid 82% of the tariffs in October 2025, and 67% of the burden will fall on consumers alone by July 2026.\n\nTrump said tariffs would bring manufacturing work back to America. However, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) says U.S. manufacturing activity has now contracted in nine consecutive months due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs.\n\nTrump said tariffs would protect American workers and create millions of jobs. However, unemployment is at a four-year high and (excluding the pandemic) hiring slowed more profoundly in 2025 than any other year since the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump said tariffs would make America wealthy again and people would be \"very happy\" with the result. However, consumer sentiment in 2025 recorded its lowest annual average since the University of Michigan started collecting data in 1960.\n\nImportantly, U.S. GDP increased an annual 4.3% during the third quarter, the most robust growth in two years. President Trump credited tariffs for the booming economy. However, GDP growth was artificially high because imports (which are subtracted from GDP) were artificially low. Why were imports low? Companies stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs earlier this year.",

If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity.

    "description": "Stone Ridge 2025 Investor Letter from Ross Stevens, Founder and CEO",
    "fullText": "“Every driver has a limit.  Mine is a little bit further than others.”\n\n— Ayrton Senna, greatest Formula One driver of all time\n‍\n\n“I’m not funny.  What I am is brave.”\n\n— Lucille Ball, greatest female comedian of all time\n‍\n\n“I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.”\n\n“I can outlearn you.  \nI can outread you.  \nI can outthink you.  \nAnd I can outphilosophize you.”\n\n— Robert De Niro as Max Cady, Cape Fear‍\n‍\n\n“I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.”\n\n— Michael Scott, The Office, on how Bayesians form priors\n‍\n\nThe greatest treasure hunters know that the treasure they seek is not lost. It is waiting.\n\nStarting in 1969 and for 5,954 straight days, treasure hunter Mel Fisher sought what was waiting for him: the wreckage of the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, a Spanish galleon that sunk in 1622.\n\nHow do you recruit, retain, and motivate a crew when you are not sure when you will find the treasure, if you will find the treasure, or what the treasure will be worth? Fisher developed a powerful operating philosophy, captured in its entirety with three amazing words.\n\nEvery morning, for 16 years, Mel Fisher banged pots and pans in the pre-sunrise to rouse his crew, shouting and smiling, “Today’s the day, men. Today’s the day.”\n\nEventually it was true. On July 20, 1985, Mel and his crew discovered the most valuable shipwreck in history, 70 miles off the coast of Key West. The Atocha yielded gold and silver today worth more than $10 billion.\n\nFisher’s “today’s the day” philosophy reframed what could have otherwise been a mentally tortuous journey – will we ever find the treasure? Is it even here? – into daily play characterized by disciplined guessing, dispassionate refinement, and the singular goal of ending the day less wrong.\n\nFisher had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, as we will see, his operating philosophy, and its daily ritual of iteration, was textbook Bayesian. Fisher also settled – for me – a foundationally important debate I had struggled with about the philosophy of probability theory which, in turn, provided me with an operating manual for leadership.\n\nArriving at the University of Chicago’s Ph.D. program in 1991, I, like Fisher, had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, exposure the first day of my first class turned into a wandering, wondering, and still unabated obsession. I left the program five years later with a Ph.D. in Bayesian statistics (and finance), and my career has essentially been a three-decade extension of what I learned at Chicago. I now do Bayesian treasure hunting for a living.\n\nFancy math aside, the foundational idea of Bayesian statistics is simply learning from experience. Things get started with a “prior distribution”, which is what you think you know about what you want to know – for example, “Where is the treasure?” That “prior” is mixed with observable data – experience – to form a “posterior distribution”, a structured mashup of your prior and the data you collected.  The posterior represents your new view of what you want to know – for example, “I now know the treasure is not over there.”i\n\nThe power of Bayesian statistics is in the trade-off inherent in the framework. How much do you listen to your pre-wisdom intuition before it is enhanced by the data you collect, knowing your pre-data knowledge is limited, at best? How much do you listen to your new data, especially if it contradicts your pre-data intuition, knowing your limited sample may not lead you closer to the treasure, and might even throw you off the trail?\n\nWhen done with mastery, Bayesian statistics is a beautiful, egoless, daily practice of being less wrong.\n\nIn hindsight, every incoming University of Chicago Ph.D. student in 1991 – our collaborative little group of intellectually hungry sponges – was susceptible to becoming a Bayesian. Arnold Zellner, a giant in the history of Bayesian econometrics, towered, gently, over the business school’s statistics department, having just been named President of the American Statistical Association and – to me – a hilarious, wonderful, deeply caring professor. And though my own research was – and still is – focused on empirical asset pricing, my six-man dissertation committee ended up including four Bayesian statisticians, each a legend in the field.\n\nI recall as if it were yesterday my dissertation co-chairman Rob McCulloch teaching me that the Bayesian-required question “how do we set our priors?” illuminated a philosophical debate, still raging, about probability theory because that simple question is akin to asking, “What can we know prior to knowing?” I thought about that deeply for years.\n\nStudying Fisher, and treasure hunting, I now know that the answer is, often, a lot.\n\n“What’s an expert anyway? Just some guy from out of town.”\n\nConsider that Fisher knew to search off the coast of Florida and not, say, Australia. How? During his pre-search research at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Fisher discovered a faded 1622 salvage account describing the treasure fleet’s loss and references to survivors setting up camp in Cayos del Marques, or Key Largo today. So, Fisher’s prior variance was very large to start – search the Florida Keys – but not practically infinite – search all 140 million square miles of water on the surface of the planet.ii\n\nKnowing roughly where the Atocha sank and roughly the seasonal path of the current – that is, knowing prior to knowing before collecting any data from the sea – Fisher literally, and massively, shrunk the problem. Bayesian shrinkage, a foundational element of Bayesian statistics, involves pulling in especially noisy estimates – say, all oceans on Earth – closer to a central value – say, water off the coast of Florida. My dissertation – which applied new computational techniques in Bayesian shrinkage to old problems in finance – helped me see Fisher as a Bayesian.\n\nEvery day, Fisher, like any good Bayesian, updated his prior guess of where the Atocha was with data about where it definitely was not. Every day Fisher became a little less wrong.\n\nIn finding the Atocha in 16 years – and not 60, or never – Fisher adhered to Bayesian-adjacent principles that Alec Litowitz, founder of Magnetar Capital, and my former boss and mentor, writes about in his forthcoming and fascinating field guide for success, The Adaptability Quotient: Rewiring Your Mind for Success in the Next Human Era:\n\n“Confirmation bias is the worst enemy of iteration.  In a Bayesian system, it’s fatal. If you only accept the data that supports your hypothesis, you’re not updating – you’re entrenching. The people who learn fastest are the ones who are most willing to be wrong…with the humility to trade conviction for information, one update at a time.”\n\nFisher let the data speak and learned fast. In 1973, he found silver bars and coins matching the Atocha’s manifest.  Less wrong. Two years later, he discovered bronze cannons with Atocha markings. Even less wrong. Ten years after that, the motherlode. Absolutely right.\n\nAs students of the great Chicago Bayesians, we at Stone Ridge seek continual improvement in the speed of unbiased iterations. We are trained to privately ask ourselves, “Was I less wrong today?” Our progress depends on our eruptions of good questions, and truly listening to the answers. We would rather look dumb by asking, than not ask and be dumb. People forget if you looked dumb. They do not if you are.\n\nAs students of the great Bayesian Fisher, we at Stone Ridge know that success is not always linked to intelligence, boldness, or experience, but does consistently follow those most adaptive. In Litowitz-speak, it is not just IQ or EQ that matters, but AQ – adaptability quotient – a way of thinking that prioritizes learning over being right, and structure over rigidity. When the terrain shifts, do you update or insist?\n\nUpdating our prior – Chicago – with our data – Fisher – allows us to graduate with an extraordinarily valuable posterior because it contains X-marks-the-spot wisdom: markets overpay for stories of the future and underpay for hidden treasures of the past. That single Chicago-Fisherian insight caused us to make $3 billion in uncorrelated trading profits this year and $10 billion the last three. To see how, let’s go Bayesian treasure hunting and discover what awaits us buried in old reinsurance balance sheets and ancient Arkansas rock.\n\nIn 2023, amidst intense diligence for what ultimately became a $3 billion purchase of PDPsiii  in Arkansas’ Fayetteville Shale, we noticed that of the 860,000 acres included in the deal, 800,000 were covered with PDPs and 60,000 – all adjacent – were covered with grass. That’s a lot of undeveloped land.\n\n“Why are there no drilling rigs here?”\n\nWe decided to park our one major unanswered diligence question for the sake of efficiency, once convinced our PDP-only purchase could deliver our target returns.\n\nTwo years later, after taking over operations of the 5,596 wells we purchased – and our internally reframed responsibility of powering the homes of four million American families – the question resurfaced. “Why are there no rigs here?”\n\nThis time we could not shake it.\n\nWe learned that no one had drilled anything new for almost a decade, odd for a basin that size. A little stitious, we wondered, “Does treasure await?”\n\nWe suspected the previous owner’s “denominator problem” could explain their lack of drilling. They were an enormous company. Any marginal improvements in Fayetteville, despite being potentially large in dollar terms, would likely not move the needle in ROE, their north star.  In contrast, Stone Ridge operates every day with a “no basis point left behind” mindset. One basis point is our north star.  And, to us, large dollars will always be large dollars.\n\nWe also learned that two important aspects of drilling changed in the past decade: technologyiv and cost. Completion – the act of getting a drilled well to the point that gas steadily comes out of the ground for commercial purposes – now benefits from better drills, smarter rigs, more powerful fleets, and advanced digital control systems. And following a version of Moore’s Law, the new and better technology continually costs a lot less.\n\nWe decided to run a tightly controlled test program on our undeveloped land, drilling new wells, seeking fast, unbiased iterations, and updating – and hopefully tightening – the variance of our Bayesian prior – every day. Was there untapped gas under our 60,000 acres of grass? If so, where? If so, how much?\n\nOur approach was surgical. Two pads, five wells, disciplined design, unbiased data analysis, and adherence to the following mathematical identity.\n\nDrilling for natural gas ≡ searching for buried treasure in ancient rock\n\nThough we did not shout “today’s the day” every morning during our Fayetteville testing, we did feel Fisher-like energy as our ignorance shrank. Less wrong. Even less wrong. Absolutely right.\n\nEureka!  We found Fisher-like treasure.\n\nComposed of oil and gas, not gold and silver, our no-less-precious motherlode means that the $10 billion lifetime revenue we originally expected in Fayetteville now looks more like $15 billion. Discovering half an Atocha caused us to immediately shrink our priors in all seven U.S. basins we operate, a technical Bayesian statistical concept called “borrowing strength.” Our philosophy of probability theory, concretely applied to our Fayetteville test results, allowed us – with powerful practical efficiency – to know without knowing in the not-yet-tested basins. Less wrong.\n\nWe are now in the process of learning as much as is known about drilling before tapping our AQ to push the limit “a little further than others” and get closer to what is knowable. Every day counts because there’s gold oil and gas in them thar hills. It is waiting.\n\n“It may seem difficult at first, but all things are difficult at first.”\n\n— Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings\n\nIn launching our energy franchise almost five years ago, we assumed our breakthroughs in proprietary financing and hedging technology – and the resulting material edge in our cost of funds – were sufficient conditions for best-in-class investment performance. We quickly and painfully learned, however, that financial sophistication cannot substitute for industrial control. In energy markets, physics – not finance – sets the tuition entrepreneurs must pay.\n\nA bit chastened, we updated our prior and then – fortuitously – met Flywheel Energy, by far the best operators in the industry, due in part to their entire executive team’s roots in elite military operations. Flywheel is now part of Stone Ridge.\n\nUnder Flywheel’s peerless leadership, and an unbeatable team of 794 superstars – including 569 in the field – we now operate our wells ourselves. With every colleague crisply aligned on, and unambiguously individually responsible for their specific part, maximizing a singular metric – total dollars of operating profit – physics and finance are now in sync. Industry-leading results have followed.\n\nSince inception, Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) has purchased almost $11 billion of energy assets, all via proprietary securitizations – no bankers, no information leakage, no fee leakage. Over that period, spot natural gas has traveled in a staggeringly wide and volatile range of $1.50/MMBtu to almost $9/MMBtu. Yet, across thirteen equity tranches, the integrated precision of Flywheel physics + Stone Ridge finance has produced >20%/year, with low volatility, and no correlation to anything.v\n\n“Never was a finer canvas presented to work on than our countrymen. All of them engaged in the pursuits of honest industry, independent in their circumstances, enlightened as to their rights, and firm in their habits of order.”\n\n— Thomas Jefferson in a letter to James Madison, 1796\n\nThe U.S. shale revolution required three actors, working in concert. First, unlimited underground supply of hydrocarbons. Second, technological breakthroughs to access it. Third, profit-seeking capital. Leveraging nature for the first part, SRE brings fresh thinking to the rest.\n\nPlay the tape forward five years and I do not see SRE as a larger version of what we are today. I see a different kind of company. SRE has a chance to matter in the same practical, civic way that a major rail line or a modern port matters. I would like us to.\n\nAt our pace of disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and unrelenting process improvement, SRE will be a top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons. Managing that level of capital and molecule movement at our extraordinary level of operational excellence would meaningfully impact U.S. families, U.S. factories, and the competitiveness of this country. I would like us to.\n\nMore than 99% of the capital we manage at Stone Ridge, including SRE, comes from American investors. At our scale, that cannot happen by accident. At Stone Ridge, American capital produces American treasure.\n\nOn average and over time, treasure hunting in the sea is not a good business. Availability bias blinds us to the fact that for every Mel Fisher, dozens of others strike out. In fact, any too narrowly defined business is not a good business over a long enough time horizon.  Meta and abstract? No, Bayesian and practical. When the terrain shifts and you insist, your business surface area too is limited even for efficient Bayesian updating to help. In Litowitz-speak, your confirmation bias is fatal. It is just a matter of time.\n\nConsider legacy reinsurance. In contrast to prospective quota shares – aligned, partnership trades in which Stone Ridge shares risk pro rata with leading reinsurers, tapping into their masterful Bayesian updating cycle management skills across dozens of lines of business – legacy trades transfer retrospective risk from (re)insurance policies written years or decades ago.\n\nThe performance of legacy-only reinsurers is like that of lenders to too narrowly defined monoline credit originators (think: “only sub-prime auto” or “only UK small business”). Victims of confirmation bias’s siren song, monolines always – yes, always – originate unprofitable loans at the wrong time in the cycle.\n\nHealth warning: beware lending to monolines. When tight spreads persist, they insist.\n\nHealth warning: beware investing in legacy-only reinsurers. Confirmation bias dooms the business model and, along the way, guillotine-level adverse selection hangs over every trade. When a one-off risk-transfer price is highly attractive for clear and imperative strategic reasons, hyper-selective, non-legacy-only investors can profitably escape with their heads, but at Stone Ridge we know half-priced sushi does not mean it’s a bargain.\n\nA decade ago, there were about a dozen dedicated legacy firms and funds. Today, one large player remains, though recently its credibility detonated after initiating litigation against a client. The other remaining legacy-only firms are subscale or regionally focused. Enter Longtail Re.\n\nHumble beginnings, a clear vision\n\nStone Ridge began Longtail Re in 2020 focused on two simple ideas: 1) partner, not compete with the world’s best underwriters to generate a portfolio of hyper-diversified casualty liabilities that deliver low-cost float, and 2) invest that float in proprietary and valuable Stone Ridge-generated fixed income assets with superior risk-adjusted expected return.\n\nAlways open to Bayesian updating of its prior distribution core business model of prospective quota shares, Longtail Re’s positioning has always been: be available for new data and a reshaped posterior legacy transactions from motivated parties we know well and who call us, but do not be in the legacy business.\n\nOut of almost 100 legacy trade requests since inception, Longtail has written…three. Three.\n\nLongtail executed one of those three in November, a record $1.4 billion retrospective reinsurance transaction with Everest Group, an S&P 500 company, with whom Stone Ridge has an excellent, 13-year, uninterrupted trading relationship. Everest had compelling corporate reasons to de-risk, and the transaction with us, albeit enormous in the legacy space, was only one part of an even larger clear and imperative strategic repositioning of their entire firm. And of non-negotiable importance to us, we know (for many years), like, and trust Everest’s new CEO.\n\nThe trade has an outstanding expected return profile and diversifies Longtail’s core prospective portfolio because it covers past underwriting years back to 2003. It was also the largest legacy trade of Longtail CEO Mike Sapnar’s career, and mine.\n\nOn their most recent earnings call, Everest’s CEO said, “I was really, really glad that we were able to do this transaction with Longtail Re and Mike Sapnar...those are super credible underwriters. They did an excellent job evaluating the portfolio…it got to economics that will be very, very good for Longtail Re.” We agree.\n\nAs only Bayesian treasure hunting reinsurance geeks can, we internally renamed the core trade of the legacy reinsurance industry – a Loss Portfolio Transfer or LPT – to WPT. Waiting Portfolio Treasure.  Recall I said geeks. And who wants losses?\n\nLongtail ends 2025 with more than $6 billion in assets, about ⅓ from WPT, up from zero WPT 18 months ago.  Most important, Longtail has delivered 20% annualized ROE since inception in 2020, 16%/year higher than the average of the top three global reinsurers, our aspirational peer group in the decades ahead.\n\nLongtail may do its next legacy trade in two years, or five, or never. In recent pre-search research, we discovered a faded 1622 salvage account in Seville – aka PwC’s Annual Global Insurance Run-Off Survey – suggesting about $1 trillion of WPT may be out there, somewhere, buried in old reinsurance balance sheets. Our Bayesian training tells us about 97 out of 100 legacy treasure hunts would be for fool’s gold, but also that about $30 billion of real treasure awaits. I’m betting on Longtail’s Bayesian treasure hunters to find it.\n\nJust last year, The Atlantic wrote, “15 years into its existence, bitcoin has yet to demonstrate any serious use case.”vi\n\n87% of humans today – though definitely no one who edits articles at The Atlantic – were born into a monetary system without a reserve currency, and also without democracy, rule of law, or property rights. Simply put, the way The Atlantic editors use money is not the way most people on earth use money, whose savings technology is either collapsing paper notes, cattle, or sheet metal.\n\nSeething with financial privilege, The Atlantic editors might debate the relative merits of saving in NVDA vs. AMZN. How about, instead, cattle vs. sheet metal?\n\nIf bitcoin has no use case, perhaps The Atlantic editors should convert their entire life savings into Malawian Kwacha and see how it goes. In 2023, Malawi – generally considered a democratic country – chose a 44% overnight currency devaluation. And…it’s gone.vii If you don’t hold bitcoin, please step out of the line. This line is for people who have money. Not fiat credit.\n\nNo one got to vote on the inhuman cruelty of almost halving – overnight – the cumulative value of their entire life’s work. Instead, the criminal counterfeiters central bank forced The Atlantic editors 22 million humans to invest their life savings in unbacked pieces of paper with zero marginal production cost, turning them, ex-post, into 44% slaves. Nothing produced limitlessly and for free can ever, eventually, have value. Fiat is always and everywhere a ponzi phenomenon with seigniorage the State’s irresistibly silent Madoff-like pitch. Bitcoin, its kryptonite, will never take the meeting.\n\nStill no use case? Let’s try another one.\n\n“There isn’t a single goddamn thing that bitcoin can do for retail that Apple Pay doesn’t already do 10x better.”\n\n— The Atlantic editors bitcoin critic on Twitter (2019)\n\n“I CAN’T use Apple pay/PayPal/Visa/Master or anything like them.  \nI’m from Iran\nI CAN use bitcoin\nWhat do you have to say?!\"\n\n— Ziya Sadr, Iranian human rights activist subsequently jailed for freedom advocacy (recently released)\n\nThe critic issued a public apology.\n\nStill no use case? Before we try a final one, a Stoic parable about awe can provide some context:\n\nWhen we were very young, the world was an awe-inspiring place. Watch a three-year-old watch her dad fill up a castle-shaped bucket with wet sand at the beach. She is fascinated that her father would do such a thing, but when he inverts the bucket and carefully lifts it up – revealing a perfect sandcastle – the three-year-old is awestruck that such magic is possible and that her father has power to perform that magic.\n\nIf we meet that three-year-old ten years later, maybe she has 25% of the capacity for awe she had that day at the beach.\n\nAnd ten years after that, her capacity for awe might be down to 1% of its sandcastle level.viii\n\nIn one of the most moving days of my life, on December 10th in Oslo I got to attend the very intimate award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize. My battery capacity for awe recharged to 100%.\n\nMaría Corina Machado won for her decades-long commitment to freedom, democracy, and human dignity in Venezuela.  In 2023, with more than one-third of her country’s 30 million citizens having fled to survive – the largest refugee population in the world – Machado decided to run for President against the brutal dictator Maduro, her campaign the personification of ultimate bravery.\n\n“Traveling by road and dirt path across a country with gasoline shortages, daily blackouts, and collapsing communications,”ix  Machado risked her life just to campaign. On July 28, 2024, her supporters risked theirs just to vote. In a nationwide eruption of truth, Machado won in a landslide.x  The repressive Maduro regime ignored the results, clung to power illegally, and forced Machado into hiding.\n\nThey tried to bury us.\nThey didn’t know we were seeds.\n\nIn late 2024, from a secret location, Machado was interviewed by the Human Rights Foundation’s (HRF) Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, saying,\n\n“The world knows of Chavez and Maduro's human rights abuses, but less about their violations of financial rights, turning a functional economy into a catastrophic financial crisis. In 2018, inflation reached 1.7 million percent. This financial repression rooted in state sponsored looting, theft, and money printing happened despite our vast natural resources.\n\nBeyond wrecking the currency, the regime weaponized financial systems against its people, freezing accounts, seizing assets, and cutting off services. Venezuelans found a lifeline in bitcoin during hyperinflation, using it to protect their wealth and to finance their escape. Today, bitcoin bypasses government-imposed exchange rates and thus helps many of our people. It has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance. We are grateful for the lifeline bitcoin provides and look forward to embracing it in a new democratic Venezuela. We envision bitcoin becoming part of our national reserves, helping rebuild what the dictatorship stole. Before our gold reserves were plundered, Venezuela had wealthy financial reserves worldwide. We will restore those reserves and include bitcoin as a key component.\n\nUnlike bank wires, which the regime blocks, bitcoin donations cannot be seized. Let's use this technology to bring about the change Venezuela desperately needs.\n\nWe are determined to assert our sovereignty and transform Venezuela into an open, prosperous, and secure society, something that is only possible in a free nation.”\n\nWe await The Atlantic’s public apology.\n\nUpon news of her Nobel win, Machado began plotting her escape from hiding. She wanted to be in Oslo as a symbol for her people and the world. When it was time, Machado – in a wigged disguise and under the cover of dark – left her jungle hiding spot, evaded multiple regime checkpoints, took a tiny fishing boat through treacherous waters, and finally – miraculously – boarded a supporter’s private plane to make it to Oslo. It would be impossible to overstate the danger Machado faced to escape.\n\nAlmost immediately upon landing, at 3am local time – after hugging her family, or anyone, for the first time since she had gone into hiding 16 months earlier, and in the same clothes she began her now immensely historic day – Machado sat for an interview with BBC News.xi\n\nI immediately noticed she sounded different.\n\nAlready the world’s most inspirational living human rights activist, some transcendent combination of her time in hiding, winning the Nobel, and successful escape gave Machado’s tone, timbre, and bearing a Mandela-like ascendence and regality. She spoke with extraordinary moral authority and absolute certainty about future events, words coming through her with divine clarity, Machado now destined to become among the greatest female leaders of all time.\n\n“Venezuela has turned into a nation in which the state applies terrorism. The regime has control of all institutions and has applied state terrorism towards innocent people and committed crimes against humanity. And everybody that dares to speak out, to defend any of your basic rights, takes a huge risk and probably ends in prison. Just for posting news about the Nobel Prize, you will get in prison. And if they go looking for you and they don't find you in your house, they will take your family, even children in prison.\n\nSo, they had to say that I'm a terrorist, that I have to be in jail for the rest of my life, and they're looking for me. So, certainly, leaving Venezuela today in these circumstances is very, very dangerous. So, I just want to say today that I'm here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo. And I came here on behalf of them, and the millions of anonymous Venezuelan heroes to receive the prize and to take it back to them, because it's theirs.\n\nI'm going back to Venezuela. The Venezuelan government would have disappeared me if they found me when I was in Venezuela. And I know exactly the risks I'm taking. And what I've said to the Venezuelan people from the beginning is I'm going to be in the place where I am more useful for our cause. And until very short time ago, the place where I thought I had to be was Venezuela. The place where I believe I have to be today on behalf of our cause is Oslo.”\n\nIn his 1978 essay The Power of the Powerless, human rights activist Václav Havel – leader of the Velvet Revolution, first President of the post-Communist Czech Republic, and HRF’s first Chairman – makes the searing point that though authoritarians can mobilize their heavy artillery of terror, torture, imprisonment, and persecution, they are not equipped to fight the asymmetric battle between lies and truth.\n\nVenezuelan regime change can also be an asymmetric truth domino – the animating spark for revolutionary excitement, heroism, and power among the powerless – that then topples the other nearby dictators in Cuba and Nicaragua. That cumulative outcome would be of immense significance to America, and that possibility has been hugely motivational to me. For American global primacy to continue, which it must, this must be the Western Hemisphere’s century. No authoritarians allowed in the neighborhood.\n\nThe majority of my personal philanthropy is anonymous, and it will stay that way. However, in the hope of inspiring followershipxii  at this moment of maximum human rights gamma, I will share that I have long supported Alex Gladstein’s work arming the only people dictators fear – human rights activists – with large quantities of Satoshi’s unstoppable truth-telling weapon. Bitcoin is money dictators can’t stop. I know firsthand its importance to HRF.\n\nAsleep during Machado’s BBC News interview, I left Oslo a few hours later, hustling back to New York to host the Stone Ridge holiday party that evening. After landing, I saw, and then listened to, a voicenote attached to an encrypted message. Mouth agape, I recognized the voice immediately. With an ascendence and regality that moved me to tears by the end, here is the message in full:\n\nI want to thank you personally for your support of the Human Rights Foundation and all the programs that have made possible this unique moment in Oslo this week.\n\nBecause of your support I was able to move, to arrive where I needed to be and to continue to fight without interruption. You know in moments like these, logistics are the whole difference between presence and absence.\n\nI arrived late and I didn’t have a chance to thank you in person as I wanted, or to tell you about the plans we have in the time to come, but I know that we will have a chance to do that very soon. I want you to know that your personal commitment to our struggle for freedom translates directly into action.\n\nIt gives our people and people like us the ability to stand where it matters and when it matters so I am very, very grateful for your clarity of purpose, for your belief in freedom and certainly for your willingness to stand for this freedom in both practice and principle.\n\nI will not cease in this struggle for freedom, and I certainly look forward to welcoming you and hosting you and your family in our beautiful country and a free Venezuela.\n\nThank you for making so much happen. I look forward to seeing you and please take very good care.”\n\nBitcoin has a use case.  Human rights treasure.\n\nAnd with Machado walking among us, we need not live life devoid of feelings of awe.\n\nIn 1984 Apple, then still Apple Computer, premiered a sci-fi short film – a commercial at the Super Bowl – in which a rebellious heroine smashes a screen, symbolizing Apple breaking free from the conformity of IBM’s Big Brother. Widely considered the greatest commercial of all-time for almost four decades, it established Apple’s identity, paved the way for the Mac, and led to record sales.\n\nIn 2020, also at the Super Bowl, Apple was dethroned. New York Life premiered an even better commercial paving the way for the next chapter of its identity, also leading to record sales. Over the course of 60 emotional seconds, New York Life began by briefly exploring three Greek words for love (Philia, Storgē, Eros) to then focus on the fourth, Agape, or love as an action. The ad contained powerful scenes of care, including a ten-year-old boy lifting his little brother over a country fence en route to adventure, and a 50-year-old son lowering his frail 95-year-old father into a tub to help him bathe. The commercial anchored the firm’s 175th anniversary branding of building better futures through love and financial security.\n\nThe ancient Greeks had four words for love. The first is Philia. Philia is affection that grows from friendship. Next there’s Storgē, the kind you have for a grandparent. Or a brother. Third, there’s Eros, the uncontrollable urge to say, “I love you.” The fourth kind of love is different. It’s the most admirable. It’s called Agape: love as an action. It takes courage, sacrifice, strength; for 175 years we’ve been helping people act on their love so they can look back – or ahead – and say, “We got it right. We did good.”\n\nStone Ridge takes immense pride in working for the policyholders of New York Life, and also MassMutual, iconic American firms and our largest partners, 180-years-old and 174-years-old, respectively. Mutuals are special. They feel different inside. There is no conflict of interest between the shareholders and the policyholders because there are no shareholders. The policyholders own the firm, a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction. Employees stay for decades, and the top executives view themselves, appropriately and inspirationally to me, as leaders and stewards. My Stone Ridge colleagues and I run to work every day for New York Life and MassMutual. And we aspire for our little firm to be like those big guys when we grow up.\n\nSince any company’s longevity, on a long enough timescale, is entirely dependent on its ability to reinvent itself, the most underappreciated characteristic of these mutuals is their astonishing consistency of innovation. The typical firm in the S&P 500 is 58 years old, not 180. No business can do tomorrow what it did yesterday and last very long, let alone do in the next century what it did in the last.\n\nConsider that these mutuals paid claims during the Civil War when – remember, their core product is life insurance – their policyholders were shooting each other. They paid claims after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, decades before Hannover Re-quality earthquake seismologists could help them properly underwrite that risk. And they paid claims through the two global pandemics, twice surviving life insurers’ one true tail risk.\n\nExtraordinary financial strength, ironclad reliable claims payment, and a monumentally underrated culture of innovation = New York Life and MassMutual.\n\nWatching these reinventing mutuals up close has also taught me that firms seeking longevity – including Stone Ridge – must, just as importantly, decide what must not change. What is our air-gapped mission? What are the rituals we dare not cease?  What routines – the ones that make us us – shall we pass to new colleagues? In essence, what are we stewards of?\n\n“In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.”\n\n— Coco Chanel, revolutionary fashion designer\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all. Our rituals are few, important, and sacrosanct. Our routines drive our productivity.\n\nWe work five days/week in office and have a “no-device” policy in meetings, routines that maximize exposure to the uncorrelated weirdness of our spectacular coleagues. Fiddling with a device in a meeting means you do not belong in that meeting. Meetings should be rare, riveting, and short. Zero is the wrong number of meetings for a firm, but it is close. A meeting-less firm with 100 employees has 4,950 potential 1:1 colleague-collisions all day long. Remove 10% of the team for an unnecessary meeting and lose 945 potential collisions. That meeting-math is especially punishing at Stone Ridge. Our people are our moat, dug deeper per collision.\n\n“A lot of people never use their initiative because no one told them to.”\n\nInitiating collisions with insanely smart colleagues at Stone Ridge can seem intimidating at first, but you must take the initiative to ever create a map in which X marks the spot. My advice to my colleagues is the same advice I give to my 18- and 23-year-old boys.  Ask her out. Whether “she” is a hard class, a job, a city, a beautiful woman, or a brilliant Stone Ridge colleague – just go up and talk.xiv And remember, Stone Ridge colleagues are insanely kind too.\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we care deeply about how we present ourselves to outsiders because we matter, and so do they. When introducing ourselves in meetings, we mention our role and how long we have been at the firm. “Hi, I’m Ross Stevens, the CEO, and I’ve been at Stone Ridge since 2012.” After meetings, we walk our guests to the elevator, along the way sincerely thanking them for the visit. Sometimes we even take the elevator down with them so we can thank them some more. Finally, business cards are back. Business cards remind us we live in a tactile world, and our most tactile experiences are with other humans. Business cards also symbolize something of value – you. Our simple meeting routines honor ourselves and our firm and show proper respect to our visitors.\n\n“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”\n\nOver the last 36 months, three Stone Ridge colleagues voluntarily left to work at another firm. Each was junior in their career and had a ten-month average tenure with us. Clearly, Stone Ridge was not for them. We, in turn, reflected on what happened in each instance and refined our recruiting process, uninterested in transience in any element of our life’s work. Though Stone Ridge achieved, with plenty of room to spare, my singular KPI – less than 1%/year voluntary turnover – those three departures were exactly three too many to me. I intend to raise my game in 2026, so please tune in – same Bat-Time, same Bat-Channel – to see if I had a better year.\n\n“I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me.”\n\nDespite the three leavers, Stone Ridge got something very important, very right at firm inception: no HR. No HR is the gift that keeps on giving because the very best people are repelled by those addicted to comfort. When new folks arrive at Stone Ridge and realize we have no HR, a lens cap lifts off their consciousness. Surrounded by elite intellectual athletes, they immediately begin their training to be one, feeling compelled to do remarkable things, utterly untethered to what they previously thought possible. We teach them business physics, but also to feel bound by nothing. I would not dare limit their leaps even one inch with even one minute of an infantilizing HR training session.\n\n“He is no longer a dreamer.  He is a creator.”\n\n— Sculptor Auguste Rodin, describing his masterpiece The Thinker\n\nOne of my favorite untethered Stone Ridge policies is unlimited maternity leave, which has been true since the firm began. I think of Agape. It takes care and action to properly delegate your duties to your remaining colleagues while you enjoy that magical time with your family. In action and a bit of love, your colleagues lock arms and step up for you, so the firm does not miss a beat in your absence, the duration of which I refuse to meter. It also takes action and a bit of love to take no action. The awesome women of Stone Ridge know their job will be waiting for them when they get back. I sometimes wonder if that ever helps them decide to create more treasure.\n\n“It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how.”\n\n— Philosopher The Cat, on his approach to work in his masterpiece The Cat in the Hat\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we relentlessly focus on growing after-tax cash flow to drive durable equity value in our operating businesses. Our progress has never resembled a straight line up and to the right, and I hope it never does. However, thinking deeply about what we know before we know, open-mindedness to – and hunger for – new data, and extremely rapid posterior updating – and ultimately the courage to create with conviction when we believe it is time – have been the hallmarks of our operating model since firm inception.\n\nThe first rule of product design at Stone Ridge is we build products we want for ourselves. Stone Ridge is always the seed investor and, whenever possible – but not yet always – the largest. Consider our “no-device” policy in this context. Would you ever pull out your phone and start scrolling in the middle of a meeting with your largest investor? At Stone Ridge, we do not pull our phones out on each other.\n\nWith Stone Ridge increasingly Stone Ridge’s largest investor, the scale of our profits as principals, not agents, creates a level of alignment with our outside investors we are unaware exists elsewhere. Those investors occasionally remark that this is a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction, and that Stone Ridge feels different inside.\n\nEarlier this year, Stone Ridge Holdings Group (SRHG), parent company of Stone Ridge Asset Management, NYDIG, and Longtail Re, completed a significant primary equity financing led by an iconic American financial services firm – also a mutual, though this one a relatively spry 165-year-old – we are thrilled to partner with in the decades ahead.\n\nDespite regularly rising profitability, regularly raising primary equity for our parent and affiliates – $4.6 billion and counting, and only primary, ever – has been our quiet way of strengthening our most important partnerships, playing muscular defense when the sky falls in our markets, and playing profitable post-event offense in the aftermath.\n\nFounding 2012 SRHG investors have received 32x their original investment in distributions and now own equity valued up 178x net of those distributions, an annualized total return of 50%.  Fisher took 5,954 days to find the Atocha. We have been at it for 4,930. Every morning, I bang our little ship’s pots and pans with a smile because I know Stone Ridge will find the treasure.\n\nAs we enter 2026, our tanks are filled with energy, gratitude, and inspiration. We innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all.\n\nStone Ridge is most proud of the partnership we have with you, our investors. We are on the path together. You contribute the capital to propel and sustain groundbreaking product development. We contribute our collective careers’ worth of experience in sourcing, structuring, execution, and risk management. Together, it works. In that spirit, I offer my deepest gratitude to you for sharing your wealth with us this year. We look forward to serving you again in 2026.",

    "fullText": "‘Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary isn't blaming the economy for your empty bank account. He's blaming you. And he's not shy about it.\n\n\"Listen, I'm going to tell you something most people don't want to hear,\" O'Leary said in a December YouTube video titled \"If You Want To Get Rich, Stop Buying These 5 Things.\" \"You're broke. Not because you don't make enough money, not because the economy is rigged against you, not because you didn't get lucky. You're broke because you keep buying stupid things that are keeping you poor.\"\n\nFrom the first line, O'Leary makes it clear—building wealth doesn't start with more income. It starts with cutting the nonsense.\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nHis first target? That shiny new car in your driveway.\n\n\"Buying a new car is one of the dumbest financial decisions you can make,\" O'Leary said. A car drops 20% to 30% in value the second you drive it off the lot, he explained, turning thousands of dollars into dust—for nothing but \"that new car smell.\" And leasing? \"Leasing is the absolute worst,\" he said. \"You're renting a depreciating asset… You gave the dealership thousands of dollars for the privilege of borrowing their car.\"\n\nHis advice is brutal but simple: \"Buy a three-year-old certified pre-owned car. Let somebody else take the depreciation hit. That's what rich people do.\"\n\nO'Leary isn't just coming for your car. He's coming for your kitchen—or more accurately, the one you refuse to use. \"People tell me they don't have money to invest. And then I watch them spend $15 on a salad for lunch,\" he said. That's not a splurge. It's financial self-sabotage.\n\nThe average American spends nearly $4,000 a year eating out, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. O'Leary runs the math: investing that same $3,500 annually for 30 years at 10% could become more than $600,000. \"You're trading half a million dollars in retirement wealth for convenience and fancy meals you'll forget about in 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nPack your lunch. Make your coffee at home. \"These aren't sacrifices,\" O'Leary said. \"These are smart financial decisions.\" But when you do eat out, he says, at least make it count. \"Don't waste money on mediocre chain restaurants because you're too lazy to cook. That's not living well. That's being financially irresponsible.\"",

    "description": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett, 95, is set to step down as the CEO of Berkshire Hathway at the end of the year.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway is gearing up for the biggest leadership shake-up in decades, and one strategist thinks it presents the perfect time to buy the stock.\n\nBarbara Goodstein, a managing partner at R360, an invitation-only investment and networking group for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, told CNBC on Monday that longtime Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett's impending departure offered a \"lot of opportunity\" for investors.\n\nBuffett, 95, is set to step down as the CEO of Berkshire at the end of 2025 after nearly 60 years in the role. He will be replaced by Greg Abel, who heads the firm's non-insurance businesses and will stay on as its chairman.\n\nGoodstein said the change did not make Berkshire stock any less attractive.\n\n\"We are strong into Berkshire Hathaway, we've always respected their moves,\" she said, adding: \"We're calling this a 'succession discount.'\"\n\n\"We think the stock is trading below what it will become because everybody is waiting to see how Greg Abel performs.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stock price is up nearly 11% this year.\n\nGoodstein pointed to Berkshire's cash pile as particularly intriguing, saying she believed the firm had been \"sitting on it\" to allow Abel to make a \"big move in 2026.\"\n\nIn the third quarter, Berkshire grew its cash pile to a new record of more than $350 billion, or $382 billion if payables for Treasury purchases were excluded. The company also reported a 34% year-on-year increase in operating income to $13.5 billion.\n\nUnder Abel's leadership, Goodstein added that she thought Berkshire may look to invest in energy or defense.\n\n\"Berkshire Hathaway is well-positioned. They've always been looking at the trends. And we think that those are the two sectors that have lots of upside.\"\n\nBuffett announced his decision to step down as chief executive in May, during the closing moments of his company's annual meeting in Omaha.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders in November, Buffett addressed the looming changes and heaped praise on Abel, calling him a \"great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator.\"\n\n\"I can't think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government — you name it — that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "The chipmaker’s sprawling partnerships are driving extraordinary growth but also bank its future on the AI boom paying off quickly\n\nNvidia is, in crucial ways, nothing like Enron – the Houston energy giant that imploded through multibillion-dollar accounting fraud in 2001. Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.\n\nBut the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.\n\nNow worth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world’s AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.\n\nThis year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging from a $5bn investment into Intel – to facilitate its access to the PC market – to $100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nBut even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executive Jensen Huang’s energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.\n\nThe start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing: Nvidia lending money to customers so they can buy its products.\n\nThe largest of these is its deal with OpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia’s chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThe circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.\n\nJames Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, but said this year that the OpenAI deal presented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.\n\nHe added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”\n\nOther high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMD signed a multibillion-dollar chip deal that also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.\n\nThere is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”\n\nAll these moves form part of OpenAI’s $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies – and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.\n\nNvidia has also used structures called special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk’s xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThis drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.\n\nNvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.\n\nThe journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidia is not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent’s dotcom bubble partners. And it isn’t like Enron, Zitron argues, because it’s being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.\n\nSo what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”\n\nEssentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia’s customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.\n\nApproached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.\n\nIn particular, Kress argued that Nvidia’s recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.\n\nThere is another complexity, which is that Nvidia’s health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.\n\nAdd to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and South Korean companies. The value of this deal was not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.\n\nLikewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.\n\nGovernments are likely to pay. There’s nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.\n\n“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia’s revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”",

    "description": "\"Shark Tank\" and \"Marty Supreme\" star Kevin O'Leary explains his daily routine, which includes eating protein, biking, taking naps, and avoiding email.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Canadian businessman and entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary, 71, who gained popularity spending over nearly two decades as the blunt-talking investor on \"Shark Tank\" sarcastically nicknamed \"Mr. Wonderful.\" The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in Montreal and Ottawa and received my MBA in 1980. My second business, the software company SoftKey, became successful enough to acquire the educational software company The Learning Company in 1995. Four years later, I sold it to Mattel for $4.2 billion.\n\nI became a venture capitalist, mutual fund manager, and did some Canadian TV, starring on \"Dragon's Den,\" a reality series where entrepreneurs pitched ideas to a panel of investors. A few years later, Mark Burnett took me to lunch, as he wanted me to be one of the investors in a US version of \"Dragon's Den,\" called \"Shark Tank.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a real asshole, and you're it,\" he told me. The rest is history.\n\nI'm also acting for the first time, playing a business tycoon named Milton Rockwell in the Timothée Chalamet movie \"Marty Supreme,\" which is in theaters on Christmas Day.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nI don't need an alarm. Sometimes, when I have to be somewhere, I'll set it. But it's just a natural rhythm for me to get up at 5 a.m.\n\nGenerally, in business, there are five stories that start in Asia and then come sweeping across the globe. So I get up and watch the different feeds from Europe and Asia so I'm up to speed.\n\nAt about 6:45, when it gets light out, I get on my bike and ride for about 12 miles.\n\nI generally work out for about an hour and a half every day. It's for longevity and mental acuity; I have to do that, otherwise bad things happen.\n\nI don't eat breakfast. I fast for 16 hours and only have two meals a day. I'll have coffee in the mornings, but I don't buy it. That's stupid. Why would I pay five bucks when I can just make a coffee? I don't get it.\n\nI used to work for Steve Jobs. Before I sold The Learning Company to Mattel, we worked with Apple a lot to get the Mac into schools. He had this concept of signal and noise. He believed that you needed to do three things, and you had to get them done every day. You need a ratio of at least 70% signal, which are the three things, and the 30% can be noise, whatever is going to stop you from getting the three things done.\n\nIn entrepreneurship, and certainly in what I do today as an investor, there is no holiday, there's no workday — that doesn't exist. It's what you want to do with your time. So I pick three things I want to get done that day, and I don't let anything get in the way until those three things are done.\n\nI don't do emails anymore because I get anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 a day. I've tried every system to take the crap out, but over the years, my email address has gotten out there, and so it's just a constant stream of noise and garbage. As we speak, I see the emails just pouring in. I'm never going to get to them, so I don't try. So people who need to get a hold of me know that they are going to do that through messaging.\n\nLike my family. We have a family chat. That's very important messaging for me. It's perfect for when we are all in the same place. Through the day everyone is doing their own thing, but we figure out through the chat where we'll go out for dinner.\n\nI usually have fish and salad for lunch. Generally, I'm trying to eat 130 grams of protein a day. I do track my diet very closely, so I don't eat any shit food. There's no snacking or fast food. You can really change your productivity and how you feel with your energy by just eating a better diet and drinking less. I don't do drugs, I don't smoke, but I love wine. And I'm very careful when I drink that.\n\nA lot of my daily routine has been developed by working with successful people over the decades. I never gave a shit about sleep. I never slept at all. I could work off three hours of sleep, but then I met this CEO, and she said, \"You know something, why don't you try for 10 days getting seven hours and twenty minutes of sleep?\"\n\nI tried it for 10 days, and was she ever right. I felt so much better. My energy was up 30%, at least. And I felt like a million bucks in the morning. I felt really good.\n\nSo I got into the routine of finding seven hours and twenty minutes, and napping counts. So I nap in limos. I'm able to fall asleep as soon as we start driving. I tell the driver, \"Turn off the radio, I'm going to sleep,\" so 20 minutes to get there, I grab that 20 minutes of sleep.\n\nI like to eat around 7 p.m. or 7:30 p.m. A light Steely Dan vibe in the background is pretty good.\n\nI'll eat protein and have a glass of white wine, a Montrachet. I'll then move to red, a Burgundy or a Bordeaux. I'll keep it to two glasses, three max. I really try not to drink three hours before I go to bed. Because that screws up your sleep.\n\nMy wife and I generally watch a movie and then are in bed by 10 p.m. or 10:30 p.m.\n\nI've noticed something over the years in the people I invest in. The successful managers, entrepreneurs, founders, they all try something that they may not succeed in. So every time I get an opportunity that's completely outside my comfort zone, that I've never done before, that people tell me I'll probably fail in, I do it.\n\nI remember the conversation I had with my agent Jay Sures at UTA about doing \"Marty Supreme.\" He said, \"Listen Kevin, you're going to get offered this role but I want to warn you about something: You're not a scripted actor, you could shit the bed and destroy your brand that we're both making millions of dollars off of right now. You've got to think about this.\" And I said, \"Fuck that, I'm doing it.\"\n\nBut making the movie messed with my routine big time. Over an eight-month period, I worked on the film in New York and Tokyo. Some scenes I didn't shoot until 3:30 in the morning.\n\nAnd then there was the amount of takes the director Josh Safdie does. He wanted perfection — beyond perfection — so the takes would take hours. In the beginning, because I'm not used to working in a totalitarian environment, I finally said to Josh, \"Listen, this is my 25th take, I nailed it six times.\" And he looked at me and said, \"You haven't nailed it until I've said you've nailed it, do it again!\"\n\nI'm used to telling people, \"We're done,\" so that was the first thing I learned. But then when I saw the movie, these guys really knew what they were doing; it's unbelievable.\n\nBut I did get my naps in! I have hair in the movie, so I had to be in the makeup chair for hours to put it on and take it off. So there were two to three hours of free sleep there.\n\n\"Marty Supreme\" is in theaters nationwide on Christmas Day.",

That frustration is what Mark Cuban, the self-made billionaire and longtime Shark Tank investor, decided to unpack on his own — without being asked.\n\nIn January, Cuban returned to his personal site, Blog Maverick, after a long stretch of silence. \"I haven't published anything on here in a long, long time.. Thought it would be fun to start up again,\" he wrote. He said the post was meant to be informal and exploratory. \"I wanted to give some stream of consciousness thoughts on how I think we can ‘fix' the economics of healthcare..

Providers provide that care. Patients get a bill and if they can afford it, they pay that bill. That's it.\"\n\nIn his view, everything else is secondary. \"The ONLY question in healthcare should be ‘How should care for people who can't afford to pay for their care be paid?'\" he wrote. The rest, he suggested, is noise layered onto a transaction that used to be straightforward.\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nCuban also took aim at how pricing gets obscured. He criticized bundled charges, markups on basic supplies, and contracts so complex they hide real costs. Publishing prices alone doesn't solve it, he argued, when \"everyone bundles and upcodes and plays games.\"\n\nInsurance companies, he wrote, are a major source of that distortion. Managing and administering payments alone can add 20% to 30% in overhead, before accounting for fraud and overbilling. \"That's real money,\" Cuban said, especially in a system he estimates costs about $5 trillion a year.",

    "fullText": "The holiday season might not seem like a big window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers to get their bids seen by sellers, but one real estate agent argues it's actually an ideal time to score a deal.\n\nIf real-estate investor and agent Dana Bull was looking to expand her portfolio, she'd be putting in offers in late December — specifically, two days before Christmas.\n\nDecember 23 is her \"favorite day of the year to submit an offer,\" she told Business Insider. \"I find that sellers are very interested in getting a deal done going into the holidays or going into this year.\"\n\nBull works in real estate in a variety of capacities: She's a licensed agent, does real-estate consulting and coaching, and is a seasoned investor who owns multi-family and single-family homes throughout Massachusetts.\n\nShe's learned that if you want to land a good deal on a property, timing matters.\n\n\"It's always a good time to be deal hunting during a distracted market,\" Bull said — and people tend to be distracted over the holidays. \"Most people are just in coast mode, but if you're not in coast mode or if you can take yourself out of coast mode, this is such a great time.\"\n\nStarting a negotiation a few days before Christmas is a good time for several reasons.\n\n\"In general, people are in good spirits, and sellers tend to feel a sense of relief if they receive an offer because they usually aren't expecting one,\" she said. \"Christmas Eve puts a deadline to get things wrapped up with the negotiating and creates a sense of urgency.\"\n\nShe says she would avoid submitting an offer on actual holidays — \"it's a bit rude and unrealistic to get a response\" — but the days following Christmas are fair game. \"I almost always submit an offer that week. It's a time of great reflection, and sellers are generally motivated to put a deal together so they can enter the new year with a plan in place.\"\n\nThe holiday window of opportunity is small. A couple of weeks into January, \"it's like a light switch comes back on,\" she said, noting that mid-January is one of her busiest times of the year for consultations. \"What I've noticed is this herd mentality where everybody just ebbs and flows at the same time, so if you can be flowing when everybody else is ebbing, this is when you can negotiate.\"\n\nThat said, \"You don't want to make a bad purchase just because it's a good time of year,\" Bull added, but if you can carve out time to look for deals when most other investors aren't, you could be rewarded.\n\n\"There are always these pockets, like the Fourth of July is another great time where people have signed off, and I'm almost always working with somebody that weekend to try to scrounge something up.\"\n\nSeasonal swings aren't a myth, and they can be significant. In her market, for example, \"Massachusetts has huge seasonal swings in average pricing by like $100,000.\"\n\nIn the markets where Bull is active, in the winter, \"prices always come down,\" she added. \"And then they're going to start to climb. Then, in the summer they come back down again and they climb again in the fall. Every year it's the same quarterly trend, so if you are looking to buy a house, right now is one of the best times.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on December 9, 2024.",

    "title": "'Big Short' investor Michael Burry warns the US will lose the AI race to China if it banks on Nvidia's 'power hungry' chips",
    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "description": "Ark 2 now has a new release window, but don't expect it to be out soon, as the new date for the game is a nebulous 2028. Developer Studio Wildcard originally announced the dino-taming survival soulslike game sequel all the way back in 2020, but since then, the project has suffered several delays.\nThe 2028 date was revealed during publisher Snail Games' Investor Day held at the NASDAQ Marketsite building in Times Square this week (via the Epic Games Store blog), and the studio also unveiled a new look at the in-game model of Bob, the character who has appeared in multiple Ark projects and is voiced by The Boys star Karl Urban.\nStudio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed a two-year roadmap for Ark: Survival Ascended, which will culminate with the release of Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion that will lay the groundwork for Ark 2 and introduce several new gameplay mechanics coming to the sequel.\nContinue Reading at GameSpot",
