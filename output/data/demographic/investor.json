    "description": "The stock market could drop in 2026 as President Trump's tariffs and high valuations drag on investor sentiment.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 advanced 16% in 2025, notching double-digit gains for the third straight year.\n\nFederal Reserve research suggests President Trump's tariffs will slow economic growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at the most expensive valuation since the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) added 16% in 2025, marking the third consecutive year in which the benchmark index has recorded double-digit gains. Unfortunately, investors have reason to think 2026 will more challenging. Evidence suggests President Trump's tariffs are hurting the economy, and the stock market just flashed a warning last seen during the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nIn 2025, President Donald Trump broke with decades of trade-policy precedent and imposed sweeping tariffs that raised the average tax on U.S. imports to 16.8%, the highest level since 1935, per the Budget Lab at Yale. And Trump -- who once called tariffs \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary -- has made many misleading or inaccurate statements to drum up support for his signature trade policies.\n\nTrump said foreign exporters would absorb the tariffs for the \"privilege of access\" to the American market. However, Goldman Sachs says U.S. companies and consumers collectively paid 82% of the tariffs in October 2025, and 67% of the burden will fall on consumers alone by July 2026.\n\nTrump said tariffs would bring manufacturing work back to America. However, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) says U.S. manufacturing activity has now contracted in nine consecutive months due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs.\n\nTrump said tariffs would protect American workers and create millions of jobs. However, unemployment is at a four-year high and (excluding the pandemic) hiring slowed more profoundly in 2025 than any other year since the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump said tariffs would make America wealthy again and people would be \"very happy\" with the result. However, consumer sentiment in 2025 recorded its lowest annual average since the University of Michigan started collecting data in 1960.\n\nImportantly, U.S. GDP increased an annual 4.3% during the third quarter, the most robust growth in two years. President Trump credited tariffs for the booming economy. However, GDP growth was artificially high because imports (which are subtracted from GDP) were artificially low. Why were imports low? Companies stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs earlier this year.",

If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity.

    "fullText": "“Every driver has a limit.  Mine is a little bit further than others.”\n\n— Ayrton Senna, greatest Formula One driver of all time\n‍\n\n“I’m not funny.  What I am is brave.”\n\n— Lucille Ball, greatest female comedian of all time\n‍\n\n“I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.”\n\n“I can outlearn you.  \nI can outread you.  \nI can outthink you.  \nAnd I can outphilosophize you.”\n\n— Robert De Niro as Max Cady, Cape Fear‍\n‍\n\n“I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.”\n\n— Michael Scott, The Office, on how Bayesians form priors\n‍\n\nThe greatest treasure hunters know that the treasure they seek is not lost. It is waiting.\n\nStarting in 1969 and for 5,954 straight days, treasure hunter Mel Fisher sought what was waiting for him: the wreckage of the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, a Spanish galleon that sunk in 1622.\n\nHow do you recruit, retain, and motivate a crew when you are not sure when you will find the treasure, if you will find the treasure, or what the treasure will be worth? Fisher developed a powerful operating philosophy, captured in its entirety with three amazing words.\n\nEvery morning, for 16 years, Mel Fisher banged pots and pans in the pre-sunrise to rouse his crew, shouting and smiling, “Today’s the day, men. Today’s the day.”\n\nEventually it was true. On July 20, 1985, Mel and his crew discovered the most valuable shipwreck in history, 70 miles off the coast of Key West. The Atocha yielded gold and silver today worth more than $10 billion.\n\nFisher’s “today’s the day” philosophy reframed what could have otherwise been a mentally tortuous journey – will we ever find the treasure? Is it even here? – into daily play characterized by disciplined guessing, dispassionate refinement, and the singular goal of ending the day less wrong.\n\nFisher had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, as we will see, his operating philosophy, and its daily ritual of iteration, was textbook Bayesian. Fisher also settled – for me – a foundationally important debate I had struggled with about the philosophy of probability theory which, in turn, provided me with an operating manual for leadership.\n\nArriving at the University of Chicago’s Ph.D. program in 1991, I, like Fisher, had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, exposure the first day of my first class turned into a wandering, wondering, and still unabated obsession. I left the program five years later with a Ph.D. in Bayesian statistics (and finance), and my career has essentially been a three-decade extension of what I learned at Chicago. I now do Bayesian treasure hunting for a living.\n\nFancy math aside, the foundational idea of Bayesian statistics is simply learning from experience. Things get started with a “prior distribution”, which is what you think you know about what you want to know – for example, “Where is the treasure?” That “prior” is mixed with observable data – experience – to form a “posterior distribution”, a structured mashup of your prior and the data you collected.  The posterior represents your new view of what you want to know – for example, “I now know the treasure is not over there.”i\n\nThe power of Bayesian statistics is in the trade-off inherent in the framework. How much do you listen to your pre-wisdom intuition before it is enhanced by the data you collect, knowing your pre-data knowledge is limited, at best? How much do you listen to your new data, especially if it contradicts your pre-data intuition, knowing your limited sample may not lead you closer to the treasure, and might even throw you off the trail?\n\nWhen done with mastery, Bayesian statistics is a beautiful, egoless, daily practice of being less wrong.\n\nIn hindsight, every incoming University of Chicago Ph.D. student in 1991 – our collaborative little group of intellectually hungry sponges – was susceptible to becoming a Bayesian. Arnold Zellner, a giant in the history of Bayesian econometrics, towered, gently, over the business school’s statistics department, having just been named President of the American Statistical Association and – to me – a hilarious, wonderful, deeply caring professor. And though my own research was – and still is – focused on empirical asset pricing, my six-man dissertation committee ended up including four Bayesian statisticians, each a legend in the field.\n\nI recall as if it were yesterday my dissertation co-chairman Rob McCulloch teaching me that the Bayesian-required question “how do we set our priors?” illuminated a philosophical debate, still raging, about probability theory because that simple question is akin to asking, “What can we know prior to knowing?” I thought about that deeply for years.\n\nStudying Fisher, and treasure hunting, I now know that the answer is, often, a lot.\n\n“What’s an expert anyway? Just some guy from out of town.”\n\nConsider that Fisher knew to search off the coast of Florida and not, say, Australia. How? During his pre-search research at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Fisher discovered a faded 1622 salvage account describing the treasure fleet’s loss and references to survivors setting up camp in Cayos del Marques, or Key Largo today. So, Fisher’s prior variance was very large to start – search the Florida Keys – but not practically infinite – search all 140 million square miles of water on the surface of the planet.ii\n\nKnowing roughly where the Atocha sank and roughly the seasonal path of the current – that is, knowing prior to knowing before collecting any data from the sea – Fisher literally, and massively, shrunk the problem. Bayesian shrinkage, a foundational element of Bayesian statistics, involves pulling in especially noisy estimates – say, all oceans on Earth – closer to a central value – say, water off the coast of Florida. My dissertation – which applied new computational techniques in Bayesian shrinkage to old problems in finance – helped me see Fisher as a Bayesian.\n\nEvery day, Fisher, like any good Bayesian, updated his prior guess of where the Atocha was with data about where it definitely was not. Every day Fisher became a little less wrong.\n\nIn finding the Atocha in 16 years – and not 60, or never – Fisher adhered to Bayesian-adjacent principles that Alec Litowitz, founder of Magnetar Capital, and my former boss and mentor, writes about in his forthcoming and fascinating field guide for success, The Adaptability Quotient: Rewiring Your Mind for Success in the Next Human Era:\n\n“Confirmation bias is the worst enemy of iteration.  In a Bayesian system, it’s fatal. If you only accept the data that supports your hypothesis, you’re not updating – you’re entrenching. The people who learn fastest are the ones who are most willing to be wrong…with the humility to trade conviction for information, one update at a time.”\n\nFisher let the data speak and learned fast. In 1973, he found silver bars and coins matching the Atocha’s manifest.  Less wrong. Two years later, he discovered bronze cannons with Atocha markings. Even less wrong. Ten years after that, the motherlode. Absolutely right.\n\nAs students of the great Chicago Bayesians, we at Stone Ridge seek continual improvement in the speed of unbiased iterations. We are trained to privately ask ourselves, “Was I less wrong today?” Our progress depends on our eruptions of good questions, and truly listening to the answers. We would rather look dumb by asking, than not ask and be dumb. People forget if you looked dumb. They do not if you are.\n\nAs students of the great Bayesian Fisher, we at Stone Ridge know that success is not always linked to intelligence, boldness, or experience, but does consistently follow those most adaptive. In Litowitz-speak, it is not just IQ or EQ that matters, but AQ – adaptability quotient – a way of thinking that prioritizes learning over being right, and structure over rigidity. When the terrain shifts, do you update or insist?\n\nUpdating our prior – Chicago – with our data – Fisher – allows us to graduate with an extraordinarily valuable posterior because it contains X-marks-the-spot wisdom: markets overpay for stories of the future and underpay for hidden treasures of the past. That single Chicago-Fisherian insight caused us to make $3 billion in uncorrelated trading profits this year and $10 billion the last three. To see how, let’s go Bayesian treasure hunting and discover what awaits us buried in old reinsurance balance sheets and ancient Arkansas rock.\n\nIn 2023, amidst intense diligence for what ultimately became a $3 billion purchase of PDPsiii  in Arkansas’ Fayetteville Shale, we noticed that of the 860,000 acres included in the deal, 800,000 were covered with PDPs and 60,000 – all adjacent – were covered with grass. That’s a lot of undeveloped land.\n\n“Why are there no drilling rigs here?”\n\nWe decided to park our one major unanswered diligence question for the sake of efficiency, once convinced our PDP-only purchase could deliver our target returns.\n\nTwo years later, after taking over operations of the 5,596 wells we purchased – and our internally reframed responsibility of powering the homes of four million American families – the question resurfaced. “Why are there no rigs here?”\n\nThis time we could not shake it.\n\nWe learned that no one had drilled anything new for almost a decade, odd for a basin that size. A little stitious, we wondered, “Does treasure await?”\n\nWe suspected the previous owner’s “denominator problem” could explain their lack of drilling. They were an enormous company. Any marginal improvements in Fayetteville, despite being potentially large in dollar terms, would likely not move the needle in ROE, their north star.  In contrast, Stone Ridge operates every day with a “no basis point left behind” mindset. One basis point is our north star.  And, to us, large dollars will always be large dollars.\n\nWe also learned that two important aspects of drilling changed in the past decade: technologyiv and cost. Completion – the act of getting a drilled well to the point that gas steadily comes out of the ground for commercial purposes – now benefits from better drills, smarter rigs, more powerful fleets, and advanced digital control systems. And following a version of Moore’s Law, the new and better technology continually costs a lot less.\n\nWe decided to run a tightly controlled test program on our undeveloped land, drilling new wells, seeking fast, unbiased iterations, and updating – and hopefully tightening – the variance of our Bayesian prior – every day. Was there untapped gas under our 60,000 acres of grass? If so, where? If so, how much?\n\nOur approach was surgical. Two pads, five wells, disciplined design, unbiased data analysis, and adherence to the following mathematical identity.\n\nDrilling for natural gas ≡ searching for buried treasure in ancient rock\n\nThough we did not shout “today’s the day” every morning during our Fayetteville testing, we did feel Fisher-like energy as our ignorance shrank. Less wrong. Even less wrong. Absolutely right.\n\nEureka!  We found Fisher-like treasure.\n\nComposed of oil and gas, not gold and silver, our no-less-precious motherlode means that the $10 billion lifetime revenue we originally expected in Fayetteville now looks more like $15 billion. Discovering half an Atocha caused us to immediately shrink our priors in all seven U.S. basins we operate, a technical Bayesian statistical concept called “borrowing strength.” Our philosophy of probability theory, concretely applied to our Fayetteville test results, allowed us – with powerful practical efficiency – to know without knowing in the not-yet-tested basins. Less wrong.\n\nWe are now in the process of learning as much as is known about drilling before tapping our AQ to push the limit “a little further than others” and get closer to what is knowable. Every day counts because there’s gold oil and gas in them thar hills. It is waiting.\n\n“It may seem difficult at first, but all things are difficult at first.”\n\n— Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings\n\nIn launching our energy franchise almost five years ago, we assumed our breakthroughs in proprietary financing and hedging technology – and the resulting material edge in our cost of funds – were sufficient conditions for best-in-class investment performance. We quickly and painfully learned, however, that financial sophistication cannot substitute for industrial control. In energy markets, physics – not finance – sets the tuition entrepreneurs must pay.\n\nA bit chastened, we updated our prior and then – fortuitously – met Flywheel Energy, by far the best operators in the industry, due in part to their entire executive team’s roots in elite military operations. Flywheel is now part of Stone Ridge.\n\nUnder Flywheel’s peerless leadership, and an unbeatable team of 794 superstars – including 569 in the field – we now operate our wells ourselves. With every colleague crisply aligned on, and unambiguously individually responsible for their specific part, maximizing a singular metric – total dollars of operating profit – physics and finance are now in sync. Industry-leading results have followed.\n\nSince inception, Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) has purchased almost $11 billion of energy assets, all via proprietary securitizations – no bankers, no information leakage, no fee leakage. Over that period, spot natural gas has traveled in a staggeringly wide and volatile range of $1.50/MMBtu to almost $9/MMBtu. Yet, across thirteen equity tranches, the integrated precision of Flywheel physics + Stone Ridge finance has produced >20%/year, with low volatility, and no correlation to anything.v\n\n“Never was a finer canvas presented to work on than our countrymen. All of them engaged in the pursuits of honest industry, independent in their circumstances, enlightened as to their rights, and firm in their habits of order.”\n\n— Thomas Jefferson in a letter to James Madison, 1796\n\nThe U.S. shale revolution required three actors, working in concert. First, unlimited underground supply of hydrocarbons. Second, technological breakthroughs to access it. Third, profit-seeking capital. Leveraging nature for the first part, SRE brings fresh thinking to the rest.\n\nPlay the tape forward five years and I do not see SRE as a larger version of what we are today. I see a different kind of company. SRE has a chance to matter in the same practical, civic way that a major rail line or a modern port matters. I would like us to.\n\nAt our pace of disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and unrelenting process improvement, SRE will be a top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons. Managing that level of capital and molecule movement at our extraordinary level of operational excellence would meaningfully impact U.S. families, U.S. factories, and the competitiveness of this country. I would like us to.\n\nMore than 99% of the capital we manage at Stone Ridge, including SRE, comes from American investors. At our scale, that cannot happen by accident. At Stone Ridge, American capital produces American treasure.\n\nOn average and over time, treasure hunting in the sea is not a good business. Availability bias blinds us to the fact that for every Mel Fisher, dozens of others strike out. In fact, any too narrowly defined business is not a good business over a long enough time horizon.  Meta and abstract? No, Bayesian and practical. When the terrain shifts and you insist, your business surface area too is limited even for efficient Bayesian updating to help. In Litowitz-speak, your confirmation bias is fatal. It is just a matter of time.\n\nConsider legacy reinsurance. In contrast to prospective quota shares – aligned, partnership trades in which Stone Ridge shares risk pro rata with leading reinsurers, tapping into their masterful Bayesian updating cycle management skills across dozens of lines of business – legacy trades transfer retrospective risk from (re)insurance policies written years or decades ago.\n\nThe performance of legacy-only reinsurers is like that of lenders to too narrowly defined monoline credit originators (think: “only sub-prime auto” or “only UK small business”). Victims of confirmation bias’s siren song, monolines always – yes, always – originate unprofitable loans at the wrong time in the cycle.\n\nHealth warning: beware lending to monolines. When tight spreads persist, they insist.\n\nHealth warning: beware investing in legacy-only reinsurers. Confirmation bias dooms the business model and, along the way, guillotine-level adverse selection hangs over every trade. When a one-off risk-transfer price is highly attractive for clear and imperative strategic reasons, hyper-selective, non-legacy-only investors can profitably escape with their heads, but at Stone Ridge we know half-priced sushi does not mean it’s a bargain.\n\nA decade ago, there were about a dozen dedicated legacy firms and funds. Today, one large player remains, though recently its credibility detonated after initiating litigation against a client. The other remaining legacy-only firms are subscale or regionally focused. Enter Longtail Re.\n\nHumble beginnings, a clear vision\n\nStone Ridge began Longtail Re in 2020 focused on two simple ideas: 1) partner, not compete with the world’s best underwriters to generate a portfolio of hyper-diversified casualty liabilities that deliver low-cost float, and 2) invest that float in proprietary and valuable Stone Ridge-generated fixed income assets with superior risk-adjusted expected return.\n\nAlways open to Bayesian updating of its prior distribution core business model of prospective quota shares, Longtail Re’s positioning has always been: be available for new data and a reshaped posterior legacy transactions from motivated parties we know well and who call us, but do not be in the legacy business.\n\nOut of almost 100 legacy trade requests since inception, Longtail has written…three. Three.\n\nLongtail executed one of those three in November, a record $1.4 billion retrospective reinsurance transaction with Everest Group, an S&P 500 company, with whom Stone Ridge has an excellent, 13-year, uninterrupted trading relationship. Everest had compelling corporate reasons to de-risk, and the transaction with us, albeit enormous in the legacy space, was only one part of an even larger clear and imperative strategic repositioning of their entire firm. And of non-negotiable importance to us, we know (for many years), like, and trust Everest’s new CEO.\n\nThe trade has an outstanding expected return profile and diversifies Longtail’s core prospective portfolio because it covers past underwriting years back to 2003. It was also the largest legacy trade of Longtail CEO Mike Sapnar’s career, and mine.\n\nOn their most recent earnings call, Everest’s CEO said, “I was really, really glad that we were able to do this transaction with Longtail Re and Mike Sapnar...those are super credible underwriters. They did an excellent job evaluating the portfolio…it got to economics that will be very, very good for Longtail Re.” We agree.\n\nAs only Bayesian treasure hunting reinsurance geeks can, we internally renamed the core trade of the legacy reinsurance industry – a Loss Portfolio Transfer or LPT – to WPT. Waiting Portfolio Treasure.  Recall I said geeks. And who wants losses?\n\nLongtail ends 2025 with more than $6 billion in assets, about ⅓ from WPT, up from zero WPT 18 months ago.  Most important, Longtail has delivered 20% annualized ROE since inception in 2020, 16%/year higher than the average of the top three global reinsurers, our aspirational peer group in the decades ahead.\n\nLongtail may do its next legacy trade in two years, or five, or never. In recent pre-search research, we discovered a faded 1622 salvage account in Seville – aka PwC’s Annual Global Insurance Run-Off Survey – suggesting about $1 trillion of WPT may be out there, somewhere, buried in old reinsurance balance sheets. Our Bayesian training tells us about 97 out of 100 legacy treasure hunts would be for fool’s gold, but also that about $30 billion of real treasure awaits. I’m betting on Longtail’s Bayesian treasure hunters to find it.\n\nJust last year, The Atlantic wrote, “15 years into its existence, bitcoin has yet to demonstrate any serious use case.”vi\n\n87% of humans today – though definitely no one who edits articles at The Atlantic – were born into a monetary system without a reserve currency, and also without democracy, rule of law, or property rights. Simply put, the way The Atlantic editors use money is not the way most people on earth use money, whose savings technology is either collapsing paper notes, cattle, or sheet metal.\n\nSeething with financial privilege, The Atlantic editors might debate the relative merits of saving in NVDA vs. AMZN. How about, instead, cattle vs. sheet metal?\n\nIf bitcoin has no use case, perhaps The Atlantic editors should convert their entire life savings into Malawian Kwacha and see how it goes. In 2023, Malawi – generally considered a democratic country – chose a 44% overnight currency devaluation. And…it’s gone.vii If you don’t hold bitcoin, please step out of the line. This line is for people who have money. Not fiat credit.\n\nNo one got to vote on the inhuman cruelty of almost halving – overnight – the cumulative value of their entire life’s work. Instead, the criminal counterfeiters central bank forced The Atlantic editors 22 million humans to invest their life savings in unbacked pieces of paper with zero marginal production cost, turning them, ex-post, into 44% slaves. Nothing produced limitlessly and for free can ever, eventually, have value. Fiat is always and everywhere a ponzi phenomenon with seigniorage the State’s irresistibly silent Madoff-like pitch. Bitcoin, its kryptonite, will never take the meeting.\n\nStill no use case? Let’s try another one.\n\n“There isn’t a single goddamn thing that bitcoin can do for retail that Apple Pay doesn’t already do 10x better.”\n\n— The Atlantic editors bitcoin critic on Twitter (2019)\n\n“I CAN’T use Apple pay/PayPal/Visa/Master or anything like them.  \nI’m from Iran\nI CAN use bitcoin\nWhat do you have to say?!\"\n\n— Ziya Sadr, Iranian human rights activist subsequently jailed for freedom advocacy (recently released)\n\nThe critic issued a public apology.\n\nStill no use case? Before we try a final one, a Stoic parable about awe can provide some context:\n\nWhen we were very young, the world was an awe-inspiring place. Watch a three-year-old watch her dad fill up a castle-shaped bucket with wet sand at the beach. She is fascinated that her father would do such a thing, but when he inverts the bucket and carefully lifts it up – revealing a perfect sandcastle – the three-year-old is awestruck that such magic is possible and that her father has power to perform that magic.\n\nIf we meet that three-year-old ten years later, maybe she has 25% of the capacity for awe she had that day at the beach.\n\nAnd ten years after that, her capacity for awe might be down to 1% of its sandcastle level.viii\n\nIn one of the most moving days of my life, on December 10th in Oslo I got to attend the very intimate award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize. My battery capacity for awe recharged to 100%.\n\nMaría Corina Machado won for her decades-long commitment to freedom, democracy, and human dignity in Venezuela.  In 2023, with more than one-third of her country’s 30 million citizens having fled to survive – the largest refugee population in the world – Machado decided to run for President against the brutal dictator Maduro, her campaign the personification of ultimate bravery.\n\n“Traveling by road and dirt path across a country with gasoline shortages, daily blackouts, and collapsing communications,”ix  Machado risked her life just to campaign. On July 28, 2024, her supporters risked theirs just to vote. In a nationwide eruption of truth, Machado won in a landslide.x  The repressive Maduro regime ignored the results, clung to power illegally, and forced Machado into hiding.\n\nThey tried to bury us.\nThey didn’t know we were seeds.\n\nIn late 2024, from a secret location, Machado was interviewed by the Human Rights Foundation’s (HRF) Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, saying,\n\n“The world knows of Chavez and Maduro's human rights abuses, but less about their violations of financial rights, turning a functional economy into a catastrophic financial crisis. In 2018, inflation reached 1.7 million percent. This financial repression rooted in state sponsored looting, theft, and money printing happened despite our vast natural resources.\n\nBeyond wrecking the currency, the regime weaponized financial systems against its people, freezing accounts, seizing assets, and cutting off services. Venezuelans found a lifeline in bitcoin during hyperinflation, using it to protect their wealth and to finance their escape. Today, bitcoin bypasses government-imposed exchange rates and thus helps many of our people. It has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance. We are grateful for the lifeline bitcoin provides and look forward to embracing it in a new democratic Venezuela. We envision bitcoin becoming part of our national reserves, helping rebuild what the dictatorship stole. Before our gold reserves were plundered, Venezuela had wealthy financial reserves worldwide. We will restore those reserves and include bitcoin as a key component.\n\nUnlike bank wires, which the regime blocks, bitcoin donations cannot be seized. Let's use this technology to bring about the change Venezuela desperately needs.\n\nWe are determined to assert our sovereignty and transform Venezuela into an open, prosperous, and secure society, something that is only possible in a free nation.”\n\nWe await The Atlantic’s public apology.\n\nUpon news of her Nobel win, Machado began plotting her escape from hiding. She wanted to be in Oslo as a symbol for her people and the world. When it was time, Machado – in a wigged disguise and under the cover of dark – left her jungle hiding spot, evaded multiple regime checkpoints, took a tiny fishing boat through treacherous waters, and finally – miraculously – boarded a supporter’s private plane to make it to Oslo. It would be impossible to overstate the danger Machado faced to escape.\n\nAlmost immediately upon landing, at 3am local time – after hugging her family, or anyone, for the first time since she had gone into hiding 16 months earlier, and in the same clothes she began her now immensely historic day – Machado sat for an interview with BBC News.xi\n\nI immediately noticed she sounded different.\n\nAlready the world’s most inspirational living human rights activist, some transcendent combination of her time in hiding, winning the Nobel, and successful escape gave Machado’s tone, timbre, and bearing a Mandela-like ascendence and regality. She spoke with extraordinary moral authority and absolute certainty about future events, words coming through her with divine clarity, Machado now destined to become among the greatest female leaders of all time.\n\n“Venezuela has turned into a nation in which the state applies terrorism. The regime has control of all institutions and has applied state terrorism towards innocent people and committed crimes against humanity. And everybody that dares to speak out, to defend any of your basic rights, takes a huge risk and probably ends in prison. Just for posting news about the Nobel Prize, you will get in prison. And if they go looking for you and they don't find you in your house, they will take your family, even children in prison.\n\nSo, they had to say that I'm a terrorist, that I have to be in jail for the rest of my life, and they're looking for me. So, certainly, leaving Venezuela today in these circumstances is very, very dangerous. So, I just want to say today that I'm here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo. And I came here on behalf of them, and the millions of anonymous Venezuelan heroes to receive the prize and to take it back to them, because it's theirs.\n\nI'm going back to Venezuela. The Venezuelan government would have disappeared me if they found me when I was in Venezuela. And I know exactly the risks I'm taking. And what I've said to the Venezuelan people from the beginning is I'm going to be in the place where I am more useful for our cause. And until very short time ago, the place where I thought I had to be was Venezuela. The place where I believe I have to be today on behalf of our cause is Oslo.”\n\nIn his 1978 essay The Power of the Powerless, human rights activist Václav Havel – leader of the Velvet Revolution, first President of the post-Communist Czech Republic, and HRF’s first Chairman – makes the searing point that though authoritarians can mobilize their heavy artillery of terror, torture, imprisonment, and persecution, they are not equipped to fight the asymmetric battle between lies and truth.\n\nVenezuelan regime change can also be an asymmetric truth domino – the animating spark for revolutionary excitement, heroism, and power among the powerless – that then topples the other nearby dictators in Cuba and Nicaragua. That cumulative outcome would be of immense significance to America, and that possibility has been hugely motivational to me. For American global primacy to continue, which it must, this must be the Western Hemisphere’s century. No authoritarians allowed in the neighborhood.\n\nThe majority of my personal philanthropy is anonymous, and it will stay that way. However, in the hope of inspiring followershipxii  at this moment of maximum human rights gamma, I will share that I have long supported Alex Gladstein’s work arming the only people dictators fear – human rights activists – with large quantities of Satoshi’s unstoppable truth-telling weapon. Bitcoin is money dictators can’t stop. I know firsthand its importance to HRF.\n\nAsleep during Machado’s BBC News interview, I left Oslo a few hours later, hustling back to New York to host the Stone Ridge holiday party that evening. After landing, I saw, and then listened to, a voicenote attached to an encrypted message. Mouth agape, I recognized the voice immediately. With an ascendence and regality that moved me to tears by the end, here is the message in full:\n\nI want to thank you personally for your support of the Human Rights Foundation and all the programs that have made possible this unique moment in Oslo this week.\n\nBecause of your support I was able to move, to arrive where I needed to be and to continue to fight without interruption. You know in moments like these, logistics are the whole difference between presence and absence.\n\nI arrived late and I didn’t have a chance to thank you in person as I wanted, or to tell you about the plans we have in the time to come, but I know that we will have a chance to do that very soon. I want you to know that your personal commitment to our struggle for freedom translates directly into action.\n\nIt gives our people and people like us the ability to stand where it matters and when it matters so I am very, very grateful for your clarity of purpose, for your belief in freedom and certainly for your willingness to stand for this freedom in both practice and principle.\n\nI will not cease in this struggle for freedom, and I certainly look forward to welcoming you and hosting you and your family in our beautiful country and a free Venezuela.\n\nThank you for making so much happen. I look forward to seeing you and please take very good care.”\n\nBitcoin has a use case.  Human rights treasure.\n\nAnd with Machado walking among us, we need not live life devoid of feelings of awe.\n\nIn 1984 Apple, then still Apple Computer, premiered a sci-fi short film – a commercial at the Super Bowl – in which a rebellious heroine smashes a screen, symbolizing Apple breaking free from the conformity of IBM’s Big Brother. Widely considered the greatest commercial of all-time for almost four decades, it established Apple’s identity, paved the way for the Mac, and led to record sales.\n\nIn 2020, also at the Super Bowl, Apple was dethroned. New York Life premiered an even better commercial paving the way for the next chapter of its identity, also leading to record sales. Over the course of 60 emotional seconds, New York Life began by briefly exploring three Greek words for love (Philia, Storgē, Eros) to then focus on the fourth, Agape, or love as an action. The ad contained powerful scenes of care, including a ten-year-old boy lifting his little brother over a country fence en route to adventure, and a 50-year-old son lowering his frail 95-year-old father into a tub to help him bathe. The commercial anchored the firm’s 175th anniversary branding of building better futures through love and financial security.\n\nThe ancient Greeks had four words for love. The first is Philia. Philia is affection that grows from friendship. Next there’s Storgē, the kind you have for a grandparent. Or a brother. Third, there’s Eros, the uncontrollable urge to say, “I love you.” The fourth kind of love is different. It’s the most admirable. It’s called Agape: love as an action. It takes courage, sacrifice, strength; for 175 years we’ve been helping people act on their love so they can look back – or ahead – and say, “We got it right. We did good.”\n\nStone Ridge takes immense pride in working for the policyholders of New York Life, and also MassMutual, iconic American firms and our largest partners, 180-years-old and 174-years-old, respectively. Mutuals are special. They feel different inside. There is no conflict of interest between the shareholders and the policyholders because there are no shareholders. The policyholders own the firm, a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction. Employees stay for decades, and the top executives view themselves, appropriately and inspirationally to me, as leaders and stewards. My Stone Ridge colleagues and I run to work every day for New York Life and MassMutual. And we aspire for our little firm to be like those big guys when we grow up.\n\nSince any company’s longevity, on a long enough timescale, is entirely dependent on its ability to reinvent itself, the most underappreciated characteristic of these mutuals is their astonishing consistency of innovation. The typical firm in the S&P 500 is 58 years old, not 180. No business can do tomorrow what it did yesterday and last very long, let alone do in the next century what it did in the last.\n\nConsider that these mutuals paid claims during the Civil War when – remember, their core product is life insurance – their policyholders were shooting each other. They paid claims after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, decades before Hannover Re-quality earthquake seismologists could help them properly underwrite that risk. And they paid claims through the two global pandemics, twice surviving life insurers’ one true tail risk.\n\nExtraordinary financial strength, ironclad reliable claims payment, and a monumentally underrated culture of innovation = New York Life and MassMutual.\n\nWatching these reinventing mutuals up close has also taught me that firms seeking longevity – including Stone Ridge – must, just as importantly, decide what must not change. What is our air-gapped mission? What are the rituals we dare not cease?  What routines – the ones that make us us – shall we pass to new colleagues? In essence, what are we stewards of?\n\n“In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.”\n\n— Coco Chanel, revolutionary fashion designer\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all. Our rituals are few, important, and sacrosanct. Our routines drive our productivity.\n\nWe work five days/week in office and have a “no-device” policy in meetings, routines that maximize exposure to the uncorrelated weirdness of our spectacular coleagues. Fiddling with a device in a meeting means you do not belong in that meeting. Meetings should be rare, riveting, and short. Zero is the wrong number of meetings for a firm, but it is close. A meeting-less firm with 100 employees has 4,950 potential 1:1 colleague-collisions all day long. Remove 10% of the team for an unnecessary meeting and lose 945 potential collisions. That meeting-math is especially punishing at Stone Ridge. Our people are our moat, dug deeper per collision.\n\n“A lot of people never use their initiative because no one told them to.”\n\nInitiating collisions with insanely smart colleagues at Stone Ridge can seem intimidating at first, but you must take the initiative to ever create a map in which X marks the spot. My advice to my colleagues is the same advice I give to my 18- and 23-year-old boys.  Ask her out. Whether “she” is a hard class, a job, a city, a beautiful woman, or a brilliant Stone Ridge colleague – just go up and talk.xiv And remember, Stone Ridge colleagues are insanely kind too.\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we care deeply about how we present ourselves to outsiders because we matter, and so do they. When introducing ourselves in meetings, we mention our role and how long we have been at the firm. “Hi, I’m Ross Stevens, the CEO, and I’ve been at Stone Ridge since 2012.” After meetings, we walk our guests to the elevator, along the way sincerely thanking them for the visit. Sometimes we even take the elevator down with them so we can thank them some more. Finally, business cards are back. Business cards remind us we live in a tactile world, and our most tactile experiences are with other humans. Business cards also symbolize something of value – you. Our simple meeting routines honor ourselves and our firm and show proper respect to our visitors.\n\n“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”\n\nOver the last 36 months, three Stone Ridge colleagues voluntarily left to work at another firm. Each was junior in their career and had a ten-month average tenure with us. Clearly, Stone Ridge was not for them. We, in turn, reflected on what happened in each instance and refined our recruiting process, uninterested in transience in any element of our life’s work. Though Stone Ridge achieved, with plenty of room to spare, my singular KPI – less than 1%/year voluntary turnover – those three departures were exactly three too many to me. I intend to raise my game in 2026, so please tune in – same Bat-Time, same Bat-Channel – to see if I had a better year.\n\n“I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me.”\n\nDespite the three leavers, Stone Ridge got something very important, very right at firm inception: no HR. No HR is the gift that keeps on giving because the very best people are repelled by those addicted to comfort. When new folks arrive at Stone Ridge and realize we have no HR, a lens cap lifts off their consciousness. Surrounded by elite intellectual athletes, they immediately begin their training to be one, feeling compelled to do remarkable things, utterly untethered to what they previously thought possible. We teach them business physics, but also to feel bound by nothing. I would not dare limit their leaps even one inch with even one minute of an infantilizing HR training session.\n\n“He is no longer a dreamer.  He is a creator.”\n\n— Sculptor Auguste Rodin, describing his masterpiece The Thinker\n\nOne of my favorite untethered Stone Ridge policies is unlimited maternity leave, which has been true since the firm began. I think of Agape. It takes care and action to properly delegate your duties to your remaining colleagues while you enjoy that magical time with your family. In action and a bit of love, your colleagues lock arms and step up for you, so the firm does not miss a beat in your absence, the duration of which I refuse to meter. It also takes action and a bit of love to take no action. The awesome women of Stone Ridge know their job will be waiting for them when they get back. I sometimes wonder if that ever helps them decide to create more treasure.\n\n“It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how.”\n\n— Philosopher The Cat, on his approach to work in his masterpiece The Cat in the Hat\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we relentlessly focus on growing after-tax cash flow to drive durable equity value in our operating businesses. Our progress has never resembled a straight line up and to the right, and I hope it never does. However, thinking deeply about what we know before we know, open-mindedness to – and hunger for – new data, and extremely rapid posterior updating – and ultimately the courage to create with conviction when we believe it is time – have been the hallmarks of our operating model since firm inception.\n\nThe first rule of product design at Stone Ridge is we build products we want for ourselves. Stone Ridge is always the seed investor and, whenever possible – but not yet always – the largest. Consider our “no-device” policy in this context. Would you ever pull out your phone and start scrolling in the middle of a meeting with your largest investor? At Stone Ridge, we do not pull our phones out on each other.\n\nWith Stone Ridge increasingly Stone Ridge’s largest investor, the scale of our profits as principals, not agents, creates a level of alignment with our outside investors we are unaware exists elsewhere. Those investors occasionally remark that this is a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction, and that Stone Ridge feels different inside.\n\nEarlier this year, Stone Ridge Holdings Group (SRHG), parent company of Stone Ridge Asset Management, NYDIG, and Longtail Re, completed a significant primary equity financing led by an iconic American financial services firm – also a mutual, though this one a relatively spry 165-year-old – we are thrilled to partner with in the decades ahead.\n\nDespite regularly rising profitability, regularly raising primary equity for our parent and affiliates – $4.6 billion and counting, and only primary, ever – has been our quiet way of strengthening our most important partnerships, playing muscular defense when the sky falls in our markets, and playing profitable post-event offense in the aftermath.\n\nFounding 2012 SRHG investors have received 32x their original investment in distributions and now own equity valued up 178x net of those distributions, an annualized total return of 50%.  Fisher took 5,954 days to find the Atocha. We have been at it for 4,930. Every morning, I bang our little ship’s pots and pans with a smile because I know Stone Ridge will find the treasure.\n\nAs we enter 2026, our tanks are filled with energy, gratitude, and inspiration. We innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all.\n\nStone Ridge is most proud of the partnership we have with you, our investors. We are on the path together. You contribute the capital to propel and sustain groundbreaking product development. We contribute our collective careers’ worth of experience in sourcing, structuring, execution, and risk management. Together, it works. In that spirit, I offer my deepest gratitude to you for sharing your wealth with us this year. We look forward to serving you again in 2026.",

    "fullText": "‘Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary isn't blaming the economy for your empty bank account. He's blaming you. And he's not shy about it.\n\n\"Listen, I'm going to tell you something most people don't want to hear,\" O'Leary said in a December YouTube video titled \"If You Want To Get Rich, Stop Buying These 5 Things.\" \"You're broke. Not because you don't make enough money, not because the economy is rigged against you, not because you didn't get lucky. You're broke because you keep buying stupid things that are keeping you poor.\"\n\nFrom the first line, O'Leary makes it clear—building wealth doesn't start with more income. It starts with cutting the nonsense.\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nHis first target? That shiny new car in your driveway.\n\n\"Buying a new car is one of the dumbest financial decisions you can make,\" O'Leary said. A car drops 20% to 30% in value the second you drive it off the lot, he explained, turning thousands of dollars into dust—for nothing but \"that new car smell.\" And leasing? \"Leasing is the absolute worst,\" he said. \"You're renting a depreciating asset… You gave the dealership thousands of dollars for the privilege of borrowing their car.\"\n\nHis advice is brutal but simple: \"Buy a three-year-old certified pre-owned car. Let somebody else take the depreciation hit. That's what rich people do.\"\n\nO'Leary isn't just coming for your car. He's coming for your kitchen—or more accurately, the one you refuse to use. \"People tell me they don't have money to invest. And then I watch them spend $15 on a salad for lunch,\" he said. That's not a splurge. It's financial self-sabotage.\n\nThe average American spends nearly $4,000 a year eating out, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. O'Leary runs the math: investing that same $3,500 annually for 30 years at 10% could become more than $600,000. \"You're trading half a million dollars in retirement wealth for convenience and fancy meals you'll forget about in 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nPack your lunch. Make your coffee at home. \"These aren't sacrifices,\" O'Leary said. \"These are smart financial decisions.\" But when you do eat out, he says, at least make it count. \"Don't waste money on mediocre chain restaurants because you're too lazy to cook. That's not living well. That's being financially irresponsible.\"",

    "description": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett, 95, is set to step down as the CEO of Berkshire Hathway at the end of the year.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway is gearing up for the biggest leadership shake-up in decades, and one strategist thinks it presents the perfect time to buy the stock.\n\nBarbara Goodstein, a managing partner at R360, an invitation-only investment and networking group for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, told CNBC on Monday that longtime Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett's impending departure offered a \"lot of opportunity\" for investors.\n\nBuffett, 95, is set to step down as the CEO of Berkshire at the end of 2025 after nearly 60 years in the role. He will be replaced by Greg Abel, who heads the firm's non-insurance businesses and will stay on as its chairman.\n\nGoodstein said the change did not make Berkshire stock any less attractive.\n\n\"We are strong into Berkshire Hathaway, we've always respected their moves,\" she said, adding: \"We're calling this a 'succession discount.'\"\n\n\"We think the stock is trading below what it will become because everybody is waiting to see how Greg Abel performs.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stock price is up nearly 11% this year.\n\nGoodstein pointed to Berkshire's cash pile as particularly intriguing, saying she believed the firm had been \"sitting on it\" to allow Abel to make a \"big move in 2026.\"\n\nIn the third quarter, Berkshire grew its cash pile to a new record of more than $350 billion, or $382 billion if payables for Treasury purchases were excluded. The company also reported a 34% year-on-year increase in operating income to $13.5 billion.\n\nUnder Abel's leadership, Goodstein added that she thought Berkshire may look to invest in energy or defense.\n\n\"Berkshire Hathaway is well-positioned. They've always been looking at the trends. And we think that those are the two sectors that have lots of upside.\"\n\nBuffett announced his decision to step down as chief executive in May, during the closing moments of his company's annual meeting in Omaha.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders in November, Buffett addressed the looming changes and heaped praise on Abel, calling him a \"great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator.\"\n\n\"I can't think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government — you name it — that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "The chipmaker’s sprawling partnerships are driving extraordinary growth but also bank its future on the AI boom paying off quickly\n\nNvidia is, in crucial ways, nothing like Enron – the Houston energy giant that imploded through multibillion-dollar accounting fraud in 2001. Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.\n\nBut the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.\n\nNow worth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world’s AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.\n\nThis year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging from a $5bn investment into Intel – to facilitate its access to the PC market – to $100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nBut even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executive Jensen Huang’s energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.\n\nThe start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing: Nvidia lending money to customers so they can buy its products.\n\nThe largest of these is its deal with OpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia’s chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThe circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.\n\nJames Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, but said this year that the OpenAI deal presented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.\n\nHe added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”\n\nOther high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMD signed a multibillion-dollar chip deal that also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.\n\nThere is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”\n\nAll these moves form part of OpenAI’s $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies – and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.\n\nNvidia has also used structures called special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk’s xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThis drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.\n\nNvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.\n\nThe journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidia is not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent’s dotcom bubble partners. And it isn’t like Enron, Zitron argues, because it’s being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.\n\nSo what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”\n\nEssentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia’s customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.\n\nApproached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.\n\nIn particular, Kress argued that Nvidia’s recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.\n\nThere is another complexity, which is that Nvidia’s health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.\n\nAdd to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and South Korean companies. The value of this deal was not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.\n\nLikewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.\n\nGovernments are likely to pay. There’s nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.\n\n“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia’s revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”",

    "description": "\"Shark Tank\" and \"Marty Supreme\" star Kevin O'Leary explains his daily routine, which includes eating protein, biking, taking naps, and avoiding email.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Canadian businessman and entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary, 71, who gained popularity spending over nearly two decades as the blunt-talking investor on \"Shark Tank\" sarcastically nicknamed \"Mr. Wonderful.\" The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in Montreal and Ottawa and received my MBA in 1980. My second business, the software company SoftKey, became successful enough to acquire the educational software company The Learning Company in 1995. Four years later, I sold it to Mattel for $4.2 billion.\n\nI became a venture capitalist, mutual fund manager, and did some Canadian TV, starring on \"Dragon's Den,\" a reality series where entrepreneurs pitched ideas to a panel of investors. A few years later, Mark Burnett took me to lunch, as he wanted me to be one of the investors in a US version of \"Dragon's Den,\" called \"Shark Tank.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a real asshole, and you're it,\" he told me. The rest is history.\n\nI'm also acting for the first time, playing a business tycoon named Milton Rockwell in the Timothée Chalamet movie \"Marty Supreme,\" which is in theaters on Christmas Day.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nI don't need an alarm. Sometimes, when I have to be somewhere, I'll set it. But it's just a natural rhythm for me to get up at 5 a.m.\n\nGenerally, in business, there are five stories that start in Asia and then come sweeping across the globe. So I get up and watch the different feeds from Europe and Asia so I'm up to speed.\n\nAt about 6:45, when it gets light out, I get on my bike and ride for about 12 miles.\n\nI generally work out for about an hour and a half every day. It's for longevity and mental acuity; I have to do that, otherwise bad things happen.\n\nI don't eat breakfast. I fast for 16 hours and only have two meals a day. I'll have coffee in the mornings, but I don't buy it. That's stupid. Why would I pay five bucks when I can just make a coffee? I don't get it.\n\nI used to work for Steve Jobs. Before I sold The Learning Company to Mattel, we worked with Apple a lot to get the Mac into schools. He had this concept of signal and noise. He believed that you needed to do three things, and you had to get them done every day. You need a ratio of at least 70% signal, which are the three things, and the 30% can be noise, whatever is going to stop you from getting the three things done.\n\nIn entrepreneurship, and certainly in what I do today as an investor, there is no holiday, there's no workday — that doesn't exist. It's what you want to do with your time. So I pick three things I want to get done that day, and I don't let anything get in the way until those three things are done.\n\nI don't do emails anymore because I get anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 a day. I've tried every system to take the crap out, but over the years, my email address has gotten out there, and so it's just a constant stream of noise and garbage. As we speak, I see the emails just pouring in. I'm never going to get to them, so I don't try. So people who need to get a hold of me know that they are going to do that through messaging.\n\nLike my family. We have a family chat. That's very important messaging for me. It's perfect for when we are all in the same place. Through the day everyone is doing their own thing, but we figure out through the chat where we'll go out for dinner.\n\nI usually have fish and salad for lunch. Generally, I'm trying to eat 130 grams of protein a day. I do track my diet very closely, so I don't eat any shit food. There's no snacking or fast food. You can really change your productivity and how you feel with your energy by just eating a better diet and drinking less. I don't do drugs, I don't smoke, but I love wine. And I'm very careful when I drink that.\n\nA lot of my daily routine has been developed by working with successful people over the decades. I never gave a shit about sleep. I never slept at all. I could work off three hours of sleep, but then I met this CEO, and she said, \"You know something, why don't you try for 10 days getting seven hours and twenty minutes of sleep?\"\n\nI tried it for 10 days, and was she ever right. I felt so much better. My energy was up 30%, at least. And I felt like a million bucks in the morning. I felt really good.\n\nSo I got into the routine of finding seven hours and twenty minutes, and napping counts. So I nap in limos. I'm able to fall asleep as soon as we start driving. I tell the driver, \"Turn off the radio, I'm going to sleep,\" so 20 minutes to get there, I grab that 20 minutes of sleep.\n\nI like to eat around 7 p.m. or 7:30 p.m. A light Steely Dan vibe in the background is pretty good.\n\nI'll eat protein and have a glass of white wine, a Montrachet. I'll then move to red, a Burgundy or a Bordeaux. I'll keep it to two glasses, three max. I really try not to drink three hours before I go to bed. Because that screws up your sleep.\n\nMy wife and I generally watch a movie and then are in bed by 10 p.m. or 10:30 p.m.\n\nI've noticed something over the years in the people I invest in. The successful managers, entrepreneurs, founders, they all try something that they may not succeed in. So every time I get an opportunity that's completely outside my comfort zone, that I've never done before, that people tell me I'll probably fail in, I do it.\n\nI remember the conversation I had with my agent Jay Sures at UTA about doing \"Marty Supreme.\" He said, \"Listen Kevin, you're going to get offered this role but I want to warn you about something: You're not a scripted actor, you could shit the bed and destroy your brand that we're both making millions of dollars off of right now. You've got to think about this.\" And I said, \"Fuck that, I'm doing it.\"\n\nBut making the movie messed with my routine big time. Over an eight-month period, I worked on the film in New York and Tokyo. Some scenes I didn't shoot until 3:30 in the morning.\n\nAnd then there was the amount of takes the director Josh Safdie does. He wanted perfection — beyond perfection — so the takes would take hours. In the beginning, because I'm not used to working in a totalitarian environment, I finally said to Josh, \"Listen, this is my 25th take, I nailed it six times.\" And he looked at me and said, \"You haven't nailed it until I've said you've nailed it, do it again!\"\n\nI'm used to telling people, \"We're done,\" so that was the first thing I learned. But then when I saw the movie, these guys really knew what they were doing; it's unbelievable.\n\nBut I did get my naps in! I have hair in the movie, so I had to be in the makeup chair for hours to put it on and take it off. So there were two to three hours of free sleep there.\n\n\"Marty Supreme\" is in theaters nationwide on Christmas Day.",

    "fullText": "Healthcare didn't become confusing overnight. It got there slowly, buried under paperwork, billing codes, and middlemen most patients never asked for. That frustration is what Mark Cuban, the self-made billionaire and longtime Shark Tank investor, decided to unpack on his own — without being asked.\n\nIn January, Cuban returned to his personal site, Blog Maverick, after a long stretch of silence. \"I haven't published anything on here in a long, long time.. Thought it would be fun to start up again,\" he wrote. He said the post was meant to be informal and exploratory. \"I wanted to give some stream of consciousness thoughts on how I think we can ‘fix' the economics of healthcare.. Hopefully I make a lot of folks think and make a lot of folks in the industry think harder.\"\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nFrom there, Cuban went straight to what he sees as the core problem. \"Healthcare is a very simple industry made complicated,\" he wrote, arguing that the complexity isn't driven by better care but by the pursuit of margin dollars.\n\nWhen Cuban asked what healthcare should look like, his answer was intentionally retro. \"Hypothetically, it should look like 1955,\" he wrote. \"Patients go to providers for care. Providers provide that care. Patients get a bill and if they can afford it, they pay that bill. That's it.\"\n\nIn his view, everything else is secondary. \"The ONLY question in healthcare should be ‘How should care for people who can't afford to pay for their care be paid?'\" he wrote. The rest, he suggested, is noise layered onto a transaction that used to be straightforward.\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nCuban also took aim at how pricing gets obscured. He criticized bundled charges, markups on basic supplies, and contracts so complex they hide real costs. Publishing prices alone doesn't solve it, he argued, when \"everyone bundles and upcodes and plays games.\"\n\nInsurance companies, he wrote, are a major source of that distortion. Managing and administering payments alone can add 20% to 30% in overhead, before accounting for fraud and overbilling. \"That's real money,\" Cuban said, especially in a system he estimates costs about $5 trillion a year.",

    "title": "A real estate investor and agent explains why 2 days before Christmas is her 'favorite day of the year' to submit home offers — and other 'pockets' when you can score a good deal",
    "description": "\"It's always a good time to be deal hunting during a distracted market,\" says real-estate agent and investor Dana Bull.",
    "fullText": "The holiday season might not seem like a big window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers to get their bids seen by sellers, but one real estate agent argues it's actually an ideal time to score a deal.\n\nIf real-estate investor and agent Dana Bull was looking to expand her portfolio, she'd be putting in offers in late December — specifically, two days before Christmas.\n\nDecember 23 is her \"favorite day of the year to submit an offer,\" she told Business Insider. \"I find that sellers are very interested in getting a deal done going into the holidays or going into this year.\"\n\nBull works in real estate in a variety of capacities: She's a licensed agent, does real-estate consulting and coaching, and is a seasoned investor who owns multi-family and single-family homes throughout Massachusetts.\n\nShe's learned that if you want to land a good deal on a property, timing matters.\n\n\"It's always a good time to be deal hunting during a distracted market,\" Bull said — and people tend to be distracted over the holidays. \"Most people are just in coast mode, but if you're not in coast mode or if you can take yourself out of coast mode, this is such a great time.\"\n\nStarting a negotiation a few days before Christmas is a good time for several reasons.\n\n\"In general, people are in good spirits, and sellers tend to feel a sense of relief if they receive an offer because they usually aren't expecting one,\" she said. \"Christmas Eve puts a deadline to get things wrapped up with the negotiating and creates a sense of urgency.\"\n\nShe says she would avoid submitting an offer on actual holidays — \"it's a bit rude and unrealistic to get a response\" — but the days following Christmas are fair game. \"I almost always submit an offer that week. It's a time of great reflection, and sellers are generally motivated to put a deal together so they can enter the new year with a plan in place.\"\n\nThe holiday window of opportunity is small. A couple of weeks into January, \"it's like a light switch comes back on,\" she said, noting that mid-January is one of her busiest times of the year for consultations. \"What I've noticed is this herd mentality where everybody just ebbs and flows at the same time, so if you can be flowing when everybody else is ebbing, this is when you can negotiate.\"\n\nThat said, \"You don't want to make a bad purchase just because it's a good time of year,\" Bull added, but if you can carve out time to look for deals when most other investors aren't, you could be rewarded.\n\n\"There are always these pockets, like the Fourth of July is another great time where people have signed off, and I'm almost always working with somebody that weekend to try to scrounge something up.\"\n\nSeasonal swings aren't a myth, and they can be significant. In her market, for example, \"Massachusetts has huge seasonal swings in average pricing by like $100,000.\"\n\nIn the markets where Bull is active, in the winter, \"prices always come down,\" she added. \"And then they're going to start to climb. Then, in the summer they come back down again and they climb again in the fall. Every year it's the same quarterly trend, so if you are looking to buy a house, right now is one of the best times.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on December 9, 2024.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "description": "Diameter Capital Partners made successful telecom and satellite bets as AI demand spread beyond chips.",
    "fullText": "The artificial intelligence boom is real — but there's more to the AI trade than chips alone, according to a credit investor.\n\n\"This is a super-duper micro cycle that will outlast many investing careers,\" said Scott Goodwin, the cofounder and managing partner of Diameter Capital Partners, a quote he attributed to his partner Jonathan Lewinsohn.\n\nAI represents what Diameter Capital sees as a long-running, disruptive cycle — but buying the most obvious winners isn't the only way to play it, he said on the \"Goldman Sachs Exchanges\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nDiameter Capital, which manages approximately $25 billion in assets, has focused on where AI demand could create less obvious bottlenecks — and where those bottlenecks show up in credit markets.\n\nThat view led Diameter to buy the unsecured debt of a midsize telecommunications company in 2023.\n\nGoodwin said the bet was rooted in the idea that as companies move from training AI models to actually using them, demand shifts away from chips alone and toward the networks that carry data.\n\n\"It had to leave the data center. How would it leave? It would leave on the commercial fiber, the pipes,\" he said.\n\nThe telco went on to sign more than $10 billion in contracts with hyperscale cloud providers, and the debt has rebounded to face value, Goodwin said.\n\nDiameter Capital also made \"a big bet\" on a satellite company tied to the wireless spectrum — a wager that later paid off after the company sold spectrum assets and the debt returned to face value.\n\nGoodwin's comments come amid growing debate over whether sky-high AI valuations are sustainable and whether investors are overlooking other opportunities tied to the technology.\n\nGoodwin warned that parts of the AI-credit boom may be taking on risk that's hard to price, especially in chip finance.\n\nSome investors, he said, are taking on \"residual risk,\" or the riskiest slice of chip-financing deals — betting on what the hardware might be worth years from now. Cutting-edge firms refresh their technology often, so chips can quickly become outdated for some customers.\n\n\"We call up really smart people in Silicon Valley, we call up really smart people at Big Tech companies and ask them what the residual value is on these chips three, four, five, six, seven years forward,\" he said. \"None of them have a clue.\"\n\nGoodwin said the next phase isn't just about spending on infrastructure — it's about competitive disruption rather than capital expenditure.\n\n\"Who are the companies, who are the entities that are going to adopt AI and take a step forward versus their peers? And who are going to be the losers?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is actually a longer cycle than the capex cycle, so that's really interesting,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Peter Schiff warned that Bitcoin is unlikely to find a durable bottom at $50,000.\n\nSchiff argued that Strategy’s valuation is vulnerable to further declines.\n\nMichael Saylor and Strategy have downplayed downside risks and continue to add to their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nBitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Wednesday issued a renewed warning about BTC, arguing that prices will fall well below $50,000 over the long term.\n\nIn the same outburst, Schiff also accused Michael Saylor of disregarding shareholder value as Strategy continues one of the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulation campaigns on record, despite prices falling steeply in recent weeks.\n\nIn a reply on X, Schiff said Bitcoin would not establish a lasting bottom at $50,000, describing that level as merely a short-term reference point.\n\n“No, that’s just a very short-term price target based on MSTR. Long-term Bitcoin will go much lower than $50,000,” Schiff wrote, responding to a user who asked whether prices would rebound after reaching that level.\n\nIn a separate post, Schiff added that Bitcoin would be trading well below $50,000 by the time Strategy’s executive chairman ultimately exits his holdings.\n\n“Bitcoin will be much lower than $50,000 when that happens,” Schiff wrote in response to a user who said they planned to buy once Saylor sells his Bitcoin.\n\nSchiff also targeted Strategy’s stock, arguing that its valuation remains exposed to further downside and is closely linked to Bitcoin’s performance.\n\n“It’s hard to find a chart that looks worse than $MSTR,” Schiff wrote on X. “At a minimum, the stock should drop to about $80, which is half its current price.”\n\nHe added that such a decline in Strategy’s shares would likely coincide with another sharp drop in Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine MSTR dropping that much without a significant decline in Bitcoin as well,” Schiff said. “I’d say a minimum target for BTC is about $50K.”\n\nSchiff has repeatedly argued that Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused strategy prioritizes cryptocurrency exposure over the interests of equity investors.\n\nSaylor and Strategy have consistently minimized perceived risk during periods of Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAfter Bitcoin fell last month, Strategy stated on X that even if BTC declined to its average purchase price of roughly $74,000, the company’s holdings would still cover its outstanding convertible debt multiple times over.\n\nIn November, Strategy CEO Phong Le suggested the company could be forced to sell Bitcoin if its shares traded below the value of its underlying holdings.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, dismissed bitcoin as \"worthless,\" and revisited his GameStop bet.",
    "fullText": "The mysterious Michael Burry has pulled back the curtain over the past six weeks, revealing his views on everything from bitcoin and meme stocks to the AI boom and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame was previously known for posting cryptic warnings on X, only to swiftly delete them and go silent for months or years at a time.\n\nHe has now closed his hedge fund to outside cash, and shifted his focus to writing about his personal investments and sharing his financial analyses on Substack.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through Burry's Substack, X posts, and a recent podcast interview with author Michael Lewis to gather the key insights and details he has shared so far.\n\nBurry returned to X in late October after going quiet in April 2023. His commentary since then has centered on concerns of a historic bubble in AI.\n\nHe has warned that the tech companies leading the charge are seeing a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, overinvesting in equipment such as Nvidia chips and data centers, dragging out depreciation to inflate their short-term earnings, destroying shareholder value through excessive stock-based compensation, and signing \"give-and-take\" contracts with one another to keep the buzz going.\n\nBurry — who shot to fame after his lucrative bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled by Lewis in \"The Big Short\" — has also compared AI mania to the dot-com and housing bubbles, predicting it too will end in disaster.\n\nHe has labeled OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time,\" saying it's \"hemorrhaging cash.\" He has disclosed bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir, and predicted the AI bubble will burst within two years. He has also advised investors who've won big on high-flying assets to cash out their winnings.\n\n\"I think the stock market could be in for a number of bad years,\" he told Lewis during what might be his final interview, per his Substack.\n\nBurry also said that bitcoin trading at $100,000 was \"the most ridiculous thing\" as it's \"not worth anything,\" and called it \"worse than a tulip bulb\" because it has enabled so much crime. The most popular cryptocurrency now trades below $90,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Burry revealed that he has owned gold since 2005, and described Google-parent Alphabet as the \"value investor's favorite\" among mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nBurry told Lewis that the Fed has \"done a lot of damage\" since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nHe said the US central bank doesn't do \"anything very helpful,\" and the Treasury could just have a department to set interest rates and control the money supply instead.\n\nBurry has also warned that the US banking system is showing signs of \"fragility,\" and banks are \"getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nMoreover, he has defended his past comments on the regional banking fiasco, pandemic-fueled inflation, and a potential meme-stock crash, saying his calls were largely on the money.\n\nHe has shared details of his personal portfolio, including that he has emulated most of his fund's positions and owns shares of Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn a Monday post, he revisited his sale of GameStop shortly before the meme stock skyrocketed in January 2021, saying he had \"no idea what was coming.\" He also teased a future post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\nBurry's other revelations so far include the fact that he has known Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, for years, and bought the chipmaker's stock in 2017 or 2018.\n\nAs promised in his Substack's name, \"Cassandra Unchained,\" Burry is speaking freely for the first time in many years — and may just be getting started.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is planning an executive order that would limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defense contractors whose projects are over-budget and delayed, according to three ​sources briefed on the order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched ‌nature of the defense industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.\n\nIndustry groups have been on high alert about the ‌closely-held proposal, which is tied to a Treasury Department initiative, two of the sources said.\n\nA White House official said: \"Until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential executive orders is purely speculation.\"\n\nShares ⁠of Lockheed fell 1.6% and Northrop Grumman sank ‌2% in after-hours trading after some aspects of the news were first reported by online political news service Punchbowl.\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS OFTEN BUY BACK SHARES\n\nShare buybacks are common among defense firms, and several pay a ‍dividend. Lockheed in October, for example, raised its dividend for the 23rd year in a row, to $3.45 per share. At the same time, it authorized the purchase of up to $2 billion of its shares, raising the total amount promised for repurchases to $9.1 billion.\n\nLockheed's F-35 fighter jet, one of ​the most expensive U.S. defense programs, has been plagued by rising costs and delays. Many big defense programs take much longer ‌to deliver a product than initially promised and at a far higher price.\n\nThe $140 billion Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program that will replace aging Minuteman III missiles, designed and managed by Northrop Grumman, will be years behind schedule and 81% over budget, the U.S. military said last year.\n\nThe biggest defense firms, including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the executive order.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth unveiled sweeping changes in November to how the Pentagon purchases weapons, ⁠allowing the military to more rapidly acquire technology amid growing global threats, ​in accordance with an executive order signed by Trump in April.\n\nThat restructuring will ​have direct authority over major weapons programs to eliminate bureaucracy.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame wrote on Substack that a \"crappy business\" became the \"belle of the ball.\"",
    "fullText": "When it comes to regrets, Michael Burry has a few.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who bet on GameStop years before it became a meme, explained why he sold the stock before it skyrocketed in a Substack post on Monday night.\n\nBurry, who recently pivoted from hedge fund manager to online writer, first invested in GameStop in the summer of 2018. The video-game retailer's stock looked undervalued to him, and he saw an array of catalysts that could send it higher, he wrote.\n\nThey included a console refresh in 2020, the possibility of a buyout, the potential sale of the Spring Mobile business, and strong cash flows and a large cash pile offering scope for a \"very big and consequential buyback,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe exited the position in the second quarter of 2019 after the stock failed to budge. But he reinvested in July 2019, buying the stock \"with both hands\" and making it one of his larger holdings, in part because high short interest presented a fresh catalyst, he wrote.\n\n\"I visited a GameStop store to make sure I was not crazy,\" Burry wrote. \"It did not work. Even the stuff that was not on sale looked like it should be on sale.\"\n\nBurry wrote to GameStop's board to push for changes at the company. He shared that his public activism drew emails from Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, a retail investor who would become the face of the GameStop meme mania, and Chewy cofounder Ryan Cohen, who would go on to become GameStop's CEO.\n\nBurry said he bought into GameStop the second time at a split-adjusted average price of 83 cents, or less than 1/26 of the current $22 stock price.\n\nHe purchased an almost 5% stake and held it for more than 16 months. \"Most of that time, I lent my shares out at very good rates — high double digits — which was lucrative and a big part of the trade,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry cashed out by the end of November 2020, selling his shares for an average of $3.38 each, or more than four times what he paid.\n\nWeeks later, retail investors on forums such as r/WallStreetBets executed a historic squeeze on GameStop short sellers, sending the stock to an intraday high of over $120 on January 28, 2021.\n\n\"At the peak my yearslong investment might have turned $12 million into $1 billion, but that was never a possibility,\" Burry wrote, noting that he would have sold long before that point.\n\nBurry — best known for predicting and profiting from the housing crash that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, a story told in the book and movie \"The Big Short\" — reflected on whether he should have played his hand differently.\n\n\"I could have analyzed that situation better,\" he said. \"I knew GameStop inside and out, and I thought I understood the volume, short interest, and other dynamics. However, I was blinded by what I saw as execution risk.\"\n\nHe'd also lost faith in a huge stock rebound. \"As well, I am human,\" he wrote, adding that large-scale buybacks, board changes, and the sale of Spring Mobile had been \"home run/slam dunk activist successes with concrete results but zero impact on price or short interest.\"\n\nBurry seized the chance to close out his bet after GameStop shares spiked following Cohen's disclosure of his stake.\n\n\"I had no idea what was coming,\" he wrote. \"I had no idea that a Roaring Kitty existed.\"\n\n\"And I had no idea that a widely distributed gamma squeeze would thread the needle to become the one and only legal market corner,\" he added.\n\nAround 50 days after he exited, that \"ignominious crappy business\" had become the \"belle of the ball,\" Burry wrote. \"The entire world could not take their eyes off her. And neither could I.\"\n\nBurry said he had mixed feelings about the meme-stock mania of early 2021: \"It was spectacular. It was hilarious. It was tragic in turn.\"\n\nBut he decided it was \"less fun\" by the middle of 2021, when non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were soaring in value along with \"watches, shoes, just about everything.\"\n\nBurry said he feared retail investors would be \"shredded on this meme thing,\" and warned them to watch out. He spoke out because \"if there is one thing I wish I could have done, it was to have effectively warned or spoken about what was happening in 2005-2007,\" he wrote.\n\nThe deep-value investor, who moonlighted as an investment blogger in medical school, also teased an upcoming post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\n\"As a melting ice cube and a capital structure with some optionality, GameStop is roughly as I approached it in 2018, except it is only 16% shorted, all the numbers are 10 times bigger and Ryan is running it, for better or worse,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "In a lengthy blog post, Bury advised against attempting to short the current AI bubble and said the bubble may grow even larger.",
    "fullText": "If you're waiting for Michael Burry to tell you when the AI bubble will burst, don't hold your breath.\n\nIn Burry's new post on his Substack, the famed \"Big Short\" investor said that there \"is no way to time or predict\" the bubble pop, especially when the bubble may still have room to grow.\n\n\"Shorts are almost always short-term trades. Usually less than a year, maybe a couple years at most,\" wrote Burry. \"Not 5 years, not 10 years.\"\n\n\"I believe today the stock market is in a phase that could become a blow off top of extreme magnitude on the upside, while at any time, maybe even today or tomorrow, making a generational top,\" Burry added.\n\nIn the lengthy blog post, Burry answered reader questions on his earlier posts. He argued that there is \"supply-side gluttony,\" meaning massive data-center build-outs, GPU orders, and multibillion-dollar commitments without real end-user demand, which investors are mistaking for supply-chain activity. He attributed much of the hype to being driven by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's marketing.\n\n\"Even when it finally tops, it will not be for any specific reason,\" Burry said later in the post. \"Even if the reason is an AI buildout bubble popping, that will likely not be apparent until a year or two later.\"\n\n\"Mostly, it is prudent neither to short stocks nor to buy puts on stocks. Stocks that are obviously overvalued tend to have the most upward momentum yet have puts that are very expensive,\" Burry added.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's latest digs.\n\nIn November, Burry launched a paywalled Substack called Cassandra Unchained. After posting charts on X that show circulatory investment deals between Nvidia and other tech giants, his first post took aim at Nvidia. He called the chipmaking giant \"a Cisco\" in the AI bubble debate, referring to the internet-networking giant whose stock plunged by over 75% during the dot-com crash.\n\nNvidia released a note to Wall Street analysts in late November, pushing back against some of Burry's claims.\n\nEarlier in November, during Nvidia's Q3 earnings call, the CEO addressed concerns about the AI bubble.\n\n\"From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang told investors, \"We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\"",

    "title": "'Big Short' investor Michael Burry says the latest Fed meeting points to trouble in the banking system",
    "description": "Michael Burry pointed to the Fed's plan to start purchasing short-term Treasurys as a sign of weakness in the banking system.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry thinks he's spotted another sign of trouble in the US financial system.\n\nThe famed investor of \"The Big Short\" said he was eyeing one comment in particular that came out the Fed's meeting on Wednesday. That's the mention that the FOMC believes the Fed's reserve balances had declined to \"ample levels\" — and that the central bank would start making \"reserve management purchases.\"\n\nIt's a jargony way of saying the Fed will start purchasing short-term US Treasurys \"on an ongoing basis,\" per the committee's statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPurchasing short-term T-bills — which the Fed will start doing on December 12 and total around $40 billion a month — is one way the central bank can boost liquidity in markets and the banking sector. It's slightly different from quantitative easing, which is when the Fed purchases long-term Treasurys to stimulate the economy by keeping a lid on borrowing costs. However, in the short term, it has a similar effect of boosting the amount of money circulating through the financial system, making it easier for banks to meet their reserve requirements.\n\nBut the fact that the Fed has to provide that support at all is a worrying sign, in Burry's view. The Fed's reserve balances currently hover around $2.8 trillion, according to the latest weekly data from the central bank.\n\n\"I would add if the US banking system can't function without $3+ trillion in reserves/life support from the Fed, that is not a sign of strength but a sign of fragility,\" Burry wrote in a post on X Wednesday evening. \"So I'd say US Banks are getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nStocks surged after the Fed's policy meeting, largely fueled by optimism about the central bank's plan to purchase short-term Treasury bills, JPMorgan's market intelligence team wrote in a note.\n\nThe purchase of short-term Treasurys marks the first time the Fed has meaningfully expanded its balance sheet since it ended its quantitative easing prgram in 2022, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.\n\n\"Seems that after every crisis now the Fed needs to expand its balance sheet permanently or guarantee a bank funding crisis. No wonder stocks are doing well,\" Burry said, adding that he was avoiding bank stocks and choosings to keep his money in cash accounts or Treasury money market funds.\n\n\"Rip QT; long live 'reserve management purchases,'\" he added.\n\nBurry, who correctly called the subprime mortgage crisis, has cemented his reputation as a permabear in recent years. Since returning to social media this year, he has repeatedly sounded the alarm on a stock market bubble, unveiled fresh bets against AI titans like Nvidia, and warned about the huge amounts of spending by the biggest tech companies.",

PepsiCo said it will use the savings to invest in marketing and improved value for consumers. It didn't disclose which products or how much it would cut prices.\n\nPepsiCo said it also plans to accelerate the introduction of new offerings with simpler and more functional ingredients, including Doritos Protein and Simply NKD Cheetos and Doritos, which contain no artificial flavors or colors. The company also recently introduced a prebiotic version of its signature cola.\n\nPepsiCo is making the changes after prodding from Elliott Investment Management, which took a $4 billion stake in the company in September. In a letter to PepsiCo’s board, Elliott said the company is being hurt by a lack of strategic clarity, decelerating growth and eroding profitability in its North American food and beverage businesses.\n\nIn a joint statement with PepsiCo Monday, Elliott Partner Marc Steinberg said the firm is confident that PepsiCo can create value for shareholders as it executes on its new plan.\n\n“We appreciate our collaborative engagement with PepsiCo’s management team and the urgency they have demonstrated,” Steinberg said. “We believe the plan announced today to invest in affordability, accelerate innovation and aggressively reduce costs will drive greater revenue and profit growth.”\n\nElliott said it plans to continue working closely with the company.\n\nPepsiCo shares were flat in after-hours trading Monday.\n\nPepsiCo said it expects organic revenue to grow between 2% and 4% in 2026. The company’s organic revenue rose 1.5%. the first nine months of this year.\n\nPepsiCo also said it plans to review its supply chain and continue to make changes to its board, with a focus on global leaders who can help it reach its growth and profitability goals.\n\n“We feel encouraged about the actions and initiatives we are implementing with urgency to improve both marketplace and financial performance,” PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.\n\nPepsiCo said in February that years of double-digit price increases and changing customer preferences have weakened demand for its drinks and snacks. In July, the company said it was trying to combat perceptions that its products are too expensive by expanding distribution of value brands like Chester’s and Santitas.",

    "fullText": "\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry sounded early alarms about the subprime mortgage market's excesses — the same risks that later engulfed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nNow, Burry wrote in a Substack post on Monday that he owns \"good size\" positions in both companies' common stock — and believes a long-awaited plan to take them public again may finally be approaching.\n\n\"Once each company is released from capital restraint by their IPOs, I expect growth to accelerate naturally,\" he wrote.\n\nIn his 6,000-word analysis, Burry wrote that the mortgage giants contributed to the housing bubble by buying large volumes of risky loans that eventually blew up during the financial crisis.\n\nBurry recalled that he saw the danger early. In 2003, he called Freddie \"Frauddie Mac\" in an investor letter and bought credit-default swaps that would pay off if the company faltered.\n\nNow in 2025, Burry argues the landscape has changed. Fannie and Freddie have rebuilt tens of billions in capital since 2021 and remain essential pillars of the US mortgage market, owning 62% of outstanding home loans.\n\nWith the Trump administration now signaling interest in releasing them from conservatorship, Burry believes their IPOs may be nearing.\n\nHowever, \"there remains a final steep, windy and rocky climb to IPO for both,\" he wrote, citing regulatory and policy roadblocks.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which trade over the counter, rose 2% and 2.4%, respectively, on Monday.\n\nBurry's post came a month after he closed his hedge fund to outside investors, after terminating Scion Asset Management's SEC registration.\n\nSince then, he has launched his \"Cassandra Unchained\" Substack that promises a \"front row seat to his analytical efforts and projections for stocks, markets, and bubbles, often with an eye to history and its remarkably timeless patterns.\" It now has over 146,000 subscribers.",
