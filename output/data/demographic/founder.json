    "fullText": "Don't count on a college degree to land your dream job in Silicon Valley.\n\nIncreasingly, founders and tech companies are judging talent by how quickly someone can learn, adapt, and build — not on how long they spent in a lecture hall — reshaping traditional pathways into the workforce.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer science professor widely known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is one example of this.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" this week, she spoke about the value of a degree when it comes to hiring for her AI startup, World Labs.\n\n\"When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,\" Li said.\n\n\"Now, it's more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools — and a lot of these are AI tools,\" she said. \"What's your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me.\"\n\nHer hiring bar has become even clearer: she won't hire software engineers who resist AI.\n\n\"At this point in 2025 — hiring at World Labs — I would not hire any software engineer who does not embrace AI collaborative software tools,\" Li said.\n\nIt's not about automating humans out of the equation, she added — it's about identifying people who can grow as fast as the technology around them.\n\n\"If you're able to use these tools, you're able to learn. You can superpower yourself better,\" she said.\n\nLi's stance is part of a broader shift playing out across Silicon Valley, where more founders and even major tech firms are openly questioning the value of higher education.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has openly challenged the value of a college education, urging young entrepreneurs to skip the lecture hall and learn by doing instead — a view echoed by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, who has said that adaptability and AI fluency now matter far more than the \"fanciest degrees.\"\n\n\"AI makes skill sets based on years of education irrelevant,\" Dan Rhoton, CEO of Hopeworks, told Business Insider. Hopeworks is a tech-training nonprofit that prepares underrepresented talent for AI-enabled jobs.\n\nAfter 13 years of preparing unemployed young adults ages 17 to 26 in Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia for tech careers, Rhoton said he has watched firsthand how AI is upending the value of a college degree.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more employers coming to us, saying, 'We used to require a bachelor's degree in this, but we don't understand why.'\"\n\nInstead, he said, employers now want a \"value proposition,\" which he said any job seeker can achieve by showing an AI-generated solution to a company's specific problems.\n\n\"This is the age of: I'm someone who's going to deliver business value,\" Rhoton said. \"Not: I have the right degree.\"",

    "description": "About 10 blocks south of JPMorgan's shiny, new, $3 billion fortress sits the 119-year-old library of the bank's founder.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan may now have the most state-of-the-art building on Wall Street, but about 10 blocks south of the shiny, new, $3 billion fortress still sits the 119-year-old library of the bank's founder.\n\nWith all the focus on the new kid on the block, I decided to pay a visit to the classic, now known as The Morgan Library & Museum, located on Madison Avenue and 36th Street in Manhattan.\n\nCompleted in 1906, John Pierpont (JP) Morgan had the structure built to house his study and library right next to his brownstone residence. Stepping into the original structure, you're immediately transported to the Gilded Age: extravagant paintings line the ceilings of the entry rotunda, deep red wallpaper gives a solemn tone to his study, and wood bookcases display the impressive book collections.\n\nIf you're a finance nerd, you may be disappointed in the lack of Wall Street-specific history in the museum. But if you generally appreciate art and culture as much as JP Morgan apparently did, the place is a must-see.\n\nAs his wealth grew and the fortunes of the powerful families of Europe declined, Morgan amassed pieces from all over the world and from various periods of history, including artifacts from ancient civilizations in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nOne museum guide directed me to her two favorite pieces in the collection: an original Gutenberg bible and the original manuscript of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" Seeing the works up close was breathtaking.\n\nIn the study, portraits of JP Morgan and his son, Jack, overlook the room. In the corner, a vault holds the most valuable works in the collection. In the library, three stories of bookshelves wrap around the room.\n\nThe opulence of the collection is almost too much — something the museum seems to acknowledge in displaying a political cartoon depicting Morgan pulling artifacts from Europe with a giant magnet. Nevertheless, the museum is worth it if you're a history buff.\n\nOne of the museum's gift shop clerks told me that one of its biggest recent draws was an exhibit on the library's first director, Belle da Costa, who was the library's director from 1905 to 1948. A new historical fiction novel about da Costa called \"The Personal Librarian\" has driven interest in the museum, she said, and is one of the gift shop's top-selling items.",

The game will feature characters from across Cyberpunk 2077 and the anime series Edgerunners, while also drawing from the extended Cyberpunk universe to make a TCG that's faithful to the franchise's origins.\nIGN reported revealed the upcoming project in an interview with key players from both CD Projekt Red and WeirdCo, who share a mutual passion for bringing Cyberpunk to the TCG space--which will also mark CD Projekt Red's first physical TCG.\n\"Every one of us at WeirdCo loves the Cyberpunk universe, and we built the TCG bit by bit on this foundation,\" WeirdCo co-founder Elliot Cook said, revealing that the team looked not only to 2077 and Edgerunners for inspiration, but also the Dark Horse comic series. \"At each step we analyzed every little detail, constantly asking ourselves: 'How do we make this more authentic to Cyberpunk?",
