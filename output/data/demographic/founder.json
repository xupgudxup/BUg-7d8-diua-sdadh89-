    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

    "description": "While big players such as Blackstone, KKR and Bain Capital are buying in, Fernando de Leon, founder of Leon Capital Group, said he is sitting out.",
    "fullText": "A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick. Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. \n\nFernando de Leon, founder of Leon Capital Group, started a small lot development company in 2004 with $100,000 and turned it into a $10 billion business, focused mainly on commercial real estate. He did that, he says, by predicting distress, watching the source of capital and leaning on his Harvard degree in evolutionary biology.\n\nWhile others lost their shirts in the great financial crisis, De Leon began to make his fortune. He left a job at Goldman Sachs to start his own business and was doing some deals in residential lot development. A year in, he said, he saw some of the early indications from subprime mortgages and overbuilding that this was going to be \"a difficult cycle change.\"\n\n\"We basically said, look, we see things here that are fundamentally unsound. We're going to take these property positions and sell them, and then kind of wait and see what happens,\" De Leon told Property Play.\n\n\"We divested, we brought back some liquidity, and then we sort of waited, and then in 2008 to 2012 we became fixers. We became people that were able to talk to banks, to life insurance companies, to businesses that had loan exposure, and we were able to solve problems for them,\" he said.\n\nDe Leon said he turned around projects that had stalled and become problematic for lenders, experience he now says informed his thinking in the early years of the pandemic.\n\n\"In 2021, we sold a great deal, several billion dollars of real estate because prices were high, and that was a function of low interest rates and euphoria and bad incentives in the market,\" he said. \"Part of it is understanding where the capital is coming from. You begin to see participants in the market that shouldn't be there ... and when they match up and that funnels through the supply chain, you begin to see distortion and pricing.\"\n\nNow, De Leon said, he's seeing the same red flags flying over data centers.\n\nWhile big players like Blackstone, KKR and Bain Capital are buying in, De Leon said he is sitting out.\n\n\"The thing that I can't quite square is the data center play. I look at a data center that's $10 billion, right? First of all, there haven't been any exits above, you know, $4 billion or $5 billion, you haven't seen comps, so that worries me quite a bit,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I see large technology companies, the largest companies on the planet, with $4 trillion market cap, saying, 'I don't want to own this asset. I don't want to have this on my balance sheet.' So I ask, Why? Why doesn't the largest company in the world want to own its own asset?\" De Leon said. \"The AI business is everything for them today, for the large hyperscalers, and so they're saying, 'No, you build it, you finance it.'\"\n\nDe Leon surmises that what is inside these data centers, the technology of artificial intelligence, will quickly become obsolete. AI, after all, is designed to make everything more efficient, including itself. And the value of the centers is not the four walls, but what's inside.\n\nThese 15- and 20-year leases that developers are relying on, he suspects, are \"Swiss cheese\" leases — as in, full of holes in the agreement over time.\n\nDe Leon said his biggest concern is that big private capital investors are getting the money they manage from things like pension funds for teachers, police and firefighters.\n\n\"When they say, 'I'm going to own this asset and lease it back to one of the hyperscalers,' they're putting other people's money at risk,\" he said.\n\nDe Leon started in the real estate business as a teenager, working as a translator for a local Texas developer. Instead of getting a salary, he asked for equity in a project. And rather than getting a degree in business, he chose evolutionary biology, because understanding people is good business, he says.\n\n\"It was prescient. I mean, it turned out to help me make decisions about organizing companies and leadership, building businesses,\" De Leon said. \"I think some of these things are about incentives, right? Basic commercial interaction between human beings is about incentives.\"\n\nHe said that's particularly true in industries where there are well-established players.\n\n\"You always find a status quo group of incumbents that are set up, and they have certain advantages,\" he said. \"Understanding them from a sociological standpoint, that gave us some insight into saying, 'OK, this business should compete on this basis. This is where we can win,' kind of seeing around the corners.\"\n\nDe Leon said he's excited about how much more capital is coming in to commercial real estate — from wealth firms, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and pensions.\n\n\"When the allocations to real estate go from 3% to 6%, that number means that there's like $4 trillion more of capital that is chasing a finite number of real estate assets,\" he said. \"When that happens, you see an oversupply of capital, you'll see price appreciation for fundamentally sound real estate assets. And so I think the story of the next 10 years will be that the real estate capital markets will grow tenfold.\"",

    "description": "Meet Larry Ellison, the world's fifth-richest man. He cofounded Oracle in 1977 and is still one of Silicon Valley's top dogs.",
    "fullText": "Larry Ellison is the founder and chief technology officer of the software giant Oracle.\n\nNow, he's also the world's fifth-wealthiest man, with a net worth of $238 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nEllison's 2025 was marked by big financial gains and losses. Ellison briefly claimed the title of the world's richest person when his net worth soared to $393 billion that September. Oracle shares surged after the company reported quarterly results and delivered a blockbuster outlook for its AI-powered cloud business. Later that month, his wealth had nearly doubled during the year.\n\nHowever, his fortune took a $25 billion hit toward the end of 2025 after Oracle's shares fell by more than 11% based on weaker-than-expected earnings results. December 12 marked one of the largest single-day drops in net worth this year. Tesla chief Elon Musk then resumed his place as the world's wealthiest man.\n\nOracle, like other tech giants, is betting big on artificial intelligence, and Ellison is leading the charge at the company. His latest focus is on building data centers for companies such as OpenAI.\n\nEllison started Oracle in 1977. Decades later, despite living in Hawaii, he's still one of the top dogs in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere's a look at Ellison's life and career so far.\n\nEllison was born in the Bronx on August 17, 1944, to a single mother, Florence Spellman. Raised in Chicago's South Side, he attended the University of Illinois but dropped out after his adoptive mother died. He later attended the University of Chicago for a semester, but also dropped out.\n\nIn 1966, at the age of 22, he moved to Berkeley, California, near the emerging tech hub of Silicon Valley. He worked a series of jobs, including at Wells Fargo and mainframe maker Amdahl, where he picked up programming skills.\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 with $2,000, inspired by IBM scientist Edgar F. Codd's revolutionary idea of relational databases. Its first product was dubbed Version 2. After briefly rebranding as Relational Software Inc., the company became Oracle Systems in 1982 and went public in 1986 with $55 million in revenue.\n\nGrowth was rapid, but in 1990, Oracle nearly went bankrupt after revenue miscalculations led to losses and layoffs. By 1992, the launch of Oracle7 put the company back on track. Throughout the '90s, Oracle sparred with rivals like Informix and benefited from the dot-com boom, supplying databases to countless startups.\n\nFlush with cash, Oracle went on an acquisition spree, buying PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2005 and Sun Microsystems in 2010, gaining control of key technologies like MySQL. That same year, Ellison recruited Mark Hurd alongside Safra Catz, who later became co-CEOs.\n\nEllison stepped down as CEO in 2014, assuming the roles of chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nEllison, Oracle's largest shareholder, has used his fortune to fuel a life of high-profile investments, philanthropy, and headline-making purchases.\n\nHe races yachts, sails, and partially financed the BMW Oracle USA team that won the 2010 America's Cup.\n\nHe has also built a collection of Richard Mille watches worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each. In 2009, he purchased the Indian Wells tennis tournament for $100 million.\n\nIn 2012, he bought 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, where he later moved full-time, developing real estate and a wellness retreat, and backing a farming startup. His real estate portfolio also includes mansions in Malibu, Palm Beach, and Rhode Island.\n\nHe has been an active investor for a long time. An early backer of Salesforce, he also invested in Leapfrog and the ill-fated Theranos.\n\nOne of his most lucrative bets was NetSuite: A $125 million stake in 1998 turned into a $3.5 billion windfall when Oracle acquired the company in 2016.\n\nEllison also served on Apple's board in the late 1990s and joined Tesla's board in 2018 before stepping down in 2022.\n\nEllison's daughter, Megan, is an Oscar-nominated film producer and the founder of Annapurna Pictures. The company has produced films like \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"American Hustle.\"\n\nEllison's son, David, is also in the film business. His company, Skydance Media, has produced movies like \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" and films in the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise.\n\nAfter months of discussions in 2024, Skydance Media and Paramount agreed to a deal, which created Paramount Skydance. David is the CEO. Ellison and David, who own a controlling stake in Paramount and were outbid by Netflix for Warner Bros. Discovery, launched a hostile $30-per-share offer for all of WBD in December 2025.\n\nParamount Skydance oversees Paramount Pictures, the streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV, as well as CBS and cable networks, including Comedy Central and MTV.\n\nEllison signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, vowing to give away 95% of his fortune.\n\nHe has donated millions, including $200 million to a USC cancer center in 2016, which was eventually renamed the Ellison Institute of Technology. The EIT announced an Oxford campus in 2023.\n\nHe's also been visible during Donald Trump's second term as president.\n\nEllison appeared alongside Sam Altman of OpenAI and Masayoshi Son of SoftBank at Trump's press conference the day after the president's inauguration in January 2024 to announce Project Stargate, a joint venture that would see up to $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure in the US.\n\n\"He's sort of CEO of everything. He's an amazing man,\" Trump said as he introduced Ellison, who is seen as his longtime ally.",

    "title": "I founded Bala after a burnout recovery trip — but burned out again. Here's how I cope now.",
    "description": "Burnout recovery inspired Bala, but founder Natalie Holloway found lasting relief through lifestyle changes, self-kindness, and using a life coach.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Natalie Holloway, a 37-year-old cofounder of Bala, based in Los Angeles. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe first time I recognized I was experiencing burnout, my husband and I left our advertising jobs and traveled without any set plans. This trip got me out of the nonstop grind mindset I'd functioned in for too long.\n\nI came back to corporate work refreshed and inspired in October 2016. Our company, Bala, was supposed to be a side hustle, creating cute wrist and ankle weights inspired by our travels. We never imagined it would take off the way it did. I went full-time on Bala in 2019, and my husband joined in 2020.\n\nAfter building the business for five years, we had to lay off our entire team due to the post-COVID-19 fitness industry downturn. I felt immediate burnout knowing the work that was ahead of me, but this time, I couldn't take a year off to recover.\n\nHaving experienced burnout in multiple stages of my career, I now understand what it looks like, and I can navigate it effectively with the right tools and tactics.\n\nAfter college, I landed a job in advertising and fell in love with that career path. As my career progressed, I would often stay at the office late into the night and miss 9 p.m. dinner reservations. I felt creatively inspired by what I was doing, but the hours were so long that I began to wonder what the point was.\n\nMy husband, whom I had met at work and just started dating, suggested that we quit our jobs to recover and travel, and I said yes. We were both experiencing burnout, and I didn't even realize how bad it was until that moment.\n\nWe spent several months saving money and planning before leaving our jobs in March 2016.\n\nIt was so freeing to leave with no real plan, but also scary. We didn't have jobs, we didn't have an income, and our résumés were not being built. But we did finally have the mental space to slow down, look around, and feel inspired.\n\nOne day, we were taking a yoga class in Indonesia, and the class was too easy; we wanted to work up a sweat. After the class, my husband, Max, had the idea for wrist and ankle weights that look like cute bracelets. We decided to try creating them when we returned.\n\nThis trip taught me that detachment is what helps the most when I'm feeling burned out, and that's the easiest to achieve through time away from the source of my stress.\n\nWe got back and both got new jobs in advertising, but started working on Bala on the side. We never thought it would be our full-time jobs, but it started growing.\n\nOnce we were carried in stores and had enough orders coming in, we felt we couldn't keep up with both our corporate jobs and Bala. I left my advertising job first, and my husband followed a few months later.\n\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and the fitness industry experienced a surge in demand. However, after the pandemic, the fitness industry experienced a decline, and we had to lay off our entire staff.\n\nI was pregnant and felt like I didn't have enough stamina to take on the work of 30 people. It was a really demoralizing time, and the burnout hit me immediately because all of our hopes and dreams were on the line.\n\nI was determined not to let burnout destroy my health during my pregnancy. This time, I focused on and learned the value of how I speak to myself.\n\nDuring my second experience with burnout, I learned that giving myself a mantra helps ground my anxiety. Sometimes it's something like 'I'm calm, present, and have an abundance of time.' Repeating this helps when I'm feeling overwhelmed and burned out.\n\nI can't control when stress creeps in, but I can control how I talk myself through it because my head is my reality, and I'm trying to create a positive one.\n\nWhen we started rebuilding the business, my husband and I decided that no matter how long it took for the company to recover, we were determined to see it through to the end. We had to prepare for a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nWe've started regrowing our team back to its original size.\n\nI started working with a life coach, and that's really helped. They're helping me understand what's on my to-do list that aligns with my values, which will give me energy, and what doesn't align with my values, which will deplete my energy.\n\nAlthough we can't travel to cure burnout as we once did, I now take mini recovery trips, either for a weekend, a week, or a month, when I can. We sometimes visit Joshua Tree as a family to escape from LA, unwind, and mentally reset.\n\nWe also spend every July in Lakeside, Ohio. We don't make any plans. It's just our kids and us. We still do some work, but we're able to meaningfully downshift our lives in a way that recharges us.\n\nI always have my mantras going now, and I've learned how to feel comfortable being kind to myself. I realized that burnout is inevitable, but it's about how I handle it. I try to prevent it by reminding myself that I'm working toward the long game.",

    "description": "Shiloh Luckey faces SEC charges for using VC funds to pay for her home, Super Bowl tickets, trips to Aspen, and a wedding. The FBI is also investigating.",
    "fullText": "Shiloh Luckey, founder and former CEO of ComplYant, a Los-Angeles-based tax-compliance startup that raised more than $13 million from top venture capitalists, is under federal criminal investigation for alleged securities and bank fraud, according to court filings.\n\nIn a civil complaint, the SEC has charged Luckey with violating securities laws for using millions of dollars of company funds to pay for her home, Super Bowl tickets, and a destination wedding in the Caribbean. The SEC alleges she painted a rosy picture of the company's booming revenue when ComplYant never brought in more than $620 in monthly revenue.\n\nReached by telephone, Luckey said, \"I don't have anything to offer you,\" and hung up.\n\nStartups face far less regulatory scrutiny than public companies, and founders sometimes present overly optimistic growth stories while VCs rush to fund hot companies with limited diligence. After high-profile scandals like Theranos and FTX, regulators have taken a tougher line.\n\n\"Startup founders cannot fake it until they make it by falsifying revenue metrics,\" SEC regional director Monique Winkler warned in a statement. Recent cases, including the seven-year prison sentence for Charlie Javice and fraud charges against Mozaic Payments' former CEO Marcus Cobb, show that regulators are increasingly willing to pursue criminal and civil penalties for these founders.\n\nLuckey, who formerly went by Shiloh Johnson, founded ComplYant in 2019 to help small businesses navigate the labyrinth of tax regulations from state to state. In 2022, the company closed a $5.5 million seed round led by Craft Ventures, the San Francisco venture firm cofounded by the investor and White House advisor David Sacks.\n\nA spokeswoman for Craft did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI and SEC declined to comment.\n\nLuckey hired more than 50 employees, and when ComplYant abruptly shut down last year, she severed contact with them. It took seven weeks for all employees to get their final paychecks and some discovered 401(k) contributions were missing, as Business Insider previously reported. Luckey was informed in April of this year that she was under federal criminal investigation by the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office for securities and bank fraud, according to a recent petition she filed to pause the civil case against her.\n\nIn that case, filed in October, the SEC alleges Luckey routinely misled investors.\n\n\"Luckey painted a rosy picture for investors of ComplYant's business performance, allegedly telling investors that ComplYant's monthly revenues had grown from around $2,500 in November 2020 to over $250,000 by September 2022, and that the company was bringing in dozens if not hundreds of new paying subscribers each month,\" the SEC said in a statement. \"However, ComplYant only generated on average monthly revenues of about $250 during roughly the same time period and averaged fewer than four new subscribers each month.\"\n\nLuckey also represented herself as a CPA, but there is no record of her ever having the accreditation, according to the complaint.\n\nThe SEC says she allegedly siphoned off $2.2 million for trips to Aspen, Miami Beach, Turks and Caicos, and Lisbon, and used the funds to pay for her Caribbean wedding, her car, and house.\n\nLuckey, who is representing herself in court, has not responded to the SEC allegations.\n\nSince ComplYant shut down last year, Luckey has continued to post instructional videos with advice for taxes and accounting on her TikTok channel with nearly 24,000 subscribers.\n\nIn October, records show, she launched a new startup called HabitLoop, which she describes as a digital financial assistant to help people manage their money.\n\n\"I grew up with very poor financial habits,\" Luckey said in a video introducing her latest company as inspired by a lifetime of spending beyond her means.\n\n\"This is something I built on hard lessons,\" she said.",

    "title": "Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky says he went to ‘night school’ for an hour every day with Barack Obama and even turned in homework",
    "description": "The billionaire founder admits a weekly mentorship call with the former president came with assignments like being more intentional with his friendships.",
    "fullText": "Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team.\n\nTo build Airbnb into a billion-dollar business, Brian Chesky sometimes worked gruesome 100-hour weeks. However, on top of that, he would regularly carve out time to pick the brains of one of the most important people in the world: former President Barack Obama.\n\n“At one point in 2018, we had a standing one-hour call every week, and I basically had my day job during the day, and then I had my night school with the former president, where I would get these assignments, but it changed my life,” Chesky has just revealed.\n\nSpeaking on Michelle Obama’s podcast IMO, he added: “I just was really shameless about reaching out to him, asking for advice, asking for mentorship, and he would meet with me, and he’d give me advice.”\n\nHe recalled the 44th president of the United States advised him to avoid becoming like other leaders who are effectively “self-driving cars” without intention. Instead, he should always be thinking long and hard about relationships—with his friends, his success, and his company—and be more active with the impact he wants to make.\n\nFortune reached out to Chesky and former President Obama for comment.\n\nAfter building Airbnb into a household name, Chesky faced a problem: He still wasn’t satisfied—nor necessarily happy.\n\n“The thing about being very successful in tech and making a lot of money and all this is no one ever told me how lonely it would become,” Chesky said to Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson. “And I started realizing, well, it’s weird, I had old friends that were middle-class, and I’ll be honest, a lot of them seemed happier than me at that point in my life.”\n\nAnd he credits former President Obama with helping him realize that how he was feeling was completely normal: that “the more success you get, the more isolated you get.”\n\n“People dream of success, but what they don’t realize is a lot of with success comes disconnection to your past, to yourself, to your friends, and I think a lot of what I’ve tried to do the last handful of years is to reconnect, to not live a life of isolation,” Chesky said.\n\nBarack Obama’s wisdom to Chesky was simple: He needed to be more hands-on with his relationships. That means instead of texting or calling a close friend once a year, stay constantly connected with them. Chesky said it’s a lesson he translated into his work as the leader of Airbnb.\n\n“He told me something that I’ll never forget,” Chesky said. “He said you should institutionalize your intentions, so that even when you’re a public company, you can make sure not to compromise your vision. And what he meant by that, I think, was that you should be more thoughtful about what you’re making, why you’re making it, and the impact of what you’re making is on people.”\n\nChesky admitted Obama’s advice has made a “really, really big difference” at Airbnb. And while it may sound odd for a former president to effectively give a CEO homework, it’s nothing new for Obama, who spent over a decade in the classroom teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago before his jump into the political arena.\n\nThe lessons learned from Chesky and President Obama’s relationship on finding success can be summarized into two simple steps: Seek out mentors and have friends outside of social media.\n\n“For young people, the number one thing they need to learn how to do is how to learn,” Chesky said. “And some of the best ways to learn are from other people, and some of the best ways to learn from people are, again, in the real world.”\n\nMoreover, rekindling old relationships is among what Chesky calls a “simple life hack” to make life happy.\n\n“I think the vast majority of people, if they reach out to someone, someone will want to help them,” he added. “They reach out to an old friend, the old friend will want to reach back out to them, and that is the path for reconnection. It’s a path for relationships, and it’s a path for purpose.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on May 27, 2025.",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

    "description": "After going through multiple layoffs as a UX designer, Kelly Withers used her savings to fund her startup, Carmu, which sells yoga mats.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kelly Withers, 36, who lives outside Detroit and is the founder of Carmu, a yoga mat startup. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nAbout seven years ago, I was in my 20s and getting divorced. I was a single mom to a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old, with no outside help. I had no place to live and no full-time job. So I started coming up with ideas as fast as I could. How am I going to take care of these two kids? I felt alone.\n\nAt that time, I was doing photography to help restaurants build their brands. Then I went to a yoga class. When I walked in, every person had the same mat and the same outfit. I started thinking about my mom and how she raised us to be individuals and stand out. I had this idea that since I was designing so many things already, I would go home and try to design a mat so I could feel more like myself when I went to class.\n\nAbout a week before I went to place my order for all the mat designs, the pandemic hit, and I was back to square one. I also lost my photography clients, because restaurants were shuttered. I panicked because I had two tiny humans relying on me.\n\nSo, I started teaching myself design for tech, because it seemed much more lucrative. From everything I've ever heard, you go into the corporate world — that's how you have a comfortable life.\n\nI got a syllabus from an online boot camp, but I couldn't afford it. So, I bought a book on every topic. Then I hired a tutor for 30 minutes at a time to go over my work and my portfolio, to make sure I was doing it right. He worked at Microsoft. He told me how much money I would potentially make as a junior designer. I remember thinking, \"Well, I'm going to have to pretend I'm a senior designer.\"\n\nPretty much on my first interview, I got a corporate job doing UX design as a lead designer. I was bullshitting, so it was a little nerve-racking. Whenever I had a project, I'd run it by the tutor, just praying that I didn't get busted. I caught on quickly, and it was fine. I did that for a couple of years.\n\nEventually, there was a lot less work. So, I started panicking.\n\nI found another job, so then I had two. Sure enough, about a month later, layoffs hit, and our whole team from the first job got wiped out.\n\nPeople talk about corporate life and how that gives you security. In my experience, you're handing over your control, your finances, your future — and it's still a gamble. I can't live my life constantly betting on somebody else and somebody else's company.\n\nI've always been into design. I want to build something tangible. I ordered about 250 mats to start. The idea was that I would continue working in tech, and then I would soft-launch these as my side hustle. That way, if I ever got laid off again, I'd have some security.\n\nThe day my yoga mats got delivered to my house, I got laid off. I looked at it as a sign: Go all in. You have some savings. See what you can do. Within about a month, I sold out.\n\nI was like, \"Now what am I going to do?\" They're made outside the US, so it takes a while for them to get here. I took the few mats that I had left and reached out to style editors.\n\nI took the rest of my savings, and I bought 1,000 mats. It was a scary moment because I was living off those savings, too.\n\nPeople talk about entrepreneurship and say, \"Oh, it's so risky.\" Well, it isn't. If you have the product, I like to think of it as a calculated risk. At this point, if I'm being honest, it was the only way I could think of making money, as I could not get a job interview.\n\nThe company is named after my mom, Carolyn Mulligan, who passed away 10 years ago after she was hit by a car on her bicycle. She had just been on my mind, and I'm convinced that because she was so strong, she has something to do with how this is working out.\n\nThe day I launched, in May, I sent out this post on Instagram to announce it. My friend called me and said to open up Vogue. Hailey Bieber was on the yoga mat in the magazine. About a week later, GQ wrote about Carmu. From there, it was just enough leverage where I could take it all over the place. We got into Goop, and we got into Anthropology in Europe. It's just crazy because it's been such a little amount of time.\n\nWhen I got the next shipment of mats, I hadn't had an interview in tech for a year. With my business, I was profitable from day one.\n\nThe big question now is whether I want to have outside investment or do it myself. I believe I could find outside investment. Have I been traumatized in handing over control of my life to other people? Yeah. I don't know if I'm ready to give up control of anything right now, just because of how everything has gone.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "The founder of Paracelsus Recovery, a $130,000-a-week inpatient clinic for CEOs, missed the signs of his own burnout before seeking treatment.",
    "fullText": "This essay is based on a conversation with Jan Gerber, 44, who runs the Paracelsus Recovery clinic in Zurich. Business Insider has verified his admission to another Swiss clinic for burnout. The piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2022, I realized something was wrong. I had almost lost my company, my marriage was falling apart, and it felt like everything hit all at once. I did outpatient therapy while things were unraveling, but I was clearly getting worse.\n\nAbout six months later, that December, I checked myself into an inpatient program in Zurich, where I was diagnosed with acute depression brought on by stress. The symptoms fit burnout, too — burnout and depression often overlap.\n\nAt the time, I had spent 12 years helping other people recover from burnout, depression, and addiction. I'm the founder of Paracelsus Recovery, a private clinic in Zurich that treats executives, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals who require discreet and private care. A six-week stay can cost around $800,000.\n\nIt all started when a friend of a friend, the CEO of a major, publicly listed corporation, called my parents, who worked in the mental health space, for help, and moved into their guest room for treatment. The person needed very discreet treatment for alcohol addiction — if it went public, the stock market impact could have been in the billions.\n\nI previously worked in consulting and medical concierge services, and had launched my own businesses in the travel sector. So, the entrepreneur in me realized there was a niche here: offering discreet treatment for people who couldn't just go to any old rehab.\n\nIn 2011, I co-founded a clinic in the high-end mental health space with my mother and then step-father, which initially offered one-on-one care. In 2012, this became Paracelsus Recovery.\n\nIn the early years of Paracelsus Recovery, we had a small number of clients, but it took years to establish a reputation. The high cost is a big hurdle for potential clients. We primarily find ultra-high-net-worth clients through family offices and membership organizations, such as Campden Wealth.\n\nAbout half are members of wealthy families, trust fund babies who don't develop a sense of purpose or drive. The other half is a mix of royalty, entertainers, entrepreneurs, founders, and top executives — those who have the funds to come to us.\n\nClients rarely experience burnout on its own. In many cases, people are self-medicating and in a cycle of taking downers like sleeping pills in the evening, then stimulants in the morning, such as ADHD medication or illicit drugs like cocaine. Eventually, they reach a dead end.\n\nOften, burnout is not solely prompted by the number of hours worked, but also by the responsibility of overseeing thousands of employees, investors, and business partners, which weighs heavily on their shoulders. If you're in the public eye or run a public company, where, for example, earnings aren't meeting expectations, that can also have a significant impact on stress levels.\n\nThe average worker typically seeks burnout treatment after a spouse, their kids, or employer tells them they can't show up late or get drunk every night anymore. Founders and professional executives tend to have much more to lose, and a network of people who help them conceal some of their issues. As a result, they'll hold on for dear life until they just can't anymore. And, in general, they seek help much later.\n\nSleep is usually the first to go. That was a massive red flag for me. I used to be a good sleeper, even in stressful times, but it started to deteriorate — not just a week or a month, but about half a year of restless nights. By the time these CEOs seek treatment, it's often when a substance is involved, and it's showing up as a fatty liver or cardiovascular issues, coming from alcohol abuse, for example.\n\nWe offer a 10-day program called an \"Executive Detox.\" These programs don't solve everything, but they stabilize clients and buy them some time. On average, people stay with us for six weeks; however, in extreme cases, they may stay for six months or more.\n\nA week at Paracelsus Recovery costs around £100,000, or about $131,000. This includes a private residence, a chef, a driver, a live-in therapist, and a daily schedule of psychotherapy, medical treatments, infusions, and complementary therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, and fitness training.\n\nMy own treatment at another clinic encouraged me to introduce treatments such as shiatsu and breath-work.\n\nSuccess is relative. For me, it mostly means that someone leaves equipped with the tools to live a better life. Treatment at a clinic like Paracelsus Recovery is what I consider an acute stabilization, while the real work happens afterward. People should have ongoing therapy and support.\n\nTo recover from burnout, the most vital thing — and it's hard for career executives and entrepreneurs to hear — is to pull the emergency brake. If you continue to hold on for another week, another month, or step back halfway while the stress persists, you'll still crash.\n\nYou have to decide between investing in the quality of your life over just your career trajectory.\n\nPersonally, I didn't do that. For the sake of business continuity, I had to hang on. I still haven't fully recovered. I still feel brain fog from being burned out, and my memory is worse than it was. I'm not sure if it will ever return.\n\nBut my own experience, and my treatment at another clinic in Zurich, taught me about the value of proper inpatient treatment.\n\nAt Paracelsus Recovery, we typically treat only three or four clients at a time, which makes for a warmer and more personal experience, whereas the Swiss Clinic I attended had a capacity of about 75 patients.\n\nOur patients stay in penthouse apartments with lake views, where most of their treatments take place. No day is like another, as treatment is tailored for each client. They have access to medical treatments, a midday IV to rebalance their biochemistry, as well as a personal trainer and private chef. Their food and supplements are curated based on their lab tests and genetics.\n\nYes, the price tag is very high, but you get a lot for your money. Besides, there's no price on health and well-being.",

At Italian Tech Week in October, the Amazon founder looked back on an early piece of feedback that changed the way he approached invention—and may have helped save Amazon from becoming its own worst enemy.\n\n\"I am an inventor,\" Bezos told the audience. \"This is my fundamental nature.\" His favorite place? In a room with a whiteboard, surrounded by a small group, spitballing ideas. \"You can literally put me in front of a whiteboard and I can come up with a hundred ideas in half an hour,\" he said with a grin.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nBut that endless flow of innovation—once considered a superpower—nearly became a liability. In the early years of Amazon, one longtime executive pulled Bezos aside with a blunt warning. \"Jeff, you have enough ideas to destroy Amazon,\" Jeff Wilke told him.\n\nIt stunned him. \"This was such a shocking idea for me,\" Bezos admitted. Wilke, a manufacturing expert, saw the problem clearly: every new idea was essentially a task dropped into a queue. If the company couldn't absorb it fast enough, it wasn't just useless—it was destructive.\n\n\"You have to release the work at the right rate that the organization can accept it,\" Bezo said, quoting Wilke. \"You're creating a backlog, a queue, work in process. It's adding no value and in fact, it's creating distraction.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThat was the moment Bezos shifted. Instead of flooding Amazon with nonstop initiatives, he started filtering. \"I started prioritizing the ideas better, keeping lists of them, keeping them to myself until the organization was ready,\" he said.\n\nEven more important, Bezos began thinking like a builder—not just of ideas, but of infrastructure. \"How can I build an organization that can be ready for more ideas?\" he said. The answer was scaling leadership, growing bandwidth, and creating systems that could handle multiple innovations at once.\n\nAmazon didn't slow down after that—it got smarter. \"We built a company that's very good at inventing and doing more than one thing at a time,\" Bezos said. But none of it worked until he accepted a hard truth: ideas are powerful, but only if they're released at the right moment. Without discipline, even genius becomes a liability.",

While ⁠the Chinese and Dutch governments ‌eased restrictions on Nexperia, court fights and an internal battle are continuing.\n\nDISAGREEMENT ON WHAT TO TALK ABOUT\n\nA spokesperson for Nexperia BV said ‍the company was aware of the invitation, which follows its own call for talks with its Chinese operations in late November, but it had seen \"no indications of any willingness to engage ​in meaningful discussions on the restoration of the supply chain\".\n\nWhile Nexperia wants to ‌discuss restoring normal operations, Wingtech said on Wednesday that ownership and control questions must come first.\n\n\"(The) core prerequisite and fundamental basis for resolving Nexperia's current governance impasse is the restoration of Wingtech's lawful control,\" it said in a statement.\n\nArnold Croiset van Uchelen, the lawyer appointed as custodian of Nexperia's shares, confirmed he and court-appointed non-executive manager ⁠Guido Dierick had received a letter from Wingtech.\n\n\"We ​have indeed received an invitation like that, and ​we'll respond shortly,\" he told Reuters. \"We're available for a conversation, but about the who, what and where, we're not disclosing that in the media.\"\n\nNexperia's ‍Chinese packaging arm has ⁠declared independence and is seeking to replace European chip wafers with others made in China. The European production arm has halted wafer shipments to China, citing ⁠nonpayment. Stockpiles of the company's chips are dwindling and the car industry fears shortages may re-emerge in ‌January.",

    "fullText": "Don't count on a college degree to land your dream job in Silicon Valley.\n\nIncreasingly, founders and tech companies are judging talent by how quickly someone can learn, adapt, and build — not on how long they spent in a lecture hall — reshaping traditional pathways into the workforce.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer science professor widely known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is one example of this.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" this week, she spoke about the value of a degree when it comes to hiring for her AI startup, World Labs.\n\n\"When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,\" Li said.\n\n\"Now, it's more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools — and a lot of these are AI tools,\" she said. \"What's your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me.\"\n\nHer hiring bar has become even clearer: she won't hire software engineers who resist AI.\n\n\"At this point in 2025 — hiring at World Labs — I would not hire any software engineer who does not embrace AI collaborative software tools,\" Li said.\n\nIt's not about automating humans out of the equation, she added — it's about identifying people who can grow as fast as the technology around them.\n\n\"If you're able to use these tools, you're able to learn. You can superpower yourself better,\" she said.\n\nLi's stance is part of a broader shift playing out across Silicon Valley, where more founders and even major tech firms are openly questioning the value of higher education.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has openly challenged the value of a college education, urging young entrepreneurs to skip the lecture hall and learn by doing instead — a view echoed by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, who has said that adaptability and AI fluency now matter far more than the \"fanciest degrees.\"\n\n\"AI makes skill sets based on years of education irrelevant,\" Dan Rhoton, CEO of Hopeworks, told Business Insider. Hopeworks is a tech-training nonprofit that prepares underrepresented talent for AI-enabled jobs.\n\nAfter 13 years of preparing unemployed young adults ages 17 to 26 in Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia for tech careers, Rhoton said he has watched firsthand how AI is upending the value of a college degree.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more employers coming to us, saying, 'We used to require a bachelor's degree in this, but we don't understand why.'\"\n\nInstead, he said, employers now want a \"value proposition,\" which he said any job seeker can achieve by showing an AI-generated solution to a company's specific problems.\n\n\"This is the age of: I'm someone who's going to deliver business value,\" Rhoton said. \"Not: I have the right degree.\"",

    "description": "About 10 blocks south of JPMorgan's shiny, new, $3 billion fortress sits the 119-year-old library of the bank's founder.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan may now have the most state-of-the-art building on Wall Street, but about 10 blocks south of the shiny, new, $3 billion fortress still sits the 119-year-old library of the bank's founder.\n\nWith all the focus on the new kid on the block, I decided to pay a visit to the classic, now known as The Morgan Library & Museum, located on Madison Avenue and 36th Street in Manhattan.\n\nCompleted in 1906, John Pierpont (JP) Morgan had the structure built to house his study and library right next to his brownstone residence. Stepping into the original structure, you're immediately transported to the Gilded Age: extravagant paintings line the ceilings of the entry rotunda, deep red wallpaper gives a solemn tone to his study, and wood bookcases display the impressive book collections.\n\nIf you're a finance nerd, you may be disappointed in the lack of Wall Street-specific history in the museum. But if you generally appreciate art and culture as much as JP Morgan apparently did, the place is a must-see.\n\nAs his wealth grew and the fortunes of the powerful families of Europe declined, Morgan amassed pieces from all over the world and from various periods of history, including artifacts from ancient civilizations in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nOne museum guide directed me to her two favorite pieces in the collection: an original Gutenberg bible and the original manuscript of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" Seeing the works up close was breathtaking.\n\nIn the study, portraits of JP Morgan and his son, Jack, overlook the room. In the corner, a vault holds the most valuable works in the collection. In the library, three stories of bookshelves wrap around the room.\n\nThe opulence of the collection is almost too much — something the museum seems to acknowledge in displaying a political cartoon depicting Morgan pulling artifacts from Europe with a giant magnet. Nevertheless, the museum is worth it if you're a history buff.\n\nOne of the museum's gift shop clerks told me that one of its biggest recent draws was an exhibit on the library's first director, Belle da Costa, who was the library's director from 1905 to 1948. A new historical fiction novel about da Costa called \"The Personal Librarian\" has driven interest in the museum, she said, and is one of the gift shop's top-selling items.",
