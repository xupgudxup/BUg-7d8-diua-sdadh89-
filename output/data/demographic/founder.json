    "fullText": "JPMorgan may now have the most state-of-the-art building on Wall Street, but about 10 blocks south of the shiny, new, $3 billion fortress still sits the 119-year-old library of the bank's founder.\n\nWith all the focus on the new kid on the block, I decided to pay a visit to the classic, now known as The Morgan Library & Museum, located on Madison Avenue and 36th Street in Manhattan.\n\nCompleted in 1906, John Pierpont (JP) Morgan had the structure built to house his study and library right next to his brownstone residence. Stepping into the original structure, you're immediately transported to the Gilded Age: extravagant paintings line the ceilings of the entry rotunda, deep red wallpaper gives a solemn tone to his study, and wood bookcases display the impressive book collections.\n\nIf you're a finance nerd, you may be disappointed in the lack of Wall Street-specific history in the museum. But if you generally appreciate art and culture as much as JP Morgan apparently did, the place is a must-see.\n\nAs his wealth grew and the fortunes of the powerful families of Europe declined, Morgan amassed pieces from all over the world and from various periods of history, including artifacts from ancient civilizations in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nOne museum guide directed me to her two favorite pieces in the collection: an original Gutenberg bible and the original manuscript of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" Seeing the works up close was breathtaking.\n\nIn the study, portraits of JP Morgan and his son, Jack, overlook the room. In the corner, a vault holds the most valuable works in the collection. In the library, three stories of bookshelves wrap around the room.\n\nThe opulence of the collection is almost too much — something the museum seems to acknowledge in displaying a political cartoon depicting Morgan pulling artifacts from Europe with a giant magnet. Nevertheless, the museum is worth it if you're a history buff.\n\nOne of the museum's gift shop clerks told me that one of its biggest recent draws was an exhibit on the library's first director, Belle da Costa, who was the library's director from 1905 to 1948. A new historical fiction novel about da Costa called \"The Personal Librarian\" has driven interest in the museum, she said, and is one of the gift shop's top-selling items.",

    "description": "The Cyberpunk series is getting an official physical trading card game as part of a new collaboration between CD Projekt Red and TCG newcomers WeirdCo. The game will feature characters from across Cyberpunk 2077 and the anime series Edgerunners, while also drawing from the extended Cyberpunk universe to make a TCG that's faithful to the franchise's origins.\nIGN reported revealed the upcoming project in an interview with key players from both CD Projekt Red and WeirdCo, who share a mutual passion for bringing Cyberpunk to the TCG space--which will also mark CD Projekt Red's first physical TCG.\n\"Every one of us at WeirdCo loves the Cyberpunk universe, and we built the TCG bit by bit on this foundation,\" WeirdCo co-founder Elliot Cook said, revealing that the team looked not only to 2077 and Edgerunners for inspiration, but also the Dark Horse comic series. \"At each step we analyzed every little detail, constantly asking ourselves: 'How do we make this more authentic to Cyberpunk?",
