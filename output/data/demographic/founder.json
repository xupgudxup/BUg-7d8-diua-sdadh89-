    "description": "Astelia CEO Alon Noy, a former leader of Israel's National Red Team, said that traditional cybersecurity has \"no chance\" against AI-powered attackers.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence has supercharged the cybersecurity arms race. Attackers are rushing to harness the tech to break into systems, leaving defenders no choice but to adopt it as well to fend them off.\n\nAlon Noy, who previously led an Israeli intelligence unit that tested the nation's cyber defenses, saw that paradigm shift as an irresistible opportunity to wield his cybersecurity skills and \"protect the world,\" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview this week.\n\nNoy is the CEO and cofounder of Astelia, a cybersecurity startup that uses AI to analyze an enterprise's systems, identify the tiny fraction of vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, and help plug those holes in its defenses.\n\nAstelia announced on Tuesday that it has raised $35 million in a combined seed and Series A funding round led by Index Ventures and Team8.\n\nNoy spoke to Business Insider about why he thinks Astelia is the perfect bulwark against a new generation of cybersecurity threats, how he plans to use his investors' cash, and how young people can get ahead in the AI era.\n\nHe said that stress-testing Israel's critical infrastructure defenses helped him realize the value of being able to \"think like an attacker.\"\n\nNoy's cofounders, Nadav Ostrovsky and Roy Rajwan, also worked on Israel's National Red Team, mimicking attackers to test the country's critical infrastructure defenses.\n\nNoy explained that advances in AI have dramatically increased the number of vulnerabilities in an enterprise's computer systems and radically reduced the time needed to exploit them.\n\nThat creates a \"bad equation between the attackers and defenders,\" he said. When attackers use AI tools to rapidly identify and exploit vulnerabilities, defenders with only traditional tools \"have no chance to win the race,\" he added.\n\nNoy said a key challenge is that many enterprises have \"endless backlogs of vulnerabilities\" but limited resources to address them. He added that it's close to \"mission impossible\" to find the \"needles in the haystack\" — the vulnerabilities that are truly exploitable.\n\nAstelia combines AI agents with network and environment analysis of a customer's systems to pinpoint the 1% or 2% of vulnerabilities that are genuinely risky, he said.\n\nThe company can preemptively spot holes in a security system before they're ever exploited, which is \"super valuable for customers,\" Noy said.\n\nHe gave the example of a telecoms business that had a few million vulnerabilities in its backlog and no idea how to prioritize them. Astelia pinpointed the few hundred of those that posed genuine threats and helped tackle them, he said.\n\nNoy said he would use the fresh funds to ramp up Astelia's go-to-market team and bolster its R&D team. He said the startup would likely double in headcount by the end of this year, from around 30 people today to between 60 and 70 by December's close.\n\nJuriaan Duizendstraal, a partner at Index Ventures, said in a press release announcing the raise that AI is forcing enterprises to shift from \"assumed risk to provable exposure,\" and Astelia helps them to \"turn vulnerability management from a reactive scramble into a preemptive defense.\"\n\nAmir Zilberstein, a managing partner at Team8, wrote that his firm invested in part because of the Astelia team's \"rare understanding of how security failures emerge in real environments.\"\n\n\"Astelia cuts through vulnerability noise by grounding decisions in real exposure, and we believe this team is redefining how enterprises operationalize security,\" he added.\n\nNoy also spoke to Business Insider about how AI is changing the wider world.\n\nHe said the immense buzz around the tech is justified, but companies won't succeed long-term by simply using AI. They need to have a \"moat\" to fend off competitors, such as access to proprietary data, he said.\n\nNoy cautioned that many people are too relaxed about uploading personal information to ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, as they don't realize their sensitive data could be used to train the models, or consider that it might be leaked.\n\nHe also offered advice to young people worried about an affordability crisis and AI replacing humans in many jobs.\n\nNoy recommended they become \"good friends with AI\" and use it for everything from coding to planning, shopping, messaging, and managing tasks.\n\nHe said that could help them stay updated on the tech's latest abilities and shortcomings, and keep up with a fast-changing market, instead of getting \"left behind.\"",

    "description": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.",
    "fullText": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.\n\nThere is an overwhelming feeling that if everyone stopped and thought about it for five minutes, they'd build something completely different; but it's paired with a total inability to articulate why they specifically haven't stopped.\n\nNobody stops, because nobody can afford to, and that feeling has a name. It's called Moloch, and it's the most important thing happening in AI that isn't on your roadmap.\n\nA new model drops. It's better at benchmarks. Every AI product company now has to integrate it (if they're a wrapper) or match it (if they're building a model) or explain to their investors why they didn't. Integration // parity takes engineering time, time that doesn't go toward the actual product differentiation that would create long-term value. But the company that doesn't integrate looks like it's falling behind, and looking like you're falling behind is fatal when your entire valuation rests on the assumption that you're on the frontier.\n\nEveryone catches up, everyone shifts resources, everyone ships the update. The net competitive position of every company is exactly where it was before, except they all engineering time on esoteria and none of them made their end-product meaningfully better for end-users.\n\nIt happens every few weeks now.\n\nThis is Moloch; and it'scoordination failure as competition. Every company makes an individually rational decision (keep up with the frontier or die) and the aggregate outcome is an industry that's moving incredibly fast in the direction of model capability, and barely at all in the direction of product value.\n\nThe race is real // the destination is fake.\n\nEvery AI product is converging on the same interface: a chat box. Maybe a chat box with some tool use. Maybe a chat box with some RAG. But at bottom, a text input and a text output, differentiated by branding and minor UX choices and which model is running underneath.\n\nThe chat box won because it ships fast, and Moloch rewards speed over design.\n\nBuilding a novel interaction paradigm takes months or years of research, iteration, user testing. During those months, fifteen competitors will ship chat-box wrappers with the latest model and capture the market's attention. Your investors will get nervous. Your board will suggest you \"ship something\" while you figure out the long-term vision. You'll ship the chat box. The long-term vision will die in a Notion doc nobody opens.\n\nEvery company faces this exact choice and picks the same outcome. The competitive structure selects against creativity. The companies that take time to build something new get outrun by the companies that ship the obvious thing fast. And the obvious thing is always the same thing, because the obvious thing is, by definition, the thing that doesn't need original thinking.\n\nMoloch doesn't want you to build something good.\n\nMoloch wants you to build something now.\n\nThe competitive dynamic is bad enough at the product level. At the fundraising level, it's catastrophic.\n\nAI companies are raising at valuations that require them to grow at rates that are only achievable by chasing the broadest possible market with the most generic possible product. A company that raises at a $500M valuation needs to show a path to billions in revenue, which means it can't afford to be a niche tool that does one thing brilliantly for a specific audience. It has to be a platform, horizontal, aimed at enterprise, built for no one in particular.\n\nEvery AI company is building the same enterprise platform with the same features targeting the same buyers, because the fundraising math requires it, because the valuation requires it, because the competitive environment requires raising at that valuation to attract talent, because the talent market requires it.\n\nNobody in this chain chose this outcome. Every individual decision was rational. The aggregate result is an industry producing fifty identical products, none of which solve any specific problem particularly well, all of which are locked in a feature war that generates zero cumulative value.\n\nThe companies that would build something different (smaller, more focused, more opinionated) can't raise the capital to compete. The companies that raise the capital are structurally forced into sameness. Moloch eats the variance, and variance is where all the actual value lives.\n\nTop AI researchers and engineers go to the companies that are on the frontier. The frontier is defined by model capability benchmarks. So companies invest disproportionately in model capabilty, because that's how you attract talent, even when the marginal return on model capability for their specific product is near zero.\n\nYour users don't need GPT-5 when they can barely use GPT-4 effectively. They need better UX and better integration into how they actually work. But the engineer who could build that wants to work on the model, because model work is what gets you your next job, because the next company is also optimizing for model capability, because they need to attract talent too.\n\nEvery company overspends on model capability and underspends on product quality. The structure forces it. The talent market punishes you for having the right priorities.\n\nThe startup advice I've heard for a decade+ is \"Ignore the noise. Focus on users. Build something good.\"\n\nCorrect in theory, nearly impossible in practice, because Moloch specifically punishes this strategy in the medium term.\n\nBuilding something good takes time, and time means you're not shipping. Not shipping means you look like you're losing, which means talent leaves and investors get nervous, and your competitors (who are shipping fast and bad) capture market position that's expensive to reclaim.\n\nThe window in which \"build something good\" pays off is long, two years, three years, maybe more. The window in which Moloch punishes you for it is immediate and continuous. Most companies don't survive the medium term to reach teh long term.\n\nThe founders who know this stay up at night.\n\nThey can probably see the right thing to build.\n\nThey can't survive building it.\n\nYou can't outrun Moloch. You can only build a structure it can't reach.\n\nIn practice, this means: don't raise more than you need. Don't hire faster than your product vision can absorb. Don't compete on the frontier unless the frontier is where your users live. Find a niche that's too small for the Moloch-captured companies to notice and go so deep into it that by the time they arrive, your product is years ahead in the dimension that matters to those users.\n\nBe small enough that the competitve pressure doesn't distort your priorities. Be opinionated enough that you can't be dragged into building the same thing as everyone else. Be capitally efficient enough that you don't need the growth rate that forces you onto the treadmill. Be weird enough that nobody can copy you without becoming you.",

    "description": "When a startup founder allowed an employee's dog to start coming to the office, she had no idea he would become their biggest productivity hack.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sophia Kianni, a 24-year-old startup founder based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen my startup was raising $35 million in Series A funding, it was naturally a very intense period for our company. We were heads down, with everyone coming to the office early and leaving very late, five to six days a week.\n\nComing out of that time, one of our team members brought her dog, Ollie, to the office, and he kind of became our secret productivity hack.\n\nNow he comes in most days of the week, and it truly feels like we have an office dog. Culture is everything at an early-stage startup, and Ollie helps us foster an environment of people who are excited to do their work.\n\nHe's even helping us with hiring.\n\nI launched my commerce startup, Phia, two years ago with my roommate at Stanford. We're using AI to match users with products aligned to their preferences across various brands.\n\nOur office is based in Union Square in New York City. For the past year, our team of about 10 was working out of a 17th-floor office that we loved. As we completed our Series A funding round and expanded our team, we decided to rent the office on the floor below ours, with a staircase linking the two areas.\n\nI call our new floor the hacker lounge because it's where our engineers work and has a more casual, industrial vibe, with a common space to roam. That's where Ollie, our Shiba Inu office dog, hangs out. Anyone who wants to be around Ollie can come down to the lower level; otherwise, they can stay on the top level.\n\nOur team member who owns Ollie is fully in charge of him at the office, including his food, water, and bathroom breaks.\n\nThe bottom floor's layout is weirdly perfect for a dog. There's a tiny office space with only one desk where we keep his dog bed and food bowl, so when our teammate needs to go heads down to work on something like financial modeling, he can hang out in there.\n\nThe rest of the space has a large open concept in the middle where he can just roam around where he wants to. While he stays in the hacker lounge downstairs because of the space, our upstairs office stays much more buttoned up and professional.\n\nAs an early-stage startup, we have a level of intensity and grind culture, but we want to make sure our office environment still feels collaborative, kind, and inviting. I feel like that's exactly what a dog helps facilitate.\n\nWith Ollie around, we can laugh and talk with other people on our team while playing fetch. Having an office dog makes the atmosphere so much lighter and encourages us to spend that time together.\n\nIt's also so motivating and exciting knowing that if I'm staying late at the office, at least there's a delightful dog to cheer me up.\n\nIn the past, when I needed a break while working on something intense or time-consuming like an important deck, I'd leave the building to take a walk and clear my head. However, it was a time-consuming process.\n\nNow I can access that same mental reset by petting Ollie or having a lighthearted moment around him with my teammates. Then I can easily resume the task I was focused on with a fresh perspective.\n\nI think those refreshing moments with Ollie put us in a better mood, so we're able to stay at the office longer and be productive for a longer period of time.\n\nWe're trying to grow our team, so we've been making a lot of content tailored toward hiring recently. I feel like showcasing Ollie in our content has been a great way to showcase our work culture and attract the type of people we're looking for.\n\nOf course, we want to work with someone who is extremely high IQ and high agency, but we also want someone nice, fun, kind, delightful — the type of person who might be attracted to the idea of an office dog.\n\nWe'll make content saying, \"If you want to come and play with Ollie, you should apply to Phia\", and it's been a great hiring funnel. We recently got an email from someone with the subject line \"I want to say hi to Ollie,\" and it was a pitch to work for us.\n\nI don't have any frustrations with having an office dog. He fits perfectly in our space. When we have people come to our office, like investors, we have them go to our conference room.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting an office dog, make sure you have the right space to fit them in. If you have the facilities to have a dog, I would 100% recommend it.\n\nDo you have a story to share about a unique productivity hack?

He was 58.\n\nThe British-born man died Feb. 9 after the 17-story fall which occurred at a luxury condominium in Pattaya, according to Reuters.\n\nThai police told Reuters that initial investigations suggested suicide with no indications of foul play, and CCTV footage showed no one entering his apartment where he lived alone.\n\nPolice reported that Griffiths had been dealing with two ongoing court cases, including a legal dispute with his second wife over a business they ran together. Documents related to those lawsuits were found in his apartment, per the report.\n\nGriffiths co-founded Asos in London in 2000 with Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan and Deborah Thorpe. It was initially named “As Seen on Screen” before switching to the acronym in 2002.\n\nThe company grew to become valued at over £6 billion with designs worn by celebrities including Rihanna, Michelle Obama and Bella Hadid.\n\nGriffiths left Asos in 2005 but remained a large shareholder for nearly another decade and later co-founded several other ventures including online furniture store Achica, music-focused fashion retailer EBTM and ethical clothing website Adili.\n\n“We’re saddened to hear about the passing of Quentin, one of our original co-founders,” an Asos spokesperson said in a statement to BBC News. “He played an important role in Asos’s earliest days and we’re forever grateful for his contribution.

    "description": "A solo founder used AI to vibe code her website, cut 60-minute tasks to one-minute, and scale her coaching business without hiring employees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Christina Puder, a 35-year-old solo founder based in Madrid. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I took my side hustle full-time, I needed a website and accidentally fell into the world of building with AI.\n\nAfter trying an old website builder and failing, I hired a designer and an engineer part-time to do it. They were a bit slow, so while I was waiting, I tried using a suggested AI tool to build my website.\n\nI don't have funding or a technical background, so I made a free account with Lovable, an AI coding assistant. I started adding simple information about the website design, and all of a sudden, the AI platform built the entire landing page. That was my gateway into all the things AI can do.\n\nSometimes using AI feels like I'm working with the dumbest person I've ever met, but the word \"constraint\" very rarely enters my mind when I think about how AI is enabling me to run my business.\n\nFor about the last 10 years, I've been doing career coaching for product managers on the side of my full-time job. I went from zero clients to consistently having a full plate. In 2025, I decided to coach full-time.\n\nI knew I wanted to be bootstrapped, and hiring full-time employees was way too expensive. Part-time isn't ideal either because that's somebody who might not fully understand my business needs; it's not their main focus.\n\nBefore building my website, I was a casual AI user. I would go to ChatGPT for help with ideas, writing, and research. I don't have a background in tech, and because of that, I initially didn't think of AI as an enabler for my business. After building my website, I discovered how useful AI could be for both my webpage and the internal system of my business.\n\nWhen I tried building my website before using AI, I probably put in 30 or 40 hours, and it turned out so ugly and clunky. Then I started testing Loveable using five free credits a day. After seeing how fast the AI tool worked and how good it looked, I knew I'd be back the next day to keep building.\n\nWhen I first started using Lovable, I think the credits were correlated to the number of messages I sent. I discovered a hack after I sent a message with a single easy change request, and it cost me a credit. In the next message, I put six requests, and it did all six changes and only took one credit again.\n\nI think they've discovered that loophole. Now, credit usage seems more closely tied to the amount of power a request consumes. There are times I'm building, and I'm surprised because I won't realize I'm making such an expensive request.\n\nI'm not sure how many credits it took to build my whole website. It's definitely more than five, but someone could build a whole landing page with five credits. They could ask the AI tool to make a basic website with three sections and brand colors, and I think it would honestly only take two and a half credits.\n\nI switched to a paid account, and now I pay $20 a month for my subscription, which I don't think is that expensive. I get 100 credits a month, plus my five free credits every day that don't roll over.\n\nI've started to think of my AI tools as workers. I want to make sure I use them to their full capacity, which is why I always try to use the credits that don't roll over. It's the same as if I hired someone full-time: I'd want them to deliver high output every day.\n\nIf it's been a while since I've given my website backend some love, I'll write a prompt asking which areas of the code would most benefit from a refactor, and ask it to rank them. Then, based on how many of my five credits I have left, I'll tell it which areas to fix.\n\nOne service I offer is finding and applying to jobs for clients. Each client has very specific criteria for the kinds of jobs they want, and I would manually search for jobs that fit those criteria for each client.\n\nIt used to take me around 60 minutes a day per client just to manually find the right jobs to apply for. I built AI-driven automations that reduced search time to one minute. Getting 60 minutes a day back for each of my clients has been a massive scale unlock.\n\nI really didn't think it was possible.\n\nEvery once in a while, things break, or I hit bugs. There have been times when I'm building something, and I spend 40 credits trying to fix it. After a while, I'll ask the AI to completely remove the feature we're working on because we've hit a bug. I'll tell them that instead of continuing to try to dig our way out, we're just going to start from scratch.\n\nThere was once an issue with some logos on my website. I tried and tried to prompt it to make them all look the same size together, but it wouldn't do it. I eventually went back to my part-time engineer and asked them to fix it.\n\nEvery once in a while, I go back to that engineer and just pay him to fix one or two specific things that I can't get done.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Krista LeRay, founder and CEO of Penny Linn Designs. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first needlepoint project was in college. I moved from the Chicago suburbs to the University of Kentucky for college and remember feeling struck by how preppy everything was. Everyone had these needlepoint belts that they would wear. I wanted to immerse myself in the culture, so I decided to try needlepoint.\n\nA local needlepoint store showed me how to do the basic continental stitch, and that was that. I stitched in college but then didn't think about it for a while, until my then-boyfriend (now husband) started talking about a needlepoint belt, and I said I could make him one.\n\nThen I stitched a ringbearer pillow for our wedding in 2019, and really fell back in love with the hobby. But I couldn't find the things I wanted to stitch in stores. It all felt older to me, so when the pandemic hit in 2020, and I had extra time on my hands, I started painting my own canvases. Since then, I've grown Penny Linn Designs to over 10 million in sales.\n\nI worked for Major League Baseball after graduating from college in 2013, but also ran a successful blog on the side. Eventually, I started making more money from my blog than at my corporate job, and I began blogging full-time.\n\nI shared the canvas I painted with my followers. It was the green Ralph's Coffee cup. My followers started asking me if I could paint a canvas for them to stitch, and that's what led me down the path to starting Penny Linn.\n\nThings just sort of snowballed. By 2022, I was making as much as I was making from my blog, making needlepoint canvases. When I had my first son that year, I had been blogging for 10 years and had sort of hit my max with sharing my life online. It felt like a natural progression to turn my full attention to Penny Linn.\n\nThroughout my blogging experience, I dealt with a lot of negative comments and cattiness. It helped me build a thick skin, something that is definitely needed when running a business.\n\nI have a 24-hour rule about dealing with criticism. I try not to read things about myself online, but if I do, I always ask whether the comment is valid. If it's not, I can push the critique aside.\n\nIf it is, I give myself 24 hours to be upset about it. After that, I either move on or decide to make a change.\n\nI only want to invest in things I'm good at and feel confident in. It's tough, but you have to decide what you're standing firm on when you grow a business. For me, that means that Penny Linn doesn't offer finishing services for our needlepoint projects.\n\nI don't want to provide a product that isn't up to my standards, and right now I don't believe we're good enough to get there. That makes some people mad, but I know it's right for us.\n\nOne of the other things I do is hire people who are smarter than me for my team. I know I don't know everything, so I look to others to help guide me on things like accounting and legal issues.\n\nI always say that Penny Linn is for a stitcher by a stitcher. I'm the stitcher that I'm talking about. Everything we sell is something I'd want to make. For now, that means mainly smaller canvases.\n\nA lot of people coming to Penny Linn are needlepoint beginners, so the projects are easier to manage and less expensive than larger projects like Christmas stockings. As our customers continue to grow with us, we'll start offering bigger projects.\n\nNeedlepoint is a popular hobby now, and I definitely worry about whether its popularity will continue. But I always remind myself that things like embroidery and needlepoint have been around since the dawn of time. Once you're a needlepointer, you're one for life. I think people will always come back to it, and we'll continue to evolve.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

    "fullText": "Izzy Martinez doesn't ever give Daniel Cormier a chance against Jon Jones – even on the wrestling mats.\n\nMartinez was Jones' wrestling coach for his two UFC light heavyweight title fights against Cormier. Jones emerged victorious in both, with his head kick knockout in their UFC 214 rematch overturned to a no contest after he tested positive for a turinabol metabolite.\n\nAn Olympic wrestler during the 2004 and 2008 games, Cormier said he'd be open to wrestling Jones under Martinez's Real American Freestyle banner.\n\n\"I love the guy. He's awesome – tons of respect for him. But they need to beat Jon at some point,\" Martinez told MMA Junkie Radio of Cormier. \"Daniel Cormier hasn't beat Jon. I don't think he can beat Jon at anything, but he needs to beat him at something, and the next best thing that he's ever able to do is wrestle. So that's always been the sh*t talk.\n\n\"'Oh, you could beat me in a fight, but I'd beat your ass in wrestling.' Even when I was telling Hulk Hogan, one day, it would be a hell of a dream because Daniel Cormier would actually think he's going to come out here and kill Jon, and Jon will shock him again and the wrestling world will go crazy. So yeah, that's a dream.\"\n\nDespite the magnitude of a potential wrestling match, Martinez isn't so sure it would materialize.\n\n\"Jon's cool, man. He's in his own world in a good way,\" Martinez said. \"He loves Gable Steveson. He's down there. He loves his family. So I don't think it's a priority to put on wrestling shoes, give Daniel Cormier a shot at even coming close to him. I think Jon loves the fact that he lives in Cormier's head. I don't think Jon or DC want to train that hard and put it on the line again. But if they do, they know who to call, baby.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: RAF co-founder: Daniel Cormier can't beat Jon Jones at anything",

    "fullText": "The creator of a popular AI coding agent said software engineering as a job title will soon be a thing of the past as artificial intelligence automates writing code.\n\nBoris Cherny, who created Claude Code at Anthropic, said in an interview with Y Combinator's \"Lightcone\" podcast that 2026 will bring \"insane\" developments to AI. That includes a massive shift in the work software engineers do across industries.\n\n\"I think today coding is practically solved for me, and I think it'll be the case for everyone regardless of domain,\" Cherny said in the interview, published Tuesday. \"I think we're going to start to see the title 'software engineer' go away. And I think it's just going to be maybe builder, maybe product manager, maybe we'll keep the title as a vestigial thing.\"\n\nCherny added that software engineers will not only be coding but increasingly taking on other tasks like \"writing specs\" — a document that defines what and how something will be built — or talking to users.\n\n\"Like this thing that we're starting to see right now in our team, where engineers are very much generalists, and every single function on our team codes,\" he said — including product managers, designers, engineering manager, and finance people.\n\nTech executives and founders have said advancements in AI have rapidly changed the way their teams operate in the past few years\n\nJesal Gadhia, a startup founder, recently told Business Insider that all the code for his company were written by agents, which wouldn't have been possible in 2024.\n\nAgents like Claude have changed how software engineers work as they spend more time reviewing or debugging code rather than writing lines of it.\n\nSome in the industry have started to note the unintended consequences of relying on AI. A software engineer told Business Insider that AI has simultaneously made them productive and overworked, leading to \"AI fatigue.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and Tesla's ex-head of AI, said in January that he has noticed his ability to manually code has started to \"atrophy.\"",

    "fullText": "It is with sad hearts that we learn of the passing of George Barber, founder of the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum. The AMA Motorcycle Hall of Famer was 85.\n\nBarber was a philanthropist, real estate developer and businessman, son of George Warren Barber Sr., who founded Barber Dairies in the 1930s. Barber Jr. began privately collecting motorcycles in the '70s, and in 1994, established a museum to display his collection to the public. In 2003, he opened Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Alabama, where he relocated his museum.\n\nBarber Vintage Motorsports Museum: An Interview with George Barber\n\nThe AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame inducted Barber in 2014, in recognition of his efforts in preserving motorcycle history.\n\nThe American Motorcyclist Association is saddened to learn of the passing of AMA Motorcycle Hall of Famer George Barber, who passed away at 85 years old.\n\nFounder of the prestigious Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum in Birmingham, Ala., home to the world's largest collection of historic motorcycles, Barber had a unique impact on the motorcycling community.\n\nSon of George H. Barber, founder of Barber Dairy and pioneer for dairy pasteurization in the United States, the younger Barber's love for motor vehicles started early in his life. In the 1960s, Barber raced and wrenched on his own Porsche racers with great success, claiming a large collection of wins behind the wheel.\n\nBarber's interest in motorcycles began soon after, leading him to open his own museum and hire skilled workers to restore vintage motorcycles to help build his collection. At the same time, Barber operated a vintage motorcycle racing team, which raced across the United States and Europe.\n\nIn 1994, Barber's museum gained 501(c)(3) nonprofit status and was officially named the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum.\n\nIn 2002, Barber opted to close the original location of the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum, moving his collection to its current location in September 2003, an 830-acre complex that also includes a 2.38-mile road circuit.\n\nFor his longtime preservation of motorcycle history, Barber was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nBecome a Motorcycle.com insider.

    "fullText": "Not long after the terms “996” and “grindcore” entered the popular lexicon, people started telling me stories about what was happening at startups in San Francisco, ground zero for the artificial intelligence economy.

Or the employees who had started taking their shoes off in the office because, well, if you were going to be there for at least 12 hours a day, six days a week, wouldn’t you rather be wearing slippers?\n\n“If you go to a cafe on a Sunday, everyone is working,” says Sanju Lokuhitige, the co-founder of Mythril, a pre-seed-stage AI startup, who moved to San Francisco in November to be closer to the action. Lokuhitige says he works seven days a week, 12 hours a day, minus a few carefully selected social events each week where he can network with other people at startups. “Sometimes I’m coding the whole day,” he says. “I do not have work-life balance.”\n\nAnother startup employee, who came to San Francisco to work for an early-stage AI company, showed me dismal photos from his office: a two-bedroom apartment in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood popular with tech workers. His startup’s founders live and work in this apartment – from 9am until as late as 3am, breaking only to DoorDash meals or to sleep, and leaving the building only to take cigarette breaks. The employee (who asked not to use his name, since he still works for this company) described the situation as “horrendous”. “I’d heard about 996, but these guys don’t even do 996,” he says. “They’re working 16-hour days.”\n\nStartups have never been particularly glamorous. When I started reporting on the industry a decade ago, people were cashing in on the new mobile app economy, and coders were chugging Soylent to stay at their desks longer. Startups then, too, were defined by hustle culture, high-octane energy and the pursuit of growth at all costs – ideas that, to some extent, have remained in the bloodstream of the industry.\n\nBut in the last year, as the magic dust of artificial intelligence has settled in San Francisco, the vibe among tech workers does seem different. The excitement about a new epoch in tech – and all the money that comes with it – is now tempered with anxieties about the industry, and the economy. Some workers are going all in on AI while also questioning whether all that AI is good for the world. Others are effectively training machines to do their jobs better than they can. And many of the same workers who are racing to build the future are now wondering if the future they’re building has a place for them in it.\n\nThe rest of us may be ambiently aware of these anxieties, but they are already tangible and keenly felt inside the tech industry. Even the biggest tech companies, once known for coddling employees with on-site massages and barber shops, have scaled back perks as they have escalated the expectations of workers. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have each been candid about their predictions that AI will replace some junior and mid-level engineers at their companies, and have respectively called for their workforces to be more “efficient” and “extremely hard core” as waves of layoffs set employees on-edge. Tech companies laid off about a quarter of a million workers around the world in 2025, according to a report published by RationalFX. In many of those layoffs, AI was cited as a main factor, even if the full reason for layoffs is often more complex.\n\n“If you were a software engineer five years ago, you could kind of write your ticket,” says Mike Robbins, an executive coach who has worked with companies like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Airbnb. Now, the balance of power has shifted away from tech workers, many of whom are left feeling anxious about their work performance. “When companies become less scared about losing employees, then they can be a little more forthright in terms of what they want and be a little more demanding.”\n\nRobbins, who wrote the book Bring Your Whole Self to Work, used to be asked to speak to companies and their leaders about topics like employee burnout, wellbeing and belonging – top priorities in the years during and shortly after the pandemic. “Quite frankly, we’ve stopped talking about all that,” he says. Now, company leaders want advice on topics like change, disruption and uncertainty in the workplace.\n\nThose themes – change, disruption and uncertainty – are each part of the fuel that has driven tech workers to put in more hours, at a higher intensity. Investment in artificial intelligence companies reached record highs in 2025, yet workers are feeling scarcity in ways they haven’t before.\n\n“It’s definitely something that’s on everyone’s mind,” says Kyle Finken, a software engineer at Mintlify, which makes an AI tool for developers. “I think a lot of people are concerned like, ‘Oh, am I going to have a job in three years?’”\n\nDespite his fears, Finken, like many other startup employees I spoke to, feels energized by the “extraordinary innovation” happening in artificial intelligence and believes that there will still be plenty of jobs for software engineers in the future, even if those jobs look different from the pure coding roles of today. He and other tech workers characterized the current moment as a particularly creative and productive time in tech, where people are devoting extra hours to work not because their employers demand it but out of genuine interest in the new tools and capabilities. For example, Garry Tan, the head of the famous startup accelerator Y Combinator, recently bragged that he “stayed up 19 hours” playing around with Claude Code.\n\nEven those who felt excited about the pace of change acknowledged that AI was rapidly augmenting their work, in ways that could have uncertain outcomes for the jobs of the future. “This is definitely not an era of complacency,” says Finken.\n\nOne reason for working so many hours is to keep up with tools and technology that are changing nearly every day. If you take the weekend off, you can miss a major development, which makes it harder to keep up with what competitors are doing. Another reason is to have something to show future employers, especially as more junior-level jobs are replaced by AI.\n\n“No one hires junior developers any more,” says Lokuhitige, the Mythril co-founder. Landing a job now requires “doing something cool”, he says, like building a new product or solving a problem that gets recognized as useful by larger companies. Job postings for entry-level tech jobs have dropped by a third since 2022, according to Indeed’s Hiring Lab, while job postings requiring at least five years of experience have risen. If you’re not grinding at a startup, you’re missing the prerequisite to get hired in the future.\n\nWhile economists are torn about whether AI will replace most jobs or just change them, they seem aligned in the idea that AI has already reshaped a great deal of entry-level work and will continue to do so. A paper published by Stanford researchers in November found “substantial declines in employment for early-career workers” in industries exposed to AI and suggested that areas where change is already occurring could be like a “canary in the coalmine” for the rest of the economy. The Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei, has suggested AI could eliminate about half of all entry-level jobs in white-collar industries within the next five years.\n\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund recently predicted that 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence, “like a tsunami hitting the labour market”. In San Francisco, you can already see the early signs, as Uber drivers compete with self-driving Waymos, and baristas are replaced by robotic coffee bars. Professional business services that support the tech industry have also been negatively affected by the layoffs. The pressure to grind in the tech world could be an early signal – a harbinger for what many other industries will feel soon.\n\nRobbins, the executive coach, says that companies once looked to Silicon Valley as a model of how they should operate, down to emulating policies like unlimited vacation days or adopting perks like free lunch in the office.\n\n“There was an idealization of tech and Silicon Valley for a long time across the business world. Some of that has changed,” he says. “Now, people aren’t asking me to tell them what’s going on in the Valley so that they can adopt it, the same way they were a decade ago.”\n\nRather than a model of how we should all work, the tech industry may be a premonition for the anxiety and attempts to compensate that are coming for all of us.",

    "fullText": "Expect to see your local Starbucks soon be full of middle-aged former office workers, says Andrew Yang.\n\nThe Forward Party founder and former presidential candidate said AI \"will kick millions of white-collar workers to the curb in the next 12 - 18 months\" in a post on his Substack on Monday.\n\nYang said that, when a company begins to shrink its workforce, its competitors will follow suit.\n\n\"It will become a competition because the stock market will reward you if you cut headcount and punish you if you don't,\" he added.\n\nYang has long warned about the impact of automation on jobs — he had previously told The New York Times in 2018 that he predicted self-driving cars would displace truck drivers, a shift that could \"destabilize society\" and provoke \"riots in the street.\"\n\nIn his Substack post, Yang then laid out which workers could be vulnerable: mid-career office workers, middle managers, call center workers, marketers, and coders. The list goes on.\n\n\"Do you sit at a desk and look at a computer much of the day? Take this very seriously,\" he wrote. \"Millions of workers are about to be given their pink slips.\"\n\nYang did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nThis January saw more layoffs than any January since 2009. Though this has largely been attributed to economic uncertainty, a few companies have already begun citing AI as a reason they are letting staff go.\n\nPinterest said in January that it expects to lay off 15% of its workforce. A spokesperson for Pinterest said the restructuring was part of the company's \"AI-forward strategy.\"\n\nHP said in November that it would cut up to 6,000 jobs by 2028, citing AI initiatives as the reason.\n\nCritics have also said some companies are using AI as a scapegoat for job cuts.\n\nTech CEOs and AI researchers are divided over how AI will impact society. While Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predict a future of great abundance for all, others, such as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, say we should brace for significant white-collar layoffs.\n\nYang said the impact of his predicted layoffs will be felt beyond those who actually lose their jobs.\n\n\"Let's say you're a dry cleaner, a dog walker, or a hairstylist. If people in your community stop going to the office, your business is going to suffer because there are fewer business shirts to launder, people will walk their dogs themselves, and cut back on trips to the salon,\" he said.\n\n\"The amount of money getting paid to human labor is about to go down,\" Yang said.",

AJ Scaramucci, the founder of venture capital firm Solari Capital and the son of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nScaramucci appeared on Logan Paul's livestream early Monday after auction house Goldin announced him the winning bidder in the auction, which closed at 1:14 am ET.\n\n\"My ambition for the card is just a small story,\" Scaramucci said at the event. \"The real story is that I'm on a planetary treasure hunt. I'm planning to buy a T. rex dinosaur fossil, the Declaration of Independence, and I'm not stopping there. This is only the beginning.\"\n\n\"You're just starting?\" Paul replied. \"Bro. Bro, that is so epic.\"\n\nPaul also used the livestream to open packs of Pokémon cards and announce RipIt, a new collectibles business he's launching.\n\nIn a statement, Goldin described the Pokémon card, which was originally given to winners of an illustration competition in Japan, as \"one of the Holy Grails of the collectibles industry.\"\n\nPaul previously set the world record back in July 2021 when he purchased the same card for $5.275 million, meaning he will make millions in profit.\n\nThe card also came with a diamond-encrusted chain appraised at $75,000, Goldin said. Paul wore the card during his WWE debut at WrestleMania 38 in 2022.\n\nIn an Instagram post on Saturday, Paul bid farewell to the card.\n\n\"Goodbye my friend 😢 What a privilege it's been to be the owner of the greatest collectible in the world,\" he wrote.\n\nThe markets for Pokémon cards, along with other collectible card sets like Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh!, have become huge in recent years among collectors — especially Gen Z — with the rarest cards selling for tens of thousands of dollars, if not more.\n\nSome people are even forgoing stocks and investing in Pokémon cards instead.",

To get his first customers in Seoul, he decided to get Starbucks' help.\n\n\"So my strategy was, I'm going to put a Gong Cha — the first five stores — next to Starbucks,\" Berry told CNBC. \"And if I can get one in a hundred people who are going into Starbucks to come and try a Gong Cha, then I've got a business.\"\n\nGong Cha was founded in Taiwan in 1996 by Wu Zhenhua, and Berry entered the business in 2011 to expand the brand to South Korea and other countries. As of January, the chain had about 2,200 stores in 33 countries, including the US and Canada.\n\nThe chain is known for its fragrant, fruity teas and its milk foam topping.\n\nBubble tea brands have seen large success in recent years, with several making splashy IPOs.\n\nMixue, the world's largest fast-food chain that sells cheap bubble tea and ice cream, has more than 45,000 stores worldwide and just opened its first outlet in New York City at the start of the year. It went public in Hong Kong last March, with its stock jumping 30% from its IPO price at market open.\n\nOther Asian beverage brands, like Luckin Coffee, have positioned themselves as Starbucks' rivals, offering similar drinks at lower prices.

    "fullText": "Thinking about using ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity to collect your thoughts for an email to your lawyers? Don't assume your chat will stay confidential.\n\nA federal judge ruled on Tuesday that prosecutors could access Claude chat transcripts generated by Brad Heppner, a finance startup founder accused of defrauding a company out of $150 million.\n\nThe chats occurred after Heppner received a subpoena, hired lawyers, and learned that he was a target of prosecutors, his lawyer said in court.\n\nHeppner, who helped start the finance firm Beneficient, was arrested last year and charged with wire and securities fraud for conduct that allegedly led to the downfall of GWG Holdings.\n\nInvestigators seized \"dozens of electronic devices\" when they arrested Heppner at his Dallas mansion, prosecutors said, and Heppner's lawyers have insisted that 31 chats with Anthropic's Claude bot on those devices are privileged.\n\n\"Mr. Heppner — using an AI tool — prepared reports that outlined defense strategy, that outlined what he might argue with respect to the facts and the law that we anticipated that the government might be charging,\" his lawyer said.\n\n\"The purpose of his preparing these reports was to share them with us so that he could discuss defense strategy with us.\"\n\nEven though Heppner had privileged conversations with his lawyers, Judge Jed Rakoff said he \"disclosed it to a third-party, in effect, AI, which had an express provision that what was submitted was not confidential,\" according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\nThe government noted that Claude's privacy policy specified that chats could be disclosed. Prosecutors also said that the chats couldn't be protected by the \"work product privilege,\" which can guard materials prepared at a lawyer's direction, because Heppner's lawyers didn't ask him to use Claude.\n\nThe decision has lawyers buzzing.\n\n\"My gut reaction is that the decision is directionally correct,\" Moish Peltz, an attorney whose post about the decision ricocheted around X, told Business Insider. \"There's a lot of materials that should be kept as privileged that people are putting into AI.\"\n\nThe proliferation of chatbots where people are inputting sensitive legal information, another wrote, has created \"a discovery nightmare.\"\n\nNoah Bunzl, an employment lawyer, told Business Insider that people might find it \"somewhat shocking\" that their legal confidences could be lost by sharing them with a chatbot.\n\nThe case isn't the first where an executive's use of a chatbot was the subject of legal debate.\n\nIn November, PC Gamer reported on a dispute involving the acquisition of a video-game company, where a company official's use of ChatGPT to try to avoid paying an earn-out was mentioned in court records.\n\nAnd after The New York Times sued OpenAI for allegedly violating its news article copyrights, a judge required OpenAI to retain millions of chat logs to potentially review them for copyright infringement.\n\nBunzl said he has noticed that in civil discovery, lawyers are increasingly asking for their adversary's AI chats. It's \"a whole other world of discoverable information,\" he said.\n\nStill, attorneys at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, who analyzed the Heppner decision, said it was the first they were aware of where someone's use of an AI tool may have resulted in \"a loss of privilege\" over privileged material. They said courts may view businesses' use of purpose-built AI tools differently.\n\nArlo Devlin-Brown, a white-collar defense lawyer, told Business Insider he thought AI models could potentially improve attorney-client information. But given the ambiguity in the law, people have to be vigilant.\n\n\"Until the law has been clarified, lawyers should caution their clients that inputting otherwise privileged information into an AI tool could risk exposure in litigation,\" he said in an email.\n\nRepresentatives for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and Anthropic, and lawyers for Heppner, didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tyler Smith, founder of Hundred Health. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI used to brag about how little sleep I got. It felt like a superpower: I could sleep just three or four hours a night, and still operate at a very high level.\n\nThat helped me get ahead early on. As a teen, I bused tables and sold firewood. By the time I was 19, I bought a house (which was possible because it was the subprime mortgage days). Having a mortgage gave me real responsibility at a young age.\n\nIt also got me thinking about a career. I couldn't believe how much my real estate agent made on the sale. Her commission was about $13,000 — which seemed like $1 million to me at the time — and I thought she didn't do a very good job. I realized that if I did good work in real estate, I could make even more.\n\nI dropped out of college to get into real estate. During the financial crisis, I found a niche helping banks sell foreclosures. In 2006 and 2007, I oversaw about 1,000 home sales a year and managed triple that number of properties.\n\nI was working 14-hour days, seven days a week. It wasn't a good life, but I was young enough that it didn't matter. I fueled myself on energy drinks and embraced the fact that work was my life.\n\nTo help scale, I developed software to track my business's transactions. Other brokerages inquired about what I was using, and soon I had clients paying $2,000 or $5,000 a month to use the software.\n\nI was in the right place at the right time with the right product as real estate transactions went digital. By 2012, that software, SkySlope, was doing $12 million in annual revenue. In 2017, Fidelity bought a majority stake, valuing the company at more than $80 million.\n\nThat deal meant that I had enough money to never work again. I'm wired to build, though, so I planned to use my financial freedom to focus on something with purpose: a mission-driven business.\n\nWhen I was 39, my wife and I were trying to have a child. I took a biological age test, which said my biological age was 47. That stopped me in my tracks, because my own father had died suddenly of a heart attack at 47.\n\nThe test showed me that what I was telling myself wasn't true. I was working out and eating relatively healthy. I looked fit, but the data showed that what was happening inside my body didn't match what was on the outside.\n\nOnce I saw that data, I couldn't ignore it. I spent well over six figures hiring a top-notch healthcare team. My wife and I rented a 2,000 square-foot unit in Sacramento, which we transformed into our own personal wellness center. It had IV infusions, a hyperbaric chamber, a red light bed, cold plunges, massagers — basically anything you can name in the health and fitness world.\n\nWe were building a home in Napa and wanted to know which equipment we would actually use. We spent about $700,000 fitting out the Sacramento space, and eventually over $1 million building the wellness center in our home.\n\nToday, I use the red light bed, oxygen therapy, and cold plunge almost daily. Other therapies — like massagers and bikes — didn't make the final cut. I love the results of the hyperbaric chamber, but don't like lying in it for an hour, so for now, that's out of rotation.\n\nI changed everything about my health and fitness, and because of that, everything in my life changed: my muscle mass and energy levels went through the roof, and my mood improved. I felt better than ever, and friends began to notice.\n\nI know not everyone has the money and access I do. Most people have more data about their health than ever due to smart watches and wearable monitors, but they don't have a team of doctors helping them use that information.\n\nI started Hundred Health not only to provide data, but also to offer a personalized plan for what to do with it. I used to think that wealth was freedom, but now I know that health is — and I would like to help more people access that.",

    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

Called Dragonfly, the megayacht is owned by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who sailed it into Florida for the elite art showcase.\n\nWith a status as one of the largest private yachts in the world, Luxurylaunches described Dragonfly as \"something closer to a floating skyscraper than a yacht.\" The vessel has enough space to house up to 18 guests — and a 40-member crew.\n\nWhile Brin visited Art Basel, his docked megayacht continued to run its extensive energy-hungry systems — including air conditioning, lights, IT infrastructure, security systems, and more. The result is a concerning environmental impact that shows the gap between the ultra-wealthy and the average American.\n\nTogether, all of Dragonfly's luxe megayacht accommodations consume electricity at a rate equivalent to powering hundreds of average Florida homes per day. Experts told Luxurylaunches that on a heavy operational day, Dragonfly can consume an estimated 28,800 kilowatt-hours in 24 hours. The average Florida household uses about 1,104 kilowatt-hours per month.\n\n\"Dragonfly's single day at the dock equals the daily electricity use of roughly 780 to 800 Florida households,\" the outlet noted. \"Look at it another way, and it is about 26 Florida households' entire monthly consumption, burned through in 24 hours.\"\n\nWith electricity totaling an estimated $0.30 per kilowatt-hour, Luxurylaunches noted that Dragonfly's electricity bill alone comes to roughly $8,640 per day. Dragonfly runs on a hybrid diesel-electric system, which helps offset some of its environmental impact — but certainly not enough to classify it as environmentally clean or neutral.\n\nAs many communities face rising energy costs and feel the burdens of rising global pollution, the ultra-wealthy continue to burn resources at an astonishing — and largely unchecked — scale.\n\nThis massive consumption simply for pure luxury undercuts collective efforts to slow rising global temperatures. Stronger climate policy, true accountability, and greater investment in clean energy are needed to help address resource overuse and the growing damage superyachts cause to our oceans.\n\nAll superyachts also have outsized impacts on marine ecosystems and human health, regardless of whether they are electric, hybrid, or powered entirely by dirty energy. Beyond harmful carbon pollution, superyachts release wastewater, generate plastic waste, and flood marine environments with artificial light.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nNotably, superyachts also generate a great deal of noise pollution, an often overlooked threat that experts warn can be as damaging as air pollution. Research links chronic noise exposure to hearing loss, sleep disruption, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and developmental delays in children.\n\nAt sea, excessive noise can interfere with whale and dolphin communication, placing species that depend on sound for navigation, feeding, and survival at risk.\n\nDragonfly may turn heads for its massive size and luxury, but its harmful environmental impact is impossible to ignore. As the realities of environmental pollution become increasingly dire, the extreme excess of superyachts like Dragonfly shows how the wealthy can sidestep environmental responsibility — while contributing to global pollution on a scale few others ever could.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

But if what you're saying is follows the last model, it's almost like it wouldn't necessarily be a positive catalyst, it might be a negative sort of like that last capitulation catalyst.\n\nYeah. Right. We need Correct. Correct.\n\nWhat are the what what could be that catalyst?\n\nSo, you know, some people thought uh FTX. Uh, maybe there's another similar type of thing out there.\n\nLike there's a blow up waiting in the wings somewhere.\n\nYeah, like, you know, most people have said that the acceleration down really started after October 10th. You know, October 10th there was a flash crash.\n\nAnd we're we've had flash crashes in the traditional markets. I was in the hedge fund business in the old world for 25 years. I saw many flash crashes. They're normal.\n\nAnd in crypto, you've have flash crashes all the time. It used to be, I don't know if you remember but in 2016, 17, 18, Coinbase would go down and people would say, oh, Coinbase is down and you would have a flash crash.\n\nAnd so we had a very severe moment on October 10th that is yet to be sort of resolved. The person who was maybe forced to liquidate, uh or the entity that was forced to liquidate, uh it seems is still, uh, is still liquidating. Maybe there is an entity, maybe there isn't. We don't know, but I think um there has to be sort of a capitulative moment, a moment of realization where people say, oh my goodness,\n\nit's over. And we've already been seeing that, oh Bitcoin's going to zero. Someone asked me the other day at dinner whether Bitcoin was going to zero. Um, so it's sort of unfortunate, but that's sort of the way markets work. And unfortunately with this specific crypto blockchain market, you have a lot of individuals, a lot of retail of non-professional investor.",

    "title": "Jim Ratcliffe apologises for claiming Britain has been ‘colonised’ by migrants as FA looks into comments",
    "description": "The Ineos founder said he was sorry if he ‘offended some people’ with his remarks, but insisted that is important to ‘raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth’",
    "fullText": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has offered a lukewarm apology for his claim Britain has been “colonised” by migrants, as the FA confirmed it would look into whether the comments have brought the game into disrepute.\n\nThe Manchester United co-owner said he was sorry if he “offended some people” with his remarks, but insisted that was important to “raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth”.\n\nSir Jim, one of Britain’s richest men, faced growing backlash for the comments and was under pressure from a string of high-profile politicians, including Sir Keir Starmer, to apologise.\n\nThe prime minister said the comments were “offensive and wrong”, while Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said they were “inaccurate, insulting and inflammatory”.\n\nIf the FA finds Sir Jim’s remarks brought the game into disrepute, he is likely to be hit with a financial penalty.\n\nIt came after Sir Jim, who founded the chemical giant Ineos in 1998, told Sky News: “You can’t have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK is being colonised. It’s costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants.”\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, the billionaire said: “I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern, but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.\n\n“My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.\n\n“My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK.”\n\nThe apology was welcomed by the prime minister’s official spokesperson, who told reporters: “The prime minister asked for an apology, and one’s been issued, and it’s absolutely right that Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for that language.”\n\nPressed on whether it went far enough, the official said: “It’s right that he’s apologised. It’s for Mr Ratcliffe to speak to his apology… It’s not for me.”\n\nConfirming that there had been no contact between Downing Street and Sir Jim about his comments, the spokesperson added: “We are of course of the view that there should be a serious debate about immigration, but the prime minister believes in a Britain built for all, and that those comments were inflammatory and divisive.”\n\nOthers have said the apology does not go far enough, with Minnie Rahman, head of the refugee charity Praxis, dubbing it “half-hearted”. Writing for LBC, she said: “Blaming migrants for today’s economic problems is a convenient way to dodge responsibility for that failure. His half-hearted apology only underlines the point: powerful men are quick to inflame division, but slow to accept accountability for the consequences.”\n\nTthe Conservative peer and former transport secretary Mark Harper said the apology could have been “a little more generous”, describing it as “one of those terrible ‘I’m sorry if I’ve offended anyone’ apologies”.\n\nMr Burnham, who previously backed plans driven by Sir Jim to regenerate Old Trafford and build a new stadium for Manchester United, had said the remarks “go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood”. He added that “footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city region”.\n\nThe mayor then appeared to hit out at United’s ownership, saying: “If any criticism is needed, it should be directed towards those who have offered little contribution to our life here and have instead spent years siphoning wealth out of one of our proudest institutions.”\n\nKick It Out, the anti-discrimination football campaign group, said Sir Jim’s comments were “disgraceful and deeply divisive” and also criticised his claim that the UK population had swollen by 12 million since 2020, which has proved to be inaccurate.\n\nManchester United said it “prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club” that has “embedded equality, diversity and inclusion into everything we do”.\n\n“Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters reflect the history and heritage of Manchester, a city that anyone can call home,” the club said in a statement posted to social media. “We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.”\n\nSir Jim bought a minority share in Manchester United in late 2023 and his Ineos group has since taken control of football operations.\n\nThe Football Association is understood to be examining whether his comments have brought the game into disrepute, as well as looking to whether they breached its regulations.\n\nShould the FA choose to formally investigate, the probe may be focused on FA Rule E3.1, which covers general behaviour, and states: “A participant shall at all times act in the best interests of the game and shall not act in any manner which is improper or brings the game into disrepute or use any one, or a combination of, violent conduct, serious foul play, threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting words or behaviour.”\n\nThe FA’s guidance says there are “no set sanctions for media comments or social networking comments cases. However, financial penalties are the most usual form of sanction for these kind of cases.” Sir Jim, as a club co-owner, is subject to FA rules as a participant.",

    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "description": "Hassan Ismail cofounded a defense tech startup in Canada. He found the country's regulations difficult to navigate, and the investors too risk-averse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hassan Ismail, the 24-year-old cofounder of Yellowcake, who lives in Toronto. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2021, there was a government bid in Canada for some military hardware. My cofounder and I officially founded West Tek Defense Corporation in August 2022. We were doing smart rifles for the military.\n\nIt was complicated. (At one point, we were literally balancing redox equations for propellant in the ammo.) The physics background we both had helped a lot; essentially, everything we saw was something we'd encountered in a class or during personal research.\n\nWe spent about three years on the entire process. Ultimately, we found out it wasn't going to work — mostly because of regulation.\n\nWe spoke to the head of the civilian side of procurement for the bid, and we were flat-out told something like: \"There's no reason for us to consider you. We don't even care.\" For us to even find the contact for who was running the bid, it was a bunch of dead links. We had to go pester extremely high officials to get us the appropriate contact.\n\nTo be able to produce firearms in America, you need an FFL. You go through a pretty standard process: apply, background check, reason.\n\nIn Canada, the equivalent of an FFL is a BFL. We weren't able to get a BFL until we had a contract. We had to convince some type of agency, as two kids, to buy an idea. Almost all of them at first would be receptive: \"Sure, can we see this thing?\" We'd have to awkwardly explain to them: \"Well, you have to order them before I can even produce them, because of government regulation.\"\n\nJustifiably, most of them were like, \"Nope.\"\n\nWe took this terrible 3D-printed demo to the law enforcement in Northwest Ontario. It was falling apart. I could tell they pitied us.\n\nIt was regulatory law after regulatory law. After a while, we did finally get our BFL.\n\nIt turns out, if you want to subcontract this — which you will if you're a startup, because the startup doesn't have millions to start some manufacturing project — whoever you subcontract to needs their own BFL.\n\nIt really seemed that it was tailored against any kind of startup or disruptor to come in and break the status quo.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was that a lot of manufacturing businesses are going under here. Every time we'd reach out to a company, they'd either say they don't have the budget to help us, or they would and then would call us back later and say something to the effect of, \"We're going bankrupt.\"\n\nInvestors would say: Until you guys lock in these contracts, this $1 billion government bid, we're not going to touch it. These guys were looking for fourth- or fifth-time founders who already had multi-hundred-million-dollar exits.\n\nOne of our angels, who was the first money in, is on the board of a Big Tech company. He wrote us a $50,000 angel check. We'd pitch investors on that — and Canadian investors wouldn't care.\n\nAmerican investors were interested, but the issue was that they were interested in American defense, not really Canadian defense. They also had a lot of compliance issues with investing in foreign defense.\n\nWe ended up shuttering that. We still have the patents. The tech is still ready to go.\n\nWe got into the University of Waterloo's accelerator and started a new SaaS startup.\n\nThis startup is a Delaware C Corp. American investors — who rightfully want to invest in American companies, because it's what they're familiar with — are far more friendly and open-minded.\n\nMany Canadian investors have very hostile agreement conditions. One investor wanted to do CA$100,00 at a $3-5 million valuation. For reference, we ended up raising our round at $1.6 million at a $10 million post-money capitalization in America. They were offering less than a fraction. It's brutal.\n\nEveryone in our cap table is American, or Canadian expats living in America. None of our investors are actually living in Canada.\n\nWe'd like to move the business to New York. We think it is going to be the next tech hub. Clay CEO Kareem Amin is a McGill grad. He's Canadian. He also lets us co-work in his office in Chelsea.\n\nYC initially deciding not to invest in Canadian corporations is totally justifiable. There are a lot of Canadian founders in YC. What that's telling them is: Canadians aren't even confidant in building Canadian companies. They're all moving to America anyway.\n\nI understand their decision to reverse it. The backlash was coming from a place of political climate and ignorance. A lot of people were seeing it as YC sticking the middle finger to Canada.\n\nEveryone that we know, as well as Canadian YC founders that we know and love, have all said the same thing: This is a stupid debacle.\n\nWe all understand why YC did it.",

    "fullText": "When it comes to the world’s richest billionaires, tech founders litter the top of the list. AI has been heralded as a multitrillion-dollar industry, catapulting many founders to extreme wealth; but now AI bubble fears and doubts over valuations have led to billions erased from CEOs’ net worth overnight. For Larry Ellison, whose net worth has been hardest hit, that looks like a $59.2 billion loss since the year started—and we’re only in February.\n\nAfter months of eyebrow-raising over software stocks and AI’s impact on the sector, a selloff on Tuesday triggered the loss of billions among the wealthiest. In the few days since then, Ellison has watched his wealth slide by $19 billion, according to current data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s fortune has dropped by $14 billion.\n\nThe Tuesday selloff, turbocharged by Anthropic’s new legal AI tool, also sent the already dwindling fortunes of software billionaires to tumble even harder. Following the broad selloff that saw the S&P 500 software and services index fall by nearly 4%, at least $62 billion was wiped from the net worth of the industry’s wealthiest entrepreneurs so far this year, according to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index.\n\nBut the three founders of advertising platform AppLovin saw the biggest relative decline in wealth in the aftermath in the selloff; CEO Adam Foroughi lost 31% of his net worth since the start of the year, around $7.8 billion, while former CTO John Krystynak’s fortune was shaved down 30% after a $2.4 billion blow. Fellow AppLovin cofounder Andrew Karam also emerged from the selloff 29% less rich than at the start of 2026.\n\nDespite building the world’s most valuable company thanks to AI advancements, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also faced a decline; he’s lost $7 billion since the selloff earlier this week, and is down nearly $12 billion this year. And the net worth of Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, has gone through the wringer this week. Relative to his peers, he’s only lost a modest $5 billion after Tuesday—but since the start of 2026, almost $29 billion has been wiped from Ballmer’s name.\n\nTechnology has proved a gold rush, with the industry minting new entrepreneurial millionaires and billionaires yearly. Take a look at the top 10 richest U.S. billionaires, who added a whopping $698 billion to their net worth between 2024 and 2025, according to a 2025 Oxfam report, and the sector’s financial power comes to light.",

    "fullText": "Amjad Masad thinks the modern workplace is broken — and he believes AI can help fix it.\n\nThe Replit founder and CEO says traditional corporate work has become deeply alienating, with employees siloed into narrow roles where ideas die in backlogs.\n\n\"One thing that I found extremely depressing is how atomized and siloed people are,\" Masad recently said on the \"Possible\" podcast with Reid Hoffman. \"People become sort of cogs in the machine. And I don't think that is conducive to the human spirit.\"\n\nAI, he said, is starting to reverse that dynamic by letting people inside big companies build, test, and ship ideas themselves — without waiting for engineering approval.\n\nMasad's bet is that AI agents can automate much of the repetitive, standardized work that dominates corporate life — documentation, internal tools, workflows — freeing employees to think and act more like entrepreneurs.\n\n\"As the boring things, the automated things actually are taken care of by machines, we're left to be more entrepreneurial and more creative,\" he said.\n\nMasad isn't the only tech leader seeing huge potential in deploying AI agents.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said AI agents can already handle work typically done by junior employees, Microsoft's AI platform product lead Asha Sharma has said they could flatten corporate hierarchies, and McKinsey's CEO Bob Sternfels has said the firm is already deploying 25,000 AI agents alongside its human workforce.\n\nOn the \"Possible\" podcast, Masad pointed to one case, where an employee at a big real estate marketplace had an idea to improve how buyers were routed to agents, but couldn't get engineering resources.\n\nIn the past, Masad said, \"the idea is dead,\" but now, the employee built a working routing algorithm himself using Replit, an AI-powered coding platform that lets users build and deploy software without traditional engineering support.\n\n\"He built a new routing algorithm that drove tens of millions of dollars, if not hundred million dollars, to the business,\" Masad said.\n\nThe result wasn't just business impact — the employee was promoted repeatedly and now helps guide the company's AI strategy at the board level, he said.\n\nMasad sees this as a form of entrepreneurship inside a large business where domain experts — not just engineers — can turn insight into execution.\n\nThat shift, he said, restores meaning to work by reconnecting people with the outcomes they create.\n\n\"Humans are fundamentally creative,\" he added.\n\nIf AI succeeds at removing drudgery rather than replacing judgment, Masad believes corporate jobs could become less soul-crushing and far more human.",

This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2012, I sold my first startup, Evi, to Amazon. It later became Alexa.\n\nThat gave me the capital to invest in the next generation of startups when I left Amazon in 2016. I leaned into that opportunity, becoming both a mentor and a very active angel investor.\n\nIt was one of the best experiences I've had for career development, because I saw almost every situation that a startup can encounter, both good and bad.\n\nWhen I left Amazon, I suddenly found myself with an empty calendar.\n\nI wanted to take a break — six months or so — but I still needed to do something with my days. My calendar filled up faster than I expected.\n\nI started saying yes to things I would have turned down while working at Amazon. I was invited to a party in San Francisco, which is a long way to go when you live in the UK, but I went anyway. I booked a hotel for a couple of weeks and let my time fill up with meetings and other activities.\n\nThe year I left Amazon, 2016, turned out to be a really extraordinary time for me, when I traveled a lot and did some very interesting things.\n\nOne of those was being invited to help the Creative Destruction Lab, a seed-stage program for scalable science and technology-based ventures, founded in 2012 by economists at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\n\nThe premise was simple: mentors who successfully launched companies, like me, provided startups with expertise. Every few months, the mentors and startups would meet to set clear objectives for the next stage of development.\n\nIt was a bit like the \"Weakest Link.\" We'd cut companies, sometimes if they'd fallen short of their goals, at each meeting. Over the course of about nine months, the cohort would narrow, and mentor time and resources would be focused on fewer and fewer businesses.\n\nI did this for about six years. I would fly back and forward from London to Toronto every few months, making angel investments in dozens of promising companies, and for another two years when the program moved to the University of Oxford in 2019.\n\nAround the same time, I became involved with Cambridge Angels, an invite-only network of experienced investors, which gave me exposure to a wide range of early-stage companies and investors.\n\nI knew I wanted to be a founder again one day, but waiting turned out to be the right decision. My time as a mentor and angel investor was great preparation.\n\nWhen I founded my second startup, UnlikelyAI, in 2019, the experience was very different from the first time. I still made mistakes and ran into problems, but I was no longer a novice founder with no support.\n\nThis time, I had the capital to fund the business myself for a while. When I later raised a friends-and-family round, it was largely made up of prominent angel investors I'd met through mentoring and angel investing.\n\nAs a second-time founder, not only did I have a decade of experience from my first startup, but I also had something to complement it: the invaluable, vicarious experience of mentoring hundreds of other startups.",

    "description": "\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" said Selkirk Sport co-founder Mike Barnes.",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes started selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement when they were teenagers. It was part of a homeschool project and evolved into a profitable business.\n\nA few years later, they launched a pickleball equipment company at ages 19 and 22. They had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball would ever take off.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down,'\" Rob told Business Insider. \"And we were like, let's double down, see what happens.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, that bet has paid off. Selkirk is now one of the leading pickleball equipment brands, known for its premium paddles, and the family-run company expects to generate nine-figure revenue in 2026.\n\nThe Barnes brothers say that while they skipped traditional higher education, learning has always been central to how they run their business. They've learned from other successful founders and executives by reading a lot of business books.\n\nThey shared six of their top recs.\n\nBoth brothers say they gravitate toward biographies and autobiographies because they show how decisions actually play out in the real world.\n\n\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" Rob said. \"You have people literally talking about how they made a decision and why, and then showing how it played out, good or bad.\"\n\nSome of their favorite autobiographies and memoirs include:\n\nOne business book the brothers said influenced them early on was \"The E-Myth\" by Michael E. Gerber, which dispels myths about starting a business.\n\nThey also recommend \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" which tells the story of RJR Nabisco's fall.\n\n\"It was interesting — more of a warning about how corporate governance can get out of hand,\" they said of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's bestseller.\n\nFinally, one of Mike's favorites is \"The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.\"\n\nThe book profiles eight relatively unknown CEOs who delivered extraordinary results by ignoring convention.\n\n\"They weren't very big on public perception,\" Mike said. \"But they ran their companies really well in unconventional ways. And it worked.\"\n\nThe brothers are very willing to question conventional wisdom.\n\nThey don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business, and said they try to avoid a \"best practices\" mindset.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nRob added, \"No one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does. Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"",

    "description": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is laying off staffers as it looks to cut costs and refocus its coverage.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

    "description": "Rachelle Hruska, the founder of Lingua Franca, released an anti-ICE sweater — and faced backlash.",
    "fullText": "When Rachelle Hruska founded the clothing line Lingua Franca, she had no intention of making it political.\n\nBut the brand has since taken a stance on numerous causes, including, most recently, against ICE.\n\nShe's lost business because of it, though she says it's worth it. Here's why.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rachelle Hruska, the founder of clothing brand Lingua Franca. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started Lingua Franca, it wasn't meant to be a business. I was running another company and took up embroidery to get out of my brain. I was suffering from postpartum, and a therapist suggested I do something with my hands.\n\nI had an old sweater lying around, embroidered \"booya\" on it — my two-year-old son's suggestion — and Instagrammed it. Soon, friends were asking me for sweaters.\n\nThen in 2016, I got a call from Net-a-Porter. It really wanted to launch a line with us. I worked like mad to build a cashmere supply chain and hire embroiderers, and we officially launched in September of that year.\n\nAt first, it was not political at all. We started with phrases related to my muse, my mother-in-law, Janet McPherson, who was a single mom, the oldest woman surfer, and lived on her own terms.\n\nThen, when Trump was elected in 2016, we were devastated. I needed a gift for Anna Carter, Graydon Carter's wife. At the time, Graydon was in a very public argument with Trump. I decided to have \"I miss Barack\" embroidered on the sweater, posted a photo, and it went totally viral.\n\nThen, one of the first things Trump did as president was to block citizens of certain countries, including Iran, from coming into the US. At the time, two of the people stitching for me were Iranian students who couldn't get home because they wouldn't be able to return.\n\nI thought, \"This is so messed up.\" I posted the \"I miss Barack\" sweater and said $100 from every sweater would be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union. I will never forget that weekend. We got so many orders through email and DM. We raised $100,000 for the ACLU in one weekend, and that was the spark. I felt like my life had meaning.\n\nTom Hanks talked about us on TV. Connie Britton wore one of our sweaters to the Golden Globes. We didn't have any PR; we didn't advertise. Every single celebrity was buying it for themselves.\n\nFrom that moment on, we began collaborating with organizations. We opened a store on Bleecker Street in Manhattan and had panelists come in. It's not always anti-Trump. We are intentional and pick and choose who we work with. We've raised money for Planned Parenthood, Margaret Atwood did a book event with us, and we partnered with the Whitney Museum.\n\nRight now, PBS is a big one. I feel really good about sending a big check to PBS every quarter. Could I do that for five different causes in a quarter? No, we wouldn't be in business.\n\nI don't want to be a political brand — we have a whole line of ready-to-wear clothes and collaborated with everything from \"Wicked\" to the Westminster Dog Show. I would love to just design beautiful clothes, but I can't not say anything.\n\nSoon after ICE entered Minneapolis and Renée Good's killing, we posted on Instagram designs for sweaters with the sayings \"melt ICE\" and \"I like my ICE crushed.\" We encouraged our followers to speak out and donated a percentage of the proceeds from the sweaters to Minnesota's Immigrant Rights Action Committee.\n\nLess than a week later, a store emailed us to say it would no longer carry Lingua Franca because of my political views. I didn't even get back to that store — it's just not worth it. I'm not upset about the loss of business, but rather the message behind it.\n\nIt's not the first time the brand has received pushback.\n\nThere are people and stores that don't want to buy us or be associated with us. We've been in talks with big retailers to collaborate, who would have added a lot of money to our bottom line, but they bowed out because we are political.\n\nI've been called woke. The brand has been called performative. We've been accused of making money off a tragedy. I've seen it all. I've been called every name in the book from every side.\n\nI am so beyond caring. I know in my heart that my intention is to make the world better, and we've been consistent about it. It might sound trite, but you can look at our bottom line and see we are doing this because we really want to raise money and start conversations — about how to help and what actions to take.\n\nI think a lot of leaders are afraid to speak out because they're worried about being called woke or performative, but nothing will change unless people say, \"This is wrong.\"\n\nI'm going to continue doing what I've been doing for 10 years, and some people will celebrate it, some won't. That's OK, because I can sleep at night. I have worn my heart on my sleeve — on my chest, literally.\n\nI'm using brands like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's as my models. I'm so frustrated with business leaders who let what's happening happen; people forget how much power they have.",

I decided to have \"I miss Barack\" embroidered on the sweater, posted a photo, and it went totally viral.\n\nThen, one of the first things Trump did as president was to block citizens of certain countries, including Iran, from coming into the US. At the time, two of the people stitching for me were Iranian students who couldn't get home because they wouldn't be able to return.\n\nI thought, \"This is so messed up.\" I posted the \"I miss Barack\" sweater and said $100 from every sweater would be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union. I will never forget that weekend. We got so many orders through email and DM. We raised $100,000 for the ACLU in one weekend, and that was the spark. I felt like my life had meaning.\n\nTom Hanks talked about us on TV. Connie Britton wore one of our sweaters to the Golden Globes. We didn't have any PR; we didn't advertise. Every single celebrity was buying it for themselves.\n\nFrom that moment on, we began collaborating with organizations. We opened a store on Bleecker Street in Manhattan and had panelists come in. It's not always anti-Trump. We are intentional and pick and choose who we work with. We've raised money for Planned Parenthood, Margaret Atwood did a book event with us, and we partnered with the Whitney Museum.\n\nRight now, PBS is a big one. I feel really good about sending a big check to PBS every quarter. Could I do that for five different causes in a quarter? No, we wouldn't be in business.\n\nI don't want to be a political brand — we have a whole line of ready-to-wear clothes and collaborated with everything from \"Wicked\" to the Westminster Dog Show. I would love to just design beautiful clothes, but I can't not say anything.\n\nSoon after ICE entered Minneapolis and Renée Good's killing, we posted on Instagram designs for sweaters with the sayings \"melt ICE\" and \"I like my ICE crushed.\" We encouraged our followers to speak out and donated a percentage of the proceeds from the sweaters to Minnesota's Immigrant Rights Action Committee.\n\nLess than a week later, a store emailed us to say it would no longer carry Lingua Franca because of my political views. I didn't even get back to that store — it's just not worth it. I'm not upset about the loss of business, but rather the message behind it.\n\nIt's not the first time the brand has received pushback.\n\nThere are people and stores that don't want to buy us or be associated with us. We've been in talks with big retailers to collaborate, who would have added a lot of money to our bottom line, but they bowed out because we are political.\n\nI've been called woke. The brand has been called performative. We've been accused of making money off a tragedy. I've seen it all. I've been called every name in the book from every side.\n\nI am so beyond caring. I know in my heart that my intention is to make the world better, and we've been consistent about it. It might sound trite, but you can look at our bottom line and see we are doing this because we really want to raise money and start conversations — about how to help and what actions to take.\n\nI think a lot of leaders are afraid to speak out because they're worried about being called woke or performative, but nothing will change unless people say, \"This is wrong.\"\n\nI'm going to continue doing what I've been doing for 10 years, and some people will celebrate it, some won't. That's OK, because I can sleep at night. I have worn my heart on my sleeve — on my chest, literally.\n\nI'm using brands like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's as my models. I'm so frustrated with business leaders who let what's happening happen; people forget how much power they have.",

    "fullText": "The founder of an auto parts company whose bankruptcy rattled Wall Street and prompted a debate about private credit has been charged with fraud.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors on Thursday charged Patrick James and his brother Edward James in a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that they allege involved years of fake invoices and the double- and even triple-pledging of assets.\n\nPatrick James is the founder and former CEO of auto parts maker First Brands, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Its bankruptcy was followed by the collapse of subprime auto-lender Tricolor Holdings, sparking a broader debate about the health of the credit market that drew in JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nHis brother had been a senior executive at the company.\n\nThe two men were charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy, including money laundering conspiracy. Patrick James faces an additional count, stemming from allegations that he ran a continuing financial crimes enterprise. A third former executive, Peter Andrew Brumbergs, has pleaded guilty in the case.\n\nProsecutors said the men inflated invoices, repeatedly pledged the same assets as collateral for loans, and falsified corporate financial statements in a series of schemes that yielded billions of dollars in financing.\n\nA spokesperson for Patrick James said he denies the charges.\n\n\"He built First Brands from nothing,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"Mr. James looks forward to presenting his case in court.\"\n\nEdward James's lawyer issued a statement blasting his client's arrest in Ohio as \"needless theater.\"\n\n\"We look forward to appearing in New York on his behalf, and we have complete confidence in Mr. James,\" the lawyer, Seth DuCharme, said.\n\nJefferies and UBS are among the financial firms that have acknowledged exposure to First Brands.\n\n\"The James brothers obtained billions for First Brands — and millions for themselves — by presenting their lenders with the impression of a successful, growing international business,\" Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Bill Gates doesn't just see AI as a breakthrough—he sees it as a turning point. For doctors, for teachers, for many of the roles once considered safe from automation. In two recent interviews, the Microsoft co-founder laid out a future where intelligence isn't rare or elite—it's abundant, automated, and free.\n\nAccording to Harvard Magazine, Gates sat down with professor Arthur Brooks at Harvard's Sanders Theatre to discuss his memoir \"Source Code\" last year. But the most headline-worthy moment wasn't about the past. It was Gates' stark prediction about what AI will do next.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nIn the interview, Gates said artificial intelligence will ease shortages in fields like medicine and education by taking over tasks traditionally done by humans.\n\nHe reportedly described a future where machines manage primary-care diagnostics, especially in places lacking medical professionals. In that context, Gates told Brooks, \"the machine will probably be superior to humans—because the breadth of knowledge that you need to make some of these decisions really goes beyond individual human cognition.\"\n\nGates didn't suggest human professionals would vanish overnight. But he made clear that when machines can deliver diagnoses more accurately, more affordably, and more consistently than people—they won't be sidekicks. They'll be replacements.\n\nAnd it's not just about medicine. Harvard Magazine reports that Gates framed the rise of AI as part of the same arc that turned bulky corporate computers into personal tools. Only now, the commodity isn't hardware—it's intelligence itself.\n\n\"What we're doing now [in artificial intelligence] is kind of an extension of the digital revolution,\" he said, \"and all of those things are about free intelligence.\"\n\nTrending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nThat phrase—free intelligence—is central to Gates' view. Once reserved for rare professionals with years of education, high-quality expertise will soon be as accessible as Wi-Fi.\n\nIn education, Gates predicted, AI could reshape the classroom, adapting to each student and even learning how to keep them motivated. In healthcare, it will take pressure off overworked doctors and bring diagnostic tools to parts of the world that never had them.\n\nBut Gates also issued a warning. More access doesn't always mean better outcomes.\n\n\"[Sometimes when] you empower humans, it doesn't always get pushed in the right direction,\" he said, according to Harvard Magazine.\n\nThe very systems designed to educate or heal could just as easily spread misinformation or bias—if deployed without care. Gates acknowledged this isn't just a shift in technology—it's a shift in power.\n\nThat same caution appeared during his appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" last year. Asked about the pace of change, Gates reflected on how computing once felt expensive and exclusive—and now intelligence itself is entering the same phase transition.\n\n\"The era that we're just starting is that intelligence is rare,\" Gates said. \"And with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace… great medical advice, great tutoring.\"\n\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nWhen Fallon asked whether humans would still be needed, Gates didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Not for most things,\" he said.\n\nA few roles might survive—he mentioned baseball and talk shows—but the vast majority of tasks people are trained to do? Machines will do them better, faster, and cheaper.\n\nFor investors, that future isn't just disruptive—it's investable. As AI reshapes industries like education, healthcare, and logistics, some are looking beyond Big Tech and turning to early-stage platforms. Startups focused on diagnostics, learning tools, and productivity automation are drawing serious capital. Platforms like Fundrise offer everyday investors a chance to back emerging AI companies—often with as little as $10.\n\nIt's an exciting future, especially if artificial intelligence really can solve chronic shortages in doctors and educators. But as Gates reminded both Harvard students and late-night audiences, access alone won't guarantee progress. What we do with free intelligence still depends on the people holding the keys.\n\nRead Next: Security and regulation matter in crypto — explore Kraken Pro's compliance-first trading platform.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "fullText": "Founder of the world wide web says commercialisation means the net has been ‘optimised for nastiness’, but collaboration and compassion can prevail\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nWhen Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989, his vision was clear: it would used by everyone, filled with everything and, crucially, it would be free.\n\nToday, the British computer scientist’s creation is regularly used by 5.5 billion people – and bears little resemblance to the democratic force for humanity he intended.\n\nIn Australia to promote his book, This is for Everyone, Berners-Lee is reflecting on what his invention has become – and how he and a community of collaborators can put the power of the web back into the hands of its users.\n\nBerners-Lee describes his excitement in the earliest years of the web as “uncontainable”. Approaching 40 years on, a rebellion is brewing among himself and a community of like-minded activists and developers.\n\n“We can fix the internet … It’s not too late,” he writes, describing his mission as a “battle for the soul of the web”.\n\nBerners-Lee traces the first corruption of the web to the commercialisation of the domain name system, which he believes would have served web users better had it been managed by a nonprofit in the public interest. Instead, he says, in the 1990s the .com space was pounced on by “charlatans”.\n\n“The Americans were very keen about commercialising the internet … crossing the boundary from being an academic thing to being a commercial thing,” he tells Guardian Australia from Brisbane.\n\nThe pursuit of profit soon became a driving force in how the internet was designed. But it wasn’t until 2016 – the same year he won the Turing award – that the US elections showed Berners-Lee just how toxic the web could be. Two years later, he told Vanity Fair that he was “devastated” by the abuses of the web.\n\nFor 35 years, Berners-Lee has written what he considers to be the world’s first blog. One post, published in June 2024, is dominated by a crowded map of “everything on the internet”. It is a reminder of the web’s overall beneficence – from email and Zoom to health, podcasts, collaboration, creativity and digital sovereignty, the diagram shows the web is, for the most part, good.\n\nBut to the left of the diagram is a cluster of red, including X, Snapchat, YouTube, “feed manipulation for engagement”, addiction, polarisation, disinformation and mental illness. This corner of the web, its creator says, has been “optimised for nastiness”. It is extractive and surveillance-heavy.\n\n“It’s only a small part of the whole internet … but the problem is that people spend a lot of time on [social media websites] because they’re addictive,” he says.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nGiven it was always supposed to be human-like in its sprawling connectivity, perhaps its darker sides were inevitable.\n\n“Yes and no,” Berners-Lee says. “There used to be a sort of mantra that technology was neutral and people are good and bad. But actually, that’s not true of things on the web.\n\n“The way you design a website, like Reddit or Pinterest or Snapchat, can be explicitly good.” Or, designed with engagement as a priority, its algorithm can be explicitly bad.\n\nCompounding the problem is monopolisation. Facebook and Google’s dominance is bad for innovation and bad for the web, he says, because monopolies get in the way of building systems that are truly pro-human. How many companies, after all, hold your (identical) data in non-transparent and incompatible systems?\n\nSince Berners-Lee’s disappointment a decade ago, he’s thrown everything at a project that completely shifts the way data is held on the web, known as the Solid (social linked data) protocol. It’s activism that is rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.\n\nThis version of the internet would turbocharge personal sovereignty and give control back to users.\n\n“When people are excited, they get a twinkle in their eye and they start coding just because of what they can imagine,” he says of developers who “get” the concept.\n\nHe likens Solid “pods” to backpacks of data that are securely held by each individual, allowing them to choose what to share with certain people, businesses and organisations. Department of Education data could be shared with an AI tutor; medical data with a cousin, doctor and nutritionist. The Flanders government in Belgium treats data as a national utility and is already using Solid pods for its citizens.\n\nThe Facebooks and Xs of the world need not join in – the new systems will be so empowering, collaborative and compassionate, he believes, that parts of today’s web will become obsolescent.\n\n“The existing systems will fade to a certain extent, because people will get more excited in new systems,” he says.\n\n“Being able to collaborate across the world with friends and family and colleagues will be something that they end up getting addicted to – a much better form of addiction.”\n\nHe’s not the only person wanting to fix these problems. Australia’s world-first social media ban – which blocks under-16s from using a host of sites including Snapchat, X, Facebook and YouTube – is one attempt at a solution. Although Berners-Lee is not convinced.\n\n“I’m interested to see how it goes down in Australia, because there are people in the UK who are proposing it in a similar way, and others may follow on,” he says.\n\n“The first question is whether kids should be using those particular social media sites. I think you have to recognise that things like messaging services are useful.”\n\nInstead, he’s in favour of smartphones that are especially designed for children, blocking access to harmful sites. He points to the Other phone, designed in collaboration with Mumsnet users, as an alternative to devices that allow unfettered access to social media.\n\nIt’s on the subject of artificial intelligence that his optimism plummets.\n\nBerners-Lee has long seen AI – which exists only because of the web and its data – as having the potential to transform society far beyond the boundaries of self-interested companies. But now is the time, he says, to put guardrails in place so that AI remains a force for good – and he’s afraid the chance may pass humankind by.\n\n“The horse is bolting,” he says of reining in AI’s unchecked development and growing intelligence.\n\nBerners-Lee created the web, HTML and HTTP at Cern, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, on the outskirts of Geneva. Cern’s scientific, non-commercial approach was key to the way the technology was shared.\n\n“I would like to see a Cern for AI, where all the top scientists come together and see whether they can make a super intelligence. And, if they can, they contain it into a system where it can’t just go out and persuade people to let it run the world.”\n\nRight now, though, given the division sown in part by that red corner of the web, we are “very, very far from a Cern for AI”, he says.\n\n“We have got AI being done in these huge companies, but also in these huge silos. They’re not looking over each other’s shoulder. They’re just sitting there, inside their own company, looking at their own system, trying to make it smarter.\n\n“I don’t see a way that we can get to a point where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.”\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee will be speaking at the Brisbane Powerhouse on Thursday 29 January and the Sydney Opera House on Friday 30 January",

Khosla has fought for years against public access to Martins Beach, which runs through his $37 million estate, and has filed multiple lawsuits over the issue.\n\nKhosla and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two billionaires have clashed before. In 2024, Khosla declined to endorse President Donald Trump after Musk urged the VC to vote for a Trump-Vance ticket. The VC has also called Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI \"a bit of sour grapes.\"\n\nKhosla's most recent comment on Musk came just hours after he spoke out against the ICE shooting in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration,\" Khosla wrote. \"The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society.\"\n\nThe VC founder was just one of many business and tech leaders who spoke out on social media to denounce the ICE shooting.",

    "fullText": "Florida state Sen.

    "description": "The layoffs have affected staff in North America working at the athleisure giant's",
    "fullText": "Lululemon has laid off 100 part-time employees in its customer service department in an effort to \"strengthen\" the business.\n\nThe layoffs have affected staff in North America working at the company's contact center.\n\nA Lululemon company spokesperson said: \"Over the past several months and as part of our ongoing strategic efforts to strengthen our business, we have been assessing ways to optimize and better support this experience for our guests and employees in North America.\n\n\"After careful consideration, we have made the decision to transition our North America GEC to a full-time employee staffing model. As a result, approximately 100 part-time positions in our GEC have been impacted,\" they said.\n\nThe company has come under pressure in recent months. Its sales in the Americas have slid, and analysts say the brand has veered from its yoga roots and become more generic. Its stock price has sunk 53% in the past year.\n\nIt previously cut around 150 corporate staff last summer.\n\nChip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon, has also become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the athleisure company.\n\nAt the end of last year, he launched a proxy battle to change the leadership of Lululemon's board.\n\nWilson weighed in again last week, when the brand briefly halted online sales of its \"Get Low\" leggings after customers complained they were see-through. Wilson described this as a \"total operational failure,\" and the fault of the company's board.\n\nLululemon's current CEO, Calvin McDonald, will step down at the end of this month. His permanent replacement has yet to be announced.\n\nDo you work for Lululemon and have a tip or story to share? Contact this reporter via email at rshahidi@insider.com.",

    "fullText": "Just weeks after calling out Khabib Nurmagomedov over an NFT project, Conor McGregor has turned his attention to Telegram founder Pavel Durov – but this time it’s all positive.\n\nLast month, McGregor accused Khabib of taking advantage of fans by selling NFTs through Telegram, the app created by Durov. But since then, McGregor has deleted his comments and seems to have made a connection with Durov.\n\nMcGregor had previously called out Khabib for ‘fire-selling’ NFTs on Telegram. But he later deleted his comments and now seems to be getting along well with Durov.\n\nConor McGregor took to X to share his admiration for Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram. McGregor, who has shown increasing political interest in recent years and even hinted at an Irish presidential run, has made free speech one of his main talking points.\n\n“My brother Pavel Durov!” McGregor wrote alongside four photos of the pair together training and enjoying a formal night out. “In a world where governments are tightening their grip on our freedoms, big respect to Pavel Durov, the unbreakable force behind Telegram!\n\n“This man is a true fighter: exiled from Russia for refusing to sell out user data, building an empire on privacy and free speech, and now calling out the EU’s ‘war against privacy’ with their impossible rules that punish innovation.\n\n“He’s warning us we’re running out of time to save the free internet from a dystopian nightmare of surveillance and censorship. Even after his arrest in France and being blocked from speaking at freedom forums, he stands firm, removing harmful content without compromising principles.\n\n“Pavel, you’re a legend and you are inspiring entrepreneurs and rebels everywhere to never back down. You are a dear friend and a loyal brother and I stand alongside you all the way 100%! #PavelDurov #FreeSpeechWarrior #Telegram #Legend.”\n\nDurov replied by saying: “Appreciate the love, brother. You’re an unstoppable force of nature.”\n\nDurov has also spent time training with Khabib Nurmagomedov, who invited him to join his team for a session late last year. Together, they collaborated on a project that introduced ‘digital papakhas’ as symbols on the messaging platform.\n\nKhabib eventually deleted posts related to the sale, but not before McGregor criticised him publicly on social media.\n\n“There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late father’s name, as well as Dagestan’s culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFTs online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving fans robbed of their money,” he wrote.\n\n“What a shame and a stain on his father’s name. Just wow! To scam fans using his father and his country’s culture is just so low… Father’s plan has now become father’s scam. Very sad.”\n\nThe response from Khabib’s side was direct: “You absolute liar. You will always try to darken my name, after you got destroyed that night, but you will never achieve that!\n\n“Yes, good guys don’t do that. They don’t create exclusive digital gifts with real-time value that you can share with your friends and family. Gifts in the shape of Papakha – hat that symbolise traditions and culture of Dagestan people.\n\n“Traditions and culture that slowly walking over this world, whether you like it or not! Gifts that you can find exclusively on Telegram, greatest messaging platform in the world.”\n\nMcGregor didn’t back down from his stance: “Apologise this instant for using your late father’s name to sell these ‘gifts’ that cost your fans so much of their money.\n\n“Also to sell something means it is not a gift you low-IQ troglodyte! That is the direct opposite of what ‘gift’ means. Duh duh duh dumbass hahaha Scamming on your dead daddy’s name. Shame.”",

Don't know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person's life taken unnecessarily,\" Choi added.\n\nThe Khosla founder wrote on X on Monday that he agreed with Choi, adding:\n\nThis comes amid a wave of reactions from business and tech leaders on social media to the shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents.\n\nJeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, described the shooting as \"absolutely shameful\" in a post on X.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, investor and entrepreneur Jason Calacanis blamed the country's political leaders.\n\n\"Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,\" he wrote. \"True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.\"\n\nKeith Rabois has served on the boards of several companies, including Reddit and Yelp.

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO and SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) founder Elon Musk said at this year's World Economic Form (WEF) that humanoid robots will eventually outnumber humans.\n\nRobinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild, Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss Musk's bullish claims on robotics.\n\nCheck out Musk's comments on humanoid robots and Tesla's robotaxi, and watch his full WEF interview.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.\n\nFor my question of the day, I am sticking with the man Elon Musk. I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

Not sure why polymarket made this up.\"\n\nNope. Not sure why polymarket made this up. 🤷‍♂️\n\nIt's not entirely clear where the statement came from. The Polymarket account on X frequently posts aggregated news from around the world, often without citing an original source.\n\nPolymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBezos did recently speak about about the importance of real-world experience in general.\n\nIn an appearance at Italian Tech Week in November, Bezos advised young entrepreneurs to work at a company before starting their own, rather than dropping out of college like other famous founders.\n\n\"It is possible to, you know, be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college, and be a great entrepreneur,\" Bezos said. \"We have famous examples of that working: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etcetera. But these people are the exception.\"\n\n\"I always advise to young people, you know, go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things,\" Bezos continued. \"There's still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it. It increases your odds, in my opinion.\"\n\nBezos also worked his first job at McDonald's while in high school, and he spoke favorably about the experience in comments that appeared in the 2012 book \"Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.\"\n\n\"You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously,\" Bezos said. \"You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's. It's different from what you learn in school. Don't underestimate the value of that!\"\n\nElon Musk even weighed in, replying to Bezos with a reference toward President Donald Trump's famous appearance at a McDonald's during the 2024 presidential campaign, where he worked the fryer and appeared at the drive-thru window.\n\n\"Well, the President worked at McDonald's and now he's the President,\" Musk wrote.",

    "description": "Fisayo Che is the founder of Elisamama, a brand that's sold at Saks. She's finding a path forward as the department store goes through bankruptcy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Fisayo Che, the founder of women's wear brand Elisamama. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Che's statements, including the amount Saks owes, with documentation she provided.\n\nSaks Global filed in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows it to continue operating while undergoing a court-supervised reorganization of its debt. In a statement, Saks said it is committed to \"trusted relationships with brand partners,\" and that funding it secured through the bankruptcy will \"facilitate go-forward payments to brand partners.\"\n\nBecoming a fashion designer was never a part of my vision board. When I founded Elisamama, I was still working a corporate job.\n\nI felt like I wanted to live a life of more meaning and purpose. My family is from Nigeria, and I spent time there growing up. I got the idea to start a brand that supports women artisans in the country.\n\nElisamama is a women's wear and children's brand inspired by African artistry and prints. At first, I sold the clothing at flea markets; later, I listed on Etsy and promoted it on social media.\n\nSaks really gave my business a platform to grow. Now, it's going through bankruptcy and hasn't paid me for some of my inventory. I'm not sure how to trust the company going forward.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, someone found us on Instagram and, unbeknownst to me, dropped our name with a Saks buyer. When the department store initially reached out, I thought it was a scam, and I didn't respond. Then, a vice president from the company DM'd me on Instagram.\n\nI freaked out and was very scared. I thought: How are we going to do this? I even told them I needed time to figure it out because I didn't want to mess up this opportunity.\n\nSaks really walked alongside us, gave us guidance, and helped us dip our toes slowly into its world. It was rapid-fire learning, trying to understand all the vendor requirements, including shipping and routing guidelines.\n\nWe hired more artisans in Nigeria. We beefed up our production. We worked on our supply situation. Everybody was winning; it helped us help other people grow their own businesses.\n\nIn 2023, Saks selected us to join its New Wave program for emerging designers. We came to New York, connected with industry experts and the press, and the company gave us a grant.\n\nAt the end, we had our products placed in the window at Saks' flagship store in New York. That was a remarkable moment for me and my team in Nigeria, who are so proud of this work. It was nothing that I could even have imagined for Elisamama.\n\nThe exposure it gave us was significant and gave us confidence.\n\nWe signed with a showroom and started selling in retailers like Shopbop, Tuckernuck, and several specialty boutiques. Things were ramping up, and the more I did this work, the more joy I found in it. In 2024, I left my corporate job.\n\nSaks has been a great partner to us. It has placed orders with us every season since 2020. It's 50% or 60% of our business.\n\nThe problems started in February of last year, when Saks sent vendors a memo about paying in installments. Prior to that, we were consistently paid on the agreed-upon payment terms.\n\nI thought: We can wait a few months to get paid. They're important partners.\n\nWe got a check for a couple of hundred dollars in July, and in August, we were paid a more substantial amount. I thought we were back on track and kept sending inventory. Then, no other payments came in.\n\nWe fulfilled two additional orders after that, operating on faith that things would shake out properly. The company kept saying it would get back to us with updates.\n\nNow, Saks owes us six figures. I'm considering cutting half of our team to stay viable.\n\nI employ 20 people full time in Nigeria; we have some consultants and contractors, as well. The amount Saks owes us means a lot.\n\nWhen Saks' bankruptcy was announced in January, the ax dropped. Because of the proceedings, Saks said it'd prioritize debts incurred after January 13 and get back to us on other payments owed.\n\nI have been trying to expand my partnerships and sales channels to protect my business, as we've been hearing about Saks' struggles for a long time.\n\nI want to see Saks win, but I don't believe the company anymore. We're sitting on Saks' most recent order, given the situation.\n\nI've told the buyers that any future shipments would have to be paid for before we ship. I'm also considering asking them to send back the inventory they have on hand, so at least we can cut our losses.\n\nSaks is so powerful and significant in the fashion space that partnering with it is valuable. What's happened is a disappointment, but it's also grief and sadness.\n\nSaks needs to restore trust with its suppliers by putting money behind its orders. If it did that, brands would continue to send goods because it's that important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Saks? Email Madeline Berg at mberg@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Lululemon's founder said the athleisure company's recall of its sheer \"Get Low\" leggings was a \"new low\" for the brand.\n\nChip Wilson, Lululemon's founder and former CEO, said in a Wednesday LinkedIn post that the pullback of the leggings was a \"total operational failure,\" and the fault of the company's board.\n\n\"I've believed that Lululemon has lost its cool for some time, but it is now evident to me that the Company has completely lost its way as a leader in technical apparel,\" Wilson said on LinkedIn.\n\nHe slammed the board, calling them inexperienced and shortsighted.\n\n\"It is clear that persistent failures like this are born out of this Board's lack of experience in creative businesses, disinterest in product development and quality, and focus on short-term, self-interested priorities,\" Wilson said.\n\nLululemon said in a statement to Bloomberg on Wednesday that the collection was still available in stores, but its online sales had been temporarily paused because of guest feedback.\n\nThe recall took place less than two years after its \"Breezethrough\" product line was pulled from the market in July 2024, following customer complaints about unflattering seam lines.\n\nAnalysts took note of the \"Get Low\" recall.\n\n\"LULU's withdrawal of a new legging line underscores ongoing execution issues in its core and raises further concerns about the durability of its innovation engine and premium positioning,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nLululemon's stock price is down about 10% over the past five days and has dropped more than 50% over the past year.\n\nHowever, Lululemon had another sheer leggings fiasco more than a decade ago, when Wilson was still on the company's board.\n\nIn 2013, Lululemon recalled 17% of all its pants for being too sheer. At that point, the company blamed the manufacturing error on an incomplete testing protocol.\n\nThis is not the first time Wilson has publicly criticized the brand since he left the company's board in 2015.\n\nHe slammed the company's succession plan after CEO Calvin McDonald, compared its trajectory to a \"plane crash\" and a \"sinking ship.\"\n\nIn December, he launched a proxy fight to shake up the company leadership. As the largest shareholder, he nominated three new board members of his choosing.",

    "description": "Bumble Chief Product Officer Michael Affronti, one of two remaining executives hired before founder Whitney Wolfe Herd returned as CEO, has left.",
    "fullText": "Bumble's chief product officer is out as the result of a recent leadership restructuring within the dating app company, Business Insider confirmed.\n\nMichael Affronti, Bumble's chief product officer and one of two executives who remained after Whitney Wolfe Herd was reinstated as CEO, has left the company after a year in the role.\n\nIn an end-of-year message to staff obtained by Business Insider, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd shared that she and Affronti, who was hired in January 2025, had \"mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader.\"\n\nVivek Sagi, previously the company's chief technology officer, now holds the new title of chief product and technology officer. A source familiar with the matter said that much of Bumble's engineering talent is based in Austin, where Sagi is based.\n\n\"I know this news will land differently across the organization,\" Herd wrote in the December note. \"Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\"\n\nAffronti was one of two remaining executives who worked under Lidiane Jones, who served as Bumble's CEO from January 2024 to March 2025. After Herd, who founded Bumble, announced her return as CEO in 2025, a string of executives left, including the company's CMO, CTO, CLO, and CBO.\n\nDavid Ard, Bumble's chief people officer, is the only C-suiter left at Bumble who was hired before March 2025, when Herd officially took over.\n\nIn her message to staff, Herd described a \"year of meaningful transformation for our company.\"\n\n\"Over the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now,\" Herd wrote. \"What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\"\n\nBumble had a rough 2025. The company's stock has fallen 52.35% in the last year.\n\nIn response to Herd's note, Affronti sent his own note to the company's staff.\n\n\"I have a strong, enduring belief in Bumble's mission and in our ability to return to growth and become a truly massive, category-defining business,\" Affronti wrote. \"I feel incredibly positive about the direction we're heading and the clarity we now have to operate in a way that lets our teams do their best work.\"\n\nBefore joining Bumble, Affronti served as a senior vice president and general manager at Salesforce. Jones, Herd's predecessor, came to Bumble from Salesforce as the former CEO of Slack.\n\nBumble announced Affronti's hiring on January 6, 2025. 11 days later, the company announced Jones' exit and Herd's reemergence as CEO.\n\nAffronti will now be \"cheering loudly from the outside,\" he wrote in his message.\n\nRead Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd's full message to staff:\n\nI want to share that, after thoughtful discussion, Michael and I have mutually agreed that the best path forward for the company is to centralize Product, Engineering, and Design under one leader. As a result, Michael will be departing Bumble today. We are incredibly grateful for the impact he has made during his time here and the care he brought to leading his teams, and we wish him the very best in what comes next.\n\nI know this news will land differently across the organization. For many of you who have partnered closely with Michael, it may feel especially significant; for others, it may feel less immediate. Michael has been a strong leadership presence across Bumble, and I want to thank you all in advance for supporting one another as we move through this transition.\n\nVivek will step in to lead Product alongside Engineering and Design.\n\nOver the past several weeks, and in close partnership with our Board, we've taken a hard, honest look at where our business stands and what our members need from us right now. What's become clear is that we need to sharpen our focus so we can stabilize our core, prioritize our product investments with intention, and set ourselves up for a confident return to growth.\n\nBringing these functions under one leader will provide clarity, tighter alignment, and a singular focus on what matters most: moving faster and delivering against our roadmap with more value to our members.\n\nMany of our cross-functional teams already know Vivek well - he has been deeply involved in our strategic and technical direction. Vivek has successfully led combined Product and Engineering teams at scale during his career and led them to deliver impact, giving us a proven model to build from. He brings a results oriented, steady, thoughtful approach that will continue to support our times through this next phase of work.\n\nIn the coming days, Vivek will connect with leaders across Product to ensure a smooth transition and to provide additional clarity when needed.\n\nThis has been a year of meaningful transformation for our company. Through it all, what continues to differentiate us is our talent: your resilience, your ambition, and your commitment to building products that impact our members in the most meaningful way possible. You've chosen to be here for our mission, every day, and I don't take that for granted. That is why we are building an environment where you can do the most impactful work of your career, and your engagement in this next phase is critical to our success.\n\nWe remain anchored in our three hubs - London, New York, and Austin - and now is the moment for focus. The path forward will require discipline, pace, and a shared commitment to outcomes. Let's channel our energy toward delivering for our members, our business, and each other.\n\nYou will hear more from me on our 2026 strategy during our Global All Hands on Wednesday.\n\nThank you for your partnership, your confidence, and the work ahead.\n\nDo you work at Bumble?

    "description": "Lindsay Kaplan, a former marketing exec and founder of Chief, is joining  consumer VC fund Bullish as a venture partner.",
    "fullText": "Startups don't just need cash to be successful. Like many of us, they also thrive on attention.\n\nLindsay Kaplan, a former marketing executive and cofounder of Chief, a networking company for women, wants to coach startup founders on what it takes to build culture-driving brands.\n\n\"You can have as much money as you want to pour into the algorithm and buy ads,\" Kaplan told Business Insider. \"But if you don't have the right founder who's able to build a community and the attention that you need to build a real product that people want, all of that money … is meaningless.\"\n\nAfter stepping away from her role as chief brand officer at Chief last year, Kaplan is pivoting her career to focus on working with startup founders. She's taking her own lessons as a founder, marketing exec, and investor in startups over to Bullish, a consumer-focused venture capital fund. She's joining the firm as a venture partner, the company exclusively told Business Insider.\n\nBullish has invested in several consumer hits, including Warby Parker, Harry's, Peloton, and Casper, Kaplan's former employer.\n\nBullish invests in early-stage startups, typically from pre-seed to Series A, Kaplan said. The categories she's most interested in span loneliness, dating, parenting, health, and identity and belonging.\n\n\"AI can be a tool to help those problems,\" Kaplan said, but she's acutely aware that not all AI is going to be a hit with real-life people.\n\nWhat does it take to get people to care about your product?\n\nCracking how to \"break through the noise\" helps, Kaplan said.\n\n\"What a consumer cares about is what is in it for them. What do we get out of it?\" Kaplan said. \"Founders are so used to pitching VCs that it's really hard to switch gears and start thinking about: Why should a customer care?\"\n\nWhen it comes to consumer-facing AI startups, brands need to think outside the box.\n\nKaplan said that \"contrarian\" plays can be useful when marketing a startup in a crowded space.\n\nFor instance, while so many tech companies are shouting AI from rooftops, some are strategically letting AI take a back seat.\n\n\"The best brands emerging are using AI, they're not necessarily making their startup fully based in AI,\" Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan pointed to Rocco, a smart fridge brand she angel invested in, as an example.\n\n\"It's a smart fridge, but the brand doesn't lead with 'AI-powered appliance,' it leads with design and functionality,\" Kaplan said. \"The AI makes the product better without becoming its identity, which is how they've managed to generate incredible buzz and traction in one of the most commoditized categories in consumer hardware.\"\n\nMarketing AI has been a tricky battlefield for brands.\n\nLook no further than the Friend AI ads across New York City. The ads promoting the startup's AI companion pendant were defaced by locals.\n\nOther marketing and advertising agencies, such as Day Job, are being tapped by AI companies specifically to help translate their brands to everyday people — in other words, potential customers.\n\nKaplan said startups trying to reach consumers have a unique tool at their disposal: creators.\n\nKaplan said the creator economy \"rewrote who controls distribution\" on social media by shifting who stirs buzz about brands and how people learn about them.\n\n\"Early adopters have really become the creators,\" she said.\n\nWhile startups previously toiled over customer acquisition cost (CAC), Kaplan said the big question now is: \"Who will carry the story out into the world and why will anybody listen?\"\n\n\"Distribution is no longer something you can buy,\" she said. \"You have to earn it.\"",

    "description": "Hedge fund founder George Noble says OpenAI is a warning for the wider AI boom. He says the \"low hanging fruit is gone\" as AI costs increase.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI has laid out some ambitious plans for 2026, but according to George Noble, the ChatGPT maker is a cautionary tale for the wider AI theme.\n\nThe hedge fund investor and former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund doesn't think the AI startup will be able to justify its lofty growth projections, but more than that, he thinks investors should avoid the AI trade and shift their focus to other areas of the market before the tide turns.\n\nThe hedge fund founder laid out his thesis on OpenAI's red flags in a detailed X post on Tuesday, highlighting the \"code red\" moment announced by CEO Sam Altman in December 2025.\n\nIn his view, it all comes down to financials, specifically a math problem that isn't being widely discussed. \n\n\"It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better,\" he said. \"The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.\"\n\nNoble thinks OpenAI's annual revenue has to reach $200 billion by 2030 in order for the company's projections to be justified.\n\nPointing to the broader market, he advised AI startup founders to exit their companies while the boom is still going, adding that he believes the AI hype cycle is nearing its peak. He thinks investors should shift their focus to other parts of the market, as both the AI trade and the Magnificent Seven will be impacted if OpenAI begins to struggle.\n\n\"If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming,\" he advised. \"The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.\"\n\nThe particular sector in this case is small-mid cap stocks, which is where Noble sees real value and growth potential. He added that there is a value disconnect between Big Tech stocks and their small-cap peers, which are trading at near-decade lows.\n\nFor that reason, Noble sees an opportunity for investors to move away from the most crowded stocks that carried the AI trade in 2025 and focus on the lesser-known value plays that have been quietly making progress while AI-linked names continue to dominate the headlines.\n\n\"Markets can price risk,\" he noted. \"But they can't price chaos.\nAnd OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.\"",

    "description": "Would you try a \"no-spend month\"? That's one of the secrets to hitting a seven-figure net worth shared by Michela Allocca, the founder of Break Your Budget.",
    "fullText": "Michela Allocca started posting about personal finance on Instagram in 2019. At the time, it was a creative outlet and side project that didn't make any money.\n\nHer account, Break Your Budget, took off after she expanded to TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, Allocca had more than 200,000 followers and was earning more from content creation than from her day job at an investment consulting firm.\n\nIn April 2022, she went all in on Break Your Budget. Since then, she said she's quadrupled her former corporate income and built a seven-figure net worth, which she credits to diligent saving, disciplined spending, and long-term investing. Business Insider verified her net worth by looking at account screenshots.\n\nHere are two savings strategies that helped her notch her first million.\n\nTracking expenses is the first thing Allocca tells people to do — even before creating a budget.\n\n\"If you don't track your expenses, you're spending more money than you think. I guarantee it,\" she told Business Insider, adding that it's normal to underestimate your spending. \"We're hardwired to protect our self-interest, so you'll subconsciously lie to yourself about how much you're spending if you're not actually writing it down.\"\n\nAllocca built an expense tracker to understand her outflow, but there are various apps that'll record your purchases, such as You Need A Budget or Monarch. The important thing is to select a method you'll stick with.\n\nOnce you get a clear idea of exactly where your money is going, you can figure out where you're overspending and start to cut back.\n\nAllocca prefers setting spending \"boundaries\" rather than strict rules: \"I feel like rules become very rigid and can lead to the pendulum swinging the other way, where people are like, 'Screw this, I don't want to have a budget at all.'\"\n\nInstead, she creates flexible guidelines around what she will and won't spend money on. Sometimes those boundaries are about behavior rather than categories. For example, she avoids shopping on her phone and doesn't keep her credit card near her computer.\n\n\"That creates friction in the buying process,\" she said. If she really wants something, she has to get up, retrieve her card, and make a more intentional decision.\n\nAnother strategy she uses is a \"no-spend month.\" During a recent \"no-buy January,\" Allocca set clear parameters around what she's allowed to spend on and what she's not.\n\n\"I'm not buying any new clothes or new beauty products this month,\" she said. \"But I am letting myself go out to dinner once a week and spend money on my hobbies. I'm starting needlepoint, so I can go out and buy the materials for that.\"\n\nThe idea is that introducing guidelines for defined periods of time can make spending boundaries feel more manageable.\n\nWhen reflecting on the money moves she made in her 20s that helped her reach millionaire status by 30, Allocca said increasing her income was a major factor.\n\n\"The reason I've been able to hit these big numbers is because I increased my income outside my corporate job,\" she said.\n\nWhile side hustles and entrepreneurship aren't for everyone, she said they were the biggest drivers of her financial growth: \"It's not the sexiest thing — not everyone wants a side hustle or to start a business — but that's the big driver.\"\n\nStill, she emphasized that higher earnings only work if lifestyle inflation is kept in check.\n\n\"No matter how much you increase your income, you have to avoid lifestyle creep,\" she said. \"Otherwise, you're not actually going to make progress.\"",

    "fullText": "After months of unexplained fatigue, an xAI cofounder says he's stepping back from the company following a Lyme disease diagnosis.\n\nGreg Yang said in a post on X published Tuesday that he will move into an informal advisory role at Elon Musk's startup xAI immediately so he can \"go founder mode on my health.\"\n\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection typically transmitted by ticks and is known for symptoms that can linger or worsen over time.\n\nYang said his symptoms began after an illness in early 2025, when he noticed lingering fatigue and a drop in energy and creativity weeks after he believed he had recovered.\n\nOver time, the symptoms worsened, with workouts or certain foods leaving him exhausted for days, he said.\n\n\"​​There was a week where I slept 12 hours a day and still couldn't recover,\" he added.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of testing, Yang said his doctor diagnosed him with Lyme disease, a condition that is \"famously hard to diagnose.\"\n\nHe said that he was surprised by the diagnosis, as he did not recall a tick bite.\n\n\"Likely I contracted Lyme a long time ago, but until I pushed myself hard building xAI and weakened my immune system, the symptoms weren't noticeable,\" he added.\n\nDespite the setback, Yang said he felt \"lucky\" to have caught the condition relatively early. He said discovering it now would allow him to \"fix it so I can push myself even harder when I rebound.\"\n\nIn response to Yang's X post, Musk replied that he hoped Yang would \"get well soon.\"\n\n\"Maybe Grok will find a cure!\" Musk added.\n\nYang joined xAI as a cofounder in June 2023, after spending nearly six years as a researcher at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nYang's move comes after two other xAI cofounders, Igor Babuschkin and Christian Szegedy, left the company last year.",

    "description": "Sid Pardeshi, a former Nvidia engineer-turned founder, said Jensen Huang inspired him to launch an AI company, and taught him about leadership.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sid Pardeshi, 32, the co-founder and CTO of a generative AI software platform. He is from India and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI thought I'd stay at Nvidia forever.\n\nThe pay, learning opportunities, and benefits made it a delight to work there. I had no reason to leave.\n\nBut Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, inspired me, and I realized I wanted to be a founder, too.\n\nIn 2022, I made the extremely hard decision to leave Nvidia and pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I resigned months before ChatGPT was released, and I believe that choice cost me double-digit millions worth of unvested company stock.\n\nI co-founded the AI company Blitzy in 2023, which has raised $4.4 million. Working under Huang for over six years taught me valuable lessons that have been instrumental to my success.\n\nI got an internship with Nvidia in India through my university, where I studied electrical and electronics engineering.\n\nWhen I started in January 2016, Nvidia wasn't a FAANG company, the acronym for the most prestigious Big Tech firms of the time: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. But as a gamer, I was familiar with the company's graphics chips, so I was deeply passionate about working there.\n\nAt the end of my six-month internship, I started a full-time position as a junior engineer at Nvidia in Pune. By 2018, I was a senior system software engineer.\n\nI didn't interact with Jensen much, but he would lead quarterly all-hands meetings, which I would attend remotely from India. He spoke about things where he was ahead of his time, like AI and virtual worlds. I was fascinated by him because I shared his love of technology.\n\nOnce, when Jensen visited staff in India, I asked him after an all-hands meeting what to focus on if I wanted to make a meaningful contribution to Nvidia and the tech space at large.\n\nHe suggested choosing one area of expertise and committing to it deeply, rather than spreading myself out across many interests. I took his guidance to heart and went deep into AI as it related to gaming.\n\nAs time passed, my ambitions evolved. I saw a lot of opportunities emerging in AI, and I wanted to become a founder like Jensen.\n\nIn 2022, at age 28, I quit my job and moved to Massachusetts with my wife and children to join an MSc and MBA program at Harvard.\n\nWhile studying, I worked for Nvidia as an intern from May 2023 to April 2024. They offered me a job that could start after I completed my master's, but starting a business was my primary goal.\n\nIn 2023, a classmate at Harvard and I founded Blitzy, which I work on full-time as the CTO. We're working on using AI to significantly automate software development work for enterprises.\n\nAt Nvidia, I noticed that Jensen nurtured and valued talent. When I was an intern in the US, he made time to meet with us. His assistant kept telling him that a very important client was calling him during the meeting. \"Let them wait,\" Jensen said. \"I'm talking to the future of Nvidia.\"\n\nLike Jensen, I want to keep the spark alive among employees, regardless of their rank. Every day, I allocate two hours to listening to team members and helping them solve problems.\n\nJensen would also follow his convictions. For example, he bet on the accelerated computing platform CUDA in the 2000s, when no one saw its true potential. Now, it's the backbone of AI training processes.\n\nSimilarly, when we first pitched to investors that we intended to use AI to build software autonomously, many didn't believe AI was advanced enough yet. But because I've been reading papers in the AI space every week for years, I trusted my convictions and that we could automate coding at Blitzy.\n\nAnother page I'm taking from his book is never ruling out the prospect of going out of business. Jensen was always concerned about the survival of Nvidia, despite it being a trillion-dollar company. I remember once a fellow intern in the US asked Jensen whether he watched movies. He said that even in the theater, he's thinking about Nvidia.\n\nAs Blitzy's CTO, I want to anticipate every challenge ahead of time. I focus on solving important technical problems and delegate everything else. I want to let people with more knowledge about other aspects of the company handle issues in their space.\n\nSimilarly, it's thought that Jensen's signature outfit, the black pants, shirt, and leather jacket, helps him minimize decision fatigue. I do wear different outfits every day, but my wife, who loves fashion, picks them out for me.\n\nAt one point, I wondered if I was being selfish by leaving Nvidia. I had a family, and needed to make the right choice, both for my career and for them.\n\nI moved to the US on a student visa, which meant my wife was my dependent and not allowed to work. She put her career on the line.\n\nYet, my wife, and my mom, encouraged me to pursue my dreams, and it would be too late now if I hadn't done it then. Once ChatGPT came out, everyone was thinking about bringing AI solutions to the market. I'm glad I already had deep knowledge and experience with AI and was ready to take advantage of the moment.\n\nFinancially, quitting Nvidia wasn't a smart decision because, based on my calculations around my compensation package, my unvested stock would be worth double-digit millions because of how the company's value has grown.\n\nI knew AI technology would progress significantly over the next few years, although I couldn't have anticipated ChatGPT coming out so fast in November 2022 — just months after I resigned. I was leaving right on the cusp of a big moment in the industry, before I was able to harvest the returns.\n\nBut I'm glad I quit when I did. If my family has what they need, working on cutting-edge stuff is more important to me than money.\n\nI got to watch as Nvidia grew from a relatively insignificant company to a trillion-dollar business, and I'm applying everything I learned to Blitzy. My mission is for Blitzy to be on the same trajectory as Nvidia, one day becoming a trillion-dollar company.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.",

    "description": "Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio said at Davos that \"capital wars\" could be the result of deficits and trade wars.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio thinks the world could be on the verge of \"capital wars.\"\n\nThe billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder isn't shy about sounding the alarm on economic problems he sees brewing. At this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he says Donald Trump's aggressive policies could spark global financial conflict.\n\nThe president looms large over Davos this year, with his threatening rhetoric related to Greenland, which he says the US must control for security reasons.\n\nWhile Trump's latest comments are in focus, Dalio says they're just another part of a troubling trend that could shift the global financial order. Speaking with CNBC at the event, Dalio said the possibility of capital wars represents a threat with widespread ramifications for markets and the economy.\n\n\"On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio stated. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at US debt and so on.\"\n\nIn his view, trade conflicts such as the one playing out between the US and much of the rest of the world, don't actually resolve global imbalances. They do, however, put strong tensions on capital flows, as countries grapple with who is financing deficits and which nations are willing to hold certain assets. In particular, eroding trust in the US could make global investors less willing to lend to the country by buying Treasurys.\n\n\"We know that both the holders of US dollar-denominated debt…and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other,\" he said. \"If you have other countries who are holding it and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue.\"\n\nIf foreign demand slumps, he says the US may be forced to rely on internal measures to provide the funding it needs. This could lead to higher inflation or currency debasement, two factors that would likely reinforce concerns among foreign investors.\n\nDalio also reiterated his positive view of gold as a reserve asset in the event of capital wars. He said that in normal times, gold should account for between 5% and 15% of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n\"I have been clear for quite a while that I would tilt away from bronze, and I would be tilting toward gold, and have a greater than normal amount of that,\" he said.\n\nIn his 2025 market reflections, though, Dalio said that gold's strong price rally may be a warning for investors and urged caution on what the metal's big rally could mean for the economy in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Worth a staggering $2.45bn, Suno is an AI music company that can create a track with just a few prompts. Why is its CEO happy to see it called ‘the Ozempic of the music industry’?\n\n‘The format of the future,” says Mikey Shulman, “is music you play with, not just play.” As the CEO and co-founder of the generative AI music company Suno, Shulman currently finds himself in the exhilarating if perhaps unenviable position of being simultaneously regarded as the architect of music’s future – and its executioner.\n\nSuno, which was founded just over two years ago, allows users to create entire songs with just a few text prompts. At the moment, you can’t prompt it with the name of a specific pop star, but asking for “stadium-level confessional pop-country” that “references past relationships” or “public rivalries” might get you a Taylor Swift-style song or thereabouts.\n\nIn June 2024, Suno became the target of litigation by record company trade body the RIAA on behalf of major labels in the US, while German collection society GEMA, representing songwriters, filed its own lawsuit the following January. Both claimed the service was training its systems on their copyrights without authorisation or licences.\n\nGen AI music services have triggered an existential crisis in the music industry. The utopian reading is that they will democratise creativity. The dystopian one is that art will be smothered by AI slop, as humans making music become surplus to requirements. (And many musicians already struggle to make a living from streaming revenues.) Dave Stewart of Eurythmics called them an “unstoppable force” and said musicians should, begrudgingly or enthusiastically, embrace them. Catherine Anne Davies, AKA the Anchoress, told me recently she believes it to be “dystopian”. Music lawyer Gregor Pryor has argued it is already killing off background music work.\n\n“I like to think of us as trying to make the next format for recorded music,” says Shulman. “The format of the future will be interactive.” What does he mean? “It should be social, meaning you’re doing it with other people. What we are doing is building the best digital version of that.”\n\nInvestors were clearly not scared off. In November, Suno raised $250m (£187m) in funding, taking its valuation to $2.45bn (£1.83bn). Gen AI is the hottest thing in Silicon Valley, with a Stanford University report saying it drew $34bn (£25bn) in private investment in 2024. But there are fears, notably at the Bank of England, that this brilliant boom can only be followed by a bitter bust. For now, however, investors believe gen AI is too big to fail. The stakes for Suno’s success are astonishingly high, especially given the recent leaking of an investor presentation suggesting the company only had 1 million paying subscribers. The standard monthly plan costs £8.25 ($10).\n\n“The thing that investors needed help realising,” says Shulman, “is how important music is in the world. Once you show them, their minds are changed and they realise that much, much more is possible.”\n\nWhen a new outside technology imposes itself on the music industry, the response typically runs from apoplexy to legal action, then negotiation and ultimately licensing. The three biggest names in gen AI music are at different stages along this trajectory. Klay got deals with all three majors before launching or training its technology on music, making it a rarity in this “Launch first, license later” world. Udio signed deals with Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Music Group (WMG). Suno, however, only has a deal with WMG, and legal action from the other majors is still live.\n\nShulman, now 39, was a hobbyist musician, which provided a catalyst for Suno. “I played in a lot of bands in high school and college,” he says, speaking by video from his home in the US, pointing to the bass hanging on the wall behind him. “I was OK, not great, and I was not going to be able to make a great career out of it.” He’s cautious and thoughtful when speaking, without the tang of arrogance you sometimes get from heavily hyped start-up founders.\n\nA career swerve into a physics PhD led him to Suno’s other co-founders. They wanted to build something different to heavyweight AI companies such as OpenAI, as those deal with “reasoning and automation to solve very specific problems. Music isn’t like that. There’s not a right or a wrong answer. It’s not a problem to solve.”\n\nThere remains debate about where exactly Suno sourced the music to train its systems – essentially breaking music into data strands for cataloguing – before its licensing deals were in place. “We train our models on medium- and high-quality music we can find on the open internet,” wrote Shulman in a 2024 blogpost. Suno’s initial legal defence was that this constituted fair use, and the music it drew on did not require prior permission. The record industry thought differently. “Fair use,” countered the RIAA, does not apply “when the output seeks to ‘substitute’ for the work copied.”\n\nI ask Shulman what he means by the “open internet”. There is a clear distinction between what is copyrighted (recordings are typically protected for 70 years) and what is in the public domain. “Copyright is a different thing,” he says. “I can’t get into too many specifics because there is active legal stuff going on, and also some of it is trade secrets.”\n\nCould Suno’s philosophy of “democratising” music-making be inherently anti-art? What once sprang from extraordinary human creativity now becomes ordinary. Shulman insists that, as with digital recording or sampling, this is just another example of how technology “pushes music forward”, how “new people get discovered” and “new genres get invented”.\n\nThe issue of so-called AI slop is wholly subjective, he says. “I made a really funny song with my four-year-old yesterday morning. That is ‘slop’ to you – you don’t care about it – but I love it. It’s fantastic.” He is keen to stress, meanwhile, that music generated by Suno can be extremely high quality.\n\nAnd AI-powered music is flooding streaming services: Deezer says more than a third of music delivered to it each day is AI (equal to 50,000 tracks), and 70% of streams of AI music on Deezer are fraudulent (scammers get cheaply made AI tracks on to such services, then use bots to manipulate streams at scale in order to get royalty payments, although services are increasingly wise to this). The company has started tagging AI tracks to alert users. Bandcamp recently announced that it won’t platform music “generated wholly or in substantial part by AI”.\n\nShould others follow? Shulman will say only that he doesn’t want to be “the arbiter of what happens on other platforms. There’s maybe some line to draw, but I don’t know where.”\n\nVelvet Sundown, a wholly AI “act”, released their debut album and a follow-up last summer. The 70s-styled rock band generated millions of streams, but it was a short-lived phenomenon. “I don’t know exactly what their strategy was,” Shulman says of Velvet Sundown. “It was all a bit of a goof. I think that’s why it was a flash in the pan.”\n\nSome AI-powered tracks have staying power, though. Following allegations it used Suno to clone Jorja Smith’s voice, I Run, by Haven, was excluded from the UK charts, but a version re-recorded by Kaitlin Aragon, a human singer, was chart-eligible and went Top 10. Into the Blue by Sienna Rose, who is widely suspected to be an AI act, recently made the Top 10 on Spotify’s Viral 50 Global chart. And the track Jag Vet, Du Är Inte Min is one of the biggest of the year so far in Sweden, although it has been booted out of the country’s charts for being “mainly AI-generated”.\n\nMore concerning was Suno being used last year to create tracks that the Anti-Defamation League said glorified Adolf Hitler, deployed racist slurs and talked of “white power”. Shulman says: “It was three songs that had a combined 10 plays. It was a very small thing. Unfortunately, drawing attention to it made it worse.” He says Suno has developed more rigorous safeguards to stop similar things happening in the future.\n\nSuno is keen for its deal with WMG to be seen as proof that gen AI companies can partner in mutually beneficial ways. Did the $1.5bn (£1.1bn) that AI company Anthropic paid to the book industry in September to settle claims its AI was trained on pirated copies spook Suno to get deals done swiftly? “We didn’t pay all that much attention to that,” says Shulman. “There’s a lot more to do together than fighting one another. And we intend, with this Warner partnership, to show that very strongly.”\n\nBut questions do persist about the WMG deal. Did the label insist on changes to the service? Were payments made to cover past use of its music in Suno’s training? Did WMG get equity in Suno? Shulman won’t reply, saying only that it is “a little early” to share such information, possibly fearful of compromising pending licensing deals.\n\nAgreements with the majors are one thing, but wooing artists is another. The majors insist they will only have their music used if they opt into deals. But if only a tiny percentage do – never mind their name, image and likeness rights – this will surely compromise results.\n\nIn his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularised “the 10,000-hour rule”, suggesting that this is the amount of practise time an artist needs to achieve any sort of mastery. Will the likes of Suno change this? “I think people will [still] have to spend 10,000 hours,” says Shulman. “They may be doing different things and practising different skills, but they will certainly need to spend 10,000 hours to make the best music in the world.”\n\nAs part of its charm offensive, Suno signed up US producer Timbaland as a strategic advisor, but he had to make a public apology after he took a track by producer K Fresh without permission and, Fresh alleged, “uploaded it into Suno’s AI platform, and released an unauthorised AI remix”.\n\nNevertheless, Shulman says the musicians he talks to about Suno see it as an important new creative tool and songwriting aid. He had previously told the 20VC podcast: “I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.” This does not mean musicians hate the creative process in toto, but they are appreciative of tools that can remove at least some of the grunt work.\n\nThey just see it as a dirty secret, he suggests now. “When you get people one-on-one, they’re just more comfortable admitting it. It was described to me that we’re the Ozempic of the music industry – everybody is on it and nobody wants to talk about it.”\n\nThe fear, of course, is that by putting music on Ozempic, it wastes away to nothing.",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood is making another bold call on the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nIn a 2026 outlook letter published on Jan. 15, the ARK Invest founder and CEO says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying U.S. economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" she said.\n\nWood said post-Covid high interest rates squeezed the economy, hitting housing, manufacturing, and non-AI investment. But she is optimistic that easing rates and rising productivity could release growth potential.\n\nWood wrote in a post on X (the former Twitter) that the next three years could look like “Reaganomics on steroids,” which she believes could lead to “another golden age” for the U.S. stock market.\n\n\"Early in my career, I remember how deregulation, tax cuts, sound monetary policy, and peace through strength sent the dollar soaring, which put a lid on the gold price,\" she explained.\n\nIn the Reagan era, a mix of those forces helped the market enter a long bull that ran through much of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"The Trump Administration’s policies are echoing the early days of Reaganomics in the 1980s, when the dollar nearly doubled,\" Wood said.\n\nWood focuses on emerging high-tech companies in areas including artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.\n\nShe gained a reputation after the Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. In 2025, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP): 5.29%\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD): 4.06%\n\nBeam Therapeutics (BEAM): 3.79%\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR): 3.57%\n\nWood’s style brings sweet wins in rising markets but also painful losses in bearish ones, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term results. As of Jan. 16, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -10.31%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 14.66% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.",

    "fullText": "A new kind of MAGA hat is gaining popularity online.\n\nSeveral sellers are now offering red hats printed with all-caps white lettering that says \"Make America Go Away.\"\n\nDesigned to parody the trademark headwear of the Make America Great Again political movement, the protest comes as President Donald Trump ramps up threats to seize the territory.\n\nThe founder of one group selling the hats, Victor Schøtt of Greenland Support, told Business Insider the design is more about rejecting Trump's particular style of foreign relations and less about a dislike for America itself.\n\n\"The Donald Trump America needs to stay away — the part that's trying to take over Greenland,\" Schøtt said.\n\nTrump ramped up his campaign for the Danish territory over the weekend with threats of 25% tariffs and a message to Norway's prime minister — a key Nordic and Arctic ally — warning that \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.\"\n\nSchøtt said he launched his site about a month ago, and sales have grown to a few hundred hats per week, with the US taking the largest share.\n\n\"The United States is first with around 50 orders the last couple of days, then we have Denmark with 45, and then we have Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden at around 20 each,\" he said of the MAGA designs.\n\nThe site also sells a design that says \"Nu det NUUK,\" a pun that roughly translates from Danish as \"That's enough\" using the name of Greenland's capital, Nuuk. Both designs were reportedly seen Saturday on the heads of protesters in Nuuk and Copenhagen.\n\nAll profits go to support a Greenlandic children's charity, Schøtt said.\n\nOther riffs on the original MAGA phrasing have also cropped up in the first year of Trump's second term, with hats saying \"Make America Gay Again,\" \"Make NATO Great Again,\" and \"Make America Normal Again\" available from various shops online.",

    "title": "I went from fine dining to owning a fast-casual chain. Here are 4 misconceptions about the restaurant business.",
    "description": "Hady Kfoury, founder of Naya, said working in fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants made him realize some common misconceptions about the business.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Hady Kfoury, the founder of Naya, a fast-casual Lebanese-inspired food chain with more than 40 locations on the East Coast. Naya plans to have 200 locations nationwide by 2030. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI studied hospitality in Switzerland and then came to New York to work under celebrity chefs, Daniel Boulud and François Payard, so I had experience in fine dining. When I decided to open the first Naya in 2008, that was more or less my comfort zone.\n\nA week after we launched, we got an amazing article in the New York Times and then we were packed for lunch and dinner. It definitely helped prevent us from shutting down after a few months.\n\nA couple of years in, we realized the food worked incredibly well in a faster and more accessible format. If you go to a Lebanese restaurant, you have all these mezze in the middle of the table, like a plate with a variety of dips and vegetables, and you're putting scoops on your plate. That's how we eat usually. So that's why I shifted my focus into a fast-casual model.\n\nToday, we have 44 restaurants and we are riding the wave of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine in general. It's definitely become mainstream, which is totally different than almost 20 years ago when I started the business.\n\nAs we scale, I've found there are four major misconceptions about the restaurant business.\n\nA lot of people think fast-casual restaurants are easy. It is not easy. Serving more guests at a faster pace doesn't mean it's a simple effort; it means you should master your systems and consistency at scale, possibly even more rigor than in fine dining.\n\nThe biggest challenge we have is that you're on an assembly line. You're not cooking per order. It's a problem for any restaurant with a service line. How do you plan to rotate food in a certain way, and to cook it a certain amount, so the food remains fresh and not overcooked?\n\nMy R&D doesn't stop. It keeps me up at night thinking about how we can keep improving what we do. And any change you make to improve something, you're rolling it out at 44 restaurants, so you have to be very mindful and careful.\n\nGrowing only works when the business fundamentals — training, supply chain, quality control — are built to handle it repeatedly. Growing without readiness is chaotic.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2020, I grew Naya to seven restaurants without any partners because all I cared about was being profitable and having a great team in place. Growth only works when you have those fundamentals. In 2020, I partnered with a private-equity firm, which was initially scary, but the rules were clear from day one that we would prioritize those fundamentals.\n\nSome people think cutting corners gets you a more profitable bottom line, but that is not the case. Cutting costs often undermines guest trust. You lose the customer trust, and the brands that endure are the ones that deliver authenticity, quality, and transparency every time.\n\nWe're trying to be very affordable, and we fall somewhere in the middle of the category, but I will never drop quality. I recently partnered with Pat LaFrieda, one of the best high-end butchers in the tristate. Even with our vegetables, we try to get deliveries three to four times per week rather than two times where you could get cheaper products.\n\nPeople think that it's all about the food, but people matter so much too. What keeps guests coming back and what keeps your team thriving is a culture of service, training, and retention.\n\nI take extremely good care of my team. Most of our general managers are grown within the company and we have very low staff turnover.\n\nGreat food is really important, but there's a people component to it that you can't avoid.",

    "description": "Tech News News: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims .",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott's ex-wife, Jeff Bezos, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties. While Scott's donations are unrestricted, the network supports organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. Scott has given billions to various causes, impacting diversity programs and higher education. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said, “Nizar’s statements constitute direct incitement of violence against U.S. national security interests by advocating for actions against the men and women who build the F-35 and seeking to imperil the delivery of one of the nation’s most strategic assets.”Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.What the Solidaire Network said about MacKenzie Scott’s donationsIt's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.\"Funding social movements while transforming our own relationship to wealth is clearly the way to go for philanthropy. MacKenzie's generous, no-strings-attached gift honours our bold ambitions for our collective work,” the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support the “movement for a permanent ceasefire and against Islamophobia and antisemitism.” SJP and AMP mainly focus on \"Palestinian freedom\" and firm opposition to Israel.“We need more philanthropic partners to show up during these flashpoints, and we also need their longer-term support to grow and sustain our work beyond this crisis moment. We are only able to do this work because of the multi-year funding we have received through committed partners like Solidaire Network,” Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change. For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at an “opportune time” as the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote, “Generosity and kindness engage the same pleasure centres in the brain as sex, food, and receiving gifts, and they improve our health and long-term happiness as well. The peace-fostering byproducts of one unexpected act of kindness toward a stranger of a different background or beliefs might inspire a beneficial chain reaction that goes on for years.”Sotheby's International Realty said Scott has donated an estimated $14 billion to causes, including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, strengthening functional democracy, and climate action. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Sotheby's list adds that Scott's gifts support nonprofit groups working against racial injustice, advancing gender equality, and backing public health programs.",

    "description": "Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said Meta's VR cuts targeted subsidized game studios that were crowding out developers and distorting the industry.",
    "fullText": "Meta's decision to cut more than a thousand jobs in Reality Labs and wind down parts of its metaverse strategy has reignited fears that the company is quietly backing away from virtual reality.\n\nOculus founder Palmer Luckey says that interpretation is wrong — and misses a deeper problem the cuts may actually solve.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Monday, Luckey said that Meta's Reality Labs layoffs, which The New York Times reported were roughly 10% to 15% of the division's 15,000 employees, do not signal retreat.\n\nMeta still employs the largest VR workforce in the world, he said, dwarfing competitors \"by about an order of magnitude.\"\n\nFrom a numbers perspective, Luckey framed the layoffs as \"six months of normal churn concentrated into 60 days,\" not an existential blow.\n\nThe more consequential shift, he said, lies in where the cuts landed.\n\nAccording to Luckey, most of the eliminated roles were tied to first-party content — Meta-owned studios building internally developed VR games.\n\nThose teams, he said, had become a growing problem for the broader VR ecosystem.\n\n\"Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense,\" Luckey wrote. \"Crowding out the rest of the entire ecosystem, even less so.\"\n\nLuckey said third-party developers — even efficient, well-run studios — struggled to compete against Meta-owned teams backed by budgets that far exceeded what the market could realistically return.\n\nThe irony, he added, was that strong reviews and polished execution only worsened the imbalance by pulling attention and sales away from independent creators.\n\n\"People will point out that these teams did an awesome job and got awesome reviews from critics and customers alike — yes, and fucked up though it is, that makes the problem even worse!\" he wrote.\n\nIn a capital-constrained environment, Luckey said, Meta's resources are better spent on core technology and platform stability than on competing directly with developers it needs to keep VR viable.\n\nHe also framed the move as a return to Oculus's original philosophy. Internally, he said, the company aimed \"to NOT be Nintendo\" — avoiding a closed, first-party-dominated model in favor of building an ecosystem that others could profit from.\n\nLuckey acknowledged the human cost of layoffs and said he felt \"really bad for the people impacted.\"\n\nStill, he said that scaling back first-party content is ultimately \"a good thing for the long-term health of the industry,\" even if it's uncomfortable in the short term.",

    "fullText": "A website dedicated to leaking personal information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents was reportedly subject to a cyberattack that its founder believes may have originated in Russia.\n\nDominick Skinner, a Netherlands-based immigration activist, told The Daily Beast that his website, ICE List, came under cyberattack Tuesday evening after the publication reported Skinner planned to release personal information, obtained through a whistleblower, about thousands of employees.\n\nThe attack, known as a Direct Denial of Service, is when a perpetrator seeks to disrupt access to a network or service by flooding it with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload the system.\n\nSkinner told The Daily Beast that a massive number of IPs began accessing the website, and a large amount of the traffic appeared to come from Russia – leading the founder to speculate the attack originated there.\n\n“The IPs would be run through proxies before hitting our servers, meaning it’s just impossible to track the source,” Skinner told the publication. “An attack lasting this long is sophisticated, though.”\n\nThe attack, Skinner said, occurred as he prepared to publicly identify the names of immigration law enforcement officers that were obtained in a dataset from the whistleblower.\n\nThe ICE List founder had previously told The Daily Beast that a Department of Homeland Security whistleblower provided a dataset of approximately 4,500 immigration personnel after the shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nSome of the information in the dataset included names, email addresses, phone numbers, job titles, and other background information. Skinner said he planned to make a “majority” of the names public but would provide exceptions for those working in childcare or serving as nurses.\n\nDHS has criticized Skinner’s website calling it “disgusting doxxing of our officers” that puts “their lives and their families in serious danger.”\n\nHomeland Security Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has said law enforcement are facing a 1,300 percent increase in assaults and an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against them.\n\n“Their families are being threatened. We will not back down. Anyone who doxxes our officers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” McLaughlin has warned.\n\nICE List is hosted in the Netherlands, so it cannot be taken down by the U.S. government.\n\nSkinner said whoever is attacking the website “doesn’t want others to access the site.”\n\n“But it just makes us more determined, because it is clear some people out there do not want the names of ICE and Border Patrol agents made public,” Skinner told The Daily Beast. “Given their behavior lately, and how they are increasingly viewed negatively by the public, that’s no surprise.”\n\nThe ICE List founder said he and his team have Direct Denial of Service protections in place, but that attacks of this kind are difficult to prevent and likely to happen again.",

    "fullText": "The most intimate relationship of an entrepreneur's life may not be with a spouse or a best friend, but with their cofounder. When it works, a thunderbolt idea can become a unicorn. When it doesn't, conflict can sink the ship just as quickly as it took off.\n\nThough confounder conflict isn't particularly new to Silicon Valley, the pressure to launch a successful AI startup, especially among young founders in San Francisco, is only mounting. The pace of dealmaking and technological advancements makes it all the more important to address internal fractures.\n\nAnd it's a new year, and that's always cause for some well-meaning reflection — and perhaps an influx of founders interested in couples, err, cofounder therapy.\n\nYariv Ganor, a therapist based in Israel, has been counseling startup founders for the past six years. Ganor, who is trained as both a clinical and industrial psychologist, knows a thing or two about startup life. He used to work in marketing at various Israeli startups.\n\nSome research suggests that Ganor is onto something. Nearly seven in ten founders in a 2025 study said that their \"always on\" mentality was foundational to their success, while over 70% of participants in a 2018 study on psychiatric conditions among entrepreneurs reported experiencing higher rates of depression, ADHD, and other mental health conditions compared to non-entrepreneurs.\n\nGanor sees the consequences of that strain play out in real time, especially as startups scale, funding multiples, expectations mount, and stress compounds. After years of working with founders, Ganor told Business Insider his three pieces of advice he repeatedly gives cofounders:\n\nFor many founders, the line between who they are and what they do blurs fast, Ganor said. \"Being a founder is a question of identity: It's a personal identity, not just a job,\" he added. \"Sometimes they get so wrapped up in their titles that they forget parts of themselves.\"\n\nWhen work life crowds out everything else — personal relationships, hobbies, and more — Ganor said it becomes difficult for founders to maintain a sense of self outside the company.\n\nFounders are, Ganor thinks, trained to problem solve, execute, and optimize, often at the expense of reflection, which may have downstream effects on leadership, decision-making, and cofounder relationships.\n\nThat's why a core part of Ganor's work is helping founders create diffusion between work and play. Ganor requires that founders take their meetings with him outside of the office and offers them tools for compartmentalizing their career and personal stressors.\n\nFounders ride or die by their runway, or how much cash they have left in the bank. What they don't track nearly as closely as they should, Ganor said, is their own capacity to keep going.\n\nIn his experience, many founders believe they have unlimited mental stamina and can always push through those \"996\" work weeks, a demanding schedule — and an ascendant trend in Silicon Valley — that encourages founders and employees to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\n\nInstead, Ganor wants founders to think about their mental health in the same way they think about their financial stakes in their companies: \"Don't dilute your mental equity,\" he said. \"You need to be very knowledgeable of your mental runway — once the startup starts, your runway gets shorter and shorter.\"\n\nPreserving that runway, Ganor thinks, starts with recognizing your responsibilities — to team members, clients, investors, and others — and how quickly they might multiply as the startup scales.\n\nIt's no secret that few founder stories end in rollicking success. Ganor implores his clients to never frame the pivots or even closures as failures.\n\nSometimes, he said, success can even look like preventing an unideal ending from becoming worse, adding that he once helped cofounders who were unwinding their startup finalize their business dealings with minimal conflict.\n\nGanor is currently studying the relationship between founders and investors, especially how they both think about company pivots. One of his findings: Most rejection isn't personal.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) called out his Republican colleagues during a House subcommittee hearing on the Capitol pipe bomber case on Wednesday for reserving a seat in the room for the head of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States.\n\nMoskowitz used some of his time to rib his GOP colleagues for denying the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol was a violent “insurrection” while pointing out Rhodes.\n\n“By the way, the head of the Oath Keepers is here with us in the audience. Stewart Rhodes is here today. It’s not every day, of course—not every day, of course—you get to meet someone who was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States. Hasn’t happened in 30 years,” Moskowitz said, adding:\n\nOf course, sitting in the front row in the reserved section, which is controlled by my colleagues across the aisle. Not sure why he’s here. I don’t know if he’s here to tell us about the Oath Keepers’ secret handshake or what treehouse they meet in or whether girls are allowed in. I’ve always wondered that about the Oath Keepers.\n\nBut yeah, he’s here. I mean, I don’t know—do you have any questions, my colleagues across the aisle, for the head of the Oath Keepers that’s sitting in the reserved section of this hearing? I mean, he wasn’t pardoned; he’s still convicted of seditious conspiracy. Something you guys say didn’t happen, right? There wasn’t an insurrection. I don’t know how you get convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nRhodes was convicted by a jury and sentenced to 18 years in prison for his actions surrounding the Jan. 6 attack, but his sentence was later commuted by President Donald Trump, and he was released from prison. Rhodes was initially restricted from being in DC or inside the U.S. Capitol, a restriction that was also later lifted. Rhodes relaunched the Oath Keepers militia in November of 2025.\n\nThe post House Democrat Calls Out GOP Colleagues for Giving the Founder of the Oath Keepers a Reserved Seat at Hearing first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Some successful entrepreneurs sitting atop billion-dollar businesses say they may look rich on paper, but take a peek into their bank accounts, and they’re actually cash poor. Social media mogul Jimmy Donaldson, known to his 460 million YouTube followers as MrBeast, claims he’s just as broke as everyone else despite running a $5 billion entertainment empire.\n\n“I’m borrowing money. That’s how little money I have,” Donaldson told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning.”\n\nThe 27-year-old entrepreneur has said that he keeps less than $1 million for himself, despite being a billionaire and owning more than half of his $5 billion company Beast Industries. Aside from his nine-figure Amazon deal and popular YouTube channel with 107 billion lifetime views, Donaldson hit the ultra-rich club—at least on paper—from a slew of successful businesses. He’s launched ventures including multimillion-dollar chocolate brand Feastables; Lunchly, a Lunchables-esque packaged food product; MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant that only allows for pickup and drop-off; and production company MrBeast LLC, which helps manufacture his viral videos.\n\nThrough his assets, Donaldson is projected to be worth at least $2.6 billion—although he emphasized it’s not a fat wad of cash burning a hole in his pocket. Forbes has also estimated that his annual earnings reached $85 million between April 2024 and April 2025, a far cry from the typical American salary of $62,088 a year. However, that doesn’t mean he’s splurging on luxuries and only flying private. Donaldson claimed he’s actually in the red.\n\n“It’s funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,” Donaldson explained. “They’re like, ‘You’re a billionaire!’ I’m like, ‘That’s net worth.’ I have negative money right now.”\n\n“I wake up, I just work…I’m just so busy working I don’t really think about my personal bank account,” Donaldson continued. “I’m just laser-focused on making the greatest videos as possible, and building the business as big as possible.”\n\nDonaldson rakes in eight-figure earnings and runs a $5 billion business, yet still claims to be broke. So where is all of his money going? Right back into his business ventures, the YouTube star says.\n\n“I personally have very little money because I reinvest everything (I think this year we’ll spend around a quarter of a billion on content). Ironically I’m actually borrowing $ from my mom to pay for my upcoming wedding,” Donaldson wrote on X in response to a post heralding him as the only billionaire under 30 who didn’t inherit their wealth.",

    "description": "Walmart's entry into groceries, and supermarkets' reaction, sent some shoppers to Whole Foods, co-founder John Mackey said.",
    "fullText": "Early in its history, Whole Foods got some indirect help from an unlikely \n\nJohn Mackey, who cofounded Whole Foods in 1980, told podcast host David Senra in an episode released last week that Walmart's move into groceries in the late '80s helped the grocery chain find a wider audience.\n\nIn its early years, Whole Foods served a niche market of health-conscious shoppers. Its clientele was mostly \"a bunch of hippies selling food to other hippies,\" Mackey said, describing one venture capitalist's summation of the store.\n\nIn 1988, however, Walmart made a move that would send ripples through the US grocery industry: It opened its first Supercenter, which sold both the general merchandise that Walmart was known for at the time, as well as groceries, a category that put it in competition with traditional supermarkets for the first time.\n\nWalmart's focus on low prices sent many grocery chains scrambling to cut their own prices — and shed costs accordingly, Mackey told Senra during the episode.\n\nThe cuts came in multiple areas, he said. He saw grocers reduce spending on stores, making them resemble warehouses and illuminating them with harsh lighting. Many also \"cut their labor to the bone,\" which meant that customer service got worse, he said.\n\n\"All they wanted to do was figure out how to compete with Walmart,\" Mackey said.\n\nWhole Foods used a different strategy, he said. The chain played up its selection of health-focused products and customer service as an advantage, even if its prices weren't as low as Walmart. Whole Foods employees at the time would take customers' purchases to their cars, for example, he said.\n\nAll that helped the grocery chain appeal to upper-middle-class shoppers, especially women, who were looking for a better shopping experience than what they were increasingly finding at America's cost-conscious supermarkets, Mackey said.\n\nIt didn't matter that many of Whole Foods' products were foreign to these high-income shoppers or that many Whole Foods employees had tattoos or piercings, Mackey said.\n\n\"They wanted to come into a store that was pretty, that was beautiful, with people that gave them good service,\" he said.\n\nAttracting those shoppers allowed Whole Foods to grow its sales, Mackey said. \"We were not just in our own little Hippieville any longer, \" he said.\n\nOver the next couple of decades, Whole Foods opened new stores outside its home state of Texas and became a national grocery chain, largely ignored by many of its rivals, Mackey said. And while the chain earned the nickname \"Whole Paycheck\" for its high prices, it also became known for the affluent, liberal-leaning customers who frequented its stores.\n\n\"Walmart was this giant distraction, and we were running down the field wide open for the touchdown pass,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017, Amazon acquired the chain and has since cut prices on many items at Whole Foods as well as brought its Prime subscribers, many of whom are also middle-class shoppers willing to spend a little more on food, into the stores. Mackey, who served as CEO of Whole Foods from its founding, left the company in 2022.\n\nWhile Whole Foods found its niche in the grocery industry, it still remains a relatively small player in terms of market share. The chain commanded just under 2% of sales in March 2025, according to research firm Numerator. Walmart, meanwhile, took over one-fifth of sales in the US.",

This season, they expanded to 8 teams with the addition of Breeze and Hive, but eliminated the back-to-backs as well. Instead, they are now playing 4 nights a week to accommodate the new teams. It’s a decision Stewart thinks plays a vital role in player welfare.\n\n“Just the ability to know that you’re able to compete, give your all, and you have a day in between your next game is incredibly important because back-to-backs are tough, and we have more than one of them throughout the season,” She said. “It wears on your body, and here we’re able to have a good flow just from a week standpoint, where you get your work in individually, get your work in as a team, and then you go play.”\n\nBack-to-back games have been a contentious point in basketball for years now. That is not limited to the WNBA, NBA, or even the international leagues, where the players have to endure tough schedules. If these players had to go outside the US, as they used to before Unrivaled, they would face the wrath of back-to-back games. On returning, they would be thrown in the condensed WNBA, which already had an adverse impact last year.\n\nWhen the WNBA upped the schedule to 44 games, it kept the season length the same as earlier. That naturally increased the density of games. To make matters worse, the scheduling was disoriented. Some teams played 2 or 3 back-to-backs, but the Seattle Storm did not play any. The more sticking point, however, most teams like the Chicago Sky, Storm, Mercury, and others played 20+ games with just a day of rest. Keep in mind, these are 5 v 5 games at arguably higher intensity than Unrivaled. It led to a season record of 252 injuries, up from 204 in 2024 (per the IX).\n\nThere were notable injuries in the 2025 Unrivaled as well. For example, Betnijah Laney-Hamilton had a knee injury she sustained as a relief player in Unrivaled and missed the majority of the WNBA season. Removing back-to-backs is an important step in solving that problem. NBA studies suggest that playing back-to-backs can increase injury probability.\n\nThe urgent nature of the decision also indicates that the league is committed to working to give the best environment for the players. Breanna Stewart and Co. are trying to do the same with the upcoming CBA. However, they could be making it worse before making it better.\n\nThe 2026 WNBA season is now in serious danger of being delayed. The deadline of January 9 passed without any extension as both sides entered a status quo. “We’re just going to continue to negotiate in good faith,” Breanna Stewart said. Now, the free agency has been frozen by a moratorium agreement.\n\n“The moratorium will apply specifically to free agency, sources told FOS, including the sending out of qualifying offers, core designations, signings, and all negotiations,” Annie Costabile wrote. “An email was sent to front office executives on Monday evening explaining the terms of the moratorium, league sources told FOS. The free-agency pause will end once a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified.”\n\nFree agency extension is effective until they agree to a new CBA. Based on the current signs, that will likely take some time. Even after the CBA is agreed upon, this is not a normal free agency. Most of the league (around 80%) is currently without a team in anticipation of the new ‘transformational’ CBA.\n\nThere will be a record number of deals signed and immense movement in the market. Everything of which will take some time. So, the league can’t assign a very limited period to get it over with. Then the WNBA has the 2025 Rookie draft and the expansion draft with two teams to complete. There could be a delay in starting the 2026 WNBA season, which would normally begin in mid-May.\n\nYou can’t extend beyond November because of the NBA and the rest of the American Sports seasons beginning. Many WNBA teams share facilities with them, and the league risks losing broadcasting slots as well. All in all, the league has an astronomical task to plan a normal regular season.\n\nThe post Co-Founder Breanna Stewart Pinpoints Key Unrivaled Advantage Players Rarely Get Elsewhere appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Sergey Brin is joining his Google co-founder, Larry Page, in reducing ties to the state where they built their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "For nearly three decades, Google has been steeped in the lore of Silicon Valley.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford University graduate students, created the search engine in 1998 and built the start-up out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, Calif. Over time, Google became a nearly $4 trillion juggernaut, helping to cement the Northern California region as the global epicenter of the internet industry.\n\nNow, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page are cutting some ties with the state where they made their fortunes.\n\nIn the 10 days before Christmas, an entity connected to Mr. Brin, 52, terminated or moved 15 California limited liability companies that oversee some of his business interests and investments out of the state, according to documents seen by The New York Times. Seven of the companies — including those that appear to manage one of Mr. Brin’s superyachts and his interest in a private air terminal at San Jose’s international airport — were converted into Nevada entities.\n\nMr. Brin is joining Mr. Page, 52, in reducing his California presence. More than 45 California limited liability companies associated with Mr. Page filed documents last month to either become inactive or move out of the state, according to state records. A trust with ties to Mr. Page also purchased a $71.9 million mansion in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood this week, according to a deed seen by The Times.\n\nAnother entity jointly managed by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page moved out of California and to Nevada on Christmas Eve, according to a filing seen by The Times.\n\nThe Google founders’ shrinking connections to California underscore the impact of a potential ballot measure that would affect the state’s wealthiest residents. Proposed by a health care union, the measure calls for Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax that would be equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. If the measure gains enough signatures to reach the state ballot in November and wins approval, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of Jan. 1 and they would have five years to pay it.\n\nThe potential wealth tax has already caused some California billionaires to establish more ties outside the state. Last month, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment firm in Miami. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBut the actions of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page stand out because of their wealth — their combined net worths total more than $518 billion, as estimated by Forbes — and how closely identified they are with California. While both stepped down from day-to-day management of Google and its parent, Alphabet, in 2019, they remain on the board of the company and Mr. Brin has recently become more active in Google’s A.I. efforts.\n\nMr. Brin and Mr. Page still have connections to California, including homes across the state. It’s unclear how much time they will be spending in the state this year.\n\nA representative for Mr. Brin declined to comment. Google and representatives for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Mr. Page’s Miami home purchase and Business Insider reported on some details of the shifting of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin’s companies.\n\nThe ballot initiative, which was proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system, has elicited a broad spectrum of reactions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has called the measure bad policy, arguing that it will lead billionaires to simply move to tax-friendlier states. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has defended the initiative, drawing criticism from tech investors and entrepreneurs who are discussing funding a challenger to his seat.\n\nOthers have said the proposed tax could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of California, which could then stifle innovation. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a Silicon Valley resident, said the measure was a “horrendous idea” that might force founders and executives to sell shares in companies that they run simply to fulfill the tax obligation.\n\n“Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,” Mr. Hoffman posted on social media on Wednesday. Mr. Hoffman’s spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.\n\nJensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of California’s wealthiest men, was among the few billionaires who publicly said they accepted the wealth tax. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, adding that he was “perfectly fine” with it.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement, Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff at Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, said an exodus of billionaires from California was overblown.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of billionaires have chosen to stay in California past the Jan. 1 deadline,” she said. “Only a very small percentage left before the deadline, despite weeks of Chicken Little talking points claiming a modest tax would trigger a mass departure.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Georgia Gee contributed research.",

    "description": "Sam Bail, the founder of Bright Nights Social, told Business Insider that demand is booming for her alcohol-free nightlife events in New York.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "on January 9, 2026 at 9:45AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nHytale is a sandbox-meets-RPG that has seen its fair share of development woes. Formed by Hypixel developers, who run one of the most successful Minecraft servers of all time, Hytale formerly had funding from Riot Games who then went on to purchase the studio outright in 2020. Riot canceled Hytale in June 2025, but its original founder repurchased the game in mid November 2025 and recommenced development. Now, the game is entering early access in what the Hypixel team admits will be laced with \"bugs, rough edges, and unbalanced content.\"\n\nAs part of Hypixel's dedication to its potential playerbase, it allowed modders to get their hands on the game ahead of release to identify, plan, and develop the best mods possible. From increased luck during mining, custom plots, new items, and intriguing game modes, here are the best Hypixel mods to use from launch. Hypixel has confirmed that it has partnered with Curseforge to host mods, and this should lead to a pretty seamless installation process thanks to the Curseforge launcher.\n\nAnyone who's played Minecraft's player-created custom modes will be familiar with Skyblock. You're placed on an amount of terrain high in the sky, with limited resources. It's your job to expand your Skyblock, increase your well of resources, and proceed through the game. While Hypixel's storyline will differ from Minecraft's, obviously, transferring the Skyblock concept seems to be one of the more obvious mods you should try out. It's created by Cinder Stone Studios, and will be available via Curseforge at launch.\n\nMrbysco and their partner ShyNieke have been working on the Gone Fishing mod, which pretty much does what it says on the tin. While fishing is a vanilla inclusion in Minecraft, Hytale doesn't feature the mechanic at launch. By installing the mod you can spend all day fishing in Hytale if that's your dream, and from a short clip posted to Mrbysco's X page, we know that the user interface in the lower left corner will even identify the type of fish you've caught.\n\nThe Simply Trash mod by Jaredlll08 adds a trash can to quickly get rid of unwanted items. If you've ever found yourself with a full inventory of items you don't care about in Minecraft, you've probably created a lava bin to burn them--but this can be timely and frustrating. Jared's trash can seems to remove that problem, making inventory management even easier.\n\nWhen building a structure, village, or even just decorating some paths, switching between various blocks to add texture and interesting patterns is a necessity in vanilla Hytale. With the AutoHammer mod from tr7zw, select from variants of the same block type and AutoHammer will randomize which one is placed down.\n\nThis is technically a group of mods from one creator, but Sketch Macaw's mods are infamous in the Minecraft community, with hundreds of millions of installations. Macaw adds various paintings, paths, bridges, windows, lighting options, and more. Their paintings mod means you can easily switch between which paintings appear on the canvases you place, while their multiple furniture mods make customization more varied than you can imagine. We'd argue the bundle of Macaw's Mods are almost essential to install for your Hytale world. Check out Macaw's showcase to see the mods in action. They've even developed NEP - Not Enough Poops. We're in the dark about why poop is so important in Hytale, but it's good to see Macaw thinks we'll need even more.\n\nIf you're anything like me, inventory management is an ongoing struggle in most sandbox and survival games. I start off with the best of intentions, manually organizing my loot into easy-to-find locations. If I'm feeling particularly organized, they might even be in alphabetical order. Before long though, I've been on so many adventures and acquired so much random loot that my system goes out of the window completely. That's why Buuz135's WhereThisAt? mod will be one of the first that I install for Hytale. Search nearby inventories using the Inventory Lectern to find the item, and even pull it into your inventory.\n\nImmersive Melodies is another mod that's popular in Minecraft, which creator Conczin has managed to port over to Hytale. A bundle of 25 songs is playable on seven instruments, or you can upload your own melodies. It works in multiplayer, meaning you can form a band with your friends or just annoy them as you chase them around your base yelling Blink-182's All The Small Things in their headsets. Hours of fun ... for you, probably not for them.\n\nAnother mod from Buuz135 is Lucky Mining. It gives a small chance for ores to spread to adjacent blocks while mining. You'll know whether this has happened by a helpful particle effect and accompanying sound effect. It's a simple mod, but in those early stages where resources are limited and you're trying to progress, it can prove invaluable.\n\nA simple UI and quality-of-life improvement mod, the Better Modlist is another contribution from Buuz135. This modlist combines mods and packs and shows information about them in-game. It's a handy way to see everything you've got installed at once, as well as their effects.\n\nIf you're out on a long expedition to get materials, the last thing you want to do is run around the world chasing down the drops. In Jaredlll08's Item Magnet mod, anything you chop down, mine, or drop will be automatically magnetized to you and added to your inventory. It might feel simple, but it'll shave valuable time off your resource-gathering missions.",

    "description": "A virtually blank resume may spook employers, but job candidates don’t need a lengthy work career to land a gig—after all, one of Steven Bartlett’s best hires only had two lines on her CV.",
    "fullText": "Job-seekers may believe that an Ivy League degree or Fortune 500 work experience will land them a gig—but who they thank while walking into an interview could be more important than their educational pedigree.\n\nSteven Bartlett, the founder and host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, took a chance on an applicant with a virtually blank CV for that very reason.\n\n“I hired someone who’s CV was two lines. Their experience was zero,” Bartlett explained in a recent LinkedIn post. “Much of the reason why I gave her the job was because: She thanked the security guard by name on the way into the building.”\n\nShe continued to prove herself during the hiring process in seemingly small ways too—and those acts of humility got her the job, not her credentials.\n\n“When she didn’t know something, in the interview she said ‘I don’t know that yet, but here’s how I’d figure it out,’” Bartlett explained. “After the interview she went and self-taught herself the answer she didn’t know, and emailed it to me within hours.”\n\nThe founder took a chance on the experience-less candidate, and it didn’t take long to pay off; Bartlett said that six months later, she has proved herself as one of the best hires he’s ever made. “Fifteen years of hiring has taught me that culture fit and character is MUCH harder to hire than experience, skills or education.”\n\nBartlett’s hiring philosophy is music to the ears of entry-level Gen Zers kickstarting their careers without full-time work on their resumes.\n\nIt has long been the rule of thumb that the candidate with the best degree, most work experience, and impressive credentials will come out of job interview rounds victorious. But with years of successful and failed hires under their belt, bosses are bucking the status quo and chasing talent with human skills, work ethic, and integrity.\n\nDavid Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, isn’t drawn to candidates with the highest IQ. Instead, he said he’s in the “camp of smart enough” when hiring talent at the $282 billion company; in lieu of focusing on educational pedigree, he gravitates towards applicants who are in touch with “human elements” including the ability to connect, be resilient, and determined. Experience is also “hugely underrated” and a “big differentiator for the firm,” Solomon noted. Attending Harvard University or being the brightest in the room may be impressive, but it won’t get job candidates far at the banking titan.\n\n“You have to be smart enough, but the smartest person in the world without a whole package of other things [is] not going to navigate Goldman Sachs well, not going to be successful in Goldman Sachs over the long run,” Solomon revealed on Sequoia Capital’s Long Strange Trip podcast last year. “You can’t teach experience.”\n\nAnd Danny Meyer, the founder of global fast-casual chain Shake Shack, couldn’t agree more. To run the company’s 510 restaurant locations like a well-oiled machine, he needs talent to have a high “hospitality quotient” (HQ) over IQ. And he’s searching for six green flags in Shake Shack talent: integrity, optimism, intellectual curiosity, work ethic, empathy, and self-awareness.\n\n“I really don’t give a damn what your IQ is,” Meyer told Fortune’s Jason Del Rey at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last year. “What an IQ basically says is one’s aptitude for learning. What HQ is, is the degree to which someone is happier themselves when they provide happiness for someone else.”\n\nEven the Oracle of Omaha and longtime Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has fine-tuned his own hiring philosophy. After more than five decades helming the $1 trillion holding company, Buffett has witnessed professionals without glitzy Ivy League degrees succeed. And in planning his CEO succession last year, the investing mogul made one point clear: he wasn’t going to check the education section on candidates’ resumes.\n\n“I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!” Buffett wrote in his 2025 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. “Of course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are plenty such as Pete who may have benefited by attending a less prestigious institution or even not bothering to finish school.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.",
    "fullText": "“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“Should I wear a keffiyeh to the shooting range?” Amjad Masad asked as I slid into the passenger seat of his black Mercedes sports car. The patterned Palestinian scarf has become a political lightning rod in the two years since the war in Gaza began. Masad, the founder of AI coding startup Replit, and a Palestinian by origin, wrapped it around his neck anyway.\n\nAt the shooting range in Santa Clara, we collected an assault rifle and a pistol and headed in. With the AR-22 tucked into his shoulder, Masad fired at a brisk clip, peppering bullets into a cartoon burglar. In less than two minutes, the burglar’s head was perfectly pocked with holes.\n\n“You should compete,” I suggested.\n\nHe smirked. “I always compete.”\n\nIndeed, Masad has never been shy about his competitive streak or his political beliefs — especially since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, setting off the war in Gaza.\n\nMasad, 38, has felt obliged to speak out about Gaza ever since, calling out those in tech who, in his view, have supported Israel’s “genocide” of the Palestinian people. He quickly learned just how unpopular that opinion was in Silicon Valley.\n\nParty invitations dried up, group chats lit up with techies condemning his posts, and investors called him a “terrorist sympathizer.” One member of a firm that backed Replit publicly declared (opens in new tab) in July that he would donate any earnings from the investment to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n“I felt like I was sort of expelled from Silicon Valley,” Masad said in November on the way to the range.\n\nBut even as Silicon Valley cooled on him, the AI boom that Masad had long bet on took off. In 2024, Replit combined its coding tools with AI to create an agent that could turn plain English prompts into pre-coded apps. After nearly a decade, the company was suddenly in the right place at exactly the right time.\n\nTwo years later, Replit is booming. In September, it raised $250 million from Prysm, Andreessen Horowitz, Amex Ventures, and others, at a valuation of $3 billion. The company hopes to create the preeminent AI coder — one so easy to use that anyone can become a software engineer. Meanwhile, Masad continues to advocate for his political beliefs.\n\n“People reached out to me to express that my words have been hurtful and that many have been deeply offended,” he posted on X over the summer (opens in new tab). “I finally realized that I must, from the bottom of my heart, apologize to — absolutely nobody.”\n\nMasad’s swagger isn’t unique among tech founders. But for many, their against-the-grain takes tend to align with the bottom line. Masad insists he speaks up even when it hurts his business. In that regard, “I’m probably the only contrarian in Silicon Valley,” he told me.\n\nAs Replit takes off, will he be able to maintain that independence?\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation is hitched to the AI boom. Should the boom fizzle, the company could be worth nothing. But if it holds, and AI continues to remake the tech industry and the greater economy, Masad could find himself among the Valley’s next class of billionaires.\n\nReplit has plenty of competition among AI code-to-product firms (which are typically built on top of the mega LLMs). Swedish startup Lovable raised $330 million last month (opens in new tab), and Israeli company Base44 was bought by website builder Wix for $80 million this summer. All told, the AI coding sector received $4.7 billion in U.S. funding in the last year alone, according to PitchBook.\n\nTo persevere, Masad will not only have to beat his competitors with a better product but will have to earn the favor of still more investors, given the massive capital it takes to build and power Replit’s models.\n\nFor this reason, most players in AI have been pragmatic with their politics; see, for instance, how many Silicon Valley figures who previously supported liberal causes — from Marc Benioff to Mark Zuckerberg — suddenly and enthusiastically embraced the Trump White House. Or how Jensen Huang reportedly cozied (opens in new tab) up to David Sacks, hoping the AI czar would convince President Donald Trump to loosen U.S. chip restrictions and allow Nvidia to sell more products globally. Or how Sam Altman has courted Gulf royalty, landing major (opens in new tab) deals to build data centers in the region and fund OpenAI’s stateside infrastructure needs.\n\nFor the most part, Masad has been unwilling to soften his positions. With a penchant for discursive discussions on political philosophy, Masad remains eager to speak about the war in Gaza and rail against what he sees as human rights abuses committed by Israel.\n\nAnd he’s keen to take meetings with anyone who might see eye to eye on Palestine, even if they don’t agree on tech policy. Masad has spoken with New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani and messaged Lina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and nemesis of the tech elite. He had dinner with Tucker Carlson and lasted the obligatory three hours (opens in new tab) on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nIn short, Masad sees himself as both a champion for Palestine and a mogul in waiting. Which, particularly to other Arabs in tech, has made him a hero. “Having one of us make it in Silicon Valley — and still stay vocal on Palestine in the midst of all of this, specifically in Silicon Valley — is extremely inspirational,” said Fadi Ghandour, executive chairman at investment firm Wamda, one of the backers of Replit.\n\nAll this is a world away from Amman, Jordan, where Masad grew up. On the drive from his home in Palo Alto to the gun range, Masad told me his youthful hobbies included drift racing on Amman’s streets and shooting guns in empty lots.\n\nMasad, who speaks unexpectedly softly given his combative persona, is aware of how lucky he is. He compared his circumstances to a simulation experiment in which “if you ran the world a million times, I think 90% of them, I’m in a really bad situation. I’m in prison or dead.” Instead, “somehow I keep surviving and winning.”\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation was in many ways the fruits of Masad’s decades-long study of how to make it in Silicon Valley. As a teen in Jordan, he avidly followed Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham, studying his blog posts and obsessively scrolling through Hacker News, the Y Combinator news feed.\n\nAfter getting his computer science degree in 2010 from Jordan’s Princess Sumaya University for Technology, he created the first iteration of what would become Replit: an open-source program for coders to work within a web browser, a novelty back when programmers needed to buy specialized software.\n\nHe posted a link to the program on Hacker News, where it went viral. That led to securing his first job in the U.S., as the founding engineer at Codecademy in New York. In 2013, he took a job as a software engineer at Facebook. By 2016, he and his wife, Haya Odeh, decided to revisit his old project from Jordan, officially founding Replit as an online platform to help developers build, collaborate, and publish their software.\n\nAs a student of Silicon Valley, Masad knew that mythmaking was just as important as the product. He began live-blogging Replit’s progress, and his efforts soon caught the attention of Graham himself. “What struck me most about him, at first, was that he was a programmers’ programmer,” Graham said. “He wasn’t just working on software to make money. He’d have been writing it no matter what.”\n\nGraham invited Masad and Odeh to apply to the Y Combinator accelerator program in 2018. They were accepted, and after completing the program, Replit landed investment from Andreessen Horowitz. With that funding and support, Replit gained traction as a tool for students to learn coding and educators to teach it. According to Masad, he turned down a $1 billion acquisition from Github, believing Replit would one day be worth exponentially more.\n\nMasad’s ultimate objective was to leverage his success in tech to help the Palestinian cause — a sentiment instilled in him by his mother. “She would tell me about all the great things I’m gonna do,” he said. “I fantasized as a kid about helping the Palestinians and ending the occupation and being an important force in the world.”\n\nBut in 2019, he effectively put the company on pause after his mother’s cancer took a turn for the worse. Masad and Odeh traveled to be with his father, a civil engineer with the Jordanian government.\n\nThe experience was traumatic for Masad. In his mother’s final days, the doctors in Jordan wouldn’t let any visitors into the ICU. Masad begged, then yelled, and they finally relented — on the condition he sign a “do not resuscitate” order. He still doesn’t understand why. By the time he got to see her, she was unconscious. “I was so angry at modern medicine,” Masad said. “So angry at modernity.” She died shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter a few months, Masad returned to Silicon Valley. He couldn’t stop thinking about civilization at large, about where the world was going, and if he could stand it — or if he could change it. He found himself agreeing with the Valley’s increasingly powerful libertarians.\n\nHe bonded with Marc Andreessen over politics and literature, and traveled to Malaysia to visit Balaji Srinivasan’s mysterious “startup society.” He grew to realize that the limitations he had assumed don’t necessarily apply. “There was an aspect of, like, ‘Fuck the system,’” Masad said. “‘We need to remake civilization.’”\n\nMasad gained a following on Twitter by bantering with tech legends about everything from coding to bitcoin to Covid vaccine skepticism. His growing stature landed him on podcasts and in glowing (opens in new tab) articles in The Wall Street Journal portraying him as a maverick. Then came the ultimate Silicon Valley validation: Graham, the idol whom he’d studied obsessively as a teenager in Jordan, started thanking him in his own blog posts.  (opens in new tab)\n\nMeanwhile, Replit was struggling. The education market turned out to be small, and the company had trouble expanding into enterprise deals. In late 2023, Replit killed its education product and the following year laid off 30 employees — right after moving into a bigger office in Foster City. “I remember walking around the office and just feeling sick to my stomach,” he said. “I felt like I let people down as well, because I sold them this big dream, and it wasn’t working.”\n\nHe had a plan, though, one he hoped would make his odyssey worth it. For years, he had proselytised on podcasts about how AI would turbocharge coding. Replit had spent years building an extensive database of coding materials — he just needed foundational companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to catch up and release an LLM capable of writing code. Once they did, Replit could plug those models into its pre-existing database and create a powerful app-building AI agent.\n\nWhile a new AI coding company would have to build out that infrastructure from scratch, Replit, Masad realized, could start miles ahead. After nearly a decade, he would finally have perfect timing.\n\nMasad had always been outspoken online. After Hamas’ terrorist attacks, as segments of the tech elite publicly lined up behind Israel, he held his ground. And his responses grew more costly.\n\nFirst, there were the public fights. Masad advised Elon Musk (opens in new tab) to “stick to his principles” when the billionaire said the slogan “from the river to the sea” was calling for genocide. (Palestinian activists say it’s a call for the peaceful liberation of the Palestinian people; pro-Israel voices say it calls for the extermination of Israel.) He clapped back (opens in new tab) at Lux Capital founding partner Josh Wolfe, who said that equating Israel’s actions in Gaza to genocide “grotesquely disgraces” Holocaust victims. And when Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures said Masad’s “friends” (opens in new tab) were behind the Oct. 7 attack, Masad challenged him directly.\n\n“If you think my friends did that then why don’t you confront me when you see me?” Masad replied on X (opens in new tab).\n\nBut even as things got noisy in public, Masad met eerie silence professionally. “My calendar was suddenly empty, because I was talking about Palestine,” he said. “Replit was not a hot company anymore. We did a layoff. And at the same time, a lot of my friends were no longer my friends. I was no longer invited to parties.”\n\nPotential partnerships dried up. Masad became a frequent topic in pro-Israel tech groupchats, a source said, where some investors accused him of being antisemitic.\n\nA Replit investor who requested anonymity to speak candidly told me Masad’s public persona has been “really challenging,” and he’s had to defend the founder in investor circles. I asked if Masad had lost business because of his views. “I’m sure the answer is yes,” the investor said.\n\nA startup that Masad had invested in pitched another investor — and found that Masad was a liability. “He said, ‘Oh, Amjad is investing. He’s like a terrorist sympathizer. If he’s investing, I’m not investing,” Masad said he was told, though he declined to name the company or the investor.\n\nBut as Silicon Valley grew chilly, other regions beckoned.\n\nIn April 2024, with Replit a few months from launching its AI agent, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is worth nearly $1 trillion, invited Masad and other AI thought leaders to stay at Ekland Safaris, a property in South Africa linked (opens in new tab) to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nFor Masad, it was a lifeline. Here were potential partners who didn’t care about his politics on Palestine. If anything, his Arab identity and his outspokenness made him more attractive.\n\nIn the heat of the day, a hunting guide sped Masad and other guests, including Tareq Amin, the future CEO of Saudi AI company HUMAIN, across 30,000 acres to kill kudu and wildebeest. By night, guests feasted in a grand ballroom while Masad demoed his not-yet-released AI coding agent to Saudi officials.\n\n“We’re going to be able to give a software engineer to every person,” Masad told Amin. “Anyone in the world will have a software engineer on demand.”\n\nAmin said he thought then that Replit was on “a path to build a game-changing technology.” Indeed, if the agent worked, and if the AI boom Masad had been betting on came to pass, everyone in that room stood to benefit.\n\nReplit launched its AI agent in September 2024 and within a year, revenue had reached $150 million. Amin and Masad closed a deal for Replit to be the exclusive AI coding software for Saudi governmental agencies, a partnership Masad expects to lead to “hundreds of millions” of dollars worth of business.\n\nAnd just like that, Silicon Valley wanted back in. Replit landed enterprise deals with Atlassian and Zillow, with a Meta deal in the wings, according to Masad. Replit raised its $250 million round and scored its $3 billion valuation.\n\nIt helped Masad that, in the two years since Oct. 7, there’s been rising public disapproval (opens in new tab) of the Israeli government. He also gained strength in numbers: There have been high-profile movements (opens in new tab) within Google, Amazon, and other tech giants, with employees speaking out in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\n“Today, the tide in tech has shifted,” Masad posted to X in September. (opens in new tab) “If you’ve been holding back, now is the time to speak out and call out anyone supporting or celebrating genocide.”\n\nWith Silicon Valley warming back up to him — he was on a16z’s podcast in October (opens in new tab) — Masad was invited to larger, and more controversial, audiences. He drove hours to record at Carlson’s rural Maine cabin, nodding politely when the host marveled on air at his perfect English. In July, he sat down with Rogan, talking about everything from Gaza to the Covid vaccine, which Masad has refused to take.\n\n“I tend to have a negative reaction to anyone forcing me to do something,” Masad said, prompting a “Good for you” from Rogan. “It was the same thing now with talking about Palestine and things like that. The more they come at me, the more I want to say things.”\n\nHe appears now to have the capital, both financially and socially, to draw hard lines. “There are a lot of people who care about the Palestinians but who are afraid to speak out publicly,” said Graham, who has also been an outspoken advocate for Palestine. “What Amjad and I have in common is that we don’t have to worry about being fired if we do.”\n\nMasad said Israel’s Ministry of Education had reached out around 2016 to work with Replit. “We got very close to a deal, but they were very overbearing,” he said, adding that the government had what he viewed as cumbersome requirements, like fining Replit if the service went down. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHe says he would never work with Israel now. “I think it’s an illegitimate and criminal government,” he told me during our gun safety training. “I mean, [Benjamin] Netanyahu is a war criminal.”\n\nWhen I pointed out that Saudi Arabia has its own abysmal human rights record, Masad drew a contrast.\n\n“I just think about how Replit is going to be used. Like, Israel is actively committing genocide and ethnic cleansing, and if you sell to the government there, it’s possible that they’re going to use it for that,” he said, pointing to the country’s use of Microsoft cloud services to track Palestinians’ phone calls. (After an investigation by The Guardian, Microsoft said it disabled the services that made the tracking possible in September. (opens in new tab))\n\nIt’s a careful, and conveniently self-serving, justification. This logic allows Replit to work with countries that Masad finds tolerable. Whether that line will hold as Replit scales is unclear.\n\nAfter the shooting range, we drove through a thick forest fog to the restaurant The Mountain House in Woodside. Over grilled venison, Masad talked about Replit’s next challenge: expanding its user base from corporate clients to everyday users. This isn’t essential — plenty of companies thrive selling enterprise software. But Masad wants Replit to be an engine for socioeconomic mobility around the world, letting anyone, anywhere, easily create apps and businesses.\n\nMasad acknowledged that if he succeeds — if Replit goes public and he becomes a billionaire — he will have the capital to make real change for Palestine, though he’s light on details. “It’s hard to plan for 20 years in the future,” he shrugged. “I just know that wealth is a prerequisite.”\n\nMargaux MacColl can be reached at [email protected]",

    "description": "Forage, an AI-powered startup, leverages AI as a middle manager to amplify its junior employee's productivity and learning with minimal supervision.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Charles Swann, a 44-year-old founder of an AI startup based in Boulder, CO. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI founded my startup, Forage, around 18 months ago. Besides myself, I have one full-time employee who has been with the company for eight months.\n\nMy business is in the marketing technology space, and I needed someone with a deep connection to modern culture and social media. So, I hired a 24-year-old growth and brand specialist from my neighborhood. She's a college graduate with less than two years of experience, whom I started mentoring.\n\nThe challenge with hiring someone more junior is that they often lack the skills to translate their intuition into a business strategy. But over the last six months, especially since the launch of Gemini 3, we've been able to leverage AI to significantly expand the capabilities of my junior employee.\n\nWe work in the marketing technology space, helping brands understand the trends happening on social media.\n\nMy junior employee has a very intuitive understanding of what influencer and brand relationships should look like, as well as how brands should present themselves on social media.\n\nWhen she first used AI in this role, she used ChatGPT to refine her product strategy. ChatGPT was great at taking her rough ideas, refining the concepts, and then writing out the details. As we began using Gemini more frequently, the role AI played in our workflow shifted from refining to co-creating product strategy.\n\nThe increased strategic capabilities in Gemini 3 are subtle, but they make a big difference because that strategic perspective is what young professionals often miss.\n\nMy growth and brand specialist had no prior experience writing a product requirements document before getting this role. Without AI, creating this document is a heavy lift. It's essentially the initial blueprint for a new product feature, translating a business idea into the technical instructions needed to build it.\n\nWriting this type of document for complex features typically would take a skilled product manager eight to 10 hours to get it right. With Gemini, my employee can do this in four to five hours.\n\nGemini 3 has been a significant step forward. Before using it, I had the idea that we should create 70% of the final product, and AI should generate 30%. Now, it's probably 40% us and 60% Gemini, simply because it's so good at expanding and expediting.\n\nWith younger career professionals, sometimes there's a light switch that clicks, and they know what it's like to be a leader, take ownership of something, and start running with their ideas.\n\nMy employee has really demonstrated that growth. This occurred at the same time she became more sophisticated in her use of AI.\n\nAI now serves as that middle layer, helping her level up the work she produces. I hesitate to say that AI alone has allowed me to have less supervision, but as she started getting more sophisticated in her use of the AI tool, I've spent less time reviewing in detail what she's generating and more time focused on the big-picture strategy questions.\n\nThere's always a risk in relying on AI to teach my employee how to gain years of experience in seconds. Hallucinations and feedback loops can occur if someone doesn't have the experience to know when to redirect.\n\nWhat I've done to help safeguard us is create a collection of prompt starters that include a detailed background on what our platform does, the features, and how to define it, which I can copy and paste into the chat. That's been a giant time saver and helps keep it focused on relevant context.\n\nHowever, I think running into possible mistakes or hallucinations is better than moving slowly. I would rather have those mistakes come up, and we have to course correct, than not be able to move at the pace we are.\n\nAI removes some of the traditional requirements around skills and expertise I need to see in candidates. It allows me to focus more on the raw intelligence, ambition, and drive.\n\nWith my company, I'm definitely bullish on the idea that brands will need the ability to authentically understand and reflect culture more than ever before, even in an AI-driven world, to survive. That type of intuitive knowledge resides with a different group of people than those my age, in their 40s, might be able to deliver.\n\nSo, I'm less concerned with whether my employee has been in the marketing industry for 10 years and more concerned with whether they have a deep understanding of the problem we're trying to solve.\n\nI believe this hiring mindset will only grow as AI continues to transform the workforce.\n\nDo you operate a tiny team and want to share your story?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's new defense regulations are sending ripples through the industry, and that's a good thing, according to Palmer Luckey.\n\n\"It's good to scare people sometimes,\" Luckey, the founder and CEO of defense technology startup Anduril, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\"President Trump is saying that he wants to see defence companies building new plants, building new factories, delivering on time, and then maintaining systems cost-effectively,\" Luckey said in an appearance on \"The Close\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'd say I'm broadly aligned,\" the Anduril founder said, adding that \"trying to do more of that is why I started Anduril years ago.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump criticized major defense contractors for issuing large dividends to shareholders, doing stock buybacks, and offering \"exorbitant\" pay packages while underperforming in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe president backed his rhetoric with action, signing an executive order that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nThe order caps defense executive salaries at $5 million, tying their annual compensation to on-time delivery, increased production, and operational improvements.\n\n\"These measures do apply in equal measure to me. I now cannot pay dividends. I now cannot do stock buybacks if I'm not investing in new plants,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Anduril founder told Bloomberg he pays himself a salary of $100,000 a year, in addition to owning \"a lot\" of Anduril.\n\nLuckey's startup, which makes autonomous weapons, is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025 and is considering an IPO. The company's mission is to modernize the US military through technology, including surveillance devices, air vehicles, and autonomous weapons.\n\nAs the United States hustles to modernize warfare, Anduril has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\n\"If these companies were doing really well, and if they were living up to their end of the bargain, I don't think you would see any action from Trump or others on this. It's really a reflection of how many problems we have with our defence industrial base,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nWithout specifying, he added that he thought some of Trump's proposals \"might be bad moves\" for the defense base, but that \"in concept,\" everything should be on the table.",

    "description": "Amy Errett, the founder and CEO of Madison Reed, told Business Insider she sticks to a strict structure to get through her busy days.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Errett, the founder and CEO of Madison Reed. Errett is based in Northern California and founded the hair care company in 2013. Since then, Madison Reed has grown to 90 locations across the country. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLife as a CEO is busy, and I start my days early with exercise, meditation, and a strong cup of coffee, before I jump into a morning of back-to-back meetings.\n\nI'm very disciplined about how I work and communicate, but I try to keep time for thinking and being outside, especially at the end of the week.\n\nIn the evenings, I slow down with family, simple rituals, and sleep, so I can do it all again the next day.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone to make sure nothing urgent happened overnight, especially since I'm on the West Coast.\n\nMy wife, Claire, is a professional artist and also a professional chef. I'm lucky — I get a home-cooked meal almost every night. That's also why I have to weigh myself every morning before I exercise or drink anything. I also track my sleep and stress using an Oura Ring.\n\nWithin about 45 minutes of waking up, I work out at home using my Peloton and Tonal. Five days a week, I do 30 minutes of cardio and 15 minutes of strength training.\n\nAfterward, I meditate for about 10 minutes using Henry Shukman's app, The Way.\n\nI travel a lot, but for three days, I work from home. At my home in Marin County, I work from a small pod, a 110-square-foot room in my backyard — made in Canada — that is my private workspace. I'm a nature person, and being surrounded by grass and trees is like getting plugged into an energy source.\n\nI also have a condo in San Francisco, which I go back and forth between.\n\nBefore I start work, I make a coffee with two regular shots and two decaf and bring it with me, along with water.\n\nMy workdays are highly structured. I have weekly one-on-one meetings with everyone who reports directly to me, always at the same time each week. Those blocks are fixed, and everything else gets scheduled around them.\n\nMy assistant, Christina, is essential to keeping my schedule running. We meet three times a week and plan weeks in advance.\n\nMy meetings include internal check-ins, conversations with the PR team, and external meetings. I also mentor other women investors. I've been on the board of my alma mater, Wharton, so there are sometimes external board meetings, and my own board meetings.\n\nI also personally interview every hire at the level of store general manager or above for 15 minutes before they receive an offer.\n\nThese interviews are focused entirely on cultural fit. I always ask one question: \"Tell me about something that didn't go well in your life, and what you learned from it.\"\n\nI'm looking for resilience, grit, honesty, love, and passion. Some of the answers I hear — about loss, hardship, or perseverance — stop me in my tracks and tell me who someone really is. I've had people tell me they are homeless and worked their way up to being a general manager somewhere else. That 15-minute process adds up, but it's incredibly important to me.\n\nI'm a protein loader, especially since losing a significant amount of weight. I aim to eat about 90 to 100 grams of protein a day. Cottage cheese is my best friend — it's high in protein, relatively low in calories, and keeps me full.\n\nMy go-to meal is a bowl of cottage cheese topped with a poached egg and a slice of gluten-free toast. I also allow myself one small indulgence: three days a week, I have a mini Coke Zero in the afternoon.\n\nI've tried to work with my assistant to carve out blocks of uninterrupted thinking time, but the truth is, I don't get much of it.\n\nMost days are packed back-to-back. I do, however, protect Fridays: I don't take meetings after 1 p.m., and that's when I catch up and think more freely.\n\nMy best thinking happens outside. I live near Marin, so I hike often.\n\nOn Fridays, I'll often leave right at 1 p.m. and drive to my boat alone. I don't talk to anyone — I just cruise, sit with my thoughts, and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes a close friend will join me, but most of the time it's solo.\n\nDuring the rest of the week, though, I'm extremely disciplined about communication.\n\nMy inbox is always at zero, and I respond quickly across email, Slack, text, and phone. I actually like calling people, even though most people don't — I think there's a lost art in picking up the phone and having a real conversation.\n\nIt's not always easy to stay on track — especially with such a tight schedule.\n\nThis work is personal to me. I'm putting my energy into it, and so are more than 1,100 other people. When something doesn't feel good — we didn't do right by someone, or we got turned down — I feel it deeply.\n\nI've gotten better at handling those moments over time. I work with an executive coach over Zoom twice a week. That's helped me understand what triggers me and how to recover more quickly. I still have emotional reactions — I'm very human — but I don't stay stuck in them the way I used to.\n\nWhen I feel overwhelmed now, I step outside and take a walk or just pause and take a breath. That reset helps me come back grounded.\n\nIt took a long time to get there, but it works.\n\nMost evenings, I like to unwind by watching sports. I follow several teams, record every game, and have access to all the streaming platforms, so there's almost always something on.\n\nDinner is an important part of my evening. My wife, Claire, and I sit down to eat together every night, usually around 6:15 pm. Before we eat, we say a blessing, and then we do \"roses and thorns,\" where we each share one good thing and one hard thing from the day. We've kept that tradition going since our daughter, Madison, who I named the company after, was young.\n\nAfter dinner, we'll usually watch something together. I tend to gravitate toward sports and thrillers, while Claire and our daughter have different tastes. Our dog, London, is usually right by my side.\n\nI try to be in bed by 10 p.m. and asleep by 10:30. I use a Hatch sound machine and an Eight Sleep mattress — both are game changers.",

    "title": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio says gold's rapid rally is a warning for markets and the economy",
    "description": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgwater Associates, says the blistering rally in gold last year is a reflection of precarious macro developments.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio spent 2025 expressing fear and urging caution, and he's remaining cautious as the US economy enters a new year.\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates sounded alarms throughout 2025 over what he sees as a budding global debt crisis and the waning value of fiat currency.\n\nThe surge in gold last year—the biggest gain for the metal since 1979—contains a warning for investors, specifically as it relates to the depreciating value of fiat money, Dalio said in a post on Monday.\n\nA potent cocktail of central bank buying, geopolitical worries, and appetite from individuals pushed gold to records all year, but Dalio argues that the gold rally is mainly a result of fiat money losing real value. In his view, that was the biggest story in markets in 2025.\n\n\"The best major investment of the year was long gold (returning 65% in dollar terms), which outperformed the S&P index (which returned 18% in dollars) by 47%,\" he said. \"Or, said differently, the S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms.\"\n\nDalio urged investors to consider a few key factors when evaluating the forces that drove markets in 2025. Specifically, he highlighted that examining investment through calculations made in a depreciating currency can be misleading, as it can make returns appear stronger than they actually were.\n\nFrom Dalio's perspective, the stock market's 2025 performance varied greatly based on the measuring stick.\n\n\"When one's own currency goes down, it makes it look like the things measured in it went up,\" he said. \"In this case, the S&P returned 18% for a dollar-based investor, 17% for a yen-based investor, 13% for a renminbi-based investor, only 4% for a euro-based investor, only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor, and, for a gold-based investor, it returned -28%.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the economic benefits of a weakening US dollar, attempting to frame it as beneficial for US exports. But economic think tanks such as the Cato Institute have argued against this perspective, claiming that it ignores negative spillover effects for US consumers.\n\nDalio seems to share that mindset, noting that a weaker currency tends to lower the cost of a nation's exported goods for international buyers while increasing the price of domestic imports.\n\n\"When one's currency goes down, it reduces one's wealth and one's buying power, it makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies, and it makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency.\"\n\nIn his view, rising gold prices reflect a weakening economy and a national currency that is decreasing in value. For that reason, Dalio sees the continued strength of the so-called debasement trade as a warning for the US.\n\nThe stock market's big bull run in recent years might also be making it easier for investors to disregard other warning signals flashing in the economy. Dalio emphasized that the gold rally is a reason to reassess the macro picture and take a more cautious position.\n\nThe billionaire investor added that stocks and gold benefited from monetary policy easing in 2025, but as both assets are no longer cheap, they're at risk of a pullback if conditions shift again.\n\n\"Whether or not you are currency hedged matters a lot,\" Dalio said. \"You should always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if you think you are capable of making them well.\"",

    "description": "Ben Parris is a professor of cognition and cognitive neuroscience in Bournemouth University’s School of Psychology. He is also co-founder of the university’s Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Centre",
    "fullText": "Ben Parris is a professor of cognition and cognitive neuroscience in Bournemouth University’s School of Psychology. He is also co-founder of the university’s Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Centre\n\nA decline in your cognitive health is something that can creep up on you. It’s not like a bad back or dodgy knee, which will give you plenty of gyp as soon as there is a problem. You may suddenly find that you’re not quite as mentally sharp as you once were.\n\nYou may notice that it becomes harder to hold conversations, remember phone numbers and do everyday tasks such as go to the shops. That’s a result of your frontal lobe beginning to waste away, which happens to all of us as we age, though at different rates.\n\nThis part of the brain is located just behind our forehead and is home to our executive functions – our ability to plan, organise, focus and generally interact with the world around us. It’s different from dementia, though that disease speeds up the process.\n\nWhile the frontal lobe does eventually deteriorate, as a professor and researcher who studies cognitive decline, I have seen it remain in good nick in people in their 60s and beyond.\n\nThe key to keeping your mental abilities sharp as you age starts with noticing when the frontal lobe is shrinking. If you’re aware, there are things you can do to slow it down. So here are the signs it’s happening to you, and what you can do about it. I’ve also compiled a series of tests so that you can test how well your brain is ageing, which you can access below.\n\nOne of the first signs of a decline in your cognitive health can be struggling to switch between tasks, such as cooking a meal while also holding a conversation with someone.\n\nYou might notice that you struggle to respond to someone’s comment, as you’re still thinking about what to do next in your recipe.\n\nThere is a loosening of the sharpness that was once there. The tasks bleed together, you’re not able to focus and it takes you a bit of time to adjust.\n\nThis signals a problem with your cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to switch between different tasks and remain focused. This represents one of the more difficult tasks that we engage in on a daily basis, so it can be the first ability that you notice is deteriorating.\n\nIn extreme cases, people can be stirring a pot and as they turn around to talk to someone, they are still doing the action of stirring but without the spoon in their hand.\n\nWe can all jumble up words at times, especially if we’re tired or distracted. However, if you catch yourself regularly skipping over words, it could be a sign of cognitive decline.\n\nFor example, instead of saying “I’m just going to pop to the shops”, you might come out with “I’m just shops”.\n\nIt can be a sign that there is a problem with your response inhibition, which is a cognitive function located in your frontal lobe. It is a skill we need for focus and to block out irrelevant information.\n\nWhen you skip words like this, it means that your brain failed to inhibit (or block out) the last word in the sentence until it was time to say it. It’s a form of language breakdown that can be an early sign of dementia.\n\nRegularly mixing up related words is another sign that your cognition isn’t in peak condition.\n\nFor example, if you want to say the word “fork”, it should be at the forefront of your mind but, when there is a problem with response inhibition, related words such as “spoon” and “knife” can also float to the surface.\n\nIf this part of our cognitive function continues to deteriorate, you may say words that become increasingly distant from the word you meant to say, for example “plate” or even “train” instead of “fork”. This is a sign that there is misfiring going on in the brain.\n\nThe frequency with which this occurs and the distance from the word you intended to say can be used to determine the severity of cognitive decline.\n\nIf you realise that you need to nip to the shop for some milk, your brain quickly comes up with a plan. Where is the nearest shop? How will you get there? Do you have a way of paying?\n\nWith good cognitive health, this requires little effort and you may not give these questions a second thought. However, if one of these components goes wrong – for example, you forget a means of payment – it signals a failure in working memory, which is our ability to maintain and manipulate information.\n\nAs you were leaving the house, you failed to maintain one of the key components of the task. Such mental slips become more common as we age and our frontal lobes atrophy.\n\nIf this happens occasionally and is not increasing in frequency, it’s nothing to worry about. I have been known to drive to the supermarket and walk home, forgetting that I’ve left the car as I’ve been busy thinking about other things.\n\nHowever, if it happens more and more often, you might want to consider seeing your GP. It could be an early sign of dementia.\n\nForgetting what you need from the shop, and struggling to find the items you want to buy, are signs of cognitive decline.\n\nYou rely on your short-term memory to remember what you need from the shop and your spatial memory (the ability to understand where you are in relation to your surroundings) to be able to find the products you need.\n\nIf this part of your cognitive health is deteriorating, you may find yourself walking up and down the same aisles many times, as you’ve forgotten which you’ve already been down.\n\nOne famous study took patients to a shopping centre and gave them a list of items to buy, such as milk and a newspaper. Those suffering from cognitive decline walked up and down multiple times, getting the items in an illogical way, following an incoherent path.\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms and it is significantly affecting your ability to continue with life as normal, or you have noticed that they are getting worse, I would recommend going to your GP.\n\nIt’s also worth booking an appointment with your doctor if a loved one is concerned about your cognitive health, even if you are not, as you could be experiencing anosognosia, which is a lack of awareness of your own cognitive decline. This is a common problem.\n\nWhile these symptoms could be a sign of cognitive decline or dementia, they could also be caused by a stroke or tumour. The earlier you see your GP, the easier it is to treat.\n\nIf concerned, your doctor should refer you to the neuropsychology clinic at your local hospital. There, you will probably complete a series of memory tests, such as the “Stroop task” and the Corsi block-tapping test, and have an MRI to look for shrinkage in the frontal lobe, which would indicate dementia, or lesions, which may be evidence of a stroke.\n\nThere are no hidden secrets in terms of maintaining cognitive health. As far as we’re aware, it’s the same recommendations as for maintaining bodily health.\n\nDiet and exercise are the two most important pillars to focus on for your brain.\n\nFollowing a healthy diet – which includes plenty of green leafy vegetables, fish, nuts and berries – has been shown to slow cognitive decline, which is thought to be because these foods contain nutrients such as folate and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nWeight-training twice a week has been linked to less brain shrinkage and better performance on memory tests, while cardio improves blood flow, including to the brain, promoting the development of new brain cells and protecting the organ against inflammation.\n\nI always recommend cutting back on alcohol – and only drink a few times a year myself – as research has shown that it causes shrinkage in parts of the brain important for memory, and poorer performance on cognitive tests. I’d also recommend quitting drinking alcohol alone, as the only benefits thought to come from drinking is if it gets you out socialising.\n\nIt’s possible that the deterioration of our frontal lobe happens, or is sped up, due to a lack of use, and challenging your brain has been linked with delaying cognitive decline. This could mean learning a new instrument or language, reading difficult books, doing calculations in your head instead of on your phone calculator, completing puzzles, and even watching quiz shows. They can all play a role in keeping your brain younger.\n\nSpending time in nature has been linked to better working memory, while holding conversations, and socialising has been shown to keep our cognitive health better for longer.

    "fullText": "Rosen, who led Sega from the 1960s into the 90s and who died on Christmas Day, was a hugely important figure in the history of arcade and home gaming\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",
