    "fullText": "After months of unexplained fatigue, an xAI cofounder says he's stepping back from the company following a Lyme disease diagnosis.\n\nGreg Yang said in a post on X published Tuesday that he will move into an informal advisory role at Elon Musk's startup xAI immediately so he can \"go founder mode on my health.\"\n\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection typically transmitted by ticks and is known for symptoms that can linger or worsen over time.\n\nYang said his symptoms began after an illness in early 2025, when he noticed lingering fatigue and a drop in energy and creativity weeks after he believed he had recovered.\n\nOver time, the symptoms worsened, with workouts or certain foods leaving him exhausted for days, he said.\n\n\"​​There was a week where I slept 12 hours a day and still couldn't recover,\" he added.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of testing, Yang said his doctor diagnosed him with Lyme disease, a condition that is \"famously hard to diagnose.\"\n\nHe said that he was surprised by the diagnosis, as he did not recall a tick bite.\n\n\"Likely I contracted Lyme a long time ago, but until I pushed myself hard building xAI and weakened my immune system, the symptoms weren't noticeable,\" he added.\n\nDespite the setback, Yang said he felt \"lucky\" to have caught the condition relatively early. He said discovering it now would allow him to \"fix it so I can push myself even harder when I rebound.\"\n\nIn response to Yang's X post, Musk replied that he hoped Yang would \"get well soon.\"\n\n\"Maybe Grok will find a cure!\" Musk added.\n\nYang joined xAI as a cofounder in June 2023, after spending nearly six years as a researcher at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nYang's move comes after two other xAI cofounders, Igor Babuschkin and Christian Szegedy, left the company last year.",

    "description": "Sid Pardeshi, a former Nvidia engineer-turned founder, said Jensen Huang inspired him to launch an AI company, and taught him about leadership.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sid Pardeshi, 32, the co-founder and CTO of a generative AI software platform. He is from India and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI thought I'd stay at Nvidia forever.\n\nThe pay, learning opportunities, and benefits made it a delight to work there. I had no reason to leave.\n\nBut Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, inspired me, and I realized I wanted to be a founder, too.\n\nIn 2022, I made the extremely hard decision to leave Nvidia and pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I resigned months before ChatGPT was released, and I believe that choice cost me double-digit millions worth of unvested company stock.\n\nI co-founded the AI company Blitzy in 2023, which has raised $4.4 million. Working under Huang for over six years taught me valuable lessons that have been instrumental to my success.\n\nI got an internship with Nvidia in India through my university, where I studied electrical and electronics engineering.\n\nWhen I started in January 2016, Nvidia wasn't a FAANG company, the acronym for the most prestigious Big Tech firms of the time: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. But as a gamer, I was familiar with the company's graphics chips, so I was deeply passionate about working there.\n\nAt the end of my six-month internship, I started a full-time position as a junior engineer at Nvidia in Pune. By 2018, I was a senior system software engineer.\n\nI didn't interact with Jensen much, but he would lead quarterly all-hands meetings, which I would attend remotely from India. He spoke about things where he was ahead of his time, like AI and virtual worlds. I was fascinated by him because I shared his love of technology.\n\nOnce, when Jensen visited staff in India, I asked him after an all-hands meeting what to focus on if I wanted to make a meaningful contribution to Nvidia and the tech space at large.\n\nHe suggested choosing one area of expertise and committing to it deeply, rather than spreading myself out across many interests. I took his guidance to heart and went deep into AI as it related to gaming.\n\nAs time passed, my ambitions evolved. I saw a lot of opportunities emerging in AI, and I wanted to become a founder like Jensen.\n\nIn 2022, at age 28, I quit my job and moved to Massachusetts with my wife and children to join an MSc and MBA program at Harvard.\n\nWhile studying, I worked for Nvidia as an intern from May 2023 to April 2024. They offered me a job that could start after I completed my master's, but starting a business was my primary goal.\n\nIn 2023, a classmate at Harvard and I founded Blitzy, which I work on full-time as the CTO. We're working on using AI to significantly automate software development work for enterprises.\n\nAt Nvidia, I noticed that Jensen nurtured and valued talent. When I was an intern in the US, he made time to meet with us. His assistant kept telling him that a very important client was calling him during the meeting. \"Let them wait,\" Jensen said. \"I'm talking to the future of Nvidia.\"\n\nLike Jensen, I want to keep the spark alive among employees, regardless of their rank. Every day, I allocate two hours to listening to team members and helping them solve problems.\n\nJensen would also follow his convictions. For example, he bet on the accelerated computing platform CUDA in the 2000s, when no one saw its true potential. Now, it's the backbone of AI training processes.\n\nSimilarly, when we first pitched to investors that we intended to use AI to build software autonomously, many didn't believe AI was advanced enough yet. But because I've been reading papers in the AI space every week for years, I trusted my convictions and that we could automate coding at Blitzy.\n\nAnother page I'm taking from his book is never ruling out the prospect of going out of business. Jensen was always concerned about the survival of Nvidia, despite it being a trillion-dollar company. I remember once a fellow intern in the US asked Jensen whether he watched movies. He said that even in the theater, he's thinking about Nvidia.\n\nAs Blitzy's CTO, I want to anticipate every challenge ahead of time. I focus on solving important technical problems and delegate everything else. I want to let people with more knowledge about other aspects of the company handle issues in their space.\n\nSimilarly, it's thought that Jensen's signature outfit, the black pants, shirt, and leather jacket, helps him minimize decision fatigue. I do wear different outfits every day, but my wife, who loves fashion, picks them out for me.\n\nAt one point, I wondered if I was being selfish by leaving Nvidia. I had a family, and needed to make the right choice, both for my career and for them.\n\nI moved to the US on a student visa, which meant my wife was my dependent and not allowed to work. She put her career on the line.\n\nYet, my wife, and my mom, encouraged me to pursue my dreams, and it would be too late now if I hadn't done it then. Once ChatGPT came out, everyone was thinking about bringing AI solutions to the market. I'm glad I already had deep knowledge and experience with AI and was ready to take advantage of the moment.\n\nFinancially, quitting Nvidia wasn't a smart decision because, based on my calculations around my compensation package, my unvested stock would be worth double-digit millions because of how the company's value has grown.\n\nI knew AI technology would progress significantly over the next few years, although I couldn't have anticipated ChatGPT coming out so fast in November 2022 — just months after I resigned. I was leaving right on the cusp of a big moment in the industry, before I was able to harvest the returns.\n\nBut I'm glad I quit when I did. If my family has what they need, working on cutting-edge stuff is more important to me than money.\n\nI got to watch as Nvidia grew from a relatively insignificant company to a trillion-dollar business, and I'm applying everything I learned to Blitzy. My mission is for Blitzy to be on the same trajectory as Nvidia, one day becoming a trillion-dollar company.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.",

    "description": "Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio said at Davos that \"capital wars\" could be the result of deficits and trade wars.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio thinks the world could be on the verge of \"capital wars.\"\n\nThe billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder isn't shy about sounding the alarm on economic problems he sees brewing. At this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he says Donald Trump's aggressive policies could spark global financial conflict.\n\nThe president looms large over Davos this year, with his threatening rhetoric related to Greenland, which he says the US must control for security reasons.\n\nWhile Trump's latest comments are in focus, Dalio says they're just another part of a troubling trend that could shift the global financial order. Speaking with CNBC at the event, Dalio said the possibility of capital wars represents a threat with widespread ramifications for markets and the economy.\n\n\"On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio stated. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at US debt and so on.\"\n\nIn his view, trade conflicts such as the one playing out between the US and much of the rest of the world, don't actually resolve global imbalances. They do, however, put strong tensions on capital flows, as countries grapple with who is financing deficits and which nations are willing to hold certain assets. In particular, eroding trust in the US could make global investors less willing to lend to the country by buying Treasurys.\n\n\"We know that both the holders of US dollar-denominated debt…and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other,\" he said. \"If you have other countries who are holding it and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue.\"\n\nIf foreign demand slumps, he says the US may be forced to rely on internal measures to provide the funding it needs. This could lead to higher inflation or currency debasement, two factors that would likely reinforce concerns among foreign investors.\n\nDalio also reiterated his positive view of gold as a reserve asset in the event of capital wars. He said that in normal times, gold should account for between 5% and 15% of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n\"I have been clear for quite a while that I would tilt away from bronze, and I would be tilting toward gold, and have a greater than normal amount of that,\" he said.\n\nIn his 2025 market reflections, though, Dalio said that gold's strong price rally may be a warning for investors and urged caution on what the metal's big rally could mean for the economy in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Worth a staggering $2.45bn, Suno is an AI music company that can create a track with just a few prompts. Why is its CEO happy to see it called ‘the Ozempic of the music industry’?\n\n‘The format of the future,” says Mikey Shulman, “is music you play with, not just play.” As the CEO and co-founder of the generative AI music company Suno, Shulman currently finds himself in the exhilarating if perhaps unenviable position of being simultaneously regarded as the architect of music’s future – and its executioner.\n\nSuno, which was founded just over two years ago, allows users to create entire songs with just a few text prompts. At the moment, you can’t prompt it with the name of a specific pop star, but asking for “stadium-level confessional pop-country” that “references past relationships” or “public rivalries” might get you a Taylor Swift-style song or thereabouts.\n\nIn June 2024, Suno became the target of litigation by record company trade body the RIAA on behalf of major labels in the US, while German collection society GEMA, representing songwriters, filed its own lawsuit the following January. Both claimed the service was training its systems on their copyrights without authorisation or licences.\n\nGen AI music services have triggered an existential crisis in the music industry. The utopian reading is that they will democratise creativity. The dystopian one is that art will be smothered by AI slop, as humans making music become surplus to requirements. (And many musicians already struggle to make a living from streaming revenues.) Dave Stewart of Eurythmics called them an “unstoppable force” and said musicians should, begrudgingly or enthusiastically, embrace them. Catherine Anne Davies, AKA the Anchoress, told me recently she believes it to be “dystopian”. Music lawyer Gregor Pryor has argued it is already killing off background music work.\n\n“I like to think of us as trying to make the next format for recorded music,” says Shulman. “The format of the future will be interactive.” What does he mean? “It should be social, meaning you’re doing it with other people. What we are doing is building the best digital version of that.”\n\nInvestors were clearly not scared off. In November, Suno raised $250m (£187m) in funding, taking its valuation to $2.45bn (£1.83bn). Gen AI is the hottest thing in Silicon Valley, with a Stanford University report saying it drew $34bn (£25bn) in private investment in 2024. But there are fears, notably at the Bank of England, that this brilliant boom can only be followed by a bitter bust. For now, however, investors believe gen AI is too big to fail. The stakes for Suno’s success are astonishingly high, especially given the recent leaking of an investor presentation suggesting the company only had 1 million paying subscribers. The standard monthly plan costs £8.25 ($10).\n\n“The thing that investors needed help realising,” says Shulman, “is how important music is in the world. Once you show them, their minds are changed and they realise that much, much more is possible.”\n\nWhen a new outside technology imposes itself on the music industry, the response typically runs from apoplexy to legal action, then negotiation and ultimately licensing. The three biggest names in gen AI music are at different stages along this trajectory. Klay got deals with all three majors before launching or training its technology on music, making it a rarity in this “Launch first, license later” world. Udio signed deals with Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Music Group (WMG). Suno, however, only has a deal with WMG, and legal action from the other majors is still live.\n\nShulman, now 39, was a hobbyist musician, which provided a catalyst for Suno. “I played in a lot of bands in high school and college,” he says, speaking by video from his home in the US, pointing to the bass hanging on the wall behind him. “I was OK, not great, and I was not going to be able to make a great career out of it.” He’s cautious and thoughtful when speaking, without the tang of arrogance you sometimes get from heavily hyped start-up founders.\n\nA career swerve into a physics PhD led him to Suno’s other co-founders. They wanted to build something different to heavyweight AI companies such as OpenAI, as those deal with “reasoning and automation to solve very specific problems. Music isn’t like that. There’s not a right or a wrong answer. It’s not a problem to solve.”\n\nThere remains debate about where exactly Suno sourced the music to train its systems – essentially breaking music into data strands for cataloguing – before its licensing deals were in place. “We train our models on medium- and high-quality music we can find on the open internet,” wrote Shulman in a 2024 blogpost. Suno’s initial legal defence was that this constituted fair use, and the music it drew on did not require prior permission. The record industry thought differently. “Fair use,” countered the RIAA, does not apply “when the output seeks to ‘substitute’ for the work copied.”\n\nI ask Shulman what he means by the “open internet”. There is a clear distinction between what is copyrighted (recordings are typically protected for 70 years) and what is in the public domain. “Copyright is a different thing,” he says. “I can’t get into too many specifics because there is active legal stuff going on, and also some of it is trade secrets.”\n\nCould Suno’s philosophy of “democratising” music-making be inherently anti-art? What once sprang from extraordinary human creativity now becomes ordinary. Shulman insists that, as with digital recording or sampling, this is just another example of how technology “pushes music forward”, how “new people get discovered” and “new genres get invented”.\n\nThe issue of so-called AI slop is wholly subjective, he says. “I made a really funny song with my four-year-old yesterday morning. That is ‘slop’ to you – you don’t care about it – but I love it. It’s fantastic.” He is keen to stress, meanwhile, that music generated by Suno can be extremely high quality.\n\nAnd AI-powered music is flooding streaming services: Deezer says more than a third of music delivered to it each day is AI (equal to 50,000 tracks), and 70% of streams of AI music on Deezer are fraudulent (scammers get cheaply made AI tracks on to such services, then use bots to manipulate streams at scale in order to get royalty payments, although services are increasingly wise to this). The company has started tagging AI tracks to alert users. Bandcamp recently announced that it won’t platform music “generated wholly or in substantial part by AI”.\n\nShould others follow? Shulman will say only that he doesn’t want to be “the arbiter of what happens on other platforms. There’s maybe some line to draw, but I don’t know where.”\n\nVelvet Sundown, a wholly AI “act”, released their debut album and a follow-up last summer. The 70s-styled rock band generated millions of streams, but it was a short-lived phenomenon. “I don’t know exactly what their strategy was,” Shulman says of Velvet Sundown. “It was all a bit of a goof. I think that’s why it was a flash in the pan.”\n\nSome AI-powered tracks have staying power, though. Following allegations it used Suno to clone Jorja Smith’s voice, I Run, by Haven, was excluded from the UK charts, but a version re-recorded by Kaitlin Aragon, a human singer, was chart-eligible and went Top 10. Into the Blue by Sienna Rose, who is widely suspected to be an AI act, recently made the Top 10 on Spotify’s Viral 50 Global chart. And the track Jag Vet, Du Är Inte Min is one of the biggest of the year so far in Sweden, although it has been booted out of the country’s charts for being “mainly AI-generated”.\n\nMore concerning was Suno being used last year to create tracks that the Anti-Defamation League said glorified Adolf Hitler, deployed racist slurs and talked of “white power”. Shulman says: “It was three songs that had a combined 10 plays. It was a very small thing. Unfortunately, drawing attention to it made it worse.” He says Suno has developed more rigorous safeguards to stop similar things happening in the future.\n\nSuno is keen for its deal with WMG to be seen as proof that gen AI companies can partner in mutually beneficial ways. Did the $1.5bn (£1.1bn) that AI company Anthropic paid to the book industry in September to settle claims its AI was trained on pirated copies spook Suno to get deals done swiftly? “We didn’t pay all that much attention to that,” says Shulman. “There’s a lot more to do together than fighting one another. And we intend, with this Warner partnership, to show that very strongly.”\n\nBut questions do persist about the WMG deal. Did the label insist on changes to the service? Were payments made to cover past use of its music in Suno’s training? Did WMG get equity in Suno? Shulman won’t reply, saying only that it is “a little early” to share such information, possibly fearful of compromising pending licensing deals.\n\nAgreements with the majors are one thing, but wooing artists is another. The majors insist they will only have their music used if they opt into deals. But if only a tiny percentage do – never mind their name, image and likeness rights – this will surely compromise results.\n\nIn his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularised “the 10,000-hour rule”, suggesting that this is the amount of practise time an artist needs to achieve any sort of mastery. Will the likes of Suno change this? “I think people will [still] have to spend 10,000 hours,” says Shulman. “They may be doing different things and practising different skills, but they will certainly need to spend 10,000 hours to make the best music in the world.”\n\nAs part of its charm offensive, Suno signed up US producer Timbaland as a strategic advisor, but he had to make a public apology after he took a track by producer K Fresh without permission and, Fresh alleged, “uploaded it into Suno’s AI platform, and released an unauthorised AI remix”.\n\nNevertheless, Shulman says the musicians he talks to about Suno see it as an important new creative tool and songwriting aid. He had previously told the 20VC podcast: “I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.” This does not mean musicians hate the creative process in toto, but they are appreciative of tools that can remove at least some of the grunt work.\n\nThey just see it as a dirty secret, he suggests now. “When you get people one-on-one, they’re just more comfortable admitting it. It was described to me that we’re the Ozempic of the music industry – everybody is on it and nobody wants to talk about it.”\n\nThe fear, of course, is that by putting music on Ozempic, it wastes away to nothing.",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood is making another bold call on the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nIn a 2026 outlook letter published on Jan. 15, the ARK Invest founder and CEO says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying U.S. economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" she said.\n\nWood said post-Covid high interest rates squeezed the economy, hitting housing, manufacturing, and non-AI investment. But she is optimistic that easing rates and rising productivity could release growth potential.\n\nWood wrote in a post on X (the former Twitter) that the next three years could look like “Reaganomics on steroids,” which she believes could lead to “another golden age” for the U.S. stock market.\n\n\"Early in my career, I remember how deregulation, tax cuts, sound monetary policy, and peace through strength sent the dollar soaring, which put a lid on the gold price,\" she explained.\n\nIn the Reagan era, a mix of those forces helped the market enter a long bull that ran through much of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"The Trump Administration’s policies are echoing the early days of Reaganomics in the 1980s, when the dollar nearly doubled,\" Wood said.\n\nWood focuses on emerging high-tech companies in areas including artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.\n\nShe gained a reputation after the Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. In 2025, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP): 5.29%\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD): 4.06%\n\nBeam Therapeutics (BEAM): 3.79%\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR): 3.57%\n\nWood’s style brings sweet wins in rising markets but also painful losses in bearish ones, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term results. As of Jan. 16, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -10.31%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 14.66% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.",

    "fullText": "A new kind of MAGA hat is gaining popularity online.\n\nSeveral sellers are now offering red hats printed with all-caps white lettering that says \"Make America Go Away.\"\n\nDesigned to parody the trademark headwear of the Make America Great Again political movement, the protest comes as President Donald Trump ramps up threats to seize the territory.\n\nThe founder of one group selling the hats, Victor Schøtt of Greenland Support, told Business Insider the design is more about rejecting Trump's particular style of foreign relations and less about a dislike for America itself.\n\n\"The Donald Trump America needs to stay away — the part that's trying to take over Greenland,\" Schøtt said.\n\nTrump ramped up his campaign for the Danish territory over the weekend with threats of 25% tariffs and a message to Norway's prime minister — a key Nordic and Arctic ally — warning that \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.\"\n\nSchøtt said he launched his site about a month ago, and sales have grown to a few hundred hats per week, with the US taking the largest share.\n\n\"The United States is first with around 50 orders the last couple of days, then we have Denmark with 45, and then we have Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden at around 20 each,\" he said of the MAGA designs.\n\nThe site also sells a design that says \"Nu det NUUK,\" a pun that roughly translates from Danish as \"That's enough\" using the name of Greenland's capital, Nuuk. Both designs were reportedly seen Saturday on the heads of protesters in Nuuk and Copenhagen.\n\nAll profits go to support a Greenlandic children's charity, Schøtt said.\n\nOther riffs on the original MAGA phrasing have also cropped up in the first year of Trump's second term, with hats saying \"Make America Gay Again,\" \"Make NATO Great Again,\" and \"Make America Normal Again\" available from various shops online.",

    "title": "I went from fine dining to owning a fast-casual chain. Here are 4 misconceptions about the restaurant business.",
    "description": "Hady Kfoury, founder of Naya, said working in fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants made him realize some common misconceptions about the business.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Hady Kfoury, the founder of Naya, a fast-casual Lebanese-inspired food chain with more than 40 locations on the East Coast. Naya plans to have 200 locations nationwide by 2030. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI studied hospitality in Switzerland and then came to New York to work under celebrity chefs, Daniel Boulud and François Payard, so I had experience in fine dining. When I decided to open the first Naya in 2008, that was more or less my comfort zone.\n\nA week after we launched, we got an amazing article in the New York Times and then we were packed for lunch and dinner. It definitely helped prevent us from shutting down after a few months.\n\nA couple of years in, we realized the food worked incredibly well in a faster and more accessible format. If you go to a Lebanese restaurant, you have all these mezze in the middle of the table, like a plate with a variety of dips and vegetables, and you're putting scoops on your plate. That's how we eat usually. So that's why I shifted my focus into a fast-casual model.\n\nToday, we have 44 restaurants and we are riding the wave of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine in general. It's definitely become mainstream, which is totally different than almost 20 years ago when I started the business.\n\nAs we scale, I've found there are four major misconceptions about the restaurant business.\n\nA lot of people think fast-casual restaurants are easy. It is not easy. Serving more guests at a faster pace doesn't mean it's a simple effort; it means you should master your systems and consistency at scale, possibly even more rigor than in fine dining.\n\nThe biggest challenge we have is that you're on an assembly line. You're not cooking per order. It's a problem for any restaurant with a service line. How do you plan to rotate food in a certain way, and to cook it a certain amount, so the food remains fresh and not overcooked?\n\nMy R&D doesn't stop. It keeps me up at night thinking about how we can keep improving what we do. And any change you make to improve something, you're rolling it out at 44 restaurants, so you have to be very mindful and careful.\n\nGrowing only works when the business fundamentals — training, supply chain, quality control — are built to handle it repeatedly. Growing without readiness is chaotic.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2020, I grew Naya to seven restaurants without any partners because all I cared about was being profitable and having a great team in place. Growth only works when you have those fundamentals. In 2020, I partnered with a private-equity firm, which was initially scary, but the rules were clear from day one that we would prioritize those fundamentals.\n\nSome people think cutting corners gets you a more profitable bottom line, but that is not the case. Cutting costs often undermines guest trust. You lose the customer trust, and the brands that endure are the ones that deliver authenticity, quality, and transparency every time.\n\nWe're trying to be very affordable, and we fall somewhere in the middle of the category, but I will never drop quality. I recently partnered with Pat LaFrieda, one of the best high-end butchers in the tristate. Even with our vegetables, we try to get deliveries three to four times per week rather than two times where you could get cheaper products.\n\nPeople think that it's all about the food, but people matter so much too. What keeps guests coming back and what keeps your team thriving is a culture of service, training, and retention.\n\nI take extremely good care of my team. Most of our general managers are grown within the company and we have very low staff turnover.\n\nGreat food is really important, but there's a people component to it that you can't avoid.",

    "description": "Tech News News: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims .",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott's ex-wife, Jeff Bezos, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties. While Scott's donations are unrestricted, the network supports organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. Scott has given billions to various causes, impacting diversity programs and higher education. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said, “Nizar’s statements constitute direct incitement of violence against U.S. national security interests by advocating for actions against the men and women who build the F-35 and seeking to imperil the delivery of one of the nation’s most strategic assets.”Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.What the Solidaire Network said about MacKenzie Scott’s donationsIt's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.\"Funding social movements while transforming our own relationship to wealth is clearly the way to go for philanthropy. MacKenzie's generous, no-strings-attached gift honours our bold ambitions for our collective work,” the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support the “movement for a permanent ceasefire and against Islamophobia and antisemitism.” SJP and AMP mainly focus on \"Palestinian freedom\" and firm opposition to Israel.“We need more philanthropic partners to show up during these flashpoints, and we also need their longer-term support to grow and sustain our work beyond this crisis moment. We are only able to do this work because of the multi-year funding we have received through committed partners like Solidaire Network,” Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change. For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at an “opportune time” as the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote, “Generosity and kindness engage the same pleasure centres in the brain as sex, food, and receiving gifts, and they improve our health and long-term happiness as well. The peace-fostering byproducts of one unexpected act of kindness toward a stranger of a different background or beliefs might inspire a beneficial chain reaction that goes on for years.”Sotheby's International Realty said Scott has donated an estimated $14 billion to causes, including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, strengthening functional democracy, and climate action. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Sotheby's list adds that Scott's gifts support nonprofit groups working against racial injustice, advancing gender equality, and backing public health programs.",

    "description": "Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said Meta's VR cuts targeted subsidized game studios that were crowding out developers and distorting the industry.",
    "fullText": "Meta's decision to cut more than a thousand jobs in Reality Labs and wind down parts of its metaverse strategy has reignited fears that the company is quietly backing away from virtual reality.\n\nOculus founder Palmer Luckey says that interpretation is wrong — and misses a deeper problem the cuts may actually solve.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Monday, Luckey said that Meta's Reality Labs layoffs, which The New York Times reported were roughly 10% to 15% of the division's 15,000 employees, do not signal retreat.\n\nMeta still employs the largest VR workforce in the world, he said, dwarfing competitors \"by about an order of magnitude.\"\n\nFrom a numbers perspective, Luckey framed the layoffs as \"six months of normal churn concentrated into 60 days,\" not an existential blow.\n\nThe more consequential shift, he said, lies in where the cuts landed.\n\nAccording to Luckey, most of the eliminated roles were tied to first-party content — Meta-owned studios building internally developed VR games.\n\nThose teams, he said, had become a growing problem for the broader VR ecosystem.\n\n\"Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense,\" Luckey wrote. \"Crowding out the rest of the entire ecosystem, even less so.\"\n\nLuckey said third-party developers — even efficient, well-run studios — struggled to compete against Meta-owned teams backed by budgets that far exceeded what the market could realistically return.\n\nThe irony, he added, was that strong reviews and polished execution only worsened the imbalance by pulling attention and sales away from independent creators.\n\n\"People will point out that these teams did an awesome job and got awesome reviews from critics and customers alike — yes, and fucked up though it is, that makes the problem even worse!\" he wrote.\n\nIn a capital-constrained environment, Luckey said, Meta's resources are better spent on core technology and platform stability than on competing directly with developers it needs to keep VR viable.\n\nHe also framed the move as a return to Oculus's original philosophy. Internally, he said, the company aimed \"to NOT be Nintendo\" — avoiding a closed, first-party-dominated model in favor of building an ecosystem that others could profit from.\n\nLuckey acknowledged the human cost of layoffs and said he felt \"really bad for the people impacted.\"\n\nStill, he said that scaling back first-party content is ultimately \"a good thing for the long-term health of the industry,\" even if it's uncomfortable in the short term.",

    "fullText": "A website dedicated to leaking personal information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents was reportedly subject to a cyberattack that its founder believes may have originated in Russia.\n\nDominick Skinner, a Netherlands-based immigration activist, told The Daily Beast that his website, ICE List, came under cyberattack Tuesday evening after the publication reported Skinner planned to release personal information, obtained through a whistleblower, about thousands of employees.\n\nThe attack, known as a Direct Denial of Service, is when a perpetrator seeks to disrupt access to a network or service by flooding it with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload the system.\n\nSkinner told The Daily Beast that a massive number of IPs began accessing the website, and a large amount of the traffic appeared to come from Russia – leading the founder to speculate the attack originated there.\n\n“The IPs would be run through proxies before hitting our servers, meaning it’s just impossible to track the source,” Skinner told the publication. “An attack lasting this long is sophisticated, though.”\n\nThe attack, Skinner said, occurred as he prepared to publicly identify the names of immigration law enforcement officers that were obtained in a dataset from the whistleblower.\n\nThe ICE List founder had previously told The Daily Beast that a Department of Homeland Security whistleblower provided a dataset of approximately 4,500 immigration personnel after the shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nSome of the information in the dataset included names, email addresses, phone numbers, job titles, and other background information. Skinner said he planned to make a “majority” of the names public but would provide exceptions for those working in childcare or serving as nurses.\n\nDHS has criticized Skinner’s website calling it “disgusting doxxing of our officers” that puts “their lives and their families in serious danger.”\n\nHomeland Security Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has said law enforcement are facing a 1,300 percent increase in assaults and an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against them.\n\n“Their families are being threatened. We will not back down. Anyone who doxxes our officers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” McLaughlin has warned.\n\nICE List is hosted in the Netherlands, so it cannot be taken down by the U.S. government.\n\nSkinner said whoever is attacking the website “doesn’t want others to access the site.”\n\n“But it just makes us more determined, because it is clear some people out there do not want the names of ICE and Border Patrol agents made public,” Skinner told The Daily Beast. “Given their behavior lately, and how they are increasingly viewed negatively by the public, that’s no surprise.”\n\nThe ICE List founder said he and his team have Direct Denial of Service protections in place, but that attacks of this kind are difficult to prevent and likely to happen again.",

    "fullText": "The most intimate relationship of an entrepreneur's life may not be with a spouse or a best friend, but with their cofounder. When it works, a thunderbolt idea can become a unicorn. When it doesn't, conflict can sink the ship just as quickly as it took off.\n\nThough confounder conflict isn't particularly new to Silicon Valley, the pressure to launch a successful AI startup, especially among young founders in San Francisco, is only mounting. The pace of dealmaking and technological advancements makes it all the more important to address internal fractures.\n\nAnd it's a new year, and that's always cause for some well-meaning reflection — and perhaps an influx of founders interested in couples, err, cofounder therapy.\n\nYariv Ganor, a therapist based in Israel, has been counseling startup founders for the past six years. Ganor, who is trained as both a clinical and industrial psychologist, knows a thing or two about startup life. He used to work in marketing at various Israeli startups.\n\nSome research suggests that Ganor is onto something. Nearly seven in ten founders in a 2025 study said that their \"always on\" mentality was foundational to their success, while over 70% of participants in a 2018 study on psychiatric conditions among entrepreneurs reported experiencing higher rates of depression, ADHD, and other mental health conditions compared to non-entrepreneurs.\n\nGanor sees the consequences of that strain play out in real time, especially as startups scale, funding multiples, expectations mount, and stress compounds. After years of working with founders, Ganor told Business Insider his three pieces of advice he repeatedly gives cofounders:\n\nFor many founders, the line between who they are and what they do blurs fast, Ganor said. \"Being a founder is a question of identity: It's a personal identity, not just a job,\" he added. \"Sometimes they get so wrapped up in their titles that they forget parts of themselves.\"\n\nWhen work life crowds out everything else — personal relationships, hobbies, and more — Ganor said it becomes difficult for founders to maintain a sense of self outside the company.\n\nFounders are, Ganor thinks, trained to problem solve, execute, and optimize, often at the expense of reflection, which may have downstream effects on leadership, decision-making, and cofounder relationships.\n\nThat's why a core part of Ganor's work is helping founders create diffusion between work and play. Ganor requires that founders take their meetings with him outside of the office and offers them tools for compartmentalizing their career and personal stressors.\n\nFounders ride or die by their runway, or how much cash they have left in the bank. What they don't track nearly as closely as they should, Ganor said, is their own capacity to keep going.\n\nIn his experience, many founders believe they have unlimited mental stamina and can always push through those \"996\" work weeks, a demanding schedule — and an ascendant trend in Silicon Valley — that encourages founders and employees to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\n\nInstead, Ganor wants founders to think about their mental health in the same way they think about their financial stakes in their companies: \"Don't dilute your mental equity,\" he said. \"You need to be very knowledgeable of your mental runway — once the startup starts, your runway gets shorter and shorter.\"\n\nPreserving that runway, Ganor thinks, starts with recognizing your responsibilities — to team members, clients, investors, and others — and how quickly they might multiply as the startup scales.\n\nIt's no secret that few founder stories end in rollicking success. Ganor implores his clients to never frame the pivots or even closures as failures.\n\nSometimes, he said, success can even look like preventing an unideal ending from becoming worse, adding that he once helped cofounders who were unwinding their startup finalize their business dealings with minimal conflict.\n\nGanor is currently studying the relationship between founders and investors, especially how they both think about company pivots. One of his findings: Most rejection isn't personal.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) called out his Republican colleagues during a House subcommittee hearing on the Capitol pipe bomber case on Wednesday for reserving a seat in the room for the head of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States.\n\nMoskowitz used some of his time to rib his GOP colleagues for denying the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol was a violent “insurrection” while pointing out Rhodes.\n\n“By the way, the head of the Oath Keepers is here with us in the audience. Stewart Rhodes is here today. It’s not every day, of course—not every day, of course—you get to meet someone who was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States. Hasn’t happened in 30 years,” Moskowitz said, adding:\n\nOf course, sitting in the front row in the reserved section, which is controlled by my colleagues across the aisle. Not sure why he’s here. I don’t know if he’s here to tell us about the Oath Keepers’ secret handshake or what treehouse they meet in or whether girls are allowed in. I’ve always wondered that about the Oath Keepers.\n\nBut yeah, he’s here. I mean, I don’t know—do you have any questions, my colleagues across the aisle, for the head of the Oath Keepers that’s sitting in the reserved section of this hearing? I mean, he wasn’t pardoned; he’s still convicted of seditious conspiracy. Something you guys say didn’t happen, right? There wasn’t an insurrection. I don’t know how you get convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nRhodes was convicted by a jury and sentenced to 18 years in prison for his actions surrounding the Jan. 6 attack, but his sentence was later commuted by President Donald Trump, and he was released from prison. Rhodes was initially restricted from being in DC or inside the U.S. Capitol, a restriction that was also later lifted. Rhodes relaunched the Oath Keepers militia in November of 2025.\n\nThe post House Democrat Calls Out GOP Colleagues for Giving the Founder of the Oath Keepers a Reserved Seat at Hearing first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Some successful entrepreneurs sitting atop billion-dollar businesses say they may look rich on paper, but take a peek into their bank accounts, and they’re actually cash poor. Social media mogul Jimmy Donaldson, known to his 460 million YouTube followers as MrBeast, claims he’s just as broke as everyone else despite running a $5 billion entertainment empire.\n\n“I’m borrowing money. That’s how little money I have,” Donaldson told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning.”\n\nThe 27-year-old entrepreneur has said that he keeps less than $1 million for himself, despite being a billionaire and owning more than half of his $5 billion company Beast Industries. Aside from his nine-figure Amazon deal and popular YouTube channel with 107 billion lifetime views, Donaldson hit the ultra-rich club—at least on paper—from a slew of successful businesses. He’s launched ventures including multimillion-dollar chocolate brand Feastables; Lunchly, a Lunchables-esque packaged food product; MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant that only allows for pickup and drop-off; and production company MrBeast LLC, which helps manufacture his viral videos.\n\nThrough his assets, Donaldson is projected to be worth at least $2.6 billion—although he emphasized it’s not a fat wad of cash burning a hole in his pocket. Forbes has also estimated that his annual earnings reached $85 million between April 2024 and April 2025, a far cry from the typical American salary of $62,088 a year. However, that doesn’t mean he’s splurging on luxuries and only flying private. Donaldson claimed he’s actually in the red.\n\n“It’s funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,” Donaldson explained. “They’re like, ‘You’re a billionaire!’ I’m like, ‘That’s net worth.’ I have negative money right now.”\n\n“I wake up, I just work…I’m just so busy working I don’t really think about my personal bank account,” Donaldson continued. “I’m just laser-focused on making the greatest videos as possible, and building the business as big as possible.”\n\nDonaldson rakes in eight-figure earnings and runs a $5 billion business, yet still claims to be broke. So where is all of his money going? Right back into his business ventures, the YouTube star says.\n\n“I personally have very little money because I reinvest everything (I think this year we’ll spend around a quarter of a billion on content). Ironically I’m actually borrowing $ from my mom to pay for my upcoming wedding,” Donaldson wrote on X in response to a post heralding him as the only billionaire under 30 who didn’t inherit their wealth.",

    "description": "Walmart's entry into groceries, and supermarkets' reaction, sent some shoppers to Whole Foods, co-founder John Mackey said.",
    "fullText": "Early in its history, Whole Foods got some indirect help from an unlikely \n\nJohn Mackey, who cofounded Whole Foods in 1980, told podcast host David Senra in an episode released last week that Walmart's move into groceries in the late '80s helped the grocery chain find a wider audience.\n\nIn its early years, Whole Foods served a niche market of health-conscious shoppers. Its clientele was mostly \"a bunch of hippies selling food to other hippies,\" Mackey said, describing one venture capitalist's summation of the store.\n\nIn 1988, however, Walmart made a move that would send ripples through the US grocery industry: It opened its first Supercenter, which sold both the general merchandise that Walmart was known for at the time, as well as groceries, a category that put it in competition with traditional supermarkets for the first time.\n\nWalmart's focus on low prices sent many grocery chains scrambling to cut their own prices — and shed costs accordingly, Mackey told Senra during the episode.\n\nThe cuts came in multiple areas, he said. He saw grocers reduce spending on stores, making them resemble warehouses and illuminating them with harsh lighting. Many also \"cut their labor to the bone,\" which meant that customer service got worse, he said.\n\n\"All they wanted to do was figure out how to compete with Walmart,\" Mackey said.\n\nWhole Foods used a different strategy, he said. The chain played up its selection of health-focused products and customer service as an advantage, even if its prices weren't as low as Walmart. Whole Foods employees at the time would take customers' purchases to their cars, for example, he said.\n\nAll that helped the grocery chain appeal to upper-middle-class shoppers, especially women, who were looking for a better shopping experience than what they were increasingly finding at America's cost-conscious supermarkets, Mackey said.\n\nIt didn't matter that many of Whole Foods' products were foreign to these high-income shoppers or that many Whole Foods employees had tattoos or piercings, Mackey said.\n\n\"They wanted to come into a store that was pretty, that was beautiful, with people that gave them good service,\" he said.\n\nAttracting those shoppers allowed Whole Foods to grow its sales, Mackey said. \"We were not just in our own little Hippieville any longer, \" he said.\n\nOver the next couple of decades, Whole Foods opened new stores outside its home state of Texas and became a national grocery chain, largely ignored by many of its rivals, Mackey said. And while the chain earned the nickname \"Whole Paycheck\" for its high prices, it also became known for the affluent, liberal-leaning customers who frequented its stores.\n\n\"Walmart was this giant distraction, and we were running down the field wide open for the touchdown pass,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017, Amazon acquired the chain and has since cut prices on many items at Whole Foods as well as brought its Prime subscribers, many of whom are also middle-class shoppers willing to spend a little more on food, into the stores. Mackey, who served as CEO of Whole Foods from its founding, left the company in 2022.\n\nWhile Whole Foods found its niche in the grocery industry, it still remains a relatively small player in terms of market share. The chain commanded just under 2% of sales in March 2025, according to research firm Numerator. Walmart, meanwhile, took over one-fifth of sales in the US.",

This season, they expanded to 8 teams with the addition of Breeze and Hive, but eliminated the back-to-backs as well. Instead, they are now playing 4 nights a week to accommodate the new teams. It’s a decision Stewart thinks plays a vital role in player welfare.\n\n“Just the ability to know that you’re able to compete, give your all, and you have a day in between your next game is incredibly important because back-to-backs are tough, and we have more than one of them throughout the season,” She said. “It wears on your body, and here we’re able to have a good flow just from a week standpoint, where you get your work in individually, get your work in as a team, and then you go play.”\n\nBack-to-back games have been a contentious point in basketball for years now. That is not limited to the WNBA, NBA, or even the international leagues, where the players have to endure tough schedules. If these players had to go outside the US, as they used to before Unrivaled, they would face the wrath of back-to-back games. On returning, they would be thrown in the condensed WNBA, which already had an adverse impact last year.\n\nWhen the WNBA upped the schedule to 44 games, it kept the season length the same as earlier. That naturally increased the density of games. To make matters worse, the scheduling was disoriented. Some teams played 2 or 3 back-to-backs, but the Seattle Storm did not play any. The more sticking point, however, most teams like the Chicago Sky, Storm, Mercury, and others played 20+ games with just a day of rest. Keep in mind, these are 5 v 5 games at arguably higher intensity than Unrivaled. It led to a season record of 252 injuries, up from 204 in 2024 (per the IX).\n\nThere were notable injuries in the 2025 Unrivaled as well. For example, Betnijah Laney-Hamilton had a knee injury she sustained as a relief player in Unrivaled and missed the majority of the WNBA season. Removing back-to-backs is an important step in solving that problem. NBA studies suggest that playing back-to-backs can increase injury probability.\n\nThe urgent nature of the decision also indicates that the league is committed to working to give the best environment for the players. Breanna Stewart and Co. are trying to do the same with the upcoming CBA. However, they could be making it worse before making it better.\n\nThe 2026 WNBA season is now in serious danger of being delayed. The deadline of January 9 passed without any extension as both sides entered a status quo. “We’re just going to continue to negotiate in good faith,” Breanna Stewart said. Now, the free agency has been frozen by a moratorium agreement.\n\n“The moratorium will apply specifically to free agency, sources told FOS, including the sending out of qualifying offers, core designations, signings, and all negotiations,” Annie Costabile wrote. “An email was sent to front office executives on Monday evening explaining the terms of the moratorium, league sources told FOS. The free-agency pause will end once a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified.”\n\nFree agency extension is effective until they agree to a new CBA. Based on the current signs, that will likely take some time. Even after the CBA is agreed upon, this is not a normal free agency. Most of the league (around 80%) is currently without a team in anticipation of the new ‘transformational’ CBA.\n\nThere will be a record number of deals signed and immense movement in the market. Everything of which will take some time. So, the league can’t assign a very limited period to get it over with. Then the WNBA has the 2025 Rookie draft and the expansion draft with two teams to complete. There could be a delay in starting the 2026 WNBA season, which would normally begin in mid-May.\n\nYou can’t extend beyond November because of the NBA and the rest of the American Sports seasons beginning. Many WNBA teams share facilities with them, and the league risks losing broadcasting slots as well. All in all, the league has an astronomical task to plan a normal regular season.\n\nThe post Co-Founder Breanna Stewart Pinpoints Key Unrivaled Advantage Players Rarely Get Elsewhere appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Sergey Brin is joining his Google co-founder, Larry Page, in reducing ties to the state where they built their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "For nearly three decades, Google has been steeped in the lore of Silicon Valley.\n\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford University graduate students, created the search engine in 1998 and built the start-up out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, Calif. Over time, Google became a nearly $4 trillion juggernaut, helping to cement the Northern California region as the global epicenter of the internet industry.\n\nNow, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page are cutting some ties with the state where they made their fortunes.\n\nIn the 10 days before Christmas, an entity connected to Mr. Brin, 52, terminated or moved 15 California limited liability companies that oversee some of his business interests and investments out of the state, according to documents seen by The New York Times. Seven of the companies — including those that appear to manage one of Mr. Brin’s superyachts and his interest in a private air terminal at San Jose’s international airport — were converted into Nevada entities.\n\nMr. Brin is joining Mr. Page, 52, in reducing his California presence. More than 45 California limited liability companies associated with Mr. Page filed documents last month to either become inactive or move out of the state, according to state records. A trust with ties to Mr. Page also purchased a $71.9 million mansion in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood this week, according to a deed seen by The Times.\n\nAnother entity jointly managed by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page moved out of California and to Nevada on Christmas Eve, according to a filing seen by The Times.\n\nThe Google founders’ shrinking connections to California underscore the impact of a potential ballot measure that would affect the state’s wealthiest residents. Proposed by a health care union, the measure calls for Californians worth more than $1 billion to pay a one-time tax that would be equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. If the measure gains enough signatures to reach the state ballot in November and wins approval, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of Jan. 1 and they would have five years to pay it.\n\nThe potential wealth tax has already caused some California billionaires to establish more ties outside the state. Last month, the venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment firm in Miami. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House adviser on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBut the actions of Mr. Brin and Mr. Page stand out because of their wealth — their combined net worths total more than $518 billion, as estimated by Forbes — and how closely identified they are with California. While both stepped down from day-to-day management of Google and its parent, Alphabet, in 2019, they remain on the board of the company and Mr. Brin has recently become more active in Google’s A.I. efforts.\n\nMr. Brin and Mr. Page still have connections to California, including homes across the state. It’s unclear how much time they will be spending in the state this year.\n\nA representative for Mr. Brin declined to comment. Google and representatives for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on Mr. Page’s Miami home purchase and Business Insider reported on some details of the shifting of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin’s companies.\n\nThe ballot initiative, which was proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system, has elicited a broad spectrum of reactions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has called the measure bad policy, arguing that it will lead billionaires to simply move to tax-friendlier states. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has defended the initiative, drawing criticism from tech investors and entrepreneurs who are discussing funding a challenger to his seat.\n\nOthers have said the proposed tax could drive entrepreneurs and investors out of California, which could then stifle innovation. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and a Silicon Valley resident, said the measure was a “horrendous idea” that might force founders and executives to sell shares in companies that they run simply to fulfill the tax obligation.\n\n“Poorly designed taxes incentivize avoidance, capital flight, and distortions that ultimately raise less revenue,” Mr. Hoffman posted on social media on Wednesday. Mr. Hoffman’s spokeswoman said he was not available for comment.\n\nJensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia and one of California’s wealthiest men, was among the few billionaires who publicly said they accepted the wealth tax. “We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, adding that he was “perfectly fine” with it.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement, Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff at Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, said an exodus of billionaires from California was overblown.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of billionaires have chosen to stay in California past the Jan. 1 deadline,” she said. “Only a very small percentage left before the deadline, despite weeks of Chicken Little talking points claiming a modest tax would trigger a mass departure.”\n\nKirsten Noyes and Georgia Gee contributed research.",

    "description": "Sam Bail, the founder of Bright Nights Social, told Business Insider that demand is booming for her alcohol-free nightlife events in New York.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Bail, a data engineer and the founder of the alcohol-free pop-up event company, Bright Nights Social. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThree years ago, I had the idea to open an alcohol-free bar in New York City.\n\nI don't drink, but I still wanted nightlife — dancing, music, meeting new people, getting out of the house on a Friday or Saturday night. What I didn't want was another alcohol-free space that was centered on wellness, meditation, or yoga. I wanted something that still felt like real nightlife, just without booze being the main event.\n\nInstead of signing a lease, I started testing the idea by hosting pop-up events. I'd take over coffee shops or other venues at night and turn them into alcohol-free bars for the evening.\n\nWhat started as an experiment quickly took on a life of its own.\n\nOver the past three years, I've collaborated with tons of venues, experimented with a variety of new formats, and thousands of people have come through our doors. That's been the most surprising part of all of this: the demand.\n\nWhat's even more interesting? Most of the people who attend my events aren't even sober.\n\nWhen people hear \"alcohol-free event,\" they often assume the crowd is made up entirely of sober or sober-curious people. That hasn't been my experience at all. Based on conversations with guests, I estimate that at least 75% of the people who attend my events don't identify as sober or even sober-curious.\n\nThey're mostly in their mid-20s to early 30s — older Gen Z and very young millennials. Gender splits depend on the event, but many of my parties are close to 50-50 men and women. What they have in common is that they want to go out, socialize, and have fun without making drinking the center of their entire social life.\n\nI'm 40, so I'm an elder millennial who's already done the heavy partying phase and is over it. But many of the people who come to Bright Nights Social are younger than me and feel the same way. They'll tell me things like, \"I still drink sometimes, I just don't want to do it every time I go out,\" or \"Alcohol makes me feel terrible the next day.\"\n\nThey're not abstaining out of moral opposition to alcohol or because of addiction. They're opting out because they don't like the cost, the hangovers, or the way drinking dominates social life in cities like New York.\n\nWhat I see aligns with a broader shift happening right now, especially among younger people. There's a growing focus on experiences rather than just going to a bar and spending money on drinks. In New York City, you can see it everywhere: pottery classes, cooking classes, rug tufting, late-night library events, group reading clubs.\n\nSome of my favorites have been hosting cooking classes and our crafting events, like rug-making. Coming up this month, we have a tea bar, a bagel-making (and eating!) class, and a full-on dance party, complete with DJs and a full non-alcoholic bar, to close out Dry January.\n\nPeople want to do something. They want to make memories. They just don't want to wake up feeling awful the next day.\n\nCost is also a big factor. When cocktails are $15 or $20 each, it doesn't take long for a casual night out to become extremely expensive. A lot of people tell me they'd rather spend their money on an experience than on alcohol that doesn't even make them feel good.\n\nThat doesn't mean Gen Z isn't drinking at all. In fact, some recent data suggests younger people are actually drinking more now than they were a year or two ago. I think part of that is a post-pandemic catch-up effect — many Gen Zers reached legal drinking age during lockdowns and simply didn't have the chance to go out.\n\nWhat I see on the ground is moderation. People might have one drink at dinner and then switch to a nonalcoholic beer. Or they'll alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks throughout the night — what some people call \"zebra striping.\" They're being much more intentional about how and when they drink.\n\nAnother huge shift I'm seeing is the role of legal THC. I don't serve THC products at my events, but I don't stop anyone from having one before they come, and I hear about them constantly from guests and friends who work at nonalcoholic bottle shops. THC drinks are some of the best-selling products in those stores.\n\nPeople understand what THC does. They say it helps with social anxiety, takes the edge off, and feels more manageable than alcohol when used in moderation. Compared to that, there's still skepticism around functional or adaptogenic drinks — things with nootropics, ashwagandha, or functional mushrooms. Many people aren't convinced that those drinks actually do anything beyond being a placebo.\n\nThat said, I think we're still early. As people learn what works for their own bodies — whether that's L-theanine, lion's mane, or something else — those functional beverages may gain more traction.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also seeing conversations online about people pulling back from THC after overdoing it, so I think we'll see a similar trend as people try to find nightlife events that best suit their needs.\n\nI don't think most people want to be completely sober forever, but they are actively experimenting with what moderation looks like.\n\nThe biggest misconception about alcohol-free nightlife is that it's boring or restrictive. What I've learned is that people don't want to be told what not to do — they just want more options.\n\nBright Nights Social isn't about sobriety as an identity. It's about creating a space where alcohol isn't the default. You can still dance, flirt, meet strangers, and stay out late. The only difference is that you're not expected to drink to participate.\n\nThe fact that so many non-sober people show up tells me this isn't a niche idea anymore. Alcohol-free nightlife isn't just for people who've quit drinking entirely. It's for anyone who wants to go out — and wake up the next day feeling like themselves.\n\nDo you host or attend alternative nightlife events? Contact this reporter at ktl@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "on January 9, 2026 at 9:45AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nHytale is a sandbox-meets-RPG that has seen its fair share of development woes. Formed by Hypixel developers, who run one of the most successful Minecraft servers of all time, Hytale formerly had funding from Riot Games who then went on to purchase the studio outright in 2020. Riot canceled Hytale in June 2025, but its original founder repurchased the game in mid November 2025 and recommenced development. Now, the game is entering early access in what the Hypixel team admits will be laced with \"bugs, rough edges, and unbalanced content.\"\n\nAs part of Hypixel's dedication to its potential playerbase, it allowed modders to get their hands on the game ahead of release to identify, plan, and develop the best mods possible. From increased luck during mining, custom plots, new items, and intriguing game modes, here are the best Hypixel mods to use from launch. Hypixel has confirmed that it has partnered with Curseforge to host mods, and this should lead to a pretty seamless installation process thanks to the Curseforge launcher.\n\nAnyone who's played Minecraft's player-created custom modes will be familiar with Skyblock. You're placed on an amount of terrain high in the sky, with limited resources. It's your job to expand your Skyblock, increase your well of resources, and proceed through the game. While Hypixel's storyline will differ from Minecraft's, obviously, transferring the Skyblock concept seems to be one of the more obvious mods you should try out. It's created by Cinder Stone Studios, and will be available via Curseforge at launch.\n\nMrbysco and their partner ShyNieke have been working on the Gone Fishing mod, which pretty much does what it says on the tin. While fishing is a vanilla inclusion in Minecraft, Hytale doesn't feature the mechanic at launch. By installing the mod you can spend all day fishing in Hytale if that's your dream, and from a short clip posted to Mrbysco's X page, we know that the user interface in the lower left corner will even identify the type of fish you've caught.\n\nThe Simply Trash mod by Jaredlll08 adds a trash can to quickly get rid of unwanted items. If you've ever found yourself with a full inventory of items you don't care about in Minecraft, you've probably created a lava bin to burn them--but this can be timely and frustrating. Jared's trash can seems to remove that problem, making inventory management even easier.\n\nWhen building a structure, village, or even just decorating some paths, switching between various blocks to add texture and interesting patterns is a necessity in vanilla Hytale. With the AutoHammer mod from tr7zw, select from variants of the same block type and AutoHammer will randomize which one is placed down.\n\nThis is technically a group of mods from one creator, but Sketch Macaw's mods are infamous in the Minecraft community, with hundreds of millions of installations. Macaw adds various paintings, paths, bridges, windows, lighting options, and more. Their paintings mod means you can easily switch between which paintings appear on the canvases you place, while their multiple furniture mods make customization more varied than you can imagine. We'd argue the bundle of Macaw's Mods are almost essential to install for your Hytale world. Check out Macaw's showcase to see the mods in action. They've even developed NEP - Not Enough Poops. We're in the dark about why poop is so important in Hytale, but it's good to see Macaw thinks we'll need even more.\n\nIf you're anything like me, inventory management is an ongoing struggle in most sandbox and survival games. I start off with the best of intentions, manually organizing my loot into easy-to-find locations. If I'm feeling particularly organized, they might even be in alphabetical order. Before long though, I've been on so many adventures and acquired so much random loot that my system goes out of the window completely. That's why Buuz135's WhereThisAt? mod will be one of the first that I install for Hytale. Search nearby inventories using the Inventory Lectern to find the item, and even pull it into your inventory.\n\nImmersive Melodies is another mod that's popular in Minecraft, which creator Conczin has managed to port over to Hytale. A bundle of 25 songs is playable on seven instruments, or you can upload your own melodies. It works in multiplayer, meaning you can form a band with your friends or just annoy them as you chase them around your base yelling Blink-182's All The Small Things in their headsets. Hours of fun ... for you, probably not for them.\n\nAnother mod from Buuz135 is Lucky Mining. It gives a small chance for ores to spread to adjacent blocks while mining. You'll know whether this has happened by a helpful particle effect and accompanying sound effect. It's a simple mod, but in those early stages where resources are limited and you're trying to progress, it can prove invaluable.\n\nA simple UI and quality-of-life improvement mod, the Better Modlist is another contribution from Buuz135. This modlist combines mods and packs and shows information about them in-game. It's a handy way to see everything you've got installed at once, as well as their effects.\n\nIf you're out on a long expedition to get materials, the last thing you want to do is run around the world chasing down the drops. In Jaredlll08's Item Magnet mod, anything you chop down, mine, or drop will be automatically magnetized to you and added to your inventory. It might feel simple, but it'll shave valuable time off your resource-gathering missions.",

    "description": "A virtually blank resume may spook employers, but job candidates don’t need a lengthy work career to land a gig—after all, one of Steven Bartlett’s best hires only had two lines on her CV.",
    "fullText": "Job-seekers may believe that an Ivy League degree or Fortune 500 work experience will land them a gig—but who they thank while walking into an interview could be more important than their educational pedigree.\n\nSteven Bartlett, the founder and host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, took a chance on an applicant with a virtually blank CV for that very reason.\n\n“I hired someone who’s CV was two lines. Their experience was zero,” Bartlett explained in a recent LinkedIn post. “Much of the reason why I gave her the job was because: She thanked the security guard by name on the way into the building.”\n\nShe continued to prove herself during the hiring process in seemingly small ways too—and those acts of humility got her the job, not her credentials.\n\n“When she didn’t know something, in the interview she said ‘I don’t know that yet, but here’s how I’d figure it out,’” Bartlett explained. “After the interview she went and self-taught herself the answer she didn’t know, and emailed it to me within hours.”\n\nThe founder took a chance on the experience-less candidate, and it didn’t take long to pay off; Bartlett said that six months later, she has proved herself as one of the best hires he’s ever made. “Fifteen years of hiring has taught me that culture fit and character is MUCH harder to hire than experience, skills or education.”\n\nBartlett’s hiring philosophy is music to the ears of entry-level Gen Zers kickstarting their careers without full-time work on their resumes.\n\nIt has long been the rule of thumb that the candidate with the best degree, most work experience, and impressive credentials will come out of job interview rounds victorious. But with years of successful and failed hires under their belt, bosses are bucking the status quo and chasing talent with human skills, work ethic, and integrity.\n\nDavid Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, isn’t drawn to candidates with the highest IQ. Instead, he said he’s in the “camp of smart enough” when hiring talent at the $282 billion company; in lieu of focusing on educational pedigree, he gravitates towards applicants who are in touch with “human elements” including the ability to connect, be resilient, and determined. Experience is also “hugely underrated” and a “big differentiator for the firm,” Solomon noted. Attending Harvard University or being the brightest in the room may be impressive, but it won’t get job candidates far at the banking titan.\n\n“You have to be smart enough, but the smartest person in the world without a whole package of other things [is] not going to navigate Goldman Sachs well, not going to be successful in Goldman Sachs over the long run,” Solomon revealed on Sequoia Capital’s Long Strange Trip podcast last year. “You can’t teach experience.”\n\nAnd Danny Meyer, the founder of global fast-casual chain Shake Shack, couldn’t agree more. To run the company’s 510 restaurant locations like a well-oiled machine, he needs talent to have a high “hospitality quotient” (HQ) over IQ. And he’s searching for six green flags in Shake Shack talent: integrity, optimism, intellectual curiosity, work ethic, empathy, and self-awareness.\n\n“I really don’t give a damn what your IQ is,” Meyer told Fortune’s Jason Del Rey at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last year. “What an IQ basically says is one’s aptitude for learning. What HQ is, is the degree to which someone is happier themselves when they provide happiness for someone else.”\n\nEven the Oracle of Omaha and longtime Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has fine-tuned his own hiring philosophy. After more than five decades helming the $1 trillion holding company, Buffett has witnessed professionals without glitzy Ivy League degrees succeed. And in planning his CEO succession last year, the investing mogul made one point clear: he wasn’t going to check the education section on candidates’ resumes.\n\n“I never look at where a candidate has gone to school. Never!” Buffett wrote in his 2025 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. “Of course, there are great managers who attended the most famous schools. But there are plenty such as Pete who may have benefited by attending a less prestigious institution or even not bothering to finish school.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.",
    "fullText": "“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“Should I wear a keffiyeh to the shooting range?” Amjad Masad asked as I slid into the passenger seat of his black Mercedes sports car. The patterned Palestinian scarf has become a political lightning rod in the two years since the war in Gaza began. Masad, the founder of AI coding startup Replit, and a Palestinian by origin, wrapped it around his neck anyway.\n\nAt the shooting range in Santa Clara, we collected an assault rifle and a pistol and headed in. With the AR-22 tucked into his shoulder, Masad fired at a brisk clip, peppering bullets into a cartoon burglar. In less than two minutes, the burglar’s head was perfectly pocked with holes.\n\n“You should compete,” I suggested.\n\nHe smirked. “I always compete.”\n\nIndeed, Masad has never been shy about his competitive streak or his political beliefs — especially since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, setting off the war in Gaza.\n\nMasad, 38, has felt obliged to speak out about Gaza ever since, calling out those in tech who, in his view, have supported Israel’s “genocide” of the Palestinian people. He quickly learned just how unpopular that opinion was in Silicon Valley.\n\nParty invitations dried up, group chats lit up with techies condemning his posts, and investors called him a “terrorist sympathizer.” One member of a firm that backed Replit publicly declared (opens in new tab) in July that he would donate any earnings from the investment to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n“I felt like I was sort of expelled from Silicon Valley,” Masad said in November on the way to the range.\n\nBut even as Silicon Valley cooled on him, the AI boom that Masad had long bet on took off. In 2024, Replit combined its coding tools with AI to create an agent that could turn plain English prompts into pre-coded apps. After nearly a decade, the company was suddenly in the right place at exactly the right time.\n\nTwo years later, Replit is booming. In September, it raised $250 million from Prysm, Andreessen Horowitz, Amex Ventures, and others, at a valuation of $3 billion. The company hopes to create the preeminent AI coder — one so easy to use that anyone can become a software engineer. Meanwhile, Masad continues to advocate for his political beliefs.\n\n“People reached out to me to express that my words have been hurtful and that many have been deeply offended,” he posted on X over the summer (opens in new tab). “I finally realized that I must, from the bottom of my heart, apologize to — absolutely nobody.”\n\nMasad’s swagger isn’t unique among tech founders. But for many, their against-the-grain takes tend to align with the bottom line. Masad insists he speaks up even when it hurts his business. In that regard, “I’m probably the only contrarian in Silicon Valley,” he told me.\n\nAs Replit takes off, will he be able to maintain that independence?\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation is hitched to the AI boom. Should the boom fizzle, the company could be worth nothing. But if it holds, and AI continues to remake the tech industry and the greater economy, Masad could find himself among the Valley’s next class of billionaires.\n\nReplit has plenty of competition among AI code-to-product firms (which are typically built on top of the mega LLMs). Swedish startup Lovable raised $330 million last month (opens in new tab), and Israeli company Base44 was bought by website builder Wix for $80 million this summer. All told, the AI coding sector received $4.7 billion in U.S. funding in the last year alone, according to PitchBook.\n\nTo persevere, Masad will not only have to beat his competitors with a better product but will have to earn the favor of still more investors, given the massive capital it takes to build and power Replit’s models.\n\nFor this reason, most players in AI have been pragmatic with their politics; see, for instance, how many Silicon Valley figures who previously supported liberal causes — from Marc Benioff to Mark Zuckerberg — suddenly and enthusiastically embraced the Trump White House. Or how Jensen Huang reportedly cozied (opens in new tab) up to David Sacks, hoping the AI czar would convince President Donald Trump to loosen U.S. chip restrictions and allow Nvidia to sell more products globally. Or how Sam Altman has courted Gulf royalty, landing major (opens in new tab) deals to build data centers in the region and fund OpenAI’s stateside infrastructure needs.\n\nFor the most part, Masad has been unwilling to soften his positions. With a penchant for discursive discussions on political philosophy, Masad remains eager to speak about the war in Gaza and rail against what he sees as human rights abuses committed by Israel.\n\nAnd he’s keen to take meetings with anyone who might see eye to eye on Palestine, even if they don’t agree on tech policy. Masad has spoken with New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani and messaged Lina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and nemesis of the tech elite. He had dinner with Tucker Carlson and lasted the obligatory three hours (opens in new tab) on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nIn short, Masad sees himself as both a champion for Palestine and a mogul in waiting. Which, particularly to other Arabs in tech, has made him a hero. “Having one of us make it in Silicon Valley — and still stay vocal on Palestine in the midst of all of this, specifically in Silicon Valley — is extremely inspirational,” said Fadi Ghandour, executive chairman at investment firm Wamda, one of the backers of Replit.\n\nAll this is a world away from Amman, Jordan, where Masad grew up. On the drive from his home in Palo Alto to the gun range, Masad told me his youthful hobbies included drift racing on Amman’s streets and shooting guns in empty lots.\n\nMasad, who speaks unexpectedly softly given his combative persona, is aware of how lucky he is. He compared his circumstances to a simulation experiment in which “if you ran the world a million times, I think 90% of them, I’m in a really bad situation. I’m in prison or dead.” Instead, “somehow I keep surviving and winning.”\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation was in many ways the fruits of Masad’s decades-long study of how to make it in Silicon Valley. As a teen in Jordan, he avidly followed Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham, studying his blog posts and obsessively scrolling through Hacker News, the Y Combinator news feed.\n\nAfter getting his computer science degree in 2010 from Jordan’s Princess Sumaya University for Technology, he created the first iteration of what would become Replit: an open-source program for coders to work within a web browser, a novelty back when programmers needed to buy specialized software.\n\nHe posted a link to the program on Hacker News, where it went viral. That led to securing his first job in the U.S., as the founding engineer at Codecademy in New York. In 2013, he took a job as a software engineer at Facebook. By 2016, he and his wife, Haya Odeh, decided to revisit his old project from Jordan, officially founding Replit as an online platform to help developers build, collaborate, and publish their software.\n\nAs a student of Silicon Valley, Masad knew that mythmaking was just as important as the product. He began live-blogging Replit’s progress, and his efforts soon caught the attention of Graham himself. “What struck me most about him, at first, was that he was a programmers’ programmer,” Graham said. “He wasn’t just working on software to make money. He’d have been writing it no matter what.”\n\nGraham invited Masad and Odeh to apply to the Y Combinator accelerator program in 2018. They were accepted, and after completing the program, Replit landed investment from Andreessen Horowitz. With that funding and support, Replit gained traction as a tool for students to learn coding and educators to teach it. According to Masad, he turned down a $1 billion acquisition from Github, believing Replit would one day be worth exponentially more.\n\nMasad’s ultimate objective was to leverage his success in tech to help the Palestinian cause — a sentiment instilled in him by his mother. “She would tell me about all the great things I’m gonna do,” he said. “I fantasized as a kid about helping the Palestinians and ending the occupation and being an important force in the world.”\n\nBut in 2019, he effectively put the company on pause after his mother’s cancer took a turn for the worse. Masad and Odeh traveled to be with his father, a civil engineer with the Jordanian government.\n\nThe experience was traumatic for Masad. In his mother’s final days, the doctors in Jordan wouldn’t let any visitors into the ICU. Masad begged, then yelled, and they finally relented — on the condition he sign a “do not resuscitate” order. He still doesn’t understand why. By the time he got to see her, she was unconscious. “I was so angry at modern medicine,” Masad said. “So angry at modernity.” She died shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter a few months, Masad returned to Silicon Valley. He couldn’t stop thinking about civilization at large, about where the world was going, and if he could stand it — or if he could change it. He found himself agreeing with the Valley’s increasingly powerful libertarians.\n\nHe bonded with Marc Andreessen over politics and literature, and traveled to Malaysia to visit Balaji Srinivasan’s mysterious “startup society.” He grew to realize that the limitations he had assumed don’t necessarily apply. “There was an aspect of, like, ‘Fuck the system,’” Masad said. “‘We need to remake civilization.’”\n\nMasad gained a following on Twitter by bantering with tech legends about everything from coding to bitcoin to Covid vaccine skepticism. His growing stature landed him on podcasts and in glowing (opens in new tab) articles in The Wall Street Journal portraying him as a maverick. Then came the ultimate Silicon Valley validation: Graham, the idol whom he’d studied obsessively as a teenager in Jordan, started thanking him in his own blog posts.  (opens in new tab)\n\nMeanwhile, Replit was struggling. The education market turned out to be small, and the company had trouble expanding into enterprise deals. In late 2023, Replit killed its education product and the following year laid off 30 employees — right after moving into a bigger office in Foster City. “I remember walking around the office and just feeling sick to my stomach,” he said. “I felt like I let people down as well, because I sold them this big dream, and it wasn’t working.”\n\nHe had a plan, though, one he hoped would make his odyssey worth it. For years, he had proselytised on podcasts about how AI would turbocharge coding. Replit had spent years building an extensive database of coding materials — he just needed foundational companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to catch up and release an LLM capable of writing code. Once they did, Replit could plug those models into its pre-existing database and create a powerful app-building AI agent.\n\nWhile a new AI coding company would have to build out that infrastructure from scratch, Replit, Masad realized, could start miles ahead. After nearly a decade, he would finally have perfect timing.\n\nMasad had always been outspoken online. After Hamas’ terrorist attacks, as segments of the tech elite publicly lined up behind Israel, he held his ground. And his responses grew more costly.\n\nFirst, there were the public fights. Masad advised Elon Musk (opens in new tab) to “stick to his principles” when the billionaire said the slogan “from the river to the sea” was calling for genocide. (Palestinian activists say it’s a call for the peaceful liberation of the Palestinian people; pro-Israel voices say it calls for the extermination of Israel.) He clapped back (opens in new tab) at Lux Capital founding partner Josh Wolfe, who said that equating Israel’s actions in Gaza to genocide “grotesquely disgraces” Holocaust victims. And when Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures said Masad’s “friends” (opens in new tab) were behind the Oct. 7 attack, Masad challenged him directly.\n\n“If you think my friends did that then why don’t you confront me when you see me?” Masad replied on X (opens in new tab).\n\nBut even as things got noisy in public, Masad met eerie silence professionally. “My calendar was suddenly empty, because I was talking about Palestine,” he said. “Replit was not a hot company anymore. We did a layoff. And at the same time, a lot of my friends were no longer my friends. I was no longer invited to parties.”\n\nPotential partnerships dried up. Masad became a frequent topic in pro-Israel tech groupchats, a source said, where some investors accused him of being antisemitic.\n\nA Replit investor who requested anonymity to speak candidly told me Masad’s public persona has been “really challenging,” and he’s had to defend the founder in investor circles. I asked if Masad had lost business because of his views. “I’m sure the answer is yes,” the investor said.\n\nA startup that Masad had invested in pitched another investor — and found that Masad was a liability. “He said, ‘Oh, Amjad is investing. He’s like a terrorist sympathizer. If he’s investing, I’m not investing,” Masad said he was told, though he declined to name the company or the investor.\n\nBut as Silicon Valley grew chilly, other regions beckoned.\n\nIn April 2024, with Replit a few months from launching its AI agent, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is worth nearly $1 trillion, invited Masad and other AI thought leaders to stay at Ekland Safaris, a property in South Africa linked (opens in new tab) to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nFor Masad, it was a lifeline. Here were potential partners who didn’t care about his politics on Palestine. If anything, his Arab identity and his outspokenness made him more attractive.\n\nIn the heat of the day, a hunting guide sped Masad and other guests, including Tareq Amin, the future CEO of Saudi AI company HUMAIN, across 30,000 acres to kill kudu and wildebeest. By night, guests feasted in a grand ballroom while Masad demoed his not-yet-released AI coding agent to Saudi officials.\n\n“We’re going to be able to give a software engineer to every person,” Masad told Amin. “Anyone in the world will have a software engineer on demand.”\n\nAmin said he thought then that Replit was on “a path to build a game-changing technology.” Indeed, if the agent worked, and if the AI boom Masad had been betting on came to pass, everyone in that room stood to benefit.\n\nReplit launched its AI agent in September 2024 and within a year, revenue had reached $150 million. Amin and Masad closed a deal for Replit to be the exclusive AI coding software for Saudi governmental agencies, a partnership Masad expects to lead to “hundreds of millions” of dollars worth of business.\n\nAnd just like that, Silicon Valley wanted back in. Replit landed enterprise deals with Atlassian and Zillow, with a Meta deal in the wings, according to Masad. Replit raised its $250 million round and scored its $3 billion valuation.\n\nIt helped Masad that, in the two years since Oct. 7, there’s been rising public disapproval (opens in new tab) of the Israeli government. He also gained strength in numbers: There have been high-profile movements (opens in new tab) within Google, Amazon, and other tech giants, with employees speaking out in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\n“Today, the tide in tech has shifted,” Masad posted to X in September. (opens in new tab) “If you’ve been holding back, now is the time to speak out and call out anyone supporting or celebrating genocide.”\n\nWith Silicon Valley warming back up to him — he was on a16z’s podcast in October (opens in new tab) — Masad was invited to larger, and more controversial, audiences. He drove hours to record at Carlson’s rural Maine cabin, nodding politely when the host marveled on air at his perfect English. In July, he sat down with Rogan, talking about everything from Gaza to the Covid vaccine, which Masad has refused to take.\n\n“I tend to have a negative reaction to anyone forcing me to do something,” Masad said, prompting a “Good for you” from Rogan. “It was the same thing now with talking about Palestine and things like that. The more they come at me, the more I want to say things.”\n\nHe appears now to have the capital, both financially and socially, to draw hard lines. “There are a lot of people who care about the Palestinians but who are afraid to speak out publicly,” said Graham, who has also been an outspoken advocate for Palestine. “What Amjad and I have in common is that we don’t have to worry about being fired if we do.”\n\nMasad said Israel’s Ministry of Education had reached out around 2016 to work with Replit. “We got very close to a deal, but they were very overbearing,” he said, adding that the government had what he viewed as cumbersome requirements, like fining Replit if the service went down. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHe says he would never work with Israel now. “I think it’s an illegitimate and criminal government,” he told me during our gun safety training. “I mean, [Benjamin] Netanyahu is a war criminal.”\n\nWhen I pointed out that Saudi Arabia has its own abysmal human rights record, Masad drew a contrast.\n\n“I just think about how Replit is going to be used. Like, Israel is actively committing genocide and ethnic cleansing, and if you sell to the government there, it’s possible that they’re going to use it for that,” he said, pointing to the country’s use of Microsoft cloud services to track Palestinians’ phone calls. (After an investigation by The Guardian, Microsoft said it disabled the services that made the tracking possible in September. (opens in new tab))\n\nIt’s a careful, and conveniently self-serving, justification. This logic allows Replit to work with countries that Masad finds tolerable. Whether that line will hold as Replit scales is unclear.\n\nAfter the shooting range, we drove through a thick forest fog to the restaurant The Mountain House in Woodside. Over grilled venison, Masad talked about Replit’s next challenge: expanding its user base from corporate clients to everyday users. This isn’t essential — plenty of companies thrive selling enterprise software. But Masad wants Replit to be an engine for socioeconomic mobility around the world, letting anyone, anywhere, easily create apps and businesses.\n\nMasad acknowledged that if he succeeds — if Replit goes public and he becomes a billionaire — he will have the capital to make real change for Palestine, though he’s light on details. “It’s hard to plan for 20 years in the future,” he shrugged. “I just know that wealth is a prerequisite.”\n\nMargaux MacColl can be reached at [email protected]",

    "description": "Forage, an AI-powered startup, leverages AI as a middle manager to amplify its junior employee's productivity and learning with minimal supervision.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Charles Swann, a 44-year-old founder of an AI startup based in Boulder, CO. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI founded my startup, Forage, around 18 months ago. Besides myself, I have one full-time employee who has been with the company for eight months.\n\nMy business is in the marketing technology space, and I needed someone with a deep connection to modern culture and social media. So, I hired a 24-year-old growth and brand specialist from my neighborhood. She's a college graduate with less than two years of experience, whom I started mentoring.\n\nThe challenge with hiring someone more junior is that they often lack the skills to translate their intuition into a business strategy. But over the last six months, especially since the launch of Gemini 3, we've been able to leverage AI to significantly expand the capabilities of my junior employee.\n\nWe work in the marketing technology space, helping brands understand the trends happening on social media.\n\nMy junior employee has a very intuitive understanding of what influencer and brand relationships should look like, as well as how brands should present themselves on social media.\n\nWhen she first used AI in this role, she used ChatGPT to refine her product strategy. ChatGPT was great at taking her rough ideas, refining the concepts, and then writing out the details. As we began using Gemini more frequently, the role AI played in our workflow shifted from refining to co-creating product strategy.\n\nThe increased strategic capabilities in Gemini 3 are subtle, but they make a big difference because that strategic perspective is what young professionals often miss.\n\nMy growth and brand specialist had no prior experience writing a product requirements document before getting this role. Without AI, creating this document is a heavy lift. It's essentially the initial blueprint for a new product feature, translating a business idea into the technical instructions needed to build it.\n\nWriting this type of document for complex features typically would take a skilled product manager eight to 10 hours to get it right. With Gemini, my employee can do this in four to five hours.\n\nGemini 3 has been a significant step forward. Before using it, I had the idea that we should create 70% of the final product, and AI should generate 30%. Now, it's probably 40% us and 60% Gemini, simply because it's so good at expanding and expediting.\n\nWith younger career professionals, sometimes there's a light switch that clicks, and they know what it's like to be a leader, take ownership of something, and start running with their ideas.\n\nMy employee has really demonstrated that growth. This occurred at the same time she became more sophisticated in her use of AI.\n\nAI now serves as that middle layer, helping her level up the work she produces. I hesitate to say that AI alone has allowed me to have less supervision, but as she started getting more sophisticated in her use of the AI tool, I've spent less time reviewing in detail what she's generating and more time focused on the big-picture strategy questions.\n\nThere's always a risk in relying on AI to teach my employee how to gain years of experience in seconds. Hallucinations and feedback loops can occur if someone doesn't have the experience to know when to redirect.\n\nWhat I've done to help safeguard us is create a collection of prompt starters that include a detailed background on what our platform does, the features, and how to define it, which I can copy and paste into the chat. That's been a giant time saver and helps keep it focused on relevant context.\n\nHowever, I think running into possible mistakes or hallucinations is better than moving slowly. I would rather have those mistakes come up, and we have to course correct, than not be able to move at the pace we are.\n\nAI removes some of the traditional requirements around skills and expertise I need to see in candidates. It allows me to focus more on the raw intelligence, ambition, and drive.\n\nWith my company, I'm definitely bullish on the idea that brands will need the ability to authentically understand and reflect culture more than ever before, even in an AI-driven world, to survive. That type of intuitive knowledge resides with a different group of people than those my age, in their 40s, might be able to deliver.\n\nSo, I'm less concerned with whether my employee has been in the marketing industry for 10 years and more concerned with whether they have a deep understanding of the problem we're trying to solve.\n\nI believe this hiring mindset will only grow as AI continues to transform the workforce.\n\nDo you operate a tiny team and want to share your story?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's new defense regulations are sending ripples through the industry, and that's a good thing, according to Palmer Luckey.\n\n\"It's good to scare people sometimes,\" Luckey, the founder and CEO of defense technology startup Anduril, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\"President Trump is saying that he wants to see defence companies building new plants, building new factories, delivering on time, and then maintaining systems cost-effectively,\" Luckey said in an appearance on \"The Close\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'd say I'm broadly aligned,\" the Anduril founder said, adding that \"trying to do more of that is why I started Anduril years ago.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump criticized major defense contractors for issuing large dividends to shareholders, doing stock buybacks, and offering \"exorbitant\" pay packages while underperforming in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe president backed his rhetoric with action, signing an executive order that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nThe order caps defense executive salaries at $5 million, tying their annual compensation to on-time delivery, increased production, and operational improvements.\n\n\"These measures do apply in equal measure to me. I now cannot pay dividends. I now cannot do stock buybacks if I'm not investing in new plants,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Anduril founder told Bloomberg he pays himself a salary of $100,000 a year, in addition to owning \"a lot\" of Anduril.\n\nLuckey's startup, which makes autonomous weapons, is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025 and is considering an IPO. The company's mission is to modernize the US military through technology, including surveillance devices, air vehicles, and autonomous weapons.\n\nAs the United States hustles to modernize warfare, Anduril has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\n\"If these companies were doing really well, and if they were living up to their end of the bargain, I don't think you would see any action from Trump or others on this. It's really a reflection of how many problems we have with our defence industrial base,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nWithout specifying, he added that he thought some of Trump's proposals \"might be bad moves\" for the defense base, but that \"in concept,\" everything should be on the table.",

    "description": "Amy Errett, the founder and CEO of Madison Reed, told Business Insider she sticks to a strict structure to get through her busy days.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Errett, the founder and CEO of Madison Reed. Errett is based in Northern California and founded the hair care company in 2013. Since then, Madison Reed has grown to 90 locations across the country. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLife as a CEO is busy, and I start my days early with exercise, meditation, and a strong cup of coffee, before I jump into a morning of back-to-back meetings.\n\nI'm very disciplined about how I work and communicate, but I try to keep time for thinking and being outside, especially at the end of the week.\n\nIn the evenings, I slow down with family, simple rituals, and sleep, so I can do it all again the next day.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone to make sure nothing urgent happened overnight, especially since I'm on the West Coast.\n\nMy wife, Claire, is a professional artist and also a professional chef. I'm lucky — I get a home-cooked meal almost every night. That's also why I have to weigh myself every morning before I exercise or drink anything. I also track my sleep and stress using an Oura Ring.\n\nWithin about 45 minutes of waking up, I work out at home using my Peloton and Tonal. Five days a week, I do 30 minutes of cardio and 15 minutes of strength training.\n\nAfterward, I meditate for about 10 minutes using Henry Shukman's app, The Way.\n\nI travel a lot, but for three days, I work from home. At my home in Marin County, I work from a small pod, a 110-square-foot room in my backyard — made in Canada — that is my private workspace. I'm a nature person, and being surrounded by grass and trees is like getting plugged into an energy source.\n\nI also have a condo in San Francisco, which I go back and forth between.\n\nBefore I start work, I make a coffee with two regular shots and two decaf and bring it with me, along with water.\n\nMy workdays are highly structured. I have weekly one-on-one meetings with everyone who reports directly to me, always at the same time each week. Those blocks are fixed, and everything else gets scheduled around them.\n\nMy assistant, Christina, is essential to keeping my schedule running. We meet three times a week and plan weeks in advance.\n\nMy meetings include internal check-ins, conversations with the PR team, and external meetings. I also mentor other women investors. I've been on the board of my alma mater, Wharton, so there are sometimes external board meetings, and my own board meetings.\n\nI also personally interview every hire at the level of store general manager or above for 15 minutes before they receive an offer.\n\nThese interviews are focused entirely on cultural fit. I always ask one question: \"Tell me about something that didn't go well in your life, and what you learned from it.\"\n\nI'm looking for resilience, grit, honesty, love, and passion. Some of the answers I hear — about loss, hardship, or perseverance — stop me in my tracks and tell me who someone really is. I've had people tell me they are homeless and worked their way up to being a general manager somewhere else. That 15-minute process adds up, but it's incredibly important to me.\n\nI'm a protein loader, especially since losing a significant amount of weight. I aim to eat about 90 to 100 grams of protein a day. Cottage cheese is my best friend — it's high in protein, relatively low in calories, and keeps me full.\n\nMy go-to meal is a bowl of cottage cheese topped with a poached egg and a slice of gluten-free toast. I also allow myself one small indulgence: three days a week, I have a mini Coke Zero in the afternoon.\n\nI've tried to work with my assistant to carve out blocks of uninterrupted thinking time, but the truth is, I don't get much of it.\n\nMost days are packed back-to-back. I do, however, protect Fridays: I don't take meetings after 1 p.m., and that's when I catch up and think more freely.\n\nMy best thinking happens outside. I live near Marin, so I hike often.\n\nOn Fridays, I'll often leave right at 1 p.m. and drive to my boat alone. I don't talk to anyone — I just cruise, sit with my thoughts, and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes a close friend will join me, but most of the time it's solo.\n\nDuring the rest of the week, though, I'm extremely disciplined about communication.\n\nMy inbox is always at zero, and I respond quickly across email, Slack, text, and phone. I actually like calling people, even though most people don't — I think there's a lost art in picking up the phone and having a real conversation.\n\nIt's not always easy to stay on track — especially with such a tight schedule.\n\nThis work is personal to me. I'm putting my energy into it, and so are more than 1,100 other people. When something doesn't feel good — we didn't do right by someone, or we got turned down — I feel it deeply.\n\nI've gotten better at handling those moments over time. I work with an executive coach over Zoom twice a week. That's helped me understand what triggers me and how to recover more quickly. I still have emotional reactions — I'm very human — but I don't stay stuck in them the way I used to.\n\nWhen I feel overwhelmed now, I step outside and take a walk or just pause and take a breath. That reset helps me come back grounded.\n\nIt took a long time to get there, but it works.\n\nMost evenings, I like to unwind by watching sports. I follow several teams, record every game, and have access to all the streaming platforms, so there's almost always something on.\n\nDinner is an important part of my evening. My wife, Claire, and I sit down to eat together every night, usually around 6:15 pm. Before we eat, we say a blessing, and then we do \"roses and thorns,\" where we each share one good thing and one hard thing from the day. We've kept that tradition going since our daughter, Madison, who I named the company after, was young.\n\nAfter dinner, we'll usually watch something together. I tend to gravitate toward sports and thrillers, while Claire and our daughter have different tastes. Our dog, London, is usually right by my side.\n\nI try to be in bed by 10 p.m. and asleep by 10:30. I use a Hatch sound machine and an Eight Sleep mattress — both are game changers.",

    "title": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio says gold's rapid rally is a warning for markets and the economy",
    "description": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgwater Associates, says the blistering rally in gold last year is a reflection of precarious macro developments.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio spent 2025 expressing fear and urging caution, and he's remaining cautious as the US economy enters a new year.\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates sounded alarms throughout 2025 over what he sees as a budding global debt crisis and the waning value of fiat currency.\n\nThe surge in gold last year—the biggest gain for the metal since 1979—contains a warning for investors, specifically as it relates to the depreciating value of fiat money, Dalio said in a post on Monday.\n\nA potent cocktail of central bank buying, geopolitical worries, and appetite from individuals pushed gold to records all year, but Dalio argues that the gold rally is mainly a result of fiat money losing real value. In his view, that was the biggest story in markets in 2025.\n\n\"The best major investment of the year was long gold (returning 65% in dollar terms), which outperformed the S&P index (which returned 18% in dollars) by 47%,\" he said. \"Or, said differently, the S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms.\"\n\nDalio urged investors to consider a few key factors when evaluating the forces that drove markets in 2025. Specifically, he highlighted that examining investment through calculations made in a depreciating currency can be misleading, as it can make returns appear stronger than they actually were.\n\nFrom Dalio's perspective, the stock market's 2025 performance varied greatly based on the measuring stick.\n\n\"When one's own currency goes down, it makes it look like the things measured in it went up,\" he said. \"In this case, the S&P returned 18% for a dollar-based investor, 17% for a yen-based investor, 13% for a renminbi-based investor, only 4% for a euro-based investor, only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor, and, for a gold-based investor, it returned -28%.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the economic benefits of a weakening US dollar, attempting to frame it as beneficial for US exports. But economic think tanks such as the Cato Institute have argued against this perspective, claiming that it ignores negative spillover effects for US consumers.\n\nDalio seems to share that mindset, noting that a weaker currency tends to lower the cost of a nation's exported goods for international buyers while increasing the price of domestic imports.\n\n\"When one's currency goes down, it reduces one's wealth and one's buying power, it makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies, and it makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency.\"\n\nIn his view, rising gold prices reflect a weakening economy and a national currency that is decreasing in value. For that reason, Dalio sees the continued strength of the so-called debasement trade as a warning for the US.\n\nThe stock market's big bull run in recent years might also be making it easier for investors to disregard other warning signals flashing in the economy. Dalio emphasized that the gold rally is a reason to reassess the macro picture and take a more cautious position.\n\nThe billionaire investor added that stocks and gold benefited from monetary policy easing in 2025, but as both assets are no longer cheap, they're at risk of a pullback if conditions shift again.\n\n\"Whether or not you are currency hedged matters a lot,\" Dalio said. \"You should always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if you think you are capable of making them well.\"",

    "description": "Ben Parris is a professor of cognition and cognitive neuroscience in Bournemouth University’s School of Psychology. He is also co-founder of the university’s Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Centre",
    "fullText": "Ben Parris is a professor of cognition and cognitive neuroscience in Bournemouth University’s School of Psychology. He is also co-founder of the university’s Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Centre\n\nA decline in your cognitive health is something that can creep up on you. It’s not like a bad back or dodgy knee, which will give you plenty of gyp as soon as there is a problem. You may suddenly find that you’re not quite as mentally sharp as you once were.\n\nYou may notice that it becomes harder to hold conversations, remember phone numbers and do everyday tasks such as go to the shops. That’s a result of your frontal lobe beginning to waste away, which happens to all of us as we age, though at different rates.\n\nThis part of the brain is located just behind our forehead and is home to our executive functions – our ability to plan, organise, focus and generally interact with the world around us. It’s different from dementia, though that disease speeds up the process.\n\nWhile the frontal lobe does eventually deteriorate, as a professor and researcher who studies cognitive decline, I have seen it remain in good nick in people in their 60s and beyond.\n\nThe key to keeping your mental abilities sharp as you age starts with noticing when the frontal lobe is shrinking. If you’re aware, there are things you can do to slow it down. So here are the signs it’s happening to you, and what you can do about it. I’ve also compiled a series of tests so that you can test how well your brain is ageing, which you can access below.\n\nOne of the first signs of a decline in your cognitive health can be struggling to switch between tasks, such as cooking a meal while also holding a conversation with someone.\n\nYou might notice that you struggle to respond to someone’s comment, as you’re still thinking about what to do next in your recipe.\n\nThere is a loosening of the sharpness that was once there. The tasks bleed together, you’re not able to focus and it takes you a bit of time to adjust.\n\nThis signals a problem with your cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to switch between different tasks and remain focused. This represents one of the more difficult tasks that we engage in on a daily basis, so it can be the first ability that you notice is deteriorating.\n\nIn extreme cases, people can be stirring a pot and as they turn around to talk to someone, they are still doing the action of stirring but without the spoon in their hand.\n\nWe can all jumble up words at times, especially if we’re tired or distracted. However, if you catch yourself regularly skipping over words, it could be a sign of cognitive decline.\n\nFor example, instead of saying “I’m just going to pop to the shops”, you might come out with “I’m just shops”.\n\nIt can be a sign that there is a problem with your response inhibition, which is a cognitive function located in your frontal lobe. It is a skill we need for focus and to block out irrelevant information.\n\nWhen you skip words like this, it means that your brain failed to inhibit (or block out) the last word in the sentence until it was time to say it. It’s a form of language breakdown that can be an early sign of dementia.\n\nRegularly mixing up related words is another sign that your cognition isn’t in peak condition.\n\nFor example, if you want to say the word “fork”, it should be at the forefront of your mind but, when there is a problem with response inhibition, related words such as “spoon” and “knife” can also float to the surface.\n\nIf this part of our cognitive function continues to deteriorate, you may say words that become increasingly distant from the word you meant to say, for example “plate” or even “train” instead of “fork”. This is a sign that there is misfiring going on in the brain.\n\nThe frequency with which this occurs and the distance from the word you intended to say can be used to determine the severity of cognitive decline.\n\nIf you realise that you need to nip to the shop for some milk, your brain quickly comes up with a plan. Where is the nearest shop? How will you get there? Do you have a way of paying?\n\nWith good cognitive health, this requires little effort and you may not give these questions a second thought. However, if one of these components goes wrong – for example, you forget a means of payment – it signals a failure in working memory, which is our ability to maintain and manipulate information.\n\nAs you were leaving the house, you failed to maintain one of the key components of the task. Such mental slips become more common as we age and our frontal lobes atrophy.\n\nIf this happens occasionally and is not increasing in frequency, it’s nothing to worry about. I have been known to drive to the supermarket and walk home, forgetting that I’ve left the car as I’ve been busy thinking about other things.\n\nHowever, if it happens more and more often, you might want to consider seeing your GP. It could be an early sign of dementia.\n\nForgetting what you need from the shop, and struggling to find the items you want to buy, are signs of cognitive decline.\n\nYou rely on your short-term memory to remember what you need from the shop and your spatial memory (the ability to understand where you are in relation to your surroundings) to be able to find the products you need.\n\nIf this part of your cognitive health is deteriorating, you may find yourself walking up and down the same aisles many times, as you’ve forgotten which you’ve already been down.\n\nOne famous study took patients to a shopping centre and gave them a list of items to buy, such as milk and a newspaper. Those suffering from cognitive decline walked up and down multiple times, getting the items in an illogical way, following an incoherent path.\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms and it is significantly affecting your ability to continue with life as normal, or you have noticed that they are getting worse, I would recommend going to your GP.\n\nIt’s also worth booking an appointment with your doctor if a loved one is concerned about your cognitive health, even if you are not, as you could be experiencing anosognosia, which is a lack of awareness of your own cognitive decline. This is a common problem.\n\nWhile these symptoms could be a sign of cognitive decline or dementia, they could also be caused by a stroke or tumour. The earlier you see your GP, the easier it is to treat.\n\nIf concerned, your doctor should refer you to the neuropsychology clinic at your local hospital. There, you will probably complete a series of memory tests, such as the “Stroop task” and the Corsi block-tapping test, and have an MRI to look for shrinkage in the frontal lobe, which would indicate dementia, or lesions, which may be evidence of a stroke.\n\nThere are no hidden secrets in terms of maintaining cognitive health. As far as we’re aware, it’s the same recommendations as for maintaining bodily health.\n\nDiet and exercise are the two most important pillars to focus on for your brain.\n\nFollowing a healthy diet – which includes plenty of green leafy vegetables, fish, nuts and berries – has been shown to slow cognitive decline, which is thought to be because these foods contain nutrients such as folate and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nWeight-training twice a week has been linked to less brain shrinkage and better performance on memory tests, while cardio improves blood flow, including to the brain, promoting the development of new brain cells and protecting the organ against inflammation.\n\nI always recommend cutting back on alcohol – and only drink a few times a year myself – as research has shown that it causes shrinkage in parts of the brain important for memory, and poorer performance on cognitive tests.

The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

He was 95.\n\nRosen served in the United States Air Force from 1948 to 1952, and was stationed in Japan and the Far East during the Korean War. After his service ended, he remained in Japan, establishing Rosen Enterprises in 1954. While the business initially focused on selling art and identification photos, it soon shifted to importing coin-operated amusement machines from North America.\n\nIn 1965, Rosen merged his business with Nihon Goraku Bussan, Ltd. (another Japanese firm founded by Americans, also known as Service Games) to create Sega Enterprises, Ltd., with Rosen serving as CEO and managing director.\n\nUnder his watch, Sega would grow to become one of the most influential and successful companies operating in the location-based amusement industry, and brokered the deal that saw Sega become part of the vast American conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries in 1969.\n\nWhen Gulf and Western decided to sell off many of its assets following the death of its boss, Charles Bluhdorn, in 1983, Rosen teamed up with Hayao Nakayama and Isao Okawa to buy out the Japanese side of the company, creating Sega Ltd.\n\nRosen, who by this point had relocated to the United States, helped establish Sega of America and served as its chairman. He retained his director's role at Sega of Japan until 1996.\n\nHe retired in the '90s and lived in Los Angeles up until his death.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Bill Harris, the 69-year-old startup founder of Evergreen Wealth and former CEO of PayPal and Intuit, based in Miami. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the founder and CEO of Evergreen Wealth, an RIA registered investment advisory. We provide our largely high-net-worth clients with investment management and financial advice, using AI to enhance our services.\n\nI spent a decade in media in New York and then a decade in corporate fintech in California, where I served as the CEO of PayPal and Intuit (now TurboTax).\n\nThen, I spent a 25-year stint in fintech startups, with seven successes and two failures, all of which ultimately led to Evergreen Wealth in 2023.\n\nSimplicity has become one of the most important things to me. When I was married and raising kids in Silicon Valley, my days were a jumble of competing obligations. Now, I live alone in a 1,200-square-foot cottage in Miami Beach with no car. The simplicity of not having anything else that commands my attention is remarkably liberating.\n\nThough I'm 69, I haven't retired because this remains the most engaging thing I do. If and when I retire, I plan to attend the University of Cambridge as a student.\n\nHere's what a day in my life is like.\n\nI wake up when my body is ready, typically around 6 or 6:30. It might be five or 10 minutes before I hop out of bed and check email quickly to see if there's anything hot.\n\nIf not, I stay off the machine unless I've got something on deadline. I get dressed, check the tires on my bike, and organize my belongings. While I'm doing those somewhat mindless tasks, I let myself think.\n\nSomething happens first thing in the morning, where all the unraveled pieces of information from the night before feel ready to be integrated. It's a remarkably productive period of time for me to find clarity, think broadly, and process.\n\nI don't eat breakfast, and I don't shower at home, because I bike 30 minutes to work and have a shower at my office.\n\nI hit the office around 7:30 or 8 a.m. Before the pandemic, we had over 20 people in the office; now, most of our staff work from home or are hybrid. Unless I'm out of town, I go to the office every day.\n\nAfter taking a shower, I switch gears from undisciplined thoughts to the highest-priority task of the day, whether that's creating a presentation, building a spreadsheet, or simply writing.\n\nI'm not the type to be super regimented, and I'm not very good at time management. I run a whole lot more on enthusiasm than discipline.\n\nI keep track of everything throughout the day by using index cards. I scribble down words, little pictures, reminders, charts, or whatever else I need to remember. It's a fast and flexible way for me to stay organized.\n\nMy enthusiasm keeps me going most of the time, but it's not infrequent that, in the afternoon, I start dragging. I feel it physically, as if magnets are pulling me down.\n\nIf I can, I'll take a nap in the cot I've set up in my closet. Sometimes I look for a hole in the schedule, or I just cancel things. I let my body take control and don't set an alarm.\n\nEveryone knows I nap. I used to stick a Post-it on the closed door, saying \"The old man is sleeping.\"\n\nMy naps bring back that energy and enthusiasm that drives me.\n\nI don't consume caffeine. I have the willingness to let my body tell me when it's ready to rest. Occasionally, I'll miss something during a nap and think, \"Oh my, that's embarrassing,\" but I don't have a fear of missing something important.\n\nLunch is my first meal of the day, often soup, because it's just so easy and convenient. I almost exclusively drink carbonated water from my SodaStream, and I drink from glass bottles to avoid microplastics.\n\nThe first thing I do when I get home is prepare some food, which involves less cooking and more chopping and combining ingredients. I've actually never even opened my oven before.\n\nMy favorite foods are eggs, avocados, salmon, legumes, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. I try to avoid eating processed foods.\n\nI don't own a TV or use social media, but I spend too much time on YouTube. I enjoy watching videos while I eat dinner.\n\nI watch content from Peter Zeihan for geopolitics, Tim Miller for politics, Sam Harris for philosophy (sort of), Sabine Hossenfelder for physics, Lex Friedman for science and AI, and Josh Johnson for fun.\n\nIf I have some time, I might also read.\n\nIf I still have energy, I'll dedicate another hour or two to work. I also review my index cards from the day, and if there's anything still unfinished or important enough to track, I add it to my task list, which is an Excel sheet I've had for years. There must be over 10,000 entries by now.\n\nHaving such a big list isn't terrifying; it's reassuring. What terrifies me is losing track of something. If everything gets logged, I have the satisfaction of knowing that I didn't forget about it; it's just not at the top of my priority list.\n\nThen I'll get into bed, and the last thing I do before I go to sleep is put on an eye mask so I don't wake up to the morning light if it's before my body is ready.\n\nOn weekends, I try to eat well and go out to places where the food is excellent. Like the weekdays, I ride my bike for at least an hour each day.\n\nI also enjoy going out dancing to live music. It could be jazz, deep house, rock, or pop. I just love the feeling of being in a live music session with other people and everybody moving. I love rhythmic motion.",

    "fullText": "Startup founder Adam Joseph has never appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" but he knows how it feels to be on the hot seat in front of Mark Cuban.\n\nJoseph managed to get Cuban's attention and an investment in his AI-powered PR agency, Clipbook, through a series of emails.\n\nThe seven-figure investment that Joseph secured started 12 months ago with cold outreach to a few famous investors, including Cuban, who has said he spends his days reading and responding to emails.\n\nJoseph shared highlights from his email exchange with Cuban exclusively with Business Insider. These emails show how Cuban responds to startup founders, assesses business pitches, and decides to invest over email, as the billionaire has said he's done many times.\n\n\"I wanted to put a potential seed opportunity that I think might be a strong mutual fit,\" Joseph wrote in his initial message to Cuban.\n\nThe Clipbook founder then provided a bullet-point summary of his startup, which uses AI to track how people and companies are being discussed online, like a more sophisticated version of Google Alerts. Joseph worked in PR for a few years and said he felt the \"pain points\" of keeping tabs on public sentiment, which he thought AI could help solve. When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, Joseph said it became \"immediately obvious\" that AI could transform PR.\n\nCuban didn't respond to Joseph's pitch right away. The next day, the entrepreneur followed up, adding that he's backed by Dan Pfeiffer, co-host of the popular politics show \"Pod Save America.\"\n\nThat same day, Cuban responded. He requested a sample report for his own name to demonstrate the tech in action. He also asked how Clipbook differed from Google Alerts and wanted to know what the founder was seeking from him — and under what terms. From there, Joseph and Cuban traded a few more emails and hopped on a call. Soon after, they reached a deal, Joseph said.\n\n\"It moved more aggressively and faster with Mark than I expected,\" Joseph later said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nJoseph said Cuban vetted him, not just the business.\n\n\"He was just really doing a 360, just pressure-testing the business,\" Joseph said. \"But I think more importantly, probably, pressure-testing me as an entrepreneur. So the fact that he had come in pretty hot with some pretty aggressive questions I think was also really — it was really, actually, in retrospect, a really positive signal that he was very interested in the deal.\"\n\nBelow are email exchanges between Joseph and Cuban, which Joseph shared with Business Insider. Cuban gave Business Insider permission to publish their content. The original text and formatting have been preserved, with small modifications for clarity. Certain sensitive information, like email addresses and Clipbook's revenue, has been redacted.",

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nathan Wangliao Yinan, the CEO and cofounder of Singapore-based AI startup Havana. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history.\n\nAfter university, I didn't have the risk appetite to start something immediately. I joined McKinsey in the UK in 2018 because they actively encouraged me to do something different after two years there.\n\nI was at McKinsey for slightly under three years. I met a lot of people who were from different walks of life, and that made me feel it's OK to go and do different things.\n\nMy first manager had been a doctor in the UK who left practice because she felt the healthcare system was broken. She joined McKinsey to do healthcare work. One of my favorite bosses had been in the US Marines and went to Iraq. He did an MBA and joined the firm after that.\n\nI moved back to Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and McKinsey became less fun because everything was remote. The thing I enjoyed most — the people — began to decline.\n\nI knew I wanted to start something, but I realized I was pushing it off because it was hard to make a move during the pandemic. At some point, it felt like I was doing my job out of inertia.\n\nI left McKinsey in 2021 at the age of 27 and worked at a Singapore-based AI startup for two years, leading the go-to-market strategy.\n\nI went from being in a huge office with all kinds of perks to being in a coworking space with just two other people, and we had to figure everything out from scratch.\n\nI told my founder in the first month, \"Maybe I should just go back to McKinsey because this feels too scary.\" I don't know if the company will be around in a year. What if I need to look for a job?\n\nA lot of it is irrational because, honestly, we raised a lot of money, and we were a good company, and I'm sure I could find a job.\n\nThe startup was acquired in 2023, and I cofounded Havana, a startup specializing in AI agents for student recruitment and enrollment teams.\n\nI was told that the most important and hardest thing in a startup is managing my own psychology.\n\nIt's not learning how to build a new product or how to sell. If you are able to manage your psychology, then you will have the morale to learn all these things. As long as you work hard and you're capable, anyone can figure these things out. Most people, at some point, lose morale, or they just feel like it sucks too much.\n\nThere are a lot of things that can distract you. You can think, \"Oh, my other friends are doing X, Y, Z, and their life seems easier.\" You have to learn to shut down these distracting thoughts when you are in a career with a lot of openness and uncertainty.\n\nThe most important skill I learned at McKinsey is how to navigate clients.\n\nTypically, they are more senior and older than us. They have multiple departments, and you need to know how to run a meeting efficiently and understand everyone's needs. The startup that I'm running now sells to universities, which are bigger than us, so that's a useful skill.\n\nConsulting also trained me to be organized and structured. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly and do things fast because timelines are always tight.\n\nThere are also some things I had to unlearn. Consultants are trained to overanalyze and rely on data to figure out the most optimal solution. That's OK for big companies.\n\nIn a startup, when you're trying to make decisions, you'll never have enough data. You just have to have the guts to do one thing. If it doesn't work, go and do the second thing.\n\nWhen I first left consulting, I struggled with that. I would take a bit too long to try to get data, talk to more people, and read more books before choosing the right path.\n\nEarly on, we conducted customer interviews before building the product. My cofounder and I would spend a lot of time discussing: Is this the pain point we want to solve? Does this feel big enough? What's the first version of the product we should build?\n\nIt's very ambiguous, like trying to get some kind of instinct through research. Over time, we began building the product and attracting customers, and then a bit more rhythm emerged.\n\nNow, I don't feel like I have to have all the knowledge. I'm comfortable taking risks and making decisions.\n\nAs a startup founder, I've also gotten a lot more comfortable with speaking more. When I was at McKinsey, my managers would say I needed to speak up \n\nIf you run a business and are the only non-technical founder, you have to talk to customers every day. They expect you to show up with a point of view.\n\nDo you have a story to share about building a tech business in Asia? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",

    "description": "The oldest active wrestler is Big Japan Pro-Wrestling co-founder Great Kojika, who is currently in his 80s.",
    "fullText": "Professional wrestling is known to be exceptionally taxing on the body, making it all the more impressive when a performer is able to continue in the industry at an advanced age. North Americans like Mike Jackson and Chick Donovan are known as some of the oldest wrestlers who are still active, but there is one who has surpassed them: the Great Kojika.\n\nBorn in Japan in 1942, Shinya Koshika is 83 years old and, as of today, wrestled his most recent match in April 2025. Though he took a few years off, Kojika has been an active performer since 1963. He's known to be the final active wrestler who trained under Rikidōzan, one of the most monumental figures in pro wrestling history.\n\nMany familiar with him would likely agree that Koshika's most iconic work was done in All Japan Pro-Wrestling, where he performed from 1973 through 1986, when he initially decided to retire. However, he was coaxed out of that retirement in 1995, and would eventually make his return to AJPW among other ventures.\n\nKojika's career wasn't just limited to Japan, either. From the 1960s into the '70s, Kojika wrestled for the NWA in the United States, sometimes performing as the unfortunately-named Mr. Kung-Fu, or Kung Fu Lee. Kojika's stateside opponents include Dory Funk Jr., Fritz von Erich, Bob Backlund, and Stan Hansen, among many others.\n\nIn 1973, he captured the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship for a time before dropping it to the legendary Terry Funk. Other titles held by Kojika over the years include the All Asia Tag Team Championship in AJPW, and the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship, plus numerous other tag and trio titles in Japan.\n\nIn the 1990s, after deciding to come out of in-ring retirement, Koshika also helped found Big Japan Pro Wrestling. The promotion remains active to this day, with Koshika as its President. Though he doesn't wrestle often, Kojika still gets in the ring from time to time, and he has yet to officially indicate his retirement.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Weeks later on January 20, reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 was released.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

They were also built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major US tech companies invest to build LLMs. The result: a massive sell-off on January 27 wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in tech stocks, including US$600 billion from Nvidia alone.\n\nAnalysts expected the momentum of Chinese AI companies to continue this year, thanks to Beijing's policy support, improved funding prospects, greater adoption of AI systems across industries and a growing number of talent being recruited for innovative projects.\n\nA domestic AI start-up's co-founder, who declined to be identified, predicted that China would overtake the US to become \"the world's leading AI power in 2027\". China's advantage was its deep talent pool, according to the co-founder.\n\nIn his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that the domestic market has \"many large AI models competing in a race to the top\", while new breakthroughs were being achieved in domestic semiconductor development. All of that \"has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest growing innovation capabilities\", Xi said.\n\nDeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng.

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian military leader on Putin’s hit-list conned the Kremlin out of $500,000 by faking his own death to collect the bounty, Kyiv revealed on Thursday.\n\nDenis Kapustin, a far-right military commander and founder of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a battalion of far-right Russians who fight for Ukraine against Putin, was reported to have been killed in a drone strike in Zaporizhia on December 27 after spending months atop the Kremlin’s most wanted list.\n\n“We will definitely avenge you, Denis,” the RVC wrote in a Telegram post ‘confirming’ Kapustin’s death. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nBut in a stunning twist, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) revealed on Thursday that the assassination of Kapustin, 41, had instead been part of an elaborate hoax cooked up by Kyiv to save the militia leader’s life and trick Russia into paying them a half-a-million dollar bounty that had been placed on his head.\n\n“Welcome back to life,” HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov announced in a video on January 1, congratulating Kapustin on bamboozling the Kremlin.\n\n“First of all, Mr. Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” he said. “I wish us all and you personally success.”\n\nBudanov, who described Kapustin as a “personal enemy” of Vladimir Putin, said the plot had taken more than a month to organize and that the commander would promptly return to the frontlines to continue his duties after swindling the Kremlin out of its cash.\n\nKapustin, better known by his callsign of ‘White Rex,’ also confirmed his role in the plot and said his “temporary absence” had not affected his unit’s effectiveness on the battlefield.\n\n“I am ready to move to the area of operations and continue commanding the RDK,” he said.\n\nFormed in 2022, the RVC was one of several international brigades composed of dissident Russians who took up arms against Putin and played a key role in cross-border excursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut Kapustin, who has been formally named a terrorist by the Russian government, has long been considered a controversial ally to Ukraine due to his association with several neo-Nazi and far-right groups, which saw him banned from entering almost the entire European Union, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, in 2019 because of his extremist views.\n\nThe RVC describes its members as holding “conservative views and traditionalist beliefs” but has denied accusations of neo-Nazism, instead claiming their goal is to establish a “true nation-state for Russians” that “lives in peace with the nations that surround it.”\n\n“I have my set of views, it’s a patriotic set of views, it’s a traditionalist set of views, it’s a right-wing set of views,” Kapustin told Al Jazeera in 2023.\n\n“You’ll never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you’ll never find me raising my hand in a Hitler sign. So why would you call me that?”",

It's helped to carry this market in 2025. I'm curious how you how you see that AI trade and trend evolving in 2026, Tom.\n\nGood afternoon, Josh. Thank you very much for having me on and happy New Year to everyone. Yeah, so, so we sort of described four pillars of the rally and the most important and first one as you said is AI. and it's really been a rising tide that's lifted all boats, not just this year, but for the past three and a half years, really. But we think that's changing a little bit in 2026. and importantly, it doesn't mean it's necessarily going away, but instead, I think the sort of AI enthusiasm is going to look a lot more like Q4 than it did say Q2 and Q3. and what I mean by that is that it's fractured. So we're not going to have every single tech stock just running away. It's going to become a selection of winners, say like your Micron, and then maybe some losers, like your Oracle and to a point Qualcomm. and I'm not saying to those stocks specifically into 2026, but more as an example that we're going to have to be selective as AI matures.\n\nWell, let me ask you, if AI is sort of more fractured next year, you know, if I'm a viewer or I'm an investor, I'm listening to that. How do I discern, Tom, then the winners and losers in this AI fractured world you're describing?\n\nSo for me, I look at AI as sort of a cycle that's maturing, right? And really the first stage was sort of it was it was the epiphany stage, right? Oh my gosh, we can do this. And then in order to do this, the first thing we need is semiconductors. And now we're going to run out and buy all the semiconductors that we can and obviously Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi have benefited fantastically from this. I see it evolving a bit now into those that those companies that are really taking the leading edge. Probably my top AI pick for 2026 is Google. I like Gemini 3. I think their advantage on search gives them a huge uh sort of chip in the game against Open AI. So I like Google from a search standpoint. I also like the memory because that's sort of the next stage of this data center build out, right? We need the compute power. Well now all of a sudden we need all the memory to power all that we need. So I see it more of an infrastructure play evolving uh towards memory on the infrastructure side, but then also from sort of the hyperscalers, I really like Google uh with YouTube and then with Gemini 3.",

    "fullText": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary has learned many things from the CEOs and world leaders he rubs shoulders with, but one of his most important daily rituals comes from an iconic innovator: Steve Jobs.\n\nO'Leary told Business Insider that a goal technique he uses every day came straight from studying the Apple founder. He picked it up after working alongside Jobs in the mid-1990s, when O'Leary's educational software company The Learning Company was working with Apple to get the Mac computer into schools.\n\n\"He believed that you needed to do three things, and you had to get them done every day,\" O'Leary said of Jobs.\n\n\"You need a ratio of at least 70% signal, which are the three things, and the 30% can be noise — whatever is going to stop you from getting the three things done,\" he continued. \"So I pick three things I want to get done that day, and I don't let anything get in the way until those three things are done.\"\n\nO'Leary said one of the three things he has to do every day is exercise. He usually wakes up at 5 a.m. and works out for over an hour, usually biking about 12 miles.\n\n\"I have to do that; otherwise, bad things happen,\" he said.\n\nOn the noise side, part of the 30% that gets in O'Leary's way is his overflowing inbox. It's become such a distraction that he's stopped trying to keep up with email.\n\n\"I don't do emails anymore because I get anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 a day,\" O'Leary said. \"I've tried every system to take the crap out, but over the years, my email address has gotten out there, and so it's just a constant stream of noise and garbage. As we speak, I see the emails just pouring in. I'm never going to get to them, so I don't try.\"\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" star says in his line of work, it's best to focus on what he really wants to accomplish and block out all the noise.\n\n\"In entrepreneurship, and certainly in what I do today as an investor, there is no holiday, there's no workday — that doesn't exist,\" O'Leary said. \"It's what you want to do with your time.\"",

    "description": "Chip Wilson, Lululemon's founder, isn't afraid to speak his mind about his former company, which he still holds an 8% stake in.",
    "fullText": "Lululemon's outspoken founder is used to making headlines with his interviews.\n\nDennis \"Chip\" Wilson founded the athleisure brand in 1998 and left the company in 2013 after a series of controversial remarks. Since his departure, the 70-year-old billionaire has continued to express his opinions about the brand.\n\nWith an 8% stake in the company, Wilson's wealth remains tied to Lululemon's performance. With shares underperforming compared to its peers over the last two years and a CEO set to leave in 2026, Lululemon is facing some challenges entering the new year.\n\nOn Monday, Wilson launched a proxy battle by nominating three new board members.\n\n\"My passion for the Lululemon Athletica muse has never changed, but I know this campaign for change cannot be about me,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"It is about recommitting Lululemon to genuine creative leadership that will re-establish a brand of enduring strength.\"\n\nLululemon released a statement in response to Wilson's nominations.\n\n\"Mr. Wilson has not been involved with the company for a decade, and since his departure, Lululemon has continued to adapt to the marketplace and lead the industry, building one of the most compelling growth stories in retail,\" the company said.\n\nHere are some quotes that show what Wilson has said publicly about Lululemon since leaving the company.\n\nLululemon said in December that CEO Calvin McDonald would leave his role at the end of January 2026 and named CFO Meghan Frank and CCO André Maestrini as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement.\n\nWilson was quick to criticize the change.\n\n\"As one of the largest active shareholders of Lululemon, I am deeply concerned about what appears to be a tremendous failure by the board to competently plan for the future and manage an effective succession process,\" Wilson said in a statement the day after the company's announcement.\n\nIn his statement announcing his board nominations on December 29, Wilson said that \"shareholders have no faith\" in the current board's ability to select a new CEO.\n\nIn October, Wilson penned an ad in The Wall Street Journal to criticize the athleisure brand's performance.\n\nIn the ad, he described Lululemon's \"loss of cool,\" blaming \"financed focused CEOs\" who, he said, don't know how to attract or motivate talent or understand great products.\n\nHe also compared Lululemon's \"decline\" to a \"plane crash\" and a \"sinking ship.\"\n\n\"Lululemon forgot its muse: the woman who inspires culture, not just follows it,\" he wrote.\n\nWilson implored the brand to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\"\n\nIn a Forbes interview published in January 2024, Wilson slammed the company's ads for featuring models that he described as \"sickly,\" \"unhealthy,\" and \"not inspirational.\"\n\n\"They're trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody,\" he said. \"And I think the definition of a brand is that you're not everything to everybody.\"\n\nHe also told the publication he didn't agree with Lululemon's \"whole diversity and inclusion thing.\"\n\nWilson previously sparked controversy when he was chairman of Lululemon for other remarks that suggested Lululemon was not for everyone.\n\nIn 2013, in response to criticism about Lululemon's leggings being too sheer, he told Bloomberg TV, \"Frankly, some women's bodies just don't actually work for it … It's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it.\"\n\nHe stepped down as chairman of the company shortly after. He'd resigned as CEO in 2007.\n\n\"Chip Wilson does not speak for Lululemon, and his comments do not reflect our company views or beliefs,\" Lululemon said in a public statement around the time.\n\nWilson has been adamant that Lululemon should focus on its core demographic.\n\n\"Our success was exactly that 32-year-old single professional woman — highly disposable income, very fashionable, athletic,\" Wilson told Tony Robbins in an interview published in 2023.\n\nIn the 2023 interview with Robbins, Wilson gave Lululemon props for having an \"unbeatable\" economic engine.\n\n\"Nobody's been able to replicate the muscle of this vertical retailing model, which costs so much money to get into,\" he said.\n\nThe vertical retailing model, adopted by other athletic brands like On Running, eliminates third-party retailers like Foot Locker or Macy's from the business plan.\n\nWilson spoke in the 2023 interview with Robbins about the tension he had with board members before stepping down as chairman in 2013. He described them as \"Wall Street people\" who lacked creativity.\n\n\"Somebody in here has gotta stand for the employees. Somebody has gotta stand for the quality of the product. Nobody in here cares about it,\" Wilson said he told the board.\n\nHe said those remarks led to his departure.\n\n\"'I think you should all fire yourselves,'\" he said. \"And they fired me.\"\n\nIt is common for public companies to elect new board members regularly, and many of Lululemon's board of directors have changed since Wilson's remarks.",

    "fullText": "“Every driver has a limit.  Mine is a little bit further than others.”\n\n— Ayrton Senna, greatest Formula One driver of all time\n‍\n\n“I’m not funny.  What I am is brave.”\n\n— Lucille Ball, greatest female comedian of all time\n‍\n\n“I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.”\n\n“I can outlearn you.  \nI can outread you.  \nI can outthink you.  \nAnd I can outphilosophize you.”\n\n— Robert De Niro as Max Cady, Cape Fear‍\n‍\n\n“I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.”\n\n— Michael Scott, The Office, on how Bayesians form priors\n‍\n\nThe greatest treasure hunters know that the treasure they seek is not lost. It is waiting.\n\nStarting in 1969 and for 5,954 straight days, treasure hunter Mel Fisher sought what was waiting for him: the wreckage of the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, a Spanish galleon that sunk in 1622.\n\nHow do you recruit, retain, and motivate a crew when you are not sure when you will find the treasure, if you will find the treasure, or what the treasure will be worth? Fisher developed a powerful operating philosophy, captured in its entirety with three amazing words.\n\nEvery morning, for 16 years, Mel Fisher banged pots and pans in the pre-sunrise to rouse his crew, shouting and smiling, “Today’s the day, men. Today’s the day.”\n\nEventually it was true. On July 20, 1985, Mel and his crew discovered the most valuable shipwreck in history, 70 miles off the coast of Key West. The Atocha yielded gold and silver today worth more than $10 billion.\n\nFisher’s “today’s the day” philosophy reframed what could have otherwise been a mentally tortuous journey – will we ever find the treasure? Is it even here? – into daily play characterized by disciplined guessing, dispassionate refinement, and the singular goal of ending the day less wrong.\n\nFisher had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, as we will see, his operating philosophy, and its daily ritual of iteration, was textbook Bayesian. Fisher also settled – for me – a foundationally important debate I had struggled with about the philosophy of probability theory which, in turn, provided me with an operating manual for leadership.\n\nArriving at the University of Chicago’s Ph.D. program in 1991, I, like Fisher, had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, exposure the first day of my first class turned into a wandering, wondering, and still unabated obsession. I left the program five years later with a Ph.D. in Bayesian statistics (and finance), and my career has essentially been a three-decade extension of what I learned at Chicago. I now do Bayesian treasure hunting for a living.\n\nFancy math aside, the foundational idea of Bayesian statistics is simply learning from experience. Things get started with a “prior distribution”, which is what you think you know about what you want to know – for example, “Where is the treasure?” That “prior” is mixed with observable data – experience – to form a “posterior distribution”, a structured mashup of your prior and the data you collected.  The posterior represents your new view of what you want to know – for example, “I now know the treasure is not over there.”i\n\nThe power of Bayesian statistics is in the trade-off inherent in the framework. How much do you listen to your pre-wisdom intuition before it is enhanced by the data you collect, knowing your pre-data knowledge is limited, at best? How much do you listen to your new data, especially if it contradicts your pre-data intuition, knowing your limited sample may not lead you closer to the treasure, and might even throw you off the trail?\n\nWhen done with mastery, Bayesian statistics is a beautiful, egoless, daily practice of being less wrong.\n\nIn hindsight, every incoming University of Chicago Ph.D. student in 1991 – our collaborative little group of intellectually hungry sponges – was susceptible to becoming a Bayesian. Arnold Zellner, a giant in the history of Bayesian econometrics, towered, gently, over the business school’s statistics department, having just been named President of the American Statistical Association and – to me – a hilarious, wonderful, deeply caring professor. And though my own research was – and still is – focused on empirical asset pricing, my six-man dissertation committee ended up including four Bayesian statisticians, each a legend in the field.\n\nI recall as if it were yesterday my dissertation co-chairman Rob McCulloch teaching me that the Bayesian-required question “how do we set our priors?” illuminated a philosophical debate, still raging, about probability theory because that simple question is akin to asking, “What can we know prior to knowing?” I thought about that deeply for years.\n\nStudying Fisher, and treasure hunting, I now know that the answer is, often, a lot.\n\n“What’s an expert anyway? Just some guy from out of town.”\n\nConsider that Fisher knew to search off the coast of Florida and not, say, Australia. How? During his pre-search research at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Fisher discovered a faded 1622 salvage account describing the treasure fleet’s loss and references to survivors setting up camp in Cayos del Marques, or Key Largo today. So, Fisher’s prior variance was very large to start – search the Florida Keys – but not practically infinite – search all 140 million square miles of water on the surface of the planet.ii\n\nKnowing roughly where the Atocha sank and roughly the seasonal path of the current – that is, knowing prior to knowing before collecting any data from the sea – Fisher literally, and massively, shrunk the problem. Bayesian shrinkage, a foundational element of Bayesian statistics, involves pulling in especially noisy estimates – say, all oceans on Earth – closer to a central value – say, water off the coast of Florida. My dissertation – which applied new computational techniques in Bayesian shrinkage to old problems in finance – helped me see Fisher as a Bayesian.\n\nEvery day, Fisher, like any good Bayesian, updated his prior guess of where the Atocha was with data about where it definitely was not. Every day Fisher became a little less wrong.\n\nIn finding the Atocha in 16 years – and not 60, or never – Fisher adhered to Bayesian-adjacent principles that Alec Litowitz, founder of Magnetar Capital, and my former boss and mentor, writes about in his forthcoming and fascinating field guide for success, The Adaptability Quotient: Rewiring Your Mind for Success in the Next Human Era:\n\n“Confirmation bias is the worst enemy of iteration.  In a Bayesian system, it’s fatal. If you only accept the data that supports your hypothesis, you’re not updating – you’re entrenching. The people who learn fastest are the ones who are most willing to be wrong…with the humility to trade conviction for information, one update at a time.”\n\nFisher let the data speak and learned fast. In 1973, he found silver bars and coins matching the Atocha’s manifest.  Less wrong. Two years later, he discovered bronze cannons with Atocha markings. Even less wrong. Ten years after that, the motherlode. Absolutely right.\n\nAs students of the great Chicago Bayesians, we at Stone Ridge seek continual improvement in the speed of unbiased iterations. We are trained to privately ask ourselves, “Was I less wrong today?” Our progress depends on our eruptions of good questions, and truly listening to the answers. We would rather look dumb by asking, than not ask and be dumb. People forget if you looked dumb. They do not if you are.\n\nAs students of the great Bayesian Fisher, we at Stone Ridge know that success is not always linked to intelligence, boldness, or experience, but does consistently follow those most adaptive. In Litowitz-speak, it is not just IQ or EQ that matters, but AQ – adaptability quotient – a way of thinking that prioritizes learning over being right, and structure over rigidity. When the terrain shifts, do you update or insist?\n\nUpdating our prior – Chicago – with our data – Fisher – allows us to graduate with an extraordinarily valuable posterior because it contains X-marks-the-spot wisdom: markets overpay for stories of the future and underpay for hidden treasures of the past. That single Chicago-Fisherian insight caused us to make $3 billion in uncorrelated trading profits this year and $10 billion the last three. To see how, let’s go Bayesian treasure hunting and discover what awaits us buried in old reinsurance balance sheets and ancient Arkansas rock.\n\nIn 2023, amidst intense diligence for what ultimately became a $3 billion purchase of PDPsiii  in Arkansas’ Fayetteville Shale, we noticed that of the 860,000 acres included in the deal, 800,000 were covered with PDPs and 60,000 – all adjacent – were covered with grass. That’s a lot of undeveloped land.\n\n“Why are there no drilling rigs here?”\n\nWe decided to park our one major unanswered diligence question for the sake of efficiency, once convinced our PDP-only purchase could deliver our target returns.\n\nTwo years later, after taking over operations of the 5,596 wells we purchased – and our internally reframed responsibility of powering the homes of four million American families – the question resurfaced. “Why are there no rigs here?”\n\nThis time we could not shake it.\n\nWe learned that no one had drilled anything new for almost a decade, odd for a basin that size. A little stitious, we wondered, “Does treasure await?”\n\nWe suspected the previous owner’s “denominator problem” could explain their lack of drilling. They were an enormous company. Any marginal improvements in Fayetteville, despite being potentially large in dollar terms, would likely not move the needle in ROE, their north star.  In contrast, Stone Ridge operates every day with a “no basis point left behind” mindset. One basis point is our north star.  And, to us, large dollars will always be large dollars.\n\nWe also learned that two important aspects of drilling changed in the past decade: technologyiv and cost. Completion – the act of getting a drilled well to the point that gas steadily comes out of the ground for commercial purposes – now benefits from better drills, smarter rigs, more powerful fleets, and advanced digital control systems. And following a version of Moore’s Law, the new and better technology continually costs a lot less.\n\nWe decided to run a tightly controlled test program on our undeveloped land, drilling new wells, seeking fast, unbiased iterations, and updating – and hopefully tightening – the variance of our Bayesian prior – every day. Was there untapped gas under our 60,000 acres of grass? If so, where? If so, how much?\n\nOur approach was surgical. Two pads, five wells, disciplined design, unbiased data analysis, and adherence to the following mathematical identity.\n\nDrilling for natural gas ≡ searching for buried treasure in ancient rock\n\nThough we did not shout “today’s the day” every morning during our Fayetteville testing, we did feel Fisher-like energy as our ignorance shrank. Less wrong. Even less wrong. Absolutely right.\n\nEureka!  We found Fisher-like treasure.\n\nComposed of oil and gas, not gold and silver, our no-less-precious motherlode means that the $10 billion lifetime revenue we originally expected in Fayetteville now looks more like $15 billion. Discovering half an Atocha caused us to immediately shrink our priors in all seven U.S. basins we operate, a technical Bayesian statistical concept called “borrowing strength.” Our philosophy of probability theory, concretely applied to our Fayetteville test results, allowed us – with powerful practical efficiency – to know without knowing in the not-yet-tested basins. Less wrong.\n\nWe are now in the process of learning as much as is known about drilling before tapping our AQ to push the limit “a little further than others” and get closer to what is knowable. Every day counts because there’s gold oil and gas in them thar hills. It is waiting.\n\n“It may seem difficult at first, but all things are difficult at first.”\n\n— Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings\n\nIn launching our energy franchise almost five years ago, we assumed our breakthroughs in proprietary financing and hedging technology – and the resulting material edge in our cost of funds – were sufficient conditions for best-in-class investment performance. We quickly and painfully learned, however, that financial sophistication cannot substitute for industrial control. In energy markets, physics – not finance – sets the tuition entrepreneurs must pay.\n\nA bit chastened, we updated our prior and then – fortuitously – met Flywheel Energy, by far the best operators in the industry, due in part to their entire executive team’s roots in elite military operations. Flywheel is now part of Stone Ridge.\n\nUnder Flywheel’s peerless leadership, and an unbeatable team of 794 superstars – including 569 in the field – we now operate our wells ourselves. With every colleague crisply aligned on, and unambiguously individually responsible for their specific part, maximizing a singular metric – total dollars of operating profit – physics and finance are now in sync. Industry-leading results have followed.\n\nSince inception, Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) has purchased almost $11 billion of energy assets, all via proprietary securitizations – no bankers, no information leakage, no fee leakage. Over that period, spot natural gas has traveled in a staggeringly wide and volatile range of $1.50/MMBtu to almost $9/MMBtu. Yet, across thirteen equity tranches, the integrated precision of Flywheel physics + Stone Ridge finance has produced >20%/year, with low volatility, and no correlation to anything.v\n\n“Never was a finer canvas presented to work on than our countrymen. All of them engaged in the pursuits of honest industry, independent in their circumstances, enlightened as to their rights, and firm in their habits of order.”\n\n— Thomas Jefferson in a letter to James Madison, 1796\n\nThe U.S. shale revolution required three actors, working in concert. First, unlimited underground supply of hydrocarbons. Second, technological breakthroughs to access it. Third, profit-seeking capital. Leveraging nature for the first part, SRE brings fresh thinking to the rest.\n\nPlay the tape forward five years and I do not see SRE as a larger version of what we are today. I see a different kind of company. SRE has a chance to matter in the same practical, civic way that a major rail line or a modern port matters. I would like us to.\n\nAt our pace of disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and unrelenting process improvement, SRE will be a top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons. Managing that level of capital and molecule movement at our extraordinary level of operational excellence would meaningfully impact U.S. families, U.S. factories, and the competitiveness of this country. I would like us to.\n\nMore than 99% of the capital we manage at Stone Ridge, including SRE, comes from American investors. At our scale, that cannot happen by accident. At Stone Ridge, American capital produces American treasure.\n\nOn average and over time, treasure hunting in the sea is not a good business. Availability bias blinds us to the fact that for every Mel Fisher, dozens of others strike out. In fact, any too narrowly defined business is not a good business over a long enough time horizon.  Meta and abstract? No, Bayesian and practical. When the terrain shifts and you insist, your business surface area too is limited even for efficient Bayesian updating to help. In Litowitz-speak, your confirmation bias is fatal. It is just a matter of time.\n\nConsider legacy reinsurance. In contrast to prospective quota shares – aligned, partnership trades in which Stone Ridge shares risk pro rata with leading reinsurers, tapping into their masterful Bayesian updating cycle management skills across dozens of lines of business – legacy trades transfer retrospective risk from (re)insurance policies written years or decades ago.\n\nThe performance of legacy-only reinsurers is like that of lenders to too narrowly defined monoline credit originators (think: “only sub-prime auto” or “only UK small business”). Victims of confirmation bias’s siren song, monolines always – yes, always – originate unprofitable loans at the wrong time in the cycle.\n\nHealth warning: beware lending to monolines. When tight spreads persist, they insist.\n\nHealth warning: beware investing in legacy-only reinsurers. Confirmation bias dooms the business model and, along the way, guillotine-level adverse selection hangs over every trade. When a one-off risk-transfer price is highly attractive for clear and imperative strategic reasons, hyper-selective, non-legacy-only investors can profitably escape with their heads, but at Stone Ridge we know half-priced sushi does not mean it’s a bargain.\n\nA decade ago, there were about a dozen dedicated legacy firms and funds. Today, one large player remains, though recently its credibility detonated after initiating litigation against a client. The other remaining legacy-only firms are subscale or regionally focused. Enter Longtail Re.\n\nHumble beginnings, a clear vision\n\nStone Ridge began Longtail Re in 2020 focused on two simple ideas: 1) partner, not compete with the world’s best underwriters to generate a portfolio of hyper-diversified casualty liabilities that deliver low-cost float, and 2) invest that float in proprietary and valuable Stone Ridge-generated fixed income assets with superior risk-adjusted expected return.\n\nAlways open to Bayesian updating of its prior distribution core business model of prospective quota shares, Longtail Re’s positioning has always been: be available for new data and a reshaped posterior legacy transactions from motivated parties we know well and who call us, but do not be in the legacy business.\n\nOut of almost 100 legacy trade requests since inception, Longtail has written…three. Three.\n\nLongtail executed one of those three in November, a record $1.4 billion retrospective reinsurance transaction with Everest Group, an S&P 500 company, with whom Stone Ridge has an excellent, 13-year, uninterrupted trading relationship. Everest had compelling corporate reasons to de-risk, and the transaction with us, albeit enormous in the legacy space, was only one part of an even larger clear and imperative strategic repositioning of their entire firm. And of non-negotiable importance to us, we know (for many years), like, and trust Everest’s new CEO.\n\nThe trade has an outstanding expected return profile and diversifies Longtail’s core prospective portfolio because it covers past underwriting years back to 2003. It was also the largest legacy trade of Longtail CEO Mike Sapnar’s career, and mine.\n\nOn their most recent earnings call, Everest’s CEO said, “I was really, really glad that we were able to do this transaction with Longtail Re and Mike Sapnar...those are super credible underwriters. They did an excellent job evaluating the portfolio…it got to economics that will be very, very good for Longtail Re.” We agree.\n\nAs only Bayesian treasure hunting reinsurance geeks can, we internally renamed the core trade of the legacy reinsurance industry – a Loss Portfolio Transfer or LPT – to WPT. Waiting Portfolio Treasure.  Recall I said geeks. And who wants losses?\n\nLongtail ends 2025 with more than $6 billion in assets, about ⅓ from WPT, up from zero WPT 18 months ago.  Most important, Longtail has delivered 20% annualized ROE since inception in 2020, 16%/year higher than the average of the top three global reinsurers, our aspirational peer group in the decades ahead.\n\nLongtail may do its next legacy trade in two years, or five, or never. In recent pre-search research, we discovered a faded 1622 salvage account in Seville – aka PwC’s Annual Global Insurance Run-Off Survey – suggesting about $1 trillion of WPT may be out there, somewhere, buried in old reinsurance balance sheets. Our Bayesian training tells us about 97 out of 100 legacy treasure hunts would be for fool’s gold, but also that about $30 billion of real treasure awaits. I’m betting on Longtail’s Bayesian treasure hunters to find it.\n\nJust last year, The Atlantic wrote, “15 years into its existence, bitcoin has yet to demonstrate any serious use case.”vi\n\n87% of humans today – though definitely no one who edits articles at The Atlantic – were born into a monetary system without a reserve currency, and also without democracy, rule of law, or property rights. Simply put, the way The Atlantic editors use money is not the way most people on earth use money, whose savings technology is either collapsing paper notes, cattle, or sheet metal.\n\nSeething with financial privilege, The Atlantic editors might debate the relative merits of saving in NVDA vs. AMZN. How about, instead, cattle vs. sheet metal?\n\nIf bitcoin has no use case, perhaps The Atlantic editors should convert their entire life savings into Malawian Kwacha and see how it goes. In 2023, Malawi – generally considered a democratic country – chose a 44% overnight currency devaluation. And…it’s gone.vii If you don’t hold bitcoin, please step out of the line. This line is for people who have money. Not fiat credit.\n\nNo one got to vote on the inhuman cruelty of almost halving – overnight – the cumulative value of their entire life’s work. Instead, the criminal counterfeiters central bank forced The Atlantic editors 22 million humans to invest their life savings in unbacked pieces of paper with zero marginal production cost, turning them, ex-post, into 44% slaves. Nothing produced limitlessly and for free can ever, eventually, have value. Fiat is always and everywhere a ponzi phenomenon with seigniorage the State’s irresistibly silent Madoff-like pitch. Bitcoin, its kryptonite, will never take the meeting.\n\nStill no use case? Let’s try another one.\n\n“There isn’t a single goddamn thing that bitcoin can do for retail that Apple Pay doesn’t already do 10x better.”\n\n— The Atlantic editors bitcoin critic on Twitter (2019)\n\n“I CAN’T use Apple pay/PayPal/Visa/Master or anything like them.  \nI’m from Iran\nI CAN use bitcoin\nWhat do you have to say?!\"\n\n— Ziya Sadr, Iranian human rights activist subsequently jailed for freedom advocacy (recently released)\n\nThe critic issued a public apology.\n\nStill no use case? Before we try a final one, a Stoic parable about awe can provide some context:\n\nWhen we were very young, the world was an awe-inspiring place. Watch a three-year-old watch her dad fill up a castle-shaped bucket with wet sand at the beach. She is fascinated that her father would do such a thing, but when he inverts the bucket and carefully lifts it up – revealing a perfect sandcastle – the three-year-old is awestruck that such magic is possible and that her father has power to perform that magic.\n\nIf we meet that three-year-old ten years later, maybe she has 25% of the capacity for awe she had that day at the beach.\n\nAnd ten years after that, her capacity for awe might be down to 1% of its sandcastle level.viii\n\nIn one of the most moving days of my life, on December 10th in Oslo I got to attend the very intimate award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize. My battery capacity for awe recharged to 100%.\n\nMaría Corina Machado won for her decades-long commitment to freedom, democracy, and human dignity in Venezuela.  In 2023, with more than one-third of her country’s 30 million citizens having fled to survive – the largest refugee population in the world – Machado decided to run for President against the brutal dictator Maduro, her campaign the personification of ultimate bravery.\n\n“Traveling by road and dirt path across a country with gasoline shortages, daily blackouts, and collapsing communications,”ix  Machado risked her life just to campaign. On July 28, 2024, her supporters risked theirs just to vote. In a nationwide eruption of truth, Machado won in a landslide.x  The repressive Maduro regime ignored the results, clung to power illegally, and forced Machado into hiding.\n\nThey tried to bury us.\nThey didn’t know we were seeds.\n\nIn late 2024, from a secret location, Machado was interviewed by the Human Rights Foundation’s (HRF) Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, saying,\n\n“The world knows of Chavez and Maduro's human rights abuses, but less about their violations of financial rights, turning a functional economy into a catastrophic financial crisis. In 2018, inflation reached 1.7 million percent. This financial repression rooted in state sponsored looting, theft, and money printing happened despite our vast natural resources.\n\nBeyond wrecking the currency, the regime weaponized financial systems against its people, freezing accounts, seizing assets, and cutting off services. Venezuelans found a lifeline in bitcoin during hyperinflation, using it to protect their wealth and to finance their escape. Today, bitcoin bypasses government-imposed exchange rates and thus helps many of our people. It has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance. We are grateful for the lifeline bitcoin provides and look forward to embracing it in a new democratic Venezuela. We envision bitcoin becoming part of our national reserves, helping rebuild what the dictatorship stole. Before our gold reserves were plundered, Venezuela had wealthy financial reserves worldwide. We will restore those reserves and include bitcoin as a key component.\n\nUnlike bank wires, which the regime blocks, bitcoin donations cannot be seized. Let's use this technology to bring about the change Venezuela desperately needs.\n\nWe are determined to assert our sovereignty and transform Venezuela into an open, prosperous, and secure society, something that is only possible in a free nation.”\n\nWe await The Atlantic’s public apology.\n\nUpon news of her Nobel win, Machado began plotting her escape from hiding. She wanted to be in Oslo as a symbol for her people and the world. When it was time, Machado – in a wigged disguise and under the cover of dark – left her jungle hiding spot, evaded multiple regime checkpoints, took a tiny fishing boat through treacherous waters, and finally – miraculously – boarded a supporter’s private plane to make it to Oslo. It would be impossible to overstate the danger Machado faced to escape.\n\nAlmost immediately upon landing, at 3am local time – after hugging her family, or anyone, for the first time since she had gone into hiding 16 months earlier, and in the same clothes she began her now immensely historic day – Machado sat for an interview with BBC News.xi\n\nI immediately noticed she sounded different.\n\nAlready the world’s most inspirational living human rights activist, some transcendent combination of her time in hiding, winning the Nobel, and successful escape gave Machado’s tone, timbre, and bearing a Mandela-like ascendence and regality. She spoke with extraordinary moral authority and absolute certainty about future events, words coming through her with divine clarity, Machado now destined to become among the greatest female leaders of all time.\n\n“Venezuela has turned into a nation in which the state applies terrorism. The regime has control of all institutions and has applied state terrorism towards innocent people and committed crimes against humanity. And everybody that dares to speak out, to defend any of your basic rights, takes a huge risk and probably ends in prison. Just for posting news about the Nobel Prize, you will get in prison. And if they go looking for you and they don't find you in your house, they will take your family, even children in prison.\n\nSo, they had to say that I'm a terrorist, that I have to be in jail for the rest of my life, and they're looking for me. So, certainly, leaving Venezuela today in these circumstances is very, very dangerous. So, I just want to say today that I'm here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo. And I came here on behalf of them, and the millions of anonymous Venezuelan heroes to receive the prize and to take it back to them, because it's theirs.\n\nI'm going back to Venezuela. The Venezuelan government would have disappeared me if they found me when I was in Venezuela. And I know exactly the risks I'm taking. And what I've said to the Venezuelan people from the beginning is I'm going to be in the place where I am more useful for our cause. And until very short time ago, the place where I thought I had to be was Venezuela. The place where I believe I have to be today on behalf of our cause is Oslo.”\n\nIn his 1978 essay The Power of the Powerless, human rights activist Václav Havel – leader of the Velvet Revolution, first President of the post-Communist Czech Republic, and HRF’s first Chairman – makes the searing point that though authoritarians can mobilize their heavy artillery of terror, torture, imprisonment, and persecution, they are not equipped to fight the asymmetric battle between lies and truth.\n\nVenezuelan regime change can also be an asymmetric truth domino – the animating spark for revolutionary excitement, heroism, and power among the powerless – that then topples the other nearby dictators in Cuba and Nicaragua. That cumulative outcome would be of immense significance to America, and that possibility has been hugely motivational to me. For American global primacy to continue, which it must, this must be the Western Hemisphere’s century. No authoritarians allowed in the neighborhood.\n\nThe majority of my personal philanthropy is anonymous, and it will stay that way. However, in the hope of inspiring followershipxii  at this moment of maximum human rights gamma, I will share that I have long supported Alex Gladstein’s work arming the only people dictators fear – human rights activists – with large quantities of Satoshi’s unstoppable truth-telling weapon. Bitcoin is money dictators can’t stop. I know firsthand its importance to HRF.\n\nAsleep during Machado’s BBC News interview, I left Oslo a few hours later, hustling back to New York to host the Stone Ridge holiday party that evening. After landing, I saw, and then listened to, a voicenote attached to an encrypted message. Mouth agape, I recognized the voice immediately. With an ascendence and regality that moved me to tears by the end, here is the message in full:\n\nI want to thank you personally for your support of the Human Rights Foundation and all the programs that have made possible this unique moment in Oslo this week.\n\nBecause of your support I was able to move, to arrive where I needed to be and to continue to fight without interruption. You know in moments like these, logistics are the whole difference between presence and absence.\n\nI arrived late and I didn’t have a chance to thank you in person as I wanted, or to tell you about the plans we have in the time to come, but I know that we will have a chance to do that very soon. I want you to know that your personal commitment to our struggle for freedom translates directly into action.\n\nIt gives our people and people like us the ability to stand where it matters and when it matters so I am very, very grateful for your clarity of purpose, for your belief in freedom and certainly for your willingness to stand for this freedom in both practice and principle.\n\nI will not cease in this struggle for freedom, and I certainly look forward to welcoming you and hosting you and your family in our beautiful country and a free Venezuela.\n\nThank you for making so much happen. I look forward to seeing you and please take very good care.”\n\nBitcoin has a use case.  Human rights treasure.\n\nAnd with Machado walking among us, we need not live life devoid of feelings of awe.\n\nIn 1984 Apple, then still Apple Computer, premiered a sci-fi short film – a commercial at the Super Bowl – in which a rebellious heroine smashes a screen, symbolizing Apple breaking free from the conformity of IBM’s Big Brother. Widely considered the greatest commercial of all-time for almost four decades, it established Apple’s identity, paved the way for the Mac, and led to record sales.\n\nIn 2020, also at the Super Bowl, Apple was dethroned. New York Life premiered an even better commercial paving the way for the next chapter of its identity, also leading to record sales. Over the course of 60 emotional seconds, New York Life began by briefly exploring three Greek words for love (Philia, Storgē, Eros) to then focus on the fourth, Agape, or love as an action. The ad contained powerful scenes of care, including a ten-year-old boy lifting his little brother over a country fence en route to adventure, and a 50-year-old son lowering his frail 95-year-old father into a tub to help him bathe. The commercial anchored the firm’s 175th anniversary branding of building better futures through love and financial security.\n\nThe ancient Greeks had four words for love. The first is Philia. Philia is affection that grows from friendship. Next there’s Storgē, the kind you have for a grandparent. Or a brother. Third, there’s Eros, the uncontrollable urge to say, “I love you.” The fourth kind of love is different. It’s the most admirable. It’s called Agape: love as an action. It takes courage, sacrifice, strength; for 175 years we’ve been helping people act on their love so they can look back – or ahead – and say, “We got it right. We did good.”\n\nStone Ridge takes immense pride in working for the policyholders of New York Life, and also MassMutual, iconic American firms and our largest partners, 180-years-old and 174-years-old, respectively. Mutuals are special. They feel different inside. There is no conflict of interest between the shareholders and the policyholders because there are no shareholders. The policyholders own the firm, a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction. Employees stay for decades, and the top executives view themselves, appropriately and inspirationally to me, as leaders and stewards. My Stone Ridge colleagues and I run to work every day for New York Life and MassMutual. And we aspire for our little firm to be like those big guys when we grow up.\n\nSince any company’s longevity, on a long enough timescale, is entirely dependent on its ability to reinvent itself, the most underappreciated characteristic of these mutuals is their astonishing consistency of innovation. The typical firm in the S&P 500 is 58 years old, not 180. No business can do tomorrow what it did yesterday and last very long, let alone do in the next century what it did in the last.\n\nConsider that these mutuals paid claims during the Civil War when – remember, their core product is life insurance – their policyholders were shooting each other. They paid claims after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, decades before Hannover Re-quality earthquake seismologists could help them properly underwrite that risk. And they paid claims through the two global pandemics, twice surviving life insurers’ one true tail risk.\n\nExtraordinary financial strength, ironclad reliable claims payment, and a monumentally underrated culture of innovation = New York Life and MassMutual.\n\nWatching these reinventing mutuals up close has also taught me that firms seeking longevity – including Stone Ridge – must, just as importantly, decide what must not change. What is our air-gapped mission? What are the rituals we dare not cease?  What routines – the ones that make us us – shall we pass to new colleagues? In essence, what are we stewards of?\n\n“In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.”\n\n— Coco Chanel, revolutionary fashion designer\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all. Our rituals are few, important, and sacrosanct. Our routines drive our productivity.\n\nWe work five days/week in office and have a “no-device” policy in meetings, routines that maximize exposure to the uncorrelated weirdness of our spectacular coleagues. Fiddling with a device in a meeting means you do not belong in that meeting. Meetings should be rare, riveting, and short. Zero is the wrong number of meetings for a firm, but it is close. A meeting-less firm with 100 employees has 4,950 potential 1:1 colleague-collisions all day long. Remove 10% of the team for an unnecessary meeting and lose 945 potential collisions. That meeting-math is especially punishing at Stone Ridge. Our people are our moat, dug deeper per collision.\n\n“A lot of people never use their initiative because no one told them to.”\n\nInitiating collisions with insanely smart colleagues at Stone Ridge can seem intimidating at first, but you must take the initiative to ever create a map in which X marks the spot. My advice to my colleagues is the same advice I give to my 18- and 23-year-old boys.  Ask her out. Whether “she” is a hard class, a job, a city, a beautiful woman, or a brilliant Stone Ridge colleague – just go up and talk.xiv And remember, Stone Ridge colleagues are insanely kind too.\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we care deeply about how we present ourselves to outsiders because we matter, and so do they. When introducing ourselves in meetings, we mention our role and how long we have been at the firm. “Hi, I’m Ross Stevens, the CEO, and I’ve been at Stone Ridge since 2012.” After meetings, we walk our guests to the elevator, along the way sincerely thanking them for the visit. Sometimes we even take the elevator down with them so we can thank them some more. Finally, business cards are back. Business cards remind us we live in a tactile world, and our most tactile experiences are with other humans. Business cards also symbolize something of value – you. Our simple meeting routines honor ourselves and our firm and show proper respect to our visitors.\n\n“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”\n\nOver the last 36 months, three Stone Ridge colleagues voluntarily left to work at another firm. Each was junior in their career and had a ten-month average tenure with us. Clearly, Stone Ridge was not for them. We, in turn, reflected on what happened in each instance and refined our recruiting process, uninterested in transience in any element of our life’s work. Though Stone Ridge achieved, with plenty of room to spare, my singular KPI – less than 1%/year voluntary turnover – those three departures were exactly three too many to me. I intend to raise my game in 2026, so please tune in – same Bat-Time, same Bat-Channel – to see if I had a better year.\n\n“I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me.”\n\nDespite the three leavers, Stone Ridge got something very important, very right at firm inception: no HR. No HR is the gift that keeps on giving because the very best people are repelled by those addicted to comfort. When new folks arrive at Stone Ridge and realize we have no HR, a lens cap lifts off their consciousness. Surrounded by elite intellectual athletes, they immediately begin their training to be one, feeling compelled to do remarkable things, utterly untethered to what they previously thought possible. We teach them business physics, but also to feel bound by nothing. I would not dare limit their leaps even one inch with even one minute of an infantilizing HR training session.\n\n“He is no longer a dreamer.  He is a creator.”\n\n— Sculptor Auguste Rodin, describing his masterpiece The Thinker\n\nOne of my favorite untethered Stone Ridge policies is unlimited maternity leave, which has been true since the firm began. I think of Agape. It takes care and action to properly delegate your duties to your remaining colleagues while you enjoy that magical time with your family. In action and a bit of love, your colleagues lock arms and step up for you, so the firm does not miss a beat in your absence, the duration of which I refuse to meter. It also takes action and a bit of love to take no action. The awesome women of Stone Ridge know their job will be waiting for them when they get back. I sometimes wonder if that ever helps them decide to create more treasure.\n\n“It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how.”\n\n— Philosopher The Cat, on his approach to work in his masterpiece The Cat in the Hat\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we relentlessly focus on growing after-tax cash flow to drive durable equity value in our operating businesses. Our progress has never resembled a straight line up and to the right, and I hope it never does. However, thinking deeply about what we know before we know, open-mindedness to – and hunger for – new data, and extremely rapid posterior updating – and ultimately the courage to create with conviction when we believe it is time – have been the hallmarks of our operating model since firm inception.\n\nThe first rule of product design at Stone Ridge is we build products we want for ourselves. Stone Ridge is always the seed investor and, whenever possible – but not yet always – the largest. Consider our “no-device” policy in this context. Would you ever pull out your phone and start scrolling in the middle of a meeting with your largest investor? At Stone Ridge, we do not pull our phones out on each other.\n\nWith Stone Ridge increasingly Stone Ridge’s largest investor, the scale of our profits as principals, not agents, creates a level of alignment with our outside investors we are unaware exists elsewhere. Those investors occasionally remark that this is a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction, and that Stone Ridge feels different inside.\n\nEarlier this year, Stone Ridge Holdings Group (SRHG), parent company of Stone Ridge Asset Management, NYDIG, and Longtail Re, completed a significant primary equity financing led by an iconic American financial services firm – also a mutual, though this one a relatively spry 165-year-old – we are thrilled to partner with in the decades ahead.\n\nDespite regularly rising profitability, regularly raising primary equity for our parent and affiliates – $4.6 billion and counting, and only primary, ever – has been our quiet way of strengthening our most important partnerships, playing muscular defense when the sky falls in our markets, and playing profitable post-event offense in the aftermath.\n\nFounding 2012 SRHG investors have received 32x their original investment in distributions and now own equity valued up 178x net of those distributions, an annualized total return of 50%.  Fisher took 5,954 days to find the Atocha. We have been at it for 4,930. Every morning, I bang our little ship’s pots and pans with a smile because I know Stone Ridge will find the treasure.\n\nAs we enter 2026, our tanks are filled with energy, gratitude, and inspiration. We innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all.\n\nStone Ridge is most proud of the partnership we have with you, our investors. We are on the path together. You contribute the capital to propel and sustain groundbreaking product development. We contribute our collective careers’ worth of experience in sourcing, structuring, execution, and risk management. Together, it works. In that spirit, I offer my deepest gratitude to you for sharing your wealth with us this year. We look forward to serving you again in 2026.",

    "description": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang rose from his first job at Denny's, where the idea for his company was born, to leading a chipmaking giant.",
    "fullText": "The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models.\n\nThat's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia.\n\nHuang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it.\n\nHere's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background.\n\nHuang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington.\n\nHis uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky, but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.\n\nHuang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland.\n\nBefore founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985.\n\nAt a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation.\n\nIn 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU.\n\nToday, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models.\n\nInterest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia joined the handful of companies at the time with a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nHuang's net worth is $165.4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHuang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day.\n\nCurrent and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes.\n\nHuang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays.\n\nHe has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share.\n\nHuang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product.\n\nNvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang.\n\nPriem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia.\n\nAfter Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023.\n\nHuang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company.\n\nHuang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins.\n\nHe has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHuang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning.\n\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.\n\nIn past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\nAs of June 2025, Huang owned roughly 3.77% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.\n\nHuang led Nvidia through a record-breaking, blockbuster year in 2025 as the AI boom saw no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe chipmaker became the first company in the world to cross the $5-trillion market cap valuation on October 29, 2025.\n\nAt the same time, the CEO steered the company through increased competition as AI hyperscalers explore alternative chips, regulatory headwinds, and growing concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nHuang acknowledged, in an internal meeting, the challenges of running a company faced with sky-high expectations after Nvidia delivered a better-than-expected quarter in November 2025.\n\n\"If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble,\" he said in the meeting. \"If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble.\"",

    "title": "Meet Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, who just launched a proxy fight to shake up the athleisure giant's board",
    "description": "Chip Wilson founded Lululemon in 1997 after selling his first apparel company. He became known for his controversial remarks and mishandling of company scandals.",
    "fullText": "Lululemon's billionaire founder, Chip Wilson, has been the center of both acclaim and controversy.\n\nThe 70-year-old entrepreneur was at the forefront of the movement that turned women's activewear into everyday apparel. The booming athleisure market is estimated to reach $623 billion by 2030, according to a November 2025 report. And Lululemon is a big part of that market. Popular items, like the brand's leggings, develop cult followings and become status symbols among certain demographics, like Gen Z.\n\nBut Wilson has also been a poster child for corporate controversy. Over the years, his comments about women's bodies, child labor, and the Asian community sparked outrage and eventually led to his ouster.\n\nAfter being heavily involved with the brand for over 15 years, Wilson resigned from the board of directors in 2015. Despite his exit, he's been vocal about the company's performance in recent years, frequently calling it out for underperforming compared to newer competitors. In December, he launched a proxy fight by nominating three new independent board members.\n\nToday, Wilson is worth about $7.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and is often among the top 10 wealthiest Canadians. He spends part of his fortune on philanthropy and researching a cure for the rare muscular disease called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which he was diagnosed with at 32 years old.\n\nHere's everything we know about Wilson's life and career as the founder and former CEO of Lululemon.\n\nWilson lived in California up until the age of five when his family moved to Calgary. He relocated to Edmonton for university in 1973 before moving back to the US for work two years later, according to his website.\n\nHe lived in Alaska and worked on an oil pipeline in 1975. During this time, Wilson said he read the top 100 books of all time.\n\n\"By the age of 19, I might have been the wealthiest, most traveled and best-read boy in the world,\" Wilson wrote on his website.\n\nHe went on to become an economist after receiving his degree in economics from the University of Calgary in 1979.\n\nHis entrepreneurial streak began in 1979 with Westbeach Surf Company. He started making shorts inspired by those he saw on a trip to California in 1979, Wilson writes in his book, \"The Story of Lululemon.\"\n\n\"The mistake that led to my success was an inability to sell my long, baggy, wild-patterned shorts to wholesalers. Consequently, I was forced to open my own store,\" he writes on his website.\n\nHe opened his own stores and owned the manufacturing — a move that he said tripled profits, he writes\n\nOver the years, his company evolved to serve different types of athletic lifestyles, like skateboarding and snowboarding. In 1997, Wilson sold Westbeach.\n\nWilson led an active lifestyle growing up. He played football, wrestled in university, and completed an Ironman triathlon in 1983, according to his website.\n\nFour years later, he was diagnosed with the rare, slow atrophying muscular dystrophy. As a result Wilson said he dedicates \"considerable time and money into discovering a cure.\"\n\nThe first Lululemon store opened in 2000 in Vancouver, Forbes reported. Wilson is often credited with creating and normalizing athleisure for everyday wear rather than just for workouts.\n\nWilson once said he named the company Lululemon because he believed Japanese people can't pronounce the letter L.\n\n\"It's funny to watch them try and say it,\" Wilson told Canada's The Tyee in 2005.\n\nHe has also said that brand names with the letter L in them are considered more authentic to Japanese consumers.\n\nHis now-wife, Summer Wilson, started as the founding lead designer for the brand, according to her website.\n\nWilson and Summer wed in 2002, according to his site. He had two sons from a previous marriage, and he and Summer eventually welcomed three more.\n\nThe couple live in Vancouver where Wilson has permanently lived since 1986, per his website.\n\nAfter taking the company public, Wilson took the role of chief innovation and branding officer. His CEO successor was former Starbucks executive Christine Day. The pair clashed often.\n\nIn January 2012, Lululemon announced that Wilson would step down from his role as chief innovation and branding officer. His vision for the brand's direction was a source of friction between him and former CEO Day.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Wilson began a sabbatical in Australia for over a year before Lululemon called him back to help handle a crisis, according to a 2015 press release.\n\nWomen, children, and minorities have been the subject of Wilson's most offensive takes over the years. Most of which he's had to later clarify or apologize for.\n\nThe lululemon founder once blamed birth control for higher divorce rates since \"Men did not know how to relate to the new female.\" Wilson has also spoken in favor of children working in factories to earn money and avoid poverty.\n\n\"The single easiest way to spread wealth around the world is to have poor countries pull themselves out of poverty,\" Wilson told The Tyee.\n\nAmid tension with Day and a year of scandals for Lululemon, Wilson stepped down from his role as chairman of the board in 2013.\n\nIn his book, titled \"Little Black Stretchy Pants,\" Wilson said he made Day cry during a 2013 meeting when he called her a terrible CEO and questioned her vision for Lululemon. Wilson wrote that he suspected her reaction was fake, and Day announced her resignation one day later.\n\nOn his website, Wilson said he had his own reason for leaving the company.\n\n\"I lost control of the culture and product development,\" Wilson wrote. \"At odds with a board of directors who did not want to invest in the future, I departed in 2013.\"\n\nIn the deal, Wilson sold half of his shares in the company to investment firm Advent International for $845 million, Inc. reported. Today, Wilson owns an 8% stake in Lululemon, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIn 2019, Wilson invested $100 million in the Chinese activewear company for a 0.6% stake, Forbes reported. Anta owns a majority stake in Amer Sports, a conglomerate of brands which includes Arc'teryx and Wilson Sports. Wilson said in an interview that he owns a 20% stake in Amer.\n\nWilson's 8% stake in Lululemon makes up a major portion of his wealth, per Bloomberg. Lululemon reported revenue of $10.6 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended in February 2025.\n\nHis waterfront mansion was valued at ​ $74 million in 2023 and has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, according to CBC. The property, which was constructed in 2008, has a pool and tennis court.\n\nLow Tide Properties invests in, develops, and operates commercial and residential buildings in Vancouver, with a focus on building lab and hospital spaces. It also owns multi-family properties in Seattle.\n\nWilson told Real Estate Magazine that started the company with a goal to invest 65% of his family's wealth into real estate in three cities by 2030.\n\nIn 2018, the Wilsons established the Wilson School of Design at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Richmond, British Columbia. They donated $12 million towards the program and a $36 million new facility on the school's campus.\n\nHe has allocated some of his wealth towards his charities Imagine1Day, which funds schooling for children in Ethiopia, and Wilson 5 Foundation which supports land conservation and public art installations in British Columbia.\n\nWilson's rare muscular disease affects an estimated 900,000 people globally. Wilson has an even less common form known as FSHD2, which affects just 5% of those with the disease, Business Insider reported.\n\nIn 2022, Wilson created his philanthropic venture Solve FSHD and pledged $100 million into finding a cure for FSHD.\n\nOn his website, Wilson wrote, \"I have a great fascination for the subject of longevity as I see aging as a disease.\"\n\nIn his quest to cure FSHD, he has experimented with longevity and wellness treatments popular among wealthy entrepreneurs trying to prevent aging. Some of his methods include hormone therapy, electroacupuncture, and daily doses of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWilson told Forbes in an interview published in January 2024 that he doesn't agree with the \"whole diversity and inclusion thing\" that Lululemon has embraced.\n\n\"They're trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody. And I think the definition of a brand is that you're not everything to everybody,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"You've got to be clear that you don't want certain customers coming in,\" he added.\n\nWilson has had some choice words for Lululemon's leadership over the years as the brand loses ground to brands like Alo Yoga and Vuori. In October 2025, he compared the mistakes that the brand has made to a plane crash. He also doesn't appear to be a fan of CEO Calvin McDonald, who is set to exit the company in 2026.\n\nHe blamed the brand's \"loss of cool\" on McDonald and his team for losing its innovative edge, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAlthough Wilson hasn't held a management position at Lululemon in over a decade, he's still voicing his strong opinions on how the company should be run. After Lululemon named CFO Meghan Frank and chief commercial officer André Maestrini as co-interim CEOs earlier in December, Wilson said the CEO succession plan was a \"total failure of board oversight.\"\n\n\"Shareholders have no faith that this board can select and support the next CEO without input from a board with stronger product experience,\" Wilson said in a public statement.\n\nOn December 29, he confirmed that he has nominated three inependent director candidates to the company's board, effectively launching a proxy fight at the athleisure brand. His nominations include former On Running co-CEO Marc Maurer, former ESPN chief marketing officer Laura Gentile, and former Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg.\n\n\"They can play an essential role in refocusing on the inspirational customer, revitalizing its bold vision, attracting the best people and maximizing value for all shareholders,\" Wilson said.",

Borish was a cofounder of Tudor Investment Corp, alongside billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, as well as a founding trustee of the Robin Hood Foundation, the New York-based charity headed by Wall Street's elite that focuses on alleviating poverty in the city and hosts an annual investment and finance conference in Manhattan.\n\n\"Discretionary trading is particularly challenging, but Richard has the discipline to succeed,\" Borish said in an email.\n\nPasser said the pair first met playing pickup basketball years ago and have remained in contact since. Mecox will begin trading on January 1 of the new year and is based in the Long Island hamlet of Bridgehampton.\n\nThe strategy at Mecox, which is named after a bay in the Hamptons, will focus on short-term-duration options, Passer said, and will put on between three and five trades in a day, typically.\n\nPasser, who began his career as a trader for asset managers Endeavour Capital Advisors and Vollero Beach before shifting into investor relations and operations roles, will be the firm's chief investment officer, while Kiran Srinivas will be the chief portfolio officer, according to the new manager's website.\n\nMost recently, Passer was head of marketing and IR for Dan Niles' tech-focused Satori Fund. He has also been the COO of funds such as Mark Cohen's Stone House Partners and Yaron Naymark's 1 Main Capital.\n\nFor more than two decades, Srinivas has held investment roles at some of the biggest names in the hedge fund industry, including D.E.

    "description": "14-year-old Alby Churven founded Clovr. He told Business Insider his age gave him a \"wow factor\" but limits his \"legitimacy.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alby Churven, the 14-year-old founder of Clovr, who lives in Wollongong, Australia. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was younger, I started an e-commerce grip socks brand called Alpha Grips. It failed, but that's what got me interested in business. I was 12.\n\nA lot of kids' first businesses is always something to do with e-commerce, like drop-shipping or clothing brands. Social media does saturate you with that \"get rich quick\" idea with drop-shipping or crypto. Although 90% of the time it's a scam, it still ignites an interest.\n\nThen I came up with the idea of Finkel, the startup I applied to Y Combinator with. I sent a cold email to Frank Greeff who's a pretty big founder here. He recommended I started building in public on social media, so I started doing that. X is full of startups.\n\nSocial media played a big role, seeing other people building brands and businesses. That's what got me into it. I used to do code camps when I was younger, so I've always been interested in tech and entrepreneurship.\n\nI applied to YC. Apparently I wasn't supposed to do this big video with all the editing. It's supposed to be, you sit down and turn on the webcam and talk. I didn't actually read the instructions when I did it, but I guess that's what made it pretty viral.\n\nMy application video for Y Combinator.\n\nJust applied to @ycombinator as a 14 year old founder. pic.twitter.com/hB44OvbbXh\n\nThere's a new social media ban in Australia for people under 16. All these great things have happened for me with it, but the social media ban is taking that away. I don't agree with it, but it is what it is.\n\nI'm young. I think my advantage being a teenage entrepreneur is I've got time. My goal right now is to build as many things as possible, learn as much as possible, and see where it goes.\n\nYou decide you want to do maybe when you're 18 or 16. But I know what I want to do. I want to be in startups and tech.\n\nThe benefits of starting young is that you don't have as much pressure on you financially, so you can just build things.\n\nIn the future, I'll have had experience. It's about learning. I have time on my hands, and I enjoy it.\n\nThe younger generation thinks a bit differently. Some older people may not even know how to use AI.\n\nI'm in the US right now, and I've been meeting with a lot of really cool people. When you're young, you can utilize your age to make a lot of connections. It's more rare. It's crazy you're doing it this young.\n\nMy age is a wow factor, but it also limits legitimacy.\n\nIt also can be a negative. People might not take you seriously if you're really trying to pursue something. All the things I'm building are bootstrapped, because it's impossible to raise funding when you're young.\n\nI'm getting to stages in my projects where I do need some money. I've applied to these accelerators. I had a very low expectation for Y Combinator. I got an interview about my other startup, Clovr, but then I got rejected.\n\nI've heard you have to get in the system early, so when I'm older and I apply, I'll already be in the system and have experience with how the process works.\n\nI do think grants are a really good opportunity. You won't raise nearly as much, but you're not giving away any equity. I think giving away equity young is not a good decision. It gives pressure to perform and deliver, and when you're young, you want to build stuff.",

    "title": "'We made 25 jars at a time with six pans on the go - now our business boasts a world's best marmalade'",
    "description": "Nicola Elliott is founder of Single Variety Co, an award-winning premium preserves brand that’s challenging the way food businesses grow.",
    "fullText": "There couldn’t have been any better validation for Nicola Elliott to launch her food business in 2016 than winning a gold award just one month after producing her first ever batch of Seville marmalade. “It gave me the confidence to go forward if the marmalade was that good,” recalls Elliott, founder of Single Variety Co.\n\nShe went one better this year. At the same World Marmalade Awards, her Amalfi lemon marmalade went to the final round of tasting and then scooped double gold and top accolade in an emotional moment for the British entrepreneur. “To do it at the scale that we are making it says we are doing everything right,” says Elliott.\n\nIn the early throes of her single-fruit preserves startup, Elliott was making 25 jars at a time with six pans going simultaneously and two part-time staff, as well as family and friends helping out.\n\nFrom selling her jams on a Balham market stall to owning her production facility, having shunned mass supermarket listings to retain independent quality, Single Variety Co now produces 5,000 jars per week and is set for latest annual revenues of £1.7m.\n\nIt is all a far cry from seven years ago when Elliott received her first export order to Germany for 8,000 jars of raspberry preserve. “I said ‘yes’ thinking I would be making 25 jars at a time. Somehow we did it over six weeks. We didn’t make any money on the order but it was the turning point for us.”\n\nThe business lesson led to Elliott reluctantly outsourcing production for a few years until her husband — a “people person”, former personal trainer and tennis coach — joined the business and the couple moved to Bristol and a £200,000 outlay to set up their jam factory five years ago.\n\nIn her former career as a fresh foods product developer at the likes of Sainsbury’s, Elliott cut a frustrated figure in a role she admits was cost-focussed and in which quality wasn’t a priority. She left her supermarket career to set her sights on a short shelf-life product.\n\n“When you mass-produce, quality has to give way. I was determined to make the quality what we aimed for,” she admits.\n\nAt the time, Elliott noticed that premium jams had champagne added to the strawberries or bay leaves to blackberries and “no one was making just great-tasting strawberry jam.”\n\nIt hasn’t all gone according to plan. Elliott once purchased the wrong second-hand jam kettle, at £12,000, instead of an electric kettle, which her husband still reminds the working mother of today.\n\nNow with a staff of 12, she works directly with UK fruit farmers for her products. These include seasonal limited edition jams such as traditional rhubarb from Yorkshire, which grows in the dark and is picked by candlelight.",

A Wall Street Journal investigation into Xu’s surrogacy history in the U.S. found that the Chinese billionaire was seeking parental rights to at least four unborn children, and had previously fathered and was actively fathering at least eight more surrogacy kids. There could be dozens more.\n\nThe billionaire’s video game company had also reportedly stated that Xu has more than 100 children born through surrogates based in the U.S., according to WSJ reporting. He was allegedly seeking “50 high-quality sons,” according to accounts linked to Xu on Chinese microblogging website Weibo, and said that “having more children can solve all problems.” During a 2023 court hearing, Xu also said he hoped to have around 20 U.S.-born children to one day take over his business, according to WSJ. He also fantasized about his American kids marrying Musk’s children in the future. Last month, Xu’s ex-girlfriend also alleged that he had 300 children living around the world—a claim his company denied.\n\nXu’s Duoyi Network has since made a statement against the Journal, stating the publication had “deliberately confused the facts and fabricated false information,” and that only 12 of the alleged 100-plus children were born in the U.S.\n\nXu is among a growing number of ultra-rich men parenting dozens of children to shepherd their companies and expand their legacies. And just like Xu, the video game billionaire, Telegram founder Pavel Durvo has helped conceive over 100 babies across 12 countries.\n\nOfficially, the entrepreneur worth $14.2 billion has six “official” children with three different partners. In addition to this parentage, Durov has also been donating to a sperm clinic for the past 15 years, which told him has led to more than 100 pregnancies.\n\n“I wrote my will very recently,” Durov told French publication Le Point in an interview this June. “I make no difference between my children: There are those who were conceived naturally and those who come from my sperm donations. They are all my children and will all have the same rights! I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force. The PayPal and Palantir founder, a prominent early supporter of Donald Trump, is one of the world’s richest and most influential men. Throughout his career, his principal concern has always been the future, so when The Spectator asked to interview him, he wanted to talk to young people. To that effect, three young members of the editorial team were sent to Los Angeles to meet him. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nWILLIAM ATKINSON: Following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York, an email that you sent five years ago has gone viral. You argued that with accumulating student debt and housing costs, it was no surprise that young people were turning to socialism. How do you explain that there are Gen Zs, like us, who aren’t on the left?\n\n‘The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing. America is no longer a great country’\n\nPETER THIEL: My sense is that in the US, Britain, Germany and France, the Gen Z voters are less centrist. I wouldn’t say they’re more drawn to the extremes, but they do not believe there are solutions within the Overton window straitjacket, the narrow space that’s been defined between New Labour and the Tories [in the UK] for the past three decades. And then there’s Reform, a party that repudiates that spectrum. For the first time in 200 years, there’s a real party to the right of the Tories. It’s not just a Gen Z phenomenon, but there’s a Gen Z part that is very important.\n\nWE: You first argued in the late 2000s that the backlash from globalisation would upend politics. Do you often feel that the world is catching up with Peter Thiel?\n\nPT: These things were coming for a long time. Student debt was $300 billion in 2000, around $2 trillion today. The GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008 was a big watershed. Entry-level jobs became less well paid. For students graduating after 2008, it became much, much harder to get out of the debt. Student debt slows you down from buying a house, getting started with forming a family, becoming an actual adult. You end up with a completely different society. It takes a long time to figure this out. But I started talking about this a lot in 2010… Why did house prices go up so much faster than incomes? Not enough was built. A big part was built as a retirement vehicle for older people. They were happy with the prices going up. The Tory party in the UK is probably completely past the point of no return. The suggestion that I have had was that you must start by throwing everybody out of the party who comes from real estate. You must be willing to purge all the people that are part of this dysfunctional system.\n\nJOHN POWER: What would your advice be to someone in their twenties about how they can have an impact in politics? Should they join Reform?\n\nPT: I think about politics a fair bit, but if I spent all my life on it, I would go out of my mind. I would like people to be more involved in right-wing politics, but I’m not sure that’s the best thing for most. You certainly should work for Reform rather than Labour or the Tories. You can criticise Nigel Farage as too much of a Boomer but he’s less structurally hateful to the young people. But maybe this is not the right way to frame the questions. We’re gonna have a revolution from Gen Z – all these crazy things that they are going to be doing. Is this good or bad? I’ve often said, in the early 20th century you think of both communism and fascism as youth movements that went very, very haywire. In the early 21st century, the reality is we have inverted demographic pyramids. There are not enough young people. We’re not going to get youthful communism or youthful fascism. We have this unbelievably oppressive, powerful gerontocracy. Maybe you can get communism or fascism of old people, but it’s very low-energy. It will avoid some of the defects of the early 20th century.But it’ll have many other kinds of problems. The general challenge for Gen Z is that there are big constraints.\n\nMy hope is that there always are some technological fixes, defining technology as doing more with less. If the debate is more with more spending or less with less spending, you end up with runaway deficits or extremely cruel rationing. I have critiques of the three biggest European countries – Germany, France and Britain. France is way too socialist. That doesn’t work. Germany is just insane. People have got caught up in crazed ideological fixations. There’s almost nothing like the Green party anywhere outside of Germany. Britain is neither too insane nor too socialist, but it’s extremely unpragmatic. It is extraordinary how lacking in common sense it is. The optimistic case for the UK is that there are extraordinary efficiencies one could wring out of the state. It has the greatest room for improvement of any European country. But why haven’t these things been done in the past 60 or 70 years?… Maybe the entire population is just too docile.\n\nLARA BROWN: You’ve talked before about Europe’s choice between ‘Greta on a bicycle’ environmentalism, Chinese surveillance and radical Islam. Would you say Europe has chosen one path?\n\nPT: The bad doors for Europe, the three doors of the future. For the future to have power as a cultural or political idea, you want it to be different. You can’t stay in this Groundhog Day, this Tory/Labour thing where we’re never doing anything new. The problem is the three actual pictures of the future. Behind door number one is Islamic sharia law. Behind door number two is the totalitarian CCP surveillance state, a hi-tech dystopia. Behind door number three is Greta with a bicycle, and then there’s no fourth door. This is why Greta’s been winning.\n\nJP: A lot of people on the American right talk incessantly about how terrible Britain and Europe are in general. But I think there’s selective blindness and chauvinism from some people on the American right about the condition of their own country. There is nowhere in Europe as bad as Skid Row in Los Angeles. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I would defend the Trump version of the Republican party vs the zombie Reagan-Bush era. I don’t think President Trump or J.D. Vance are absurdly optimistic or panglossian about things. Make America Great Again was the most pessimistic slogan any president had in a century, and certainly that any Republican president ever had. The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing, because the red pill is that America is no longer a great country. But you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gateway drug to a black pill, where you become nihilistic and give up and you’re destined to eat too many doughnuts in a trailer park. I don’t think that the right are overly optimistic in America. I don’t think there’s a problem where people describe things as even worse in other places. People in the US don’t pay attention to the world at all. We are a semi-autistic country. Maybe not quite as autistic as China, but we do not think about anything going on outside this country that much.\n\nLB: You mentioned the UK has undergone 70 years of stagnation. Many on the British right would agree, but may think that the period from 1979 to 1990 under Margaret Thatcher offered a respite from decline – she pursued unpopular but necessary policies such as anti-inflationary measures despite employment implications and her approach to the Unions. Would you question this narrative?\n\nPT: Reagan was very formative for me. I was in eighth grade in 1980 when Reagan got elected and felt at the time he was an incredibly great president and had solved all these problems once and for all. I think if I lived in the UK under Thatcher, I would have felt similarly. But they weren’t durable. We got Clinton and Blair after. The size of government didn’t shrink that much. The government sectors didn’t get weakened.\n\n‘Capitalism didn’t increase inequality but globalisation did’\n\nThere’s been a slowdown in tech since the 1970s. There was progress in the world of computers, internet, mobile, crypto, maybe now AI, but in a lot of other areas there was a much slower kind of progress. The question is, why did we not notice this faster? I think it’s because Reagan and Thatcher created a big lift. They made societies more capitalist by lowering marginal tax rates and deregulating. Lots of people got fired but the economy grew so most people ended up better off.\n\nReagan and Thatcher were exactly right for their time. But it wouldn’t work for all time. And to the extent that this distracts us from these science and technology questions, then it was somewhat problematic.\n\nThen there was the Clinton-Blair one-time fix, which was that you could somehow grow the economy and increase productivity through globalisation. That also probably gave you a big one-time lift. It came with very big long-term problems. It led to far more inequality. The Gini coefficient in the US went up more under Clinton than any other president post-1945. So capitalism did not increase inequality, but globalisation did.\n\nMy telling of the 50-year economic history is that we tried more capitalism with Reagan and Thatcher and it was the right thing to do. More globalism with Clinton and Blair was sort of the right thing to do, though it had more negative externalities that people were very dishonest about. We now need to do something very different.\n\nLB: Helen Andrews recently posited that feminism and gender-balance initiatives in the early Noughties led to a ‘Great Feminisation’. She claims this caused the prioritisation of safety over risk, a workplace culture dominated by consensus and appeals to emotion rather than logic in decision–making. How much do you buy into this as a theory of stagnation?\n\nPT: I think it’s very courageous of her to tackle something that is relatively taboo… Yes, I think there was a shift towards a risk-averse society. Feminisation was part of that. Things also went wrong with educational institutions or too much regulation. The deeper cause is that there was something dangerous and scary about where a lot of science and technology had gone.\n\nLB: Are you saying that diversity and inclusion efforts were an attempt to derail technological progress?\n\nPT: I think at some point people got very scared of where this stuff was going. Absolutely. It wasn’t just the nuclear thing. I would say that environmentalism as a movement was very focused on the dangers of limitless progress, even though in theory, you could have a lot of forms of environmentalism that would be pro-tech, right? If you’re concerned about climate change, we could build lots of new nuclear reactors that don’t emit carbon. But if we’re worried that nuclear reactors could be dual use and used to make nuclear weapons then you can’t do that. In some sense the energy shifted into this very anti-tech, anti-science direction for the past 50 years or so.\n\nLB: And you think DEI was a good way to achieve anti-tech goals?\n\n‘We’re going to end up with this really lame world where nothing happens but it’s maybe harder to blow up’\n\nPT: It’s always hard to know how intentional these things were. Diversity can function in an anti-tech way. If diversity really means homogenisation, let’s apply that to scientists. There’s no heterodoxy allowed, no heterodoxy on climate science, no heterodoxy on evolution, no heterodoxy on vaccines, on masks, on the origin of Covid. Everyone looks different but has to think alike. So diversity means conformity. And conformity is not compatible with science. And if diversity is a shibboleth, which I think is its important meaning, then we’re worshipping this god called diversity. It’s an unknown god. It’s a hypnotic magic trick that redirects our attention. And so we don’t care about science any more.\n\nJP: You seem to have a wider picture of American history, particularly in regard to wokeness. Many MAGA-adjacent people seem to think wokeness, or ‘cultural Marxism’, came from nowhere in the early 2010s, while you have identified before that it is a postwar phenomenon.\n\nPT: The culture wars are important. And there are ways in which there’s a side that’s right and there’s a side that’s wrong. But the big problem is that’s distracting us from things like housing or the economy generally, or science and tech or maybe even the CCP takeover of the world. This is where I push back against using the term ‘cultural Marxism’. I always think Marxism was at least about the economy. The focus on identity politics, multiculturalism, affirmative action, starts in the 1970s. That’s when inequality starts to go up. These things were at least correlated with us getting distracted from what I consider to be more important problems.\n\nJP: There are parts of the American right who now look at the changes of the 1960s, such the Civil Rights Act, and think it’s time to re-evaluate the postwar social consensus. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I don’t think you can ever strictly go back. There are three questions about the history going back to the Helen Andrews piece or my stagnation thesis. First, there’s a question of what happened. Second is a question of why it happened. Then there is a very different question of what should be done now. That’s in some ways very different from the first two. Even if we can agree there’s been stagnation, even if we say the society became too feminised or too risk-averse, we don’t want to just get blackpilled from that. And then the question is: where are the places that you have some agency to get out of this straitjacket?\n\nWA: Are you optimistic that that’s happening? And do you think you’ve contributed towards it?\n\nPT: Somewhat, and very much yes.\n\nLB: Earlier you alluded to three doors we can go through: radical environmentalism, sharia law, or Chinese-style authoritarianism. If none of us wants to go through them then what’s the way out?\n\nPT: It’s a challenge on a political level because when you’re trying to win elections it ends up being about broader narratives. For people in Silicon Valley, in a way it’s more local. You can build a company and solve particular problems in that context. Silicon Valley turned out to be a big place where there was a moderate amount of freedom of action in the past few decades, although it wasn’t a panacea. There’s a part of me that thinks that for some problems you have to go through politics. If we’re going to come up with new cures and new types of nuclear power you have to somewhat deregulate the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]. Some of these things are entangled with politics. But a lot of progress has happened that is decoupled from politics. One of the things that’s still healthy about the United States, unlike Britain and France, is that the political capital, the financial capital, the technological capital are all in different places, so it is very decentred. There are places where these things overlap, but there’s some way where people are able to do things that are independent.\n\nJP: Is tech going to come to the rescue like the Eagles [in Lord of the Rings], deus ex machina, providing abundance that can kind of smooth over some of the economic challenges? And as a rejoinder to that, do you think the AI bubble is about to pop?\n\nPT: There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution. It seems to be very concentrated on bigger companies, so it’s possible a lot of the returns are captured by a few companies, possibly leading to very uneven growth. While it may be a complement to human labour, it is probably more of a substitute than a complement. It will have a zero sum feel to a lot of people. At the same time if there is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it. I don’t think it’s big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\n\n‘There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution’\n\nOn the question of whether or not it is a bubble, I get asked this a lot by Europeans and that is how you know that they’re not going to build a lot of AI in Europe. If it’s a bubble, then people are spending too much money on AI, and they’re building too many data centres and buying too many chips, and you’re eventually going to get seriously diminishing returns on that. During the 1990s bubble, it was mainly the telecom fibre-optic infrastructure stuff where people really spent way too much and that had to get dialled back. But maybe it’s the other way around where there are high returns to AI, enabling the automation of certain workflows and enhanced productivity.\n\nIf the AI bubble does not burst, it’s possible that it ends up being quite inflationary because you have to use more power for these data centres. The atoms part of our economy is regulated and it’s hard to ramp up the power. But if the returns on power going to AI chips are really high, it will absorb a lot of energy. Interest rates could be higher because there’s more demand for capital. My macroeconomic placeholder is that it’s going to keep going.\n\nI’ve been allergic to AI for a long time because it can be a horrible buzzword. There was a 2016 report during the Obama administration on AI by the National Science and Technology council. If you did a search and replace, and replaced every use of the word AI with computers, it would have read the same way.\n\nAI also meant all these really different things over time. In 2014, [Nick] Bostrom defined it as machines being way smarter than humans. Kai-fu Lee wrote the CCP counterpoint AI Superpowers in 2017, where he defined it as this sort of low-tech, big data machine learning. Then in 2022 it turns out the AI revolution is LLMs [large language models] which can pass the Turing test. People had thought this would be what AI was for 70 years. So in the decade before we were about to pass the Turing test we had forgotten about it.\n\nThe dynamic when one has to think through a lot \n\nIf you look at the ratio of how many businesses there are per 100,000 people: what part of the US has the lowest number of businesses? Silicon Valley. That’s because the costs of business are higher, so these subscale businesses that are too small to go anywhere are even harder to get started. In a third-world country where there are no good businesses and everyone is an umbrella salesman, they are very entrepreneurial, but not in a scalable way. So you need to differentiate entrepreneurship from scalable businesses.\n\n‘If you’re too focused on history, you don’t pay enough attention to the future’\n\nThere’s this economist called Thomas Gür who has researched the idea that immigrants are more entrepreneurial. While that is correct, you have to adjust for the quality of the businesses and the immigrants start businesses by starting a taco truck because there’s nothing else you can do. It’s better than going on welfare. But that’s what you do when you’re not really part of a society. It’s better than nothing, but what you really want to do is scale.\n\nJP: Is there a cutting-edge domain that you would focus your energies on?\n\nPT: One of the lines we had in Zero to One [Thiel’s 2014 book about startups co-written with Blake Masters] is from Anna Karenina. It’s the opening line: ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ The opposite is true of business. All failed businesses are more or less alike because they fail to escape from this problem of homogeneous competition. They didn’t do anything special. All successful businesses are special in their own way. That’s the closest I can give you to a formula and it’s incredibly hard to figure out what that is, or how to do it. I have some feel for it, I know it when I see it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the past. That’s because it’s important. It’s how we got here. It’s what shaped a lot of these debates. At the same time, there’s also some limit to history. If you’re too focused on it, you don’t pay enough attention to the future. The point is not just to reflect on the past.\n\nThere was a medieval play on the Antichrist from 1160 or so, Ludus de Antichristo. It’s not a very good literary production, but there are these three kings, the Antichrist conquerors who focus on things like nationalism or their countries or their history. They lose because they’re too fixated on the past whilst the Antichrist is thinking about the future, and about what can be done. They don’t see Antichrist coming. So while it’s very important for those on the right to think about the past, to think about the history and what happened – they still should not lose sight of the future.",

    "description": "A new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley as Nvidia reaches a non-exclusive deal with a chip startup and hires its top engineers.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia is forging ahead with another bet on the AI boom, agreeing to a licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq.\n\nGroq said Wednesday that some of its executives, including its founder and CEO, will join Nvidia as part of the deal. Groq is expected to continue operating independently following what it described as a non-exclusive licensing deal.\n\nGroq is known for its Language Processing Unit, which is a custom chip designed for AI inference, namely, the process by which a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions. The startup was valued at about $6.9 billion as of three months ago and raised around $750 million in its latest funding round.\n\nJonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other members of its team are expected to join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market cap north of $4.5 trillion.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told Business Insider on Wednesday that Nvidia is not acquiring the chip startup.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Groq disclosed financial terms of the agreement.\n\nRoss and Douglas Wightman were engineers at Google who started the project that became Google's first TPU chips, before leaving to found Groq. The TPUs are custom-made to accelerate large-scale machine-learning tasks designed to handle AI workloads, and are a major rival to Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe deal between the two companies comes as a new type of dealmaking is on the rise in Silicon Valley. Whereas traditional startups either aim to go public or be acquired, new acqui-hire deals could leave some startup employees behind, only benefiting a small percentage of staff members with desirable AI skills and the founders.\n\nFor instance, in 2024, Google agreed to pay $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology but only hired its two superstar cofounders and 20% of the startup's employees. In the same year, AI developers Adept and Inflection also made similar deals with Amazon and Microsoft, respectively.\n\nMore recently, Meta's acqui-hire of Scale AI became one of the biggest bets on talent after the company agreed to invest roughly $14 billion for a 49% stake and to bring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, into the fold to lead the Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\nThese acqui-hires don't always end well. Windsurf employees were left in limbo after the AI coding startup was nearly aquired by OpenAI for $3 billion, only for the deal to fall apart and the company to be split. Google spent billions to hire Windsurf's CEO and top engineers, while the remaining hundreds of employees were acquired by another startup, Cognition.",

    "fullText": "Gummy bears, ice cream, cookies, and martinis may sound like the makings of a holiday party, but they are among the expenses now at the center of a legal fight between JPMorgan Chase and convicted startup founder Charlie Javice.\n\nJavice was sentenced to seven years in prison earlier this year over fraud tied to Frank, the financial aid startup she sold to JPMorgan in 2021 for $175 million. Despite that conviction, JPMorgan has been ordered to pay the legal bills of its former executive.\n\nJPMorgan, which has already covered some $60 million in legal expenses for Javice, is now asking a Delaware Court of Chancery judge to relieve it of an additional $18 million in expenses.\n\nIt argued that Javice and her attorneys have abused the advancement system by running up excessive and improper legal expenses. Javice's lawyers have until January 5 to respond.\n\nOn Tuesday, Quinn Emanuel, which represents Javice in the Delaware case, pushed back, saying JPMorgan is \"trying to walk away from its contractual obligation to pay Ms. Javice's legal bills.\"\n\nThe bank is \"highlighting a handful of attorney expenses (not incurred by Ms. Javice) over two years, the vast majority of which it already reviewed and paid or are not disputed,\" Quinn Emanuel spokesman Eric Herman said.\n\nSee a list of some of the expenses JPMorgan has highlighted in its Delaware court filing:\n\nJPMorgan's Delaware chancery court filing complained that the bank was billed for \"copious amounts of alcohol\", including old fashioneds, Lychee martinis, and other \"specialty cocktails.\"\n\nThe filing claims some of the booze expenses were linked to \"a hotel bar and minibar.\"\n\nIt also complained of fees tied to \"ground transportation from one bar or restaurant to another in one evening.\"\n\nKolomon was an Austrian-influenced French restaurant located in Manhattan's Ace Hotel that closed in August 2025. According to Thefork.com, its menu included Yellowfin tuna carpaccio for $29 and grilled wild mushrooms for $33.\n\nA search for \"cellulite butter\" on Amazon results in a list of body lotions that promise to firm and tighten the skin.",

    "fullText": "A 25-year-old startup founder said he starts each day with a nutrient-packed protein smoothie.\n\nMax Marchione is the cofounder of Superpower, a personalized health testing app that raised $30 million in funding earlier this year, backed by celebritiess like Steve Aoki and Logan Paul.\n\n\"Health is becoming a status symbol,\" Marchione told Business Insider. \"Twenty-somethings talking about their biomarkers, it would not have happened three years ago, but that is the defining young culture nowadays.\"\n\nRunning the company is no easy feat: Marchione works seven days a week, putting in more than 12 hours a day.\n\nThat means his self-care routine is precisely dialed in.\n\nMarchione says he has always taken an unconventional, even contrarian approach, exploring beyond what mainstream medicine recommends.\n\nAs a teen, he was an early adopter of fitness wearables like the Oura ring, and got into blue-light-blocking glasses and mouth taping — trends that, despite some mixed evidence, have become incredibly popular in wellness today.\n\nHe's also a big fan of peptide injections, such as the \"Wolverine shot,\" a compound called BPC-157. It is not FDA-approved. He began taking it in the hopes of accelerating his recovery after suffering a soccer injury.\n\nBut one constant in his health routine is much simpler: a daily smoothie.\n\nAs his first meal of the day, it packs in 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of fiber in 400 total calories.\n\nThe recipe includes fruit rich in antioxidants, plant-based compounds that research suggests help mitigate the cellular damage of aging. It also helps him get enough fiber, a crucial nutrient for gut health. Fiber helps nourish the microbiome in a way that may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and cancer as we age.\n\nCombined with protein (the primary building block for muscle), fiber helps improve fullness after eating and supports balanced blood sugar.\n\nMarchione's full \"smoothie stack,\" which he published on his website for other people to try, includes ingredients for gut health and energy, like:\n\nThis is a very high protein smoothie. The sweet spot for total daily protein intake to build muscle is about 0.7 grams per pound of body weight daily, studies suggest. For a 140-pound person, a single serving of Marchione's smoothie would be more than half the recommended amount in that range.\n\nIf he's loading up on extra protein in the smoothie, he adds digestive enzymes to make the protein easier to absorb.\n\n\"I find that if I don't do this, I have brain fog from too much protein at once,\" he wrote on his website.",

    "fullText": "A straw poll taken at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest has singled out one member of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet as by far the least popular with Republicans.\n\nThe event, held in Phoenix over the weekend, was the first since the murder of the organization’s co-founder, the conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“We wanted to get a real read on where the base is at after Charlie’s assassination, and a few things really jump off the page,” Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet told Fox News Digital on Monday.\n\nThe results were bad news for Attorney General Pam Bondi, with only 32.9 percent of those polled at the event saying they “strongly agree” with her performance.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy had the lowest disapproval rating, just 0.5 percent.\n\nBondi was the only member of Trump’s Cabinet to have negative ratings in the double digits. A combined 29 percent said they either somewhat or strongly disapproved of her work.\n\nBondi, 60, has angered MAGA loyalists this year by constantly fumbling the release of the Epstein files.\n\nAfter drip-feeding some heavily redacted documents, with the latest batch arriving on Friday, a statement by 19 of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims called out Bondi and her department, stating, “We are told that there are hundreds and thousands of pages of documents still unreleased. These are clear-cut violations of an unambiguous law.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nThe poll asked their support base to rank their priorities, with winning next year’s midterms a clear winner at 63.9 percent.\n\n“Defunding woke universities” was only voted as an issue by 1.1 percent, while the base was least interested in ending the war in Ukraine, which came last.\n\n89.5 percent of voters also said they would support a moratorium on new immigration into the U.S.\n\nThe poll also saw the vice president blitz the choice of who Turning Point USA supporters would like to see succeed Trump in 2028.\n\n“JD Vance won the 2028 nomination straw poll by more than Donald Trump won the 2024 one we did two years ago,” Charlie Kirk Show producer Blake Neff wrote on X.\n\nVance, who has regularly attended Turning Point events and spoken about his faith, scored 84.2 percent of the vote. Rubio took just 4.8 percent while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis earned a measly 2.9 percent. Donald Trump Jr. scored even less, with just 1.8 percent of the vote.\n\n88.3 percent of poll respondents self-identified as Republicans and 94.7 percent identified as conservatives.\n\nKolvet said the Turning Point “movement” is “all-in” for Vance as the next Republican leader.\n\nDuring the event on Sunday, Vance was cautious to fully condemn the rise of racism and antisemitism in the Republican Party.\n\nThe VP said conservatives should welcome everyone as long as they “love America.” He also said he was against using “purity tests” to work out who might be excluded from the religious movement over their beliefs, after questions arose over divisive figures such as Nick Fuentes and Candace Owens.\n\n“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during his closing speech on Sunday.\n\n“We don’t care if you’re white or Black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between,” he said of Turning Point’s entry policy.\n\n“We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,” he said.\n\nVance was more vocal about the Trump administration’s policies to end diversity and inclusion, telling the audience, “In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.”",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

The vehicle’s driver died at the scene, and a passenger died later in hospital.\n\nZampella began his career in video games in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he had been promoted to head of the Battlefield military shooter series of video games at EA Games – Battlefield 6 was released in October to critical acclaim.\n\nPreviously, in 2010, he founded Respawn Entertainment under EA, which created the Titanfall series of mech shooters and the popular multiplayer game Apex Legends.\n\nZampella is best known for his time in the 2000s at Infinity Ward, a studio he co-founded with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002.

    "description": "As iRobot's founder Colin Angle looks back on its path to bankruptcy, he says it was hard to overcome competitors in China.",
    "fullText": "If there's one lesson iRobot founder Colin Angle took from the company's bankruptcy, it's never to underestimate competitors.\n\nOn December 14, iRobot, maker of the popular robotic vacuum Roomba, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and will be acquired by its primary contract manufacturer, Chinese company Picea Robotics.\n\nAngle said one of his biggest takeaways as iRobot enters its next phase is that even market leaders must remain alert to competition from China.\n\n\"It's certainly the advent of this new type of competitor, the Chinese fast follower, who had access to the Chinese marketplace, which iRobot effectively did not,\" he said on the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" on Friday.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — roboticists at MIT — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website. It released its popular robot vacuum, Roomba, in 2002, which effectively created the category of consumer robotics.\n\nFor the next two decades, Angle said that the company grew the category and, for a brief period, was the leading manufacturer of vacuuming robots in China. The company reached its peak revenue in 2021, at $1.56 billion.\n\nIn the years that followed, however, Angle said the home robotics market was upended by new entrants from China, such as Roborock, which had been chipping away at iRobot's dominance since its arrival in 2018. Other Chinese competitors include Dreame, Ecovacs, and Shar.\n\nAngle said that companies like Roborock had an advantage against iRobot because they had a \"protected market to cut your teeth on for the competition.\"\n\nChina made several moves to ensure that Chinese manufacturers in the category had an advantage by providing direct subsidies to iRobot's competitors, Angle said.\n\nOver the past few years, China has made significant strides toward becoming a global hub for robotics innovation and adoption, rolling out multiple strategic plans across several sectors. As part of those efforts, the government has subsidized robot purchases at an average rate of about 17.5% of equipment costs, according to the Asian Robotics Review.\n\nIn some cases, iRobot's features simply lagged behind its competitors.\n\n\"Honestly, we got wet mopping wrong,\" he said. Scuba, iRobot's mopping robot, never took off as an independent product.\n\n\"It certainly got hard, and it got increasingly competitive,\" Angle said. \"Ultimately, we were open to other strategies to enable us to continue to innovate.\"\n\nOne of those was striking a deal with Amazon, which attempted to acquire the company for $1.4 billion, but the deal was terminated following an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission and European regulators.\n\n\"The Commission's probe focused on Amazon's ability and incentive to favor its own products and disfavor rivals, and associated effects on innovation, entry barriers, and consumer privacy,\" the FTC said in a statement in 2024. \"The Commission's investigation revealed significant concerns about the transaction's potential competitive effects.\"\n\nAngle said the deal should have been a \"no-brainer\" in a recent interview with TechCrunch.\n\n\"What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot's trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\nHe said the FTC and the European Commission's investigation should not have gone longer than three or four weeks.\n\n\"What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked,\" he said.\n\nHe said iRobot should serve as a cautionary tale for the future of US manufacturing.\n\n\"The net result, which, I have argued, was done with eyes wide open, was putting the consumer robot industry in a box, gift-wrapping it, and handing it to someone else,\" he told \"Hard Fork.\"",

    "title": "I'm a founder struggling to date. I take note of how men react to my success and am fast at weeding people out.",
    "description": "Kameron Buckner says that dating as a busy startup founder in NYC is difficult, but certain boundaries and rules help her balance work and romance.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kameron Buckner, a 32-year-old startup founder based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs a startup founder in NYC, dating is a struggle. I've noticed that some men want a woman who's a little bit more accessible throughout the week, and I've accepted I'm just not going to be that person.\n\nI have a rule of thumb right now: I won't date another early-stage founder. We can't both be fighting for our lives.\n\nMy work is demanding, and I can't be the spontaneous girl that a lot of men are looking for — I need a partner who understands that my startup is sometimes going to be my priority.\n\nI have my moments where I can meet up for a last-minute coffee, but most of the time, I'm a schedule-oriented girl. I'm all about laying out expectations and making it clear that my capacity to prioritize my relationship will fluctuate.\n\nI was a practicing attorney in a law firm for a year before realizing it was not the life I wanted to live. In 2024, I created Social Docket, an AI-powered platform designed to provide modern legal infrastructure for the creator economy.\n\nWhen I moved to New York a couple of years ago, I tested out the dating apps, but the men I saw didn't take good pictures, and it's really hard for me to get a feel for someone I haven't met in person. I've realized I prefer meeting people through friends or at an event.\n\nI'm also fast at weeding people out if I don't see it working out, meaning I'm very decisive about who I date. I don't have time to go on 10 dates to figure out if I like someone.\n\nIf someone asks what my week looks like, I'll give them the next two weeks, so we can plan the date, time, and activity. It's similar to how I plan meetings: I want to get them on my calendar.\n\nSome men seem to like it because it shows I'm willing to make time for them, but for others, I'm just not for them, and that's OK.\n\nIt sounds like I'm hiring, but I'm looking for someone who takes initiative. I work extremely hard in my business, so I appreciate someone who tells me the time and place to meet or provides me with a list of places to choose from. Someone who makes it simple.\n\nIf I'm in a busy season with work, it's nice to have a partner who can break up the fog of entrepreneurship and kindly remind me that he'd like to have some quality time together. There are times that I'm so locked in, and I do have to wake up a little bit.\n\nAt the same time, there will be moments when my partner can't be my priority. They have to understand that, as a founder, I'm actively fundraising and need to be committed. It doesn't mean I don't care, but I need to take a step back from our quality time.\n\nI might say, \"Hey, I have 15 meetings this week. I'm not going to have that much time to see you, but I'm down to do a FaceTime before bed.\"\n\nFiguring out how to learn and adapt to each other is one of the fun parts of finding a partner.\n\nThere have been times when people have made comments about my career, and I view them as a reflection of how they feel, whether it's a result of intimidation or self-consciousness.\n\nI opened up to an ex about my goal to one day make a million dollars in my company, and his first response was to question me and tell me it was greedy. He knew my heart, and for that to be the first thing he said was a real eye-opener to his character.\n\nI pay close attention to what the men I date say in the beginning and how they react to my success, because if it's an issue at the start, it's probably going to be an issue at the end. I've learned there's nothing wrong with walking away from people, even if it's just for a \"small\" reason.\n\nI think a good partner should want to see you succeed, because what's mine is yours. In a healthy partnership, both parties benefit and improve each other.\n\nI know the right partner will appreciate my ambition and drive, and let me come home to be the soft, feminine version of myself. They'll love both parts of me. With a foundation of humor, friendship, and support, everything else will just fall into place.\n\nDo you have a story to share about dating as a tech founder? If so, please reach out to the reporter tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

    "description": "While big players such as Blackstone, KKR and Bain Capital are buying in, Fernando de Leon, founder of Leon Capital Group, said he is sitting out.",
    "fullText": "A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick. Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. \n\nFernando de Leon, founder of Leon Capital Group, started a small lot development company in 2004 with $100,000 and turned it into a $10 billion business, focused mainly on commercial real estate. He did that, he says, by predicting distress, watching the source of capital and leaning on his Harvard degree in evolutionary biology.\n\nWhile others lost their shirts in the great financial crisis, De Leon began to make his fortune. He left a job at Goldman Sachs to start his own business and was doing some deals in residential lot development. A year in, he said, he saw some of the early indications from subprime mortgages and overbuilding that this was going to be \"a difficult cycle change.\"\n\n\"We basically said, look, we see things here that are fundamentally unsound. We're going to take these property positions and sell them, and then kind of wait and see what happens,\" De Leon told Property Play.\n\n\"We divested, we brought back some liquidity, and then we sort of waited, and then in 2008 to 2012 we became fixers. We became people that were able to talk to banks, to life insurance companies, to businesses that had loan exposure, and we were able to solve problems for them,\" he said.\n\nDe Leon said he turned around projects that had stalled and become problematic for lenders, experience he now says informed his thinking in the early years of the pandemic.\n\n\"In 2021, we sold a great deal, several billion dollars of real estate because prices were high, and that was a function of low interest rates and euphoria and bad incentives in the market,\" he said. \"Part of it is understanding where the capital is coming from. You begin to see participants in the market that shouldn't be there ... and when they match up and that funnels through the supply chain, you begin to see distortion and pricing.\"\n\nNow, De Leon said, he's seeing the same red flags flying over data centers.\n\nWhile big players like Blackstone, KKR and Bain Capital are buying in, De Leon said he is sitting out.\n\n\"The thing that I can't quite square is the data center play. I look at a data center that's $10 billion, right? First of all, there haven't been any exits above, you know, $4 billion or $5 billion, you haven't seen comps, so that worries me quite a bit,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I see large technology companies, the largest companies on the planet, with $4 trillion market cap, saying, 'I don't want to own this asset. I don't want to have this on my balance sheet.' So I ask, Why? Why doesn't the largest company in the world want to own its own asset?\" De Leon said. \"The AI business is everything for them today, for the large hyperscalers, and so they're saying, 'No, you build it, you finance it.'\"\n\nDe Leon surmises that what is inside these data centers, the technology of artificial intelligence, will quickly become obsolete. AI, after all, is designed to make everything more efficient, including itself. And the value of the centers is not the four walls, but what's inside.\n\nThese 15- and 20-year leases that developers are relying on, he suspects, are \"Swiss cheese\" leases — as in, full of holes in the agreement over time.\n\nDe Leon said his biggest concern is that big private capital investors are getting the money they manage from things like pension funds for teachers, police and firefighters.\n\n\"When they say, 'I'm going to own this asset and lease it back to one of the hyperscalers,' they're putting other people's money at risk,\" he said.\n\nDe Leon started in the real estate business as a teenager, working as a translator for a local Texas developer. Instead of getting a salary, he asked for equity in a project. And rather than getting a degree in business, he chose evolutionary biology, because understanding people is good business, he says.\n\n\"It was prescient. I mean, it turned out to help me make decisions about organizing companies and leadership, building businesses,\" De Leon said. \"I think some of these things are about incentives, right? Basic commercial interaction between human beings is about incentives.\"\n\nHe said that's particularly true in industries where there are well-established players.\n\n\"You always find a status quo group of incumbents that are set up, and they have certain advantages,\" he said. \"Understanding them from a sociological standpoint, that gave us some insight into saying, 'OK, this business should compete on this basis. This is where we can win,' kind of seeing around the corners.\"\n\nDe Leon said he's excited about how much more capital is coming in to commercial real estate — from wealth firms, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and pensions.\n\n\"When the allocations to real estate go from 3% to 6%, that number means that there's like $4 trillion more of capital that is chasing a finite number of real estate assets,\" he said. \"When that happens, you see an oversupply of capital, you'll see price appreciation for fundamentally sound real estate assets. And so I think the story of the next 10 years will be that the real estate capital markets will grow tenfold.\"",

    "description": "Meet Larry Ellison, the world's fifth-richest man. He cofounded Oracle in 1977 and is still one of Silicon Valley's top dogs.",
    "fullText": "Larry Ellison is the founder and chief technology officer of the software giant Oracle.\n\nNow, he's also the world's fifth-wealthiest man, with a net worth of $238 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nEllison's 2025 was marked by big financial gains and losses. Ellison briefly claimed the title of the world's richest person when his net worth soared to $393 billion that September. Oracle shares surged after the company reported quarterly results and delivered a blockbuster outlook for its AI-powered cloud business. Later that month, his wealth had nearly doubled during the year.\n\nHowever, his fortune took a $25 billion hit toward the end of 2025 after Oracle's shares fell by more than 11% based on weaker-than-expected earnings results. December 12 marked one of the largest single-day drops in net worth this year. Tesla chief Elon Musk then resumed his place as the world's wealthiest man.\n\nOracle, like other tech giants, is betting big on artificial intelligence, and Ellison is leading the charge at the company. His latest focus is on building data centers for companies such as OpenAI.\n\nEllison started Oracle in 1977. Decades later, despite living in Hawaii, he's still one of the top dogs in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere's a look at Ellison's life and career so far.\n\nEllison was born in the Bronx on August 17, 1944, to a single mother, Florence Spellman. Raised in Chicago's South Side, he attended the University of Illinois but dropped out after his adoptive mother died. He later attended the University of Chicago for a semester, but also dropped out.\n\nIn 1966, at the age of 22, he moved to Berkeley, California, near the emerging tech hub of Silicon Valley. He worked a series of jobs, including at Wells Fargo and mainframe maker Amdahl, where he picked up programming skills.\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 with $2,000, inspired by IBM scientist Edgar F. Codd's revolutionary idea of relational databases. Its first product was dubbed Version 2. After briefly rebranding as Relational Software Inc., the company became Oracle Systems in 1982 and went public in 1986 with $55 million in revenue.\n\nGrowth was rapid, but in 1990, Oracle nearly went bankrupt after revenue miscalculations led to losses and layoffs. By 1992, the launch of Oracle7 put the company back on track. Throughout the '90s, Oracle sparred with rivals like Informix and benefited from the dot-com boom, supplying databases to countless startups.\n\nFlush with cash, Oracle went on an acquisition spree, buying PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2005 and Sun Microsystems in 2010, gaining control of key technologies like MySQL. That same year, Ellison recruited Mark Hurd alongside Safra Catz, who later became co-CEOs.\n\nEllison stepped down as CEO in 2014, assuming the roles of chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nEllison, Oracle's largest shareholder, has used his fortune to fuel a life of high-profile investments, philanthropy, and headline-making purchases.\n\nHe races yachts, sails, and partially financed the BMW Oracle USA team that won the 2010 America's Cup.\n\nHe has also built a collection of Richard Mille watches worth hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each. In 2009, he purchased the Indian Wells tennis tournament for $100 million.\n\nIn 2012, he bought 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, where he later moved full-time, developing real estate and a wellness retreat, and backing a farming startup. His real estate portfolio also includes mansions in Malibu, Palm Beach, and Rhode Island.\n\nHe has been an active investor for a long time. An early backer of Salesforce, he also invested in Leapfrog and the ill-fated Theranos.\n\nOne of his most lucrative bets was NetSuite: A $125 million stake in 1998 turned into a $3.5 billion windfall when Oracle acquired the company in 2016.\n\nEllison also served on Apple's board in the late 1990s and joined Tesla's board in 2018 before stepping down in 2022.\n\nEllison's daughter, Megan, is an Oscar-nominated film producer and the founder of Annapurna Pictures. The company has produced films like \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"American Hustle.\"\n\nEllison's son, David, is also in the film business. His company, Skydance Media, has produced movies like \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" and films in the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise.\n\nAfter months of discussions in 2024, Skydance Media and Paramount agreed to a deal, which created Paramount Skydance. David is the CEO. Ellison and David, who own a controlling stake in Paramount and were outbid by Netflix for Warner Bros. Discovery, launched a hostile $30-per-share offer for all of WBD in December 2025.\n\nParamount Skydance oversees Paramount Pictures, the streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV, as well as CBS and cable networks, including Comedy Central and MTV.\n\nEllison signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, vowing to give away 95% of his fortune.\n\nHe has donated millions, including $200 million to a USC cancer center in 2016, which was eventually renamed the Ellison Institute of Technology. The EIT announced an Oxford campus in 2023.\n\nHe's also been visible during Donald Trump's second term as president.\n\nEllison appeared alongside Sam Altman of OpenAI and Masayoshi Son of SoftBank at Trump's press conference the day after the president's inauguration in January 2024 to announce Project Stargate, a joint venture that would see up to $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure in the US.\n\n\"He's sort of CEO of everything. He's an amazing man,\" Trump said as he introduced Ellison, who is seen as his longtime ally.",

    "title": "I founded Bala after a burnout recovery trip — but burned out again. Here's how I cope now.",
    "description": "Burnout recovery inspired Bala, but founder Natalie Holloway found lasting relief through lifestyle changes, self-kindness, and using a life coach.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Natalie Holloway, a 37-year-old cofounder of Bala, based in Los Angeles. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe first time I recognized I was experiencing burnout, my husband and I left our advertising jobs and traveled without any set plans. This trip got me out of the nonstop grind mindset I'd functioned in for too long.\n\nI came back to corporate work refreshed and inspired in October 2016. Our company, Bala, was supposed to be a side hustle, creating cute wrist and ankle weights inspired by our travels. We never imagined it would take off the way it did. I went full-time on Bala in 2019, and my husband joined in 2020.\n\nAfter building the business for five years, we had to lay off our entire team due to the post-COVID-19 fitness industry downturn. I felt immediate burnout knowing the work that was ahead of me, but this time, I couldn't take a year off to recover.\n\nHaving experienced burnout in multiple stages of my career, I now understand what it looks like, and I can navigate it effectively with the right tools and tactics.\n\nAfter college, I landed a job in advertising and fell in love with that career path. As my career progressed, I would often stay at the office late into the night and miss 9 p.m. dinner reservations. I felt creatively inspired by what I was doing, but the hours were so long that I began to wonder what the point was.\n\nMy husband, whom I had met at work and just started dating, suggested that we quit our jobs to recover and travel, and I said yes. We were both experiencing burnout, and I didn't even realize how bad it was until that moment.\n\nWe spent several months saving money and planning before leaving our jobs in March 2016.\n\nIt was so freeing to leave with no real plan, but also scary. We didn't have jobs, we didn't have an income, and our résumés were not being built. But we did finally have the mental space to slow down, look around, and feel inspired.\n\nOne day, we were taking a yoga class in Indonesia, and the class was too easy; we wanted to work up a sweat. After the class, my husband, Max, had the idea for wrist and ankle weights that look like cute bracelets. We decided to try creating them when we returned.\n\nThis trip taught me that detachment is what helps the most when I'm feeling burned out, and that's the easiest to achieve through time away from the source of my stress.\n\nWe got back and both got new jobs in advertising, but started working on Bala on the side. We never thought it would be our full-time jobs, but it started growing.\n\nOnce we were carried in stores and had enough orders coming in, we felt we couldn't keep up with both our corporate jobs and Bala. I left my advertising job first, and my husband followed a few months later.\n\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and the fitness industry experienced a surge in demand. However, after the pandemic, the fitness industry experienced a decline, and we had to lay off our entire staff.\n\nI was pregnant and felt like I didn't have enough stamina to take on the work of 30 people. It was a really demoralizing time, and the burnout hit me immediately because all of our hopes and dreams were on the line.\n\nI was determined not to let burnout destroy my health during my pregnancy. This time, I focused on and learned the value of how I speak to myself.\n\nDuring my second experience with burnout, I learned that giving myself a mantra helps ground my anxiety. Sometimes it's something like 'I'm calm, present, and have an abundance of time.' Repeating this helps when I'm feeling overwhelmed and burned out.\n\nI can't control when stress creeps in, but I can control how I talk myself through it because my head is my reality, and I'm trying to create a positive one.\n\nWhen we started rebuilding the business, my husband and I decided that no matter how long it took for the company to recover, we were determined to see it through to the end. We had to prepare for a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nWe've started regrowing our team back to its original size.\n\nI started working with a life coach, and that's really helped. They're helping me understand what's on my to-do list that aligns with my values, which will give me energy, and what doesn't align with my values, which will deplete my energy.\n\nAlthough we can't travel to cure burnout as we once did, I now take mini recovery trips, either for a weekend, a week, or a month, when I can. We sometimes visit Joshua Tree as a family to escape from LA, unwind, and mentally reset.\n\nWe also spend every July in Lakeside, Ohio. We don't make any plans. It's just our kids and us. We still do some work, but we're able to meaningfully downshift our lives in a way that recharges us.\n\nI always have my mantras going now, and I've learned how to feel comfortable being kind to myself. I realized that burnout is inevitable, but it's about how I handle it. I try to prevent it by reminding myself that I'm working toward the long game.",

    "description": "Shiloh Luckey faces SEC charges for using VC funds to pay for her home, Super Bowl tickets, trips to Aspen, and a wedding. The FBI is also investigating.",
    "fullText": "Shiloh Luckey, founder and former CEO of ComplYant, a Los-Angeles-based tax-compliance startup that raised more than $13 million from top venture capitalists, is under federal criminal investigation for alleged securities and bank fraud, according to court filings.\n\nIn a civil complaint, the SEC has charged Luckey with violating securities laws for using millions of dollars of company funds to pay for her home, Super Bowl tickets, and a destination wedding in the Caribbean. The SEC alleges she painted a rosy picture of the company's booming revenue when ComplYant never brought in more than $620 in monthly revenue.\n\nReached by telephone, Luckey said, \"I don't have anything to offer you,\" and hung up.\n\nStartups face far less regulatory scrutiny than public companies, and founders sometimes present overly optimistic growth stories while VCs rush to fund hot companies with limited diligence. After high-profile scandals like Theranos and FTX, regulators have taken a tougher line.\n\n\"Startup founders cannot fake it until they make it by falsifying revenue metrics,\" SEC regional director Monique Winkler warned in a statement. Recent cases, including the seven-year prison sentence for Charlie Javice and fraud charges against Mozaic Payments' former CEO Marcus Cobb, show that regulators are increasingly willing to pursue criminal and civil penalties for these founders.\n\nLuckey, who formerly went by Shiloh Johnson, founded ComplYant in 2019 to help small businesses navigate the labyrinth of tax regulations from state to state. In 2022, the company closed a $5.5 million seed round led by Craft Ventures, the San Francisco venture firm cofounded by the investor and White House advisor David Sacks.\n\nA spokeswoman for Craft did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI and SEC declined to comment.\n\nLuckey hired more than 50 employees, and when ComplYant abruptly shut down last year, she severed contact with them. It took seven weeks for all employees to get their final paychecks and some discovered 401(k) contributions were missing, as Business Insider previously reported. Luckey was informed in April of this year that she was under federal criminal investigation by the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office for securities and bank fraud, according to a recent petition she filed to pause the civil case against her.\n\nIn that case, filed in October, the SEC alleges Luckey routinely misled investors.\n\n\"Luckey painted a rosy picture for investors of ComplYant's business performance, allegedly telling investors that ComplYant's monthly revenues had grown from around $2,500 in November 2020 to over $250,000 by September 2022, and that the company was bringing in dozens if not hundreds of new paying subscribers each month,\" the SEC said in a statement. \"However, ComplYant only generated on average monthly revenues of about $250 during roughly the same time period and averaged fewer than four new subscribers each month.\"\n\nLuckey also represented herself as a CPA, but there is no record of her ever having the accreditation, according to the complaint.\n\nThe SEC says she allegedly siphoned off $2.2 million for trips to Aspen, Miami Beach, Turks and Caicos, and Lisbon, and used the funds to pay for her Caribbean wedding, her car, and house.\n\nLuckey, who is representing herself in court, has not responded to the SEC allegations.\n\nSince ComplYant shut down last year, Luckey has continued to post instructional videos with advice for taxes and accounting on her TikTok channel with nearly 24,000 subscribers.\n\nIn October, records show, she launched a new startup called HabitLoop, which she describes as a digital financial assistant to help people manage their money.\n\n\"I grew up with very poor financial habits,\" Luckey said in a video introducing her latest company as inspired by a lifetime of spending beyond her means.\n\n\"This is something I built on hard lessons,\" she said.",

    "description": "The billionaire founder admits a weekly mentorship call with the former president came with assignments like being more intentional with his friendships.",
    "fullText": "Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team.\n\nTo build Airbnb into a billion-dollar business, Brian Chesky sometimes worked gruesome 100-hour weeks. However, on top of that, he would regularly carve out time to pick the brains of one of the most important people in the world: former President Barack Obama.\n\n“At one point in 2018, we had a standing one-hour call every week, and I basically had my day job during the day, and then I had my night school with the former president, where I would get these assignments, but it changed my life,” Chesky has just revealed.\n\nSpeaking on Michelle Obama’s podcast IMO, he added: “I just was really shameless about reaching out to him, asking for advice, asking for mentorship, and he would meet with me, and he’d give me advice.”\n\nHe recalled the 44th president of the United States advised him to avoid becoming like other leaders who are effectively “self-driving cars” without intention. Instead, he should always be thinking long and hard about relationships—with his friends, his success, and his company—and be more active with the impact he wants to make.\n\nFortune reached out to Chesky and former President Obama for comment.\n\nAfter building Airbnb into a household name, Chesky faced a problem: He still wasn’t satisfied—nor necessarily happy.\n\n“The thing about being very successful in tech and making a lot of money and all this is no one ever told me how lonely it would become,” Chesky said to Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson. “And I started realizing, well, it’s weird, I had old friends that were middle-class, and I’ll be honest, a lot of them seemed happier than me at that point in my life.”\n\nAnd he credits former President Obama with helping him realize that how he was feeling was completely normal: that “the more success you get, the more isolated you get.”\n\n“People dream of success, but what they don’t realize is a lot of with success comes disconnection to your past, to yourself, to your friends, and I think a lot of what I’ve tried to do the last handful of years is to reconnect, to not live a life of isolation,” Chesky said.\n\nBarack Obama’s wisdom to Chesky was simple: He needed to be more hands-on with his relationships. That means instead of texting or calling a close friend once a year, stay constantly connected with them. Chesky said it’s a lesson he translated into his work as the leader of Airbnb.\n\n“He told me something that I’ll never forget,” Chesky said. “He said you should institutionalize your intentions, so that even when you’re a public company, you can make sure not to compromise your vision. And what he meant by that, I think, was that you should be more thoughtful about what you’re making, why you’re making it, and the impact of what you’re making is on people.”\n\nChesky admitted Obama’s advice has made a “really, really big difference” at Airbnb. And while it may sound odd for a former president to effectively give a CEO homework, it’s nothing new for Obama, who spent over a decade in the classroom teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago before his jump into the political arena.\n\nThe lessons learned from Chesky and President Obama’s relationship on finding success can be summarized into two simple steps: Seek out mentors and have friends outside of social media.\n\n“For young people, the number one thing they need to learn how to do is how to learn,” Chesky said. “And some of the best ways to learn are from other people, and some of the best ways to learn from people are, again, in the real world.”\n\nMoreover, rekindling old relationships is among what Chesky calls a “simple life hack” to make life happy.\n\n“I think the vast majority of people, if they reach out to someone, someone will want to help them,” he added. “They reach out to an old friend, the old friend will want to reach back out to them, and that is the path for reconnection. It’s a path for relationships, and it’s a path for purpose.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on May 27, 2025.",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

    "description": "After going through multiple layoffs as a UX designer, Kelly Withers used her savings to fund her startup, Carmu, which sells yoga mats.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kelly Withers, 36, who lives outside Detroit and is the founder of Carmu, a yoga mat startup. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nAbout seven years ago, I was in my 20s and getting divorced. I was a single mom to a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old, with no outside help. I had no place to live and no full-time job. So I started coming up with ideas as fast as I could. How am I going to take care of these two kids? I felt alone.\n\nAt that time, I was doing photography to help restaurants build their brands. Then I went to a yoga class. When I walked in, every person had the same mat and the same outfit. I started thinking about my mom and how she raised us to be individuals and stand out. I had this idea that since I was designing so many things already, I would go home and try to design a mat so I could feel more like myself when I went to class.\n\nAbout a week before I went to place my order for all the mat designs, the pandemic hit, and I was back to square one. I also lost my photography clients, because restaurants were shuttered. I panicked because I had two tiny humans relying on me.\n\nSo, I started teaching myself design for tech, because it seemed much more lucrative. From everything I've ever heard, you go into the corporate world — that's how you have a comfortable life.\n\nI got a syllabus from an online boot camp, but I couldn't afford it. So, I bought a book on every topic. Then I hired a tutor for 30 minutes at a time to go over my work and my portfolio, to make sure I was doing it right. He worked at Microsoft. He told me how much money I would potentially make as a junior designer. I remember thinking, \"Well, I'm going to have to pretend I'm a senior designer.\"\n\nPretty much on my first interview, I got a corporate job doing UX design as a lead designer. I was bullshitting, so it was a little nerve-racking. Whenever I had a project, I'd run it by the tutor, just praying that I didn't get busted. I caught on quickly, and it was fine. I did that for a couple of years.\n\nEventually, there was a lot less work. So, I started panicking.\n\nI found another job, so then I had two. Sure enough, about a month later, layoffs hit, and our whole team from the first job got wiped out.\n\nPeople talk about corporate life and how that gives you security. In my experience, you're handing over your control, your finances, your future — and it's still a gamble. I can't live my life constantly betting on somebody else and somebody else's company.\n\nI've always been into design. I want to build something tangible. I ordered about 250 mats to start. The idea was that I would continue working in tech, and then I would soft-launch these as my side hustle. That way, if I ever got laid off again, I'd have some security.\n\nThe day my yoga mats got delivered to my house, I got laid off. I looked at it as a sign: Go all in. You have some savings. See what you can do. Within about a month, I sold out.\n\nI was like, \"Now what am I going to do?\" They're made outside the US, so it takes a while for them to get here. I took the few mats that I had left and reached out to style editors.\n\nI took the rest of my savings, and I bought 1,000 mats. It was a scary moment because I was living off those savings, too.\n\nPeople talk about entrepreneurship and say, \"Oh, it's so risky.\" Well, it isn't. If you have the product, I like to think of it as a calculated risk. At this point, if I'm being honest, it was the only way I could think of making money, as I could not get a job interview.\n\nThe company is named after my mom, Carolyn Mulligan, who passed away 10 years ago after she was hit by a car on her bicycle. She had just been on my mind, and I'm convinced that because she was so strong, she has something to do with how this is working out.\n\nThe day I launched, in May, I sent out this post on Instagram to announce it. My friend called me and said to open up Vogue. Hailey Bieber was on the yoga mat in the magazine. About a week later, GQ wrote about Carmu. From there, it was just enough leverage where I could take it all over the place. We got into Goop, and we got into Anthropology in Europe. It's just crazy because it's been such a little amount of time.\n\nWhen I got the next shipment of mats, I hadn't had an interview in tech for a year. With my business, I was profitable from day one.\n\nThe big question now is whether I want to have outside investment or do it myself. I believe I could find outside investment. Have I been traumatized in handing over control of my life to other people? Yeah. I don't know if I'm ready to give up control of anything right now, just because of how everything has gone.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?
