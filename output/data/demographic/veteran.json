    "description": "It's important to stay current in the markets, says this veteran Wall Street mind.",
    "fullText": "Listen and \n\nAnthony Scaramucci quickly exited stage left from his communications role during the Trump 45 administration, but he isn't mincing words.\n\n\"If we could stay the course, not blow ourselves up, [and] have some decent, predictable political policies, the economy will recover,\" the Skybridge Capital founder told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast.\n\nIn addition to a short stint during Trump's first term — chronicled in his book \"From Wall Street to the White House and Back\" — Scaramucci's résumé includes an early career at Goldman Sachs before co-founding alternative asset manager Skybridge in 2005.\n\nRecently, markets have wavered amid news related to AI's growing power and Washington's political dysfunction. In D.C., \"unrest and uncertainty\" have become an issue, according to Scaramucci, who added that markets prefer \"evenness, predictability, and stability,\" while the \"on-again, off-again knee-jerking with tariffs is a mistake.\"\n\n\"I think it's hurting the markets,\" he continued. \"We could be doing way better if we had sound policies without capriciousness and uncertainty.\"\n\nThis conversation comes as once popular \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, such as Microsoft (MSFT), are experiencing pullbacks.\n\n\"Twenty stocks are holding up the market,\" Scaramucci said, adding that bitcoin's 50% correction is notable. \"Bitcoin is a leading indicator, so you're probably going to have a lot of roll-off in the stock market.\"\n\nCurrent market performance is also worth a look. Year to date, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 24.43%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has inched up 1% in 2026, the Russell 2000 (RTY=F) is up 6%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is down 1%.\n\nScaramucci sees any market downturn as temporary. \"I don't think it's going to be overly hellish, because you've got a lot of firepower from the Federal Reserve,\" he said.\n\n\"I still think [Fed chair Jerome] Powell, who is a data-dependent guy, will start cutting rates, particularly [if he sees weakness] in the overall marketplace,\" he said.\n\nScaramucci also intends to keep calm and carry on. \"Would I change my investment thesis because of this short-term stuff that's going on?\" he asked. \"I would not, and I would encourage people not to.\"",

    "fullText": "Speaking in an interview with Culemania, Ferran Olive, the FC Barcelona treasurer under Joan Laporta, has made a huge claim about the future of veteran striker Robert Lewandowski.\n\nThe 37-year-old superstar is in the final few months of his contract at the club, and so far, there have been no efforts to extend his deal.\n\nWhile it has not been entirely ruled out that Lewandowski will continue at Barça, early indications suggest that he could be in the last phase of his stint at Camp Nou.\n\nAnd, Olive, who stepped down as the club treasurer in February, when Laporta resigned as president to contest for the upcoming elections, has claimed that there are no plans for Barcelona to renew Lewandowski.\n\n“No, not in principle. I would say no,” said Olive, when asked if there were any plans to extend the veteran superstar’s contract.\n\nTime up for Lewandowski? (Photo by Gabriel Kuchta/Getty Images)\n\nNot stopping there, Olive also revealed that Barcelona had already begun the search for a top striker in the market, and that they were only €12-14 million short of returning to the 1:1 Financial Fair Play rule, which will allow them to operate freely in the summer.\n\n“We’re at €12-14 million to enter the 1:1,” Olive revealed.\n\n“Barcelona is in a position to do so, and in fact, Barcelona is currently looking for a top striker,” the ex-treasurer further added.\n\nLewandowski, for his part, has been patient with the matter of his future, while waiting for Barcelona to make an approach. He has an offer from MLS club Chicago Fire and interest from Saudi Arabia persists as well.\n\nAs for potential replacements, Barcelona like Julian Alvarez the most, although a move for the Atletico Madrid forward will be difficult to pull off this summer.",

    "fullText": "Fear, fights and feverish fanservice collide in this celebration of Resident Evil’s recent and retro legacy\nPC, PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch 2; Capcom\n\nThere’s often an undercurrent of existential fatigue in games that look back at their legacy. Dark Souls III’s dying kingdom, Metal Gear Solid 4’s decrepit Snake. So when Capcom showed us an ageing Leon Kennedy entering the ruins of the police station that marked the start of his journey from rookie cop to hardened veteran, it felt tinged with ennui as much as nostalgia. That self-reflective swansong for this 30-year series may still happen one day, but Requiem isn’t it. Even at its dourest and most pensive, this is less a song for the dead, more a knees-up in honour of the rocket launchers and typewriters that came before. Leon may be getting on a bit, but this is Capcom as energised, devious and goofy as ever.\n\nLeon’s old scars will have to wait, anyway. Requiem’s new blood is FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft. Equal parts tenacious and nervous, she’s a fitting lens on the horror portion of Requiem’s split focus between disempowered terror and cathartic action. The story opens with Grace – more acquainted with desk work than field ops – tasked to go over a crime scene at a gutted hotel. She knows the place well, since it holds some horrific memories for her. Still, she heads off with little more than a flashlight and a pistol you’ll never find quite enough ammunition for to feel safe.\n\nNot so Leon, a man whose skill for finding fresh shotgun shells is only matched by his capacity to drop vintage stilton one-liners on felled foes before the smoke from his barrel clears. Leon trades Grace’s first person camera for third person, although you can choose either for each. Grace plays well in both, though Leon’s default is far more suited to, say, severing a zombie’s fingers with his hatchet, or spearing a rebar through a bloodshot eye.\n\nLeon feels comically overpowered initially, his hardened hotshotitude underscored by the hordes of weak zombies Requiem sends to their deaths in service of making him look as cool as possible. But the game soon manages to put its absurdly capable star in convincing danger. A slew of frantic, back-against-the-wall firefights mean that, plentiful or not, you’ll need every shell.\n\nLeon’s never in so much danger as Grace, though, who soon finds herself stalked by terrifying creatures across a sprawling, stately care facility that boasts all the labyrinthine design of the series’ best locales. Requiem is ingeniously successful at instilling its forebears’ sense of trying to survive and escape from a living puzzle box. As Grace, you’ll sweat over whether to burn through precious bullets to clear a corridor of threats or risk sprinting through unharmed. Creatures sniff the air for your presence and let out shrill wails meant to goad you into panicking. Sometimes, it’s worth spending those bullets just to give your nerves a rest.\n\nYes, Requiem is scary. Occasionally, it even expects you to take the whole thing seriously. Grace and Leon’s voice actors do some heroic heavy lifting in bringing emotional weight to scenes that fall apart if you stop to think. And, for all its Evil Dead camp (that’s a compliment), this is still a tale with heart. Yet, after so many years expanding the same story with mostly the same core players, Resident Evil’s larger plot strains its hamstrings trying to find a patch of solid ground that’s not been well trodden.\n\nPerhaps that’s why real self-reflection feels out of reach – because if the series truly slowed down for even a moment, the floor would collapse. As it is, a few shameless plot contrivances feel about on par with the game’s product placement (there have been brand deals with Porsche and Hamilton watches). More deflating is a run of damp squib boss fights toward the finale. But Requiem has had so many clever set-pieces, tense chases, and joyfully gruesome encounters by that point that it’s easy to forgive it simply running out of ideas. Capcom has been on a hot streak for a while now, so it’s no shock that Requiem delivers. But it’s a very pleasant surprise that Resident Evil still feels this vital.",

    "fullText": "Veteran promoter Frank Warren has confirmed he is considering legal action against Saudi Arabian-owned Sela and American company TKO.\n\nWarren has enjoyed a fruitful partnership with Turki Alalshikh and Sela in recent years, but the arrival of the Dana White-fronted Zuffa Boxing, jointly owned by Sela and TKO, has caused tension behind the scenes.\n\nSela is a Saudi state-owned entertainment company and TKO Group Holdings is a media giant that owns the UFC and WWE.\n\nWarren alleges Sela and TKO went behind his back to form Zuffa Boxing, which he claims breaches the contracts he had already signed with the two entities.\n\nWarren's Queensberry Promotions, according to the Telegraph,, external allege as much as $1bn (£739m) could have been lost in potential earnings.\n\nIn a statement, Sela said they were \"disappointed\" by the claims and \"reject them in their entirety\".\n\nThis week it was revealed that Warren and Queensberry had sent \"letters before action\" to Sela and TKO raising the issues.\n\n\"It's just a difference of opinion over the contracts that we signed, so that will just take its course,\" Warren told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I can't make any comment on it. It is what it is and it will take its course.\"\n\nThe potential legal action comes after it emerged that Warren has had limited involvement in Tyson Fury's comeback fight in April on Netflix.\n\nThe fight was primarily organised by Sela and Netflix, and TKO chief Mark Shapiro claims Zuffa Boxing will be tasked with the promotional duties around the fight instead of Queensberry .\n\nFury is signed to Queensberry and has been since he resumed his boxing career in 2018.\n\n'Can't live in the past' - Warren on boxing's future after 45 years as promoter\n\nDubois refuses world champion Wardley's fist bump\n\nTaylor to retire after Dublin bout later this year\n\nWhite and Zuffa Boxing have made some serious waves since launching their first show in January.\n\nConor Benn joined Zuffa from Matchroom and Eddie Hearn in a one-fight deal worth $15m, but Shapiro says Sela and Alalshikh are covering Benn's purse, not TKO.\n\nWhite has ridiculed Hearn for saying he was heartbroken by Benn's exit, claiming he feels he has come into boxing and is \"beating up babies\".\n\nAsked how any legal action could affect his working relationship with Sela and Alalshikh moving forward, Warren said nothing would change.\n\n\"We will do what we continue to do and that is put on great shows. [Wardley v Dubois] will be a sell-out show just like what we're doing in Dublin, in Germany and in Manchester with Moses [Itauma],\" he said.\n\n\"Boxing is not broken for us, it's well and alive. We're not babies, we get on with it.\"\n\nZuffa have shown their intent by signing Benn and have also signed IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia.\n\nOpetaia fights Brandon Glanton on 8 March and Zuffa Boxing say their first Zuffa belt will be on the line, as well as Opetaia's IBF and Ring Magazine titles.\n\nWarren said Benn's move is something that \"happens in the sport\" and no promoter can expect absolute loyalty.\n\n\"I've been on the other side of it,\" Warren said. \"I'm old fashioned and I believe in loyalty.\n\n\"I think loyalty is something that is respected and a two-way thing.

    "fullText": "The New York Yankees have added a familiar face to their spring training roster, agreeing to a minor-league contract with veteran outfielder Randal Grichuk that includes a non-roster invitation to Major League camp as the club continues shaping its 2026 roster. At 34, Grichuk brings a right-handed bat and power potential to a Yankees squad that has been searching for lineup balance, particularly against left-handed pitching. His signing comes as part of New York’s efforts to address its bench depth and find options who can impact games in platoon roles or come off the bench when needed.\n\nGrichuk, originally a first-round draft pick (seventh overall in 2012), enters the Yankees’ camp with over a decade of MLB experience. Over his career with multiple clubs, including the St. Louis Cardinals, Toronto Blue Jays, and most recently the Kansas City Royals and Arizona Diamondbacks, he has amassed more than 200 home runs and established himself as a reliable corner outfielder with pop in his bat.\n\nThough his 2025 season was below his career averages, he slashed .228/.273/.401 between Arizona and Kansas City, teams value Grichuk’s experience and ability to contribute in the right situations.\n\nNew York’s lineup for 2026 is loaded with left-handed hitters, and adding a right-handed bat like Grichuk helps balance the roster, especially against tough southpaw starters. Yankees executives have openly stated their interest in right-handed offensive options this offseason, and Grichuk fits that need without requiring a guaranteed major-league contract.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Grichuk will compete with other outfielders during Spring Training for a roster spot. If he performs well, he could find himself on the Opening Day roster as a platoon option or a depth piece off the bench.\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nOLYMPICS: Most talked-about Olympic romances from 2026 Winter Games\n\nNBA: Andrew Friedman, other Dodgers execs get new roles with Lakers after $10 billion sale\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: USA men’s hockey draws record Olympic gold medal TV viewership\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Martin Short’s daughter Katherine tragically dies at age 42\n\nVIRAL: Pat McAfee makes stunning gesture during Team USA’s $150K Gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Yankees sign veteran outfielder and former first round pick appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Even with most of the Tennessee Titans' braintrust at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, the organization still made some roster moves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Titans decided to part ways with veterans Xavier Woods and Lloyd Cushenberry (failed physical designation), freeing up roughly $7.1 million in salary cap space heading into free agency.\n\nCushenberry had a second uneven season in 2025, coming off an Achilles injury that cost him most of 2024. After struggling early in the season, he did improve as the season wore on, but a foot injury late in the season opened the door for Corey Levin, who played well in his absence.\n\nTitans released center Lloyd Cushenberry and safety Xavier Woods. Cushenberry was released with a failed physical designation.\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 25, 2026\n\nWith Levin scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent, the Titans are extremely thin along the interior of the offensive line, with only Trey Hill on the roster with NFL experience at center.\n\nWoods was brought in last offseason to be a veteran presence for both the defense and the secondary, but battled some injury issues and eventually gave way to rookie Kevin Winston Jr. as the season progressed. Woods finished 2025 with 11 games played and 39 total tackles. Unlike Cushenberry, Woods’ release did not accompany a failed physical designation, meaning he has recovered from the hamstring injury that landed him on injured reserve.\n\nThese two moves are likely the first of a flurry of activity in the coming days and weeks. Buckle up, it appears a complete roster overhaul is on the way.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans release veterans Lloyd Cushenberry and Xavier Woods",

    "fullText": "Minneapolis — A member of the Olympic gold medal-winning U.S. women's hockey team indicated to CBS News on Tuesday that her team's absence from President Trump's State of the Union address was due to logistical challenges and not the controversy surrounding a joke Mr. Trump made while on a video call with the U.S. men's team.\n\n\"I know, like, later on, there'll be a full invite for all Team USA athletes to go to the White House like there has been in the past,\" decorated U.S. women's hockey veteran Kelly Pannek told CBS News during a practice with her pro team in Minneapolis.\n\nAsked if she wants the women's team to receive their own White House invite, Pannek responded, \"We want it to be about how great of an experience it was for us. You know, having team gold medals come out of USA hockey. It's something we've never done before.\"\n\nWhile both the men's and women's teams returned from the Milano Cortina Games with gold medals — both thanks to 2-1 overtime wins over Canada — their celebrations have been entirely different.\n\nThe U.S. men received a hero's welcome Tuesday, as the U.S. Air Force flew them from Miami to Joint Base Andrews before the players were hosted at the White House by Mr. Trump. They were then brought into the House Chamber to tumultuous applause during his State of the Union address.\n\nDuring his address, the president also made the surprising announcement that he would be awarding U.S. goalkeeper Connor Hellebuyck the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, for his heroics that helped secure the U.S. men their first gold medal since the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\" team.\n\nOn Monday, meanwhile, the U.S. women's team said it had declined an invitation to attend the State of the Union, with a spokesperson stating the athletes had \"previously scheduled academic and professional commitments.\" Several members of the women's team were already back on the ice this week, practicing for their various professional and college teams.\n\nOn a video call Sunday with Mr. Trump from the U.S. men's locker room after defeating Canada, the president suggested he would fly the men's team to Washington to meet with him at the White House, and then joked, \"I must tell you, we're gonna have to bring the women's team, you do know that?\" The comment drew a large laugh from the players in the room.\n\nMr. Trump then joked again on the call that he \"probably would be impeached\" if he failed to invite the women's team.\n\nAmid the fallout over the call, U.S. men's backup goalie Jeremy Swayman, a member of the Boston Bruins, told reporters Wednesday that his team \"should have reacted differently\" to Mr. Trump's comments.\n\n\"We know that we are so excited for the women's team, we have so much respect for the women's team,\" Swayman said. \"To share that gold medal with them is something that we're forever grateful for.\"\n\nPannek reiterated Swayman's remarks, saying the two teams \"felt like\" one family while in Italy, and have nothing but mutual admiration for one another.\n\n\"It really did feel like that, you know, full team USA. And that's part of the great thing about being at the Olympics.\"\n\nWatch: Trump's full 2026 State of the Union address\n\nRep.

    "description": "The Blue UAS List vets commercial drones for security and supply chain risks. The program is one part of DoD's bet on drone warfare.",
    "fullText": "The US Department of Defense is rapidly embracing drones across the services and steering troops toward systems vetted to avoid Chinese supply chains.\n\nThe push reflects a broader Pentagon effort to field large numbers of low-cost drones quickly without creating new dependencies that could backfire in a fight.\n\nThe Blue UAS [Uncrewed Aerial Systems] List provides service branches and federal agencies with a catalog of approved drones they can buy.\n\nThe approval process focuses on cheaper, off-the-shelf UAS that the Pentagon can easily buy and upgrade. The criteria for the list align with the Pentagon's wider drone strategy, including the Drone Dominance Program, which is testing commercial platforms from 25 companies.\n\nThe Blue UAS program was established in 2020 to identify drones compliant with US government standards, particularly cybersecurity and supply-chain rules. In December 2025, the Defense Contract Management Agency launched an official Blue UAS List website cataloging the models that military personnel could use.\n\nThe DCMA said that the list would expedite the process of getting drones into troops' hands, help jump-start investments in UAS technologies in the drone industrial base, and spark reforms in DoD's acquisition processes.\n\nFifty-four drones have been cleared for training use, and 29 have passed additional reviews for operational deployment. Those selected drones include Shield AI's V-Bat, Skydio-made drones, Performance Drone Works' C100, and AeroEnvironment's Red Dragon.\n\nTo make the Blue UAS List, drones have to meet strict legal, cybersecurity, and operational requirements. Assessments are completed on whether the drones have any vulnerabilities, such as parts sourced from certain foreign countries or exposure to supply chain risks.\n\nA range of drones, drone parts, and software are part of the Blue UAS program. Many of the approved systems are tailored to specific missions but can be modified or upgraded as requirements evolve.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in creating this list was concerns over a Chinese-dominated drone market.\n\nAccording to the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, Chinese companies control 90% of the commercial drone market. US officials have said the Blue UAS List is an effort to curb China's leverage over the market, including over key components such as motors that Beijing could restrict in a conflict, potentially disrupting US drone production.\n\nDespite the Blue UAS List's goal of compiling drones that aren't reliant on Chinese parts, sources told DefenseScoop last November that most of the approved drones rely on Chinese-made motors.\n\n\"While these Chinese-made motors are referred to as 'dumb components' experts say the issue is less about espionage risk and more about availability and resilience,\" a recent report from the Institute for Defense and Government Advancement said. \"In a conflict or trade disruption, US drone production could stall almost immediately due to reliance on Chinese supply chains.\"\n\nAmerican-made motors are typically more expensive, raising questions about how quickly Washington can scale domestic production and drive down costs.\n\nConcerns about China-free drones and the defense supply chain are more broadly sparking investments in a stronger American-made drone industry, which is an aspect of the Pentagon's Drone Dominance Program.\n\nWhen US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced the Pentagon's drone priorities in July 2025, he wrote that DoD would bolster US drone manufacturing, support investments in the domestic industry, and push for more low-cost drones and technological evolutions to get more drones to troops faster.\n\nDoD ultimately aims to field hundreds of thousands of low-cost, one-way attack drones by 2027. It has said it will invest more than $1 billion in the drone market over the next two years through the Drone Dominance Program.\n\nThe most recent development in the Drone Dominance Program is an initial test on one-way attack drones, which is happening now through next month at Fort Benning in Georgia.\n\nThe testing, called Gauntlet, involves drones from over two dozen companies, including a lot of smaller startups and two Ukrainian firms. When Gauntlet's done, DoD will buy roughly $150 million in prototypes of selected drones.\n\n\"While the Gauntlet is not itself a formal Blue UAS listing action, it is tightly aligned with the program's purpose and trajectory,\" the IDGA report said. It reflects DoD's shift toward iterative, competitive acquisition of new weapons that occur in months rather than years.",

    "title": "What releasing Antonio Gibson means for the Patriots",
    "description": "The veteran running back was let go ahead of NFL free agency.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots decided to shake up their running back room on Monday. Antonio Gibson, who originally joined the team on a three-year, $11.25 million free agency deal in 2024, was released after two seasons and 22 total games with the organization.\n\nThe move itself did not come as too big a surprise. Not only was Gibson little more than a rotational option in the Patriots’ backfield with an unclear outlook given that Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson reside atop the depth chart, he also is currently rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in October.\n\nThat said, let’s take a bigger-picture view at what the transaction means from a New England perspective.\n\nThe Patriots entered the offseason with six true running backs under contract for the 2026 season, including Gibson as the projected RB3 behind the aforementioned Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. With him no longer a piece of the puzzle, one layer of depth has been removed behind the top pair and is leaving the group looking as follows:\n\nRunning back (5): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), Terrell Jennings (26), Lan Larison (34), Elijah Mitchell (45)\n\nOutside of those six players, the Patriots also have two backfield players headed for free agency. Both running back Deneric Prince and fullback Jack Westover are exclusive rights free agents.\n\nEven if Prince and Westover are retained, the Patriots are lacking established depth or long-term developmental upside behind Stevenson and Henderson. While they project as a formidable one-two punch, no Gibson as the third option means that the team might be on the lookout for another player with a similarly versatile skillset.\n\nBefore tearing his ACL in Week 5 against the Buffalo Bills, Gibson had not just served as the Patriots’ third running back but also their top kickoff return man. As such, he had averaged 28.5 yards on his 12 runbacks and also scored a 90-yard touchdown in Week 2 versus Miami.\n\nOnce Gibson was lost for the year, the Patriots were unable to find similar production and home-run potential. Six other players returned kickoffs for them on the year — running backs Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon Henderson, Terrell Jennings and D’Ernest Johnson as well as wide receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III — but none emerged as a clear featured option.\n\nWith Gibson now officially out of the picture, the competition will start at zero again. Based on flashes, Henderson and Williams seem like the frontrunners at the moment, but there are a lot of factors plus future roster changes that are likely to change that projection.\n\nOne of the reasons why Gibson getting released was no surprise was his contract. Carrying a $4.14 million salary cap number, he was the 21st most-expensive player on the team right now. That in itself might not have been a release-worthy problem, but the structure of the pact invited a change: only his $1 million signing bonus proration for the 2026 season was fully-guaranteed.\n\nThat $1 million will now be added to the Patriots’ dead cap space for 2026. Meanwhile, the team created $2.14 million in net savings: his gross savings of $3.14 million minus another player with a $1 million salary cap number taking his spot on the Top 51 list of contracts to be counted against the cap once the new league year starts in mid-March.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, Gibson’s release now puts the Patriots $44.3 million under a projected league cap of $304.3 million.\n\nConsidering that Gibson was released with a failed physical designation, however, it appears that he qualifies for the NFL’s injury protection benefit. If so and he remains unsigned heading into the new season, the Patriots might be charged $2.1 million against their cap at the start of the regular season. In that case, the financial gains of releasing the 27-year-old would be minimal.\n\nThe Patriots’ 2024 offseason was their first without Bill Belichick presiding over their football operations. So, who was the first free agent added under the new regime led by Eliot Wolf and then-head coach Jerod Mayo? That would be one Mr. Antonio Gibson.\n\nWith Gibson now gone, so is another remnant of the Mayo-era Patriots. In fact, less than 14 months after his firing, only 23 players remain with the team who played under the one-and-done coach as pointed out by Ethan. Hurwitz of Sports Illustrated.\n\nWith Antonio Gibson's release, here's the list of remaining Patriots under contract for 2026 that played under Jerod Mayo:\n\n– Christian Gonzalez\n– DeMario Douglas\n– Kayshon Boutte\n– Drake Maye\n– Marte Mapu\n– Bryce Baringer\n– Dell Pettus\n– Marcus Jones\n– Terrell Jennings\n-…\n\n— Ethan Hurwitz (@HurwitzSports) February 23, 2026\n\nWhile his failed physical might have forced their hand a bit, the Patriots had no real reason to release Gibson now as opposed to closer to the start of free agency on March 11. However, with the entire league embarking on Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine, getting cut now allows Gibson a head start of sorts.\n\nSure, teams will be cautious when it comes to a running back who tore his ACL just four months ago, but Gibson’s name is at least out there already and he can start taking visits and undergoing physical examination with other clubs right away. Other veteran running backs who might end up competing against him on the open market might not be in that same position yet.",

    "description": "The wealthy are becoming worried about the US economy more rapidly than lower-income households. A Wall Street veteran says it's that's bullish for stocks.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 could be set to break out of its anemic trading range, according to a veteran Wall Street strategist.\n\nThe key metric to watch isn't some piece of technical analysis or a big earnings update. Rather, it's the growing feeling of economic unease among high-earning Americans, according to Jim Paulsen.\n\nThe S&P 500 is roughly flat since the start of 2026 as investors weigh the market impact of Trump's uncertain tariff regime and AI disruption fears. Jim Paulsen, former chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, says his new market indicator, which he dubs the poor/rich sentiment measure, has successfully forecast recent market rallies and is signaling a potential upswing is on the horizon.\n\nLower-income households were seen by forecasters as a weak spot in the economy for some time, but their mood has been brightening of late. At the same time, high earners have become more downbeat. This narrowing of the sentiment gap, Paulsen says, is a buy signal.\n\nPaulsen compares consumer confidence in the economy by income level to find a daily confidence ratio that he then combines with a ratio of Walmart's stock performance relative to the S&P Global Luxury stock price index.\n\nPaulsen overlaid his poor/rich sentiment indicator over the S&P 500 to assess it as an indicator for market performance.\n\n\"The Poor/Rich sentiment indicator has spiked higher 8 previous times since 2018 — in late-2018, October 2019, March 2020, May 2022, October 2022, November 2023, September 2024, and in April 2025. During each of these previous spikes in the Poor/Rich sentiment indicator, the S&P 500 was at a level which represented a good buy! \"\n\nSince the end of 2025, Paulsen's indicator has climbed. The measure's spike since December shares similarities with increases seen at the end of the 2022 bear market and at the 2020 pandemic lows.\n\nThe strategist ties the indicator's success to the idea that if the high-income cohort is losing faith in the economy, then the stock market is often at a low point. Paulsen highlights a downturn in Bloomberg's US billionaires relative total return index, which he says could be a signal that the rich are losing faith in the market.\n\n\"We seem to be in a relatively rare period when the Rich are losing confidence faster than the Poor … when the rich start complaining more than the poor, it's often been a good time to step up and buy some equities,\" the strategist said.\n\nPaulsen warned investors against using a single gauge, but said it may be a good time to assess equity exposure.\n\n\"If you are underinvested, perhaps it's worth considering taking advantage of recent volatility by adding to your equity exposure during selloffs,\" he wrote on his Substack post.",

    "fullText": "The Chargers will most likely address the interior part of the offensive line, especially the guard spots, with Bradley Bozeman and Mekhi Becton being potential cut candidates.\n\nShould they go the free agency route, Sports Illustrated's Connor Orr believes the Bolts will sign veteran Joel Bitonio, whom he tabbed in his bold predictions for all 32 teams in the NFL.\n\nJim Harbaugh is not going to put Justin Herbert at risk again like he was forced to last season. Bitonio can spearhead the offensive line’s transition to a Mike McDaniel system—Bitonio was drafted during McDaniel’s season as the Browns’ receivers coach—and could be a critical, dependable asset amid constant injury woes.\n\nBitonio is not getting any younger, set to be 35 this season and is considering retirement, but he is durable and is still moving as if he were ten years younger.\n\nA stalwart presence along the Browns' offensive line for the past decade, Bitonio finished the 2025 season ranked as PFF's 8th-best pass-blocking guard. He has also ranked in the 91st percentile in PFF run-blocking grade over the past three seasons.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike McDaniel was on the Browns' staff as the wide receiver coach in 2014, Bitonio's first season in Cleveland, so the familiarity is there.

    "fullText": "Braves' $7M injury prone fan favorite, World Series champion deemed unreliable, questioning future originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are officially underway with their 2026 Spring Training games, and there are still plenty of questions to be answered before Opening Day. One lingering question from last season was whether the Braves would bring back Ozzie Albies. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos didn’t make that decision clear during the 2025 season.\n\n“With all these options (on players), we always make the decision at the end of the year — you have five days after the World Series, and that’s when you make the decision. It’s just, things can happen, things change. You always wait,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves ended their season in disappointment, but the organization was quick to resolve Albies’ future. They opted to bring back their fan favorite and the player who has consistently been the best at his position for the team.\n\n“The Braves are going to pick up their club option on infielder Ozzie Albies. The club hasn’t announced the decision yet, but president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos confirmed the move in a radio appearance, per Mark Zinno of 92.9 The Game,” Steve Adams wrote for MLB Trade Rumors.\n\nHowever, heading into the regular season, if Albies’ injuries continue, he could become a liability for the Braves.\n\n“Even really good players can become liabilities in one form or another. That doesn't take away from the player they were, but it should inform the Braves' decisions and fans' perception that some guys can't be trusted in certain roles anymore,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote. “It was kind of a fun bit for a few years there, where the national media just continually disrespected Ozzie Albies despite the fact that he was among the best second basemen in all of baseball. However, what first looked like just some rough injury luck has become a pattern, and it is now completely fair to call him injury-prone and wonder about his future with the Braves.”\n\nThe Braves are extremely grateful for what Albies has contributed to the organization, but his injuries have also put the team in difficult situations. This season is a must-prove year for the star infielder.\n\nIf Atlanta wants to be successful, they need Albies on the field. If he can’t stay healthy, he risks letting down the Braves faithful once again. There was once a time when it was believed the Braves would have no hesitation keeping Albies for his entire career, but injuries have cast uncertainty over that future.",

That’s the main thing. I’ve said this before: As long as there’s communication, I’m good.\n\n“That means people want to move forward. I think that’s where Travis is.”\n\nThe Chiefs have leaned heavily on Kelce throughout their recent Super Bowl runs, with the tight end remaining Patrick Mahomes’ most trusted target in critical moments.\n\nAt 36, Kelce continues to produce at a high level, but the physical demands of the position inevitably prompt discussion about longevity.\n\nReid’s emphasis on communication indicates there is no disconnect between player and organisation. Instead, both sides appear aligned in assessing what comes next.\n\nReid added: “I’m not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space here. He’s been doing this a long time, and he can sort all that out as he goes forward.\n\n“But we’re proceeding with that.”\n\nThe head coach’s tone reflects respect for a player who has become central to the franchise’s modern era.\n\nKelce’s resume includes multiple Super Bowl titles and consistent Pro Bowl selections, placing him among the most accomplished tight ends in NFL history.\n\nFor now, the message from Kansas City is clear: discussions are ongoing, and the relationship remains strong.\n\nPatrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce facing lawsuit over their Kansas City steakhouse\n\n‘Shut up’ – Chris Jones fires back after ESPN analyst says Chiefs should move on from Travis Kelce\n\nWhat ‘difficult’ Travis Kelce decision should Kansas City Chiefs make, reveals ESPN insider",

    "fullText": "In an unexpected comment, one of the best pitchers in MLB just urged the Atlanta Braves to sign nine-year veteran Lucas Giolito.\n\nDespite a 76-86 finish last year, there is legitimate excitement surrounding the Braves heading into the 2026 season. Many believe Ronald Acuna Jr. can again be an MVP candidate. They brought back impact veteran Ha-Seong Kim. Added All-Star closer Robert Suarez, and will have Spencer Strider a year further removed from UCL surgery.\n\nStrider and ace Chris Sale were set to lead a rotation that had the potential to be one of the very best in the league. However, that group took massive hits over the last week. Both Hurston Waldrep and Spencer Schwellenbach are expected to miss much of the 2026 season due to surgeries on their pitching elbows.\n\nWhile the Braves still have solid pitching depth, they’ve been looking at the free agent market for potential options to fill Waldrep and Schwellenback’s spots in the rotation. One player that has been linked to Atlanta is one-time All-Star Lucas Giolito.\n\nThe 31-year-old had a good season for the Boston Red Sox in 2025 after missing all of 2024 following Tommy John surgery. Yet, for some reason, he remains a free agent with spring training a week old for teams around the league.\n\nWell, his 2025 teammate Garret Crochet believes that should end, and claimed this week that the Braves are a “pretty obvious” place he should land.\n\n“It just doesn’t make a ton of sense. It’s just been that way for a while, though,” Crochet told the media on Saturday when asked about Giolito still being available. “The middle of the market on both the position player and pitching side kind of gets screwed and ends up either signing after the season begins or what have you.”\n\n“… A lot of guys never figure it out here. The guys that have, they’ve stayed around, in the past, for a reason. I don’t think that just because we’re getting super analytical, we should look at it any differently,” he added. “When you look at depth, you’re looking at guys who are experienced and have done it, not guys who can do it. That’s not depth. That’s just another prospect.”\n\nGiolito went 10-4 with a 3.41 ERA and fanned 121 batters in 145 innings last season.\n\nBlue Jays & Max Scherzer Getting ‘Serious’ in Talks\n\nReport Reveals Juan Soto Delivered Record Revenue for NY Mets in Debut Season\n\nBest MLB Shortstops 2026: 10 Best Shortstops in MLB Right Now",

    "description": "While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won't eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.",
    "fullText": "Maybe it’s the quarterback chaos or the landslide of head coaching changes. Or because it’s late February and many of the NFL’s personnel departments already seem satisfied that the No. 1 overall pick in the draft is in the barn. Or maybe it’s because the 2025 season produced a wildly unexpected Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, and an even more unexpected Super Bowl quarterback winner in Sam Darnold.\n\nWhatever the driving force, it’s thrusting the usual sideshow of the NFL scouting combine — trade rumors, free-agency buzz and clandestine general manager meetings — into the middle of the main stage. And with that, the college players who are taking their next big step toward draft positioning have become a subplot.\n\n“It’s going to be a wild offseason and it’s going to start next week [at the combine],” one prominent NFL agent said this week. “There’s so much more than usual with different veteran stuff compared to how guys are going to work out — and we have a good class of guys [in the draft]. All the quarterback things to figure out, some of the [veteran] defensive players — some of the young players that could be traded with the staff changes — there’s going to be a lot going on. …\n\n“I see you guys talking about storylines — when was the last time anyone checked in on what’s going on with Lamar Jackson [and the Baltimore Ravens]? It’s like that situation has gotten lost in all this noise. That’s how crazy next week is going to be, though.”\n\nIn fairness, Jackson’s potential extension deadline — spoken into existence by Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti in January — has been a prominent story over the past month. Indeed, it will crank up next week, with the quarterback and franchise having been in a contract talks window for several weeks by the time Ravens new head coach Jesse Minter and general manager Eric DeCosta meet with the media in Indianapolis. It’s expected there will be some kind of temperature gauge coming out of the combine, with the front office and ownership wanting to sign an extension with Jackson and lower his $74.5 million salary cap hit in 2026.\n\nOf course, Jackson is only one of multiple pressing maneuvers — or non-maneuvers — heading into the combine that will certainly drain some of the daily news thunder from draft prospects’ workouts. Among the prominent:\n\nWho will be getting the franchise tag applied to them before free agency, with the biggest potential name being Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. As it stands, Dallas is expected to tag Pickens prior to the March 3 deadline and then either attempt to retain him or try to engage in a sign-and-trade scenario. With Pickens wanting to get to free agency and a likely $35 million average salary per season, there will likely be sparks in a tag scenario.\n\nPotential veteran trades, including Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby, Philadelphia Eagles wideout A.J. Brown, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and others. Throw in some young players who might get a call or two just to see if they are available on the trade market, including Buffalo Bills wideout Keon Coleman, Jacksonville Jaguars wideout Brian Thomas Jr., Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson and Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy.\n\nThe future of Aaron Rodgers will be a pressing question for the Pittsburgh Steelers — at least as it pertains to the organization’s other options and what kind of timeline there would be for a Rodgers decision. It’s possible we exit the combine under the presumption that the Steelers are going to move forward and try to find their future QB, which would shift the Rodgers conversation back to the Vikings, whom he was interested in before landing in Pittsburgh last offseason.\n\nAnd finally, one very big nugget that has yet to be developed: How much interest there will be in Malik Willis in free agency and what the money could ultimately look like. The ballpark speculation in the agent community is some kind of two-year deal averaging $30 to $35 million a season with $40 to $45 million guaranteed. That would put Willis in position to go back to the table next offseason and negotiate a longer term deal that tacks on to the end of 2027 and extends his guaranteed money out into a three-year window through the 2028 season. There are varying opinions on the numbers and structure, not to mention the potential interest. Willis feels like the first big quarterback domino that has to fall in March to trigger a larger migration. If he were to land in Pittsburgh, that then puts Rodgers — if he still wants to play — onto the market for the Vikings or any other suitors. And once Willis is off the board, the teams that ultimately don’t have him as an option will then have to reassess.\n\nThere’s a sliding scale of a trade likelihood for all these players. Crosby’s situation with the Raiders, from what Yahoo Sports has been told by league sources familiar with their talks, is still at a standstill — but also not unrepairable. Part of the Raiders’ motivation is to see what Crosby’s trade market looks like and also where he is at with the franchise in a new phase of a rebuild. The market will likely be the driving force here. If there is a solid offer of draft picks on the table, a trade seems more likely than not.\n\nThe same goes for Brown and the Eagles, although it remains to be seen what general manager Howie Roseman could engineer to fill his No. 1 wide receiver spot if there is ultimately an attractive offer available for Brown. It’s highly unlikely the Eagles would move Brown and not have another player in the mix, so the combine’s wide receiver workouts and other available players at the position could factor.\n\nThe Murray and Tagovailoa process is going to depend on suitors and money. Right now there are zero indications of an appetite to take on either Tagovailoa or Murray’s remaining contract in a trade, let alone surrender any meaningful draft assets to make him a starter. That could change if the QB shuffling doesn’t break right for some teams and desperation enters the scenario. Lest anyone forget, there was a market (albeit diminishing) for Russell Wilson the past two offseasons. So there can certainly be a market for Tagovailoa or Murray if a situation gets bad enough.\n\nAs for the young players, Coleman seems likeliest to be traded, given the comments of Bills owner Terry Pegula that essentially branded him as not being the front office’s draft choice. Unfortunately for Buffalo, Coleman’s trade value will be nothing more than a late pick at this stage. Even with his youth.\n\nThomas, Richardson and McCarthy are not expected to be officially on the trade block, but all three could garner some interest and calls. Thomas seems less likely to be dealt with the Jaguars moving Travis Hunter primarily to cornerback. McCarthy won’t be dealt unless the Vikings are presented with a quarterback option that effectively renders any chance of him having a future as moot. And Richardson doesn’t have much of a market, and will have only one year left on his rookie deal once his fifth-year option is ultimately declined. That doesn’t leave much room to develop him for any interested franchise. But again, we don’t know how desperate the quarterback field gets.\n\nThat’s a lot of veteran questions and potential developments that will hang over the primary reason teams are in Indianapolis next week: To begin laying down the foundations of their draft boards for April’s selection process in Pittsburgh. While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won’t eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.\n\nHere’s a look at some of those that will be worthy of watching.\n\nWhile it’s not expected to be as top-heavy as the 2024 wide receiver class — which saw seven first-round picks at the position — the wideouts are considered a spot that is going to have depth and offer needy teams quality options potentially into the third round. The general consensus at this point is that four to five receivers could go in the first round. Most of the intrigue will be how the top of the class sorts itself between the trio of Ohio State’s Carnell Tate, Arizona State’s Jordyn Tyson and USC’s Makai Lemon.\n\n“I think you could see some [changes in that trio] between interviews, measurements and whatever work gets done,” one NFC talent evaluator said. “The medicals, too — definitely the medical for Tyson. … And it depends how you want to use them in your scheme. Lemon, some teams might not like the size but others might love the versatility and how he catches it. How fast will Tyson run and some of the speed and agility things with Tate will be important. They’re all good players, but there’s definitely some of the [Travis] Hunter, [Tetairoa] McMillan, [Emeka] Egbuka [conversations from 2025] because they’re not all similar players.”\n\nAs it stands, Tate appears to stand out among talent evaluators as the most “clean” player from the threesome, in terms of the total package of consistency, health, size and production. But there’s definitely curiosity about what his pure speed and agility will look like, especially alongside Lemon and Tyson. Some of those questions will be answered — if all three actually do full workouts at the combine, which isn’t guaranteed. Beyond that trio, there will definitely be some gravity toward the next tier of WRs in Washington’s Denzel Boston, Tennessee’s Chris Brazzell II and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields, who all bring prototypical “X” receiver size to the table. The Bills will be an interesting team to watch with that group.\n\nFor only the second time in 13 years, we could end up seeing only one quarterback selected in the first round. With the Las Vegas Raiders expected to take Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza with the No. 1 pick, it’s also trending toward Mendoza passing on everything at the combine and opening the floor for the rest of the class. That will be a solid opportunity for multiple players, including Alabama’s Ty Simpson, Penn State’s Drew Allar, Miami’s Carson Beck, LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier and others.\n\nIt’s simply not a great class when it comes to star power (that will come in 2027), but there could be a bit of developmental depth with some strong showings.\n\nEven with the thin class, there is still plenty of quarterback need across the league — and that will point plenty of eyes in the direction of Simpson. He was a prospect with some solid draft heat near the midpoint of the college season, but red flags began to get raised as he got knocked around and turned the ball over later in the schedule and then suffered a rib injury that knocked him out of the College Football Playoff. Right now he’s likely to land in the late first to mid-second round range, somewhat similar to how teams were looking at Bo Nix in 2024, and Jaxson Dart and Tyler Shough last year. If Simpson can wow teams in interviews and put up a good workout, he can build momentum to move up the board and get a QB-needy team to expend a first-round pick on him. Already, you hear his name connected a lot to the Los Angeles Rams, who have the 13th and 29th overall picks.\n\nAs for the rest of the pack, it’s unclear what Allar will be able to do at the combine due to an ankle injury that ended his 2025 season. He’s the player with the size and easy arm strength, so he’ll draw in someone believing they can home his considerable talent into consistent results. Same goes for Beck, who also has size and arm, but also some leadership and love-for-the-game questions that teams want to pick at in interviews. Not to mention some bad turnovers in important spots, going all the way back to his time at Georgia. Then there’s Nussmeier, who some evaluators once believed could develop into a first-round pick, maybe even a solidly high one, before injuries derailed much of his 2025 college season. He’ll be another player who draws plenty of eyeballs.\n\nIt’s a loaded class with edge players, with an onslaught at that position expected to end up packing the first round. While there’s still a lot of work ahead, it wouldn’t be surprising to see as many as eight edge rushers come off the board in the first 32 picks. A lot of the attention will go to potential top-10 picks in Texas Tech’s David Bailey, Ohio State’s Arvell Reese and Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr. But there will be a battle to figure out the stack after that trio, with players like Auburn’s Keldric Faulk, Missouri’s Zion Young and Miami’s Akheem Mesidor battling it out. Young is a player to keep an eye on. He had a great week of practice at the Senior Bowl and ended up as the game’s defensive MVP, giving him a lot of buzz coming into the combine. But top to bottom it’s going to be great draft for teams that need edge players and defensive line talent in general.\n\n“It might be one of the deepest [edge] classes ever, especially through the top 50, 60 guys [in the entire draft],” an AFC general manager concluded. “There’s all types of skill sets and body types that fit different needs, but the talent in general just very, very good. There’s really not a Myles Garrett or Nick Bosa, but there’s a half dozen guys who could become just good, core second-contract players for teams.”\n\nBeyond the defensive line, there’s strength in the class of safeties and cornerbacks as well, with as many as a half dozen or more picks in the secondary likely to land in Round 1. And while safety isn’t traditionally a position that sees multiple first-round selections, this will almost certainly be one of those years, with Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, Toledo’s Emmanuel McNeil-Warren and Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman all having the profile to possibly land in the first half of the first round. That just doesn’t happen. Downs in particular will be very intriguing. His résumé is the kind that he’d be an easy top-five pick if he played at a more premium defensive position — and there were times that some evaluators believed he could even be worth that kind of juice in this draft. The overall strength of the defensive class at premium positions is likely to push him down the board, but it’s certainly not lost on front offices that so many of the NFL’s best defenses now feature a dynamic safety like Downs. That could cement Downs higher on teams boards by April.\n\nThe next running back after Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love is going to be an interesting development to watch. Overall, the class isn’t amazing and it’s going to be dinged a bit by the free-agent class being so strong. There’s no doubt that some teams want to see what Love’s backup for the Fighting Irish, Jadarian Price, does in the workouts. As much as game tape matters, Price could have transferred elsewhere for the 2025 college football season and doubled his touches while positioning himself to challenge Love as this year’s top running back. Now he comes into the draft with less wear and tear but also some curiosity about whether he can be a centerpiece starter and also catch the ball consistently out of the backfield. His workouts will matter, especially as it pertains to his receiving ability. If he can showcase that and put up the type of athletic numbers that some think he can, there will likely be more Alvin Kamara comparisons to follow. As of now, I’m not sure how that framing works without the receiving end of his game being more proven.\n\nOregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq is going to be interesting. Some evaluators like him as almost a hybrid running back/wide receiver if he fits into the right scheme. Others see him as a plus-level athlete whose “expected” 6-foot-2, 240-pound size is going to make him a bit of a tweener — and not in a good way — in the NFL. There’s curiosity about Sadiq’s true height and weight and what his workouts look like. There’s little doubt he has mismatch potential and maybe some considerable ceiling with the right coach and scheme, but some evaluators don’t see him as the kind of tight end who can fit in a lot of different places and be on the field at the rate of a multitude of TEs from last year’s draft. He can’t be compared realistically to the bigger bodied guys like Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren. And his overall consistency of college production wasn’t in the realm of Brock Bowers going into the 2024 draft. Who is the realistic comparable at the NFL level to Sadiq and what coach can draw that unique talent out of him?",

On paper, still, the Yankees have to like their chances in the American League, even after losing to the Toronto Blue Jays last year.\n\nEvery contending team can use some more pitching, and in a trade pitch from Mark Morales-Smith of Sports Illustrated, New York would add left-handed reliever JoJo Romero from the St. Louis Cardinals to strengthen its pen.\n\nCardinals get: Dax Kilby, Kyle Carr\n\n“The Yankees want to win the World Series, and they want to win it this year.

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid have only the final pieces of their famous 2014 title victory in tact, but they might be about to lose another one this summer. It appears that veteran defender Jose Maria Gimenez could be on his way out of the club after more than a decade.\n\nGimenez arrived for just under €1m from Danubio in Uruguay in 2013, and made an immediate impact, competing with Miranda for first-team minutes in Atletico Madrid’s 2014 title and Champions League final run. There was talk that Gimenez could have left last summer, but eventually no satisfactory offer arrived.\n\nThe 31-year-old stalwart will bring up 13 years in Madrid this summer, but RadioMarca report that this is his last. Matteo Moretto explains that Atletico have promised Gimenez that he can leave on a free in the summer despite being under contract until 2028. If Gimenez is keen on a particular destination, they will shake hands and he will leave.\n\nAtletico’s motivation to do so is related to his age, performance and salary. Gimenez earns between €6m and €7m net every year, making him one of their higher earners, but is no longer a guaranteed starter. He has also suffered significantly with injuries.\n\nFernando Cruz of DSports Radio, as quoted by Atletico Universe, has explained that Gimenez has been in talks with Boca Juniors President Juan Roman Riquelme over a potential move to Buenos Aires in the summer. Gimenez would leave after the World Cup.\n\nOn the other hand, it had been reported that AC Milan were willing to pay up to €30m for Gimenez, but if he is available on a free, then he will be much more appealing to the Rossoneri. Moretto has also confirmed there is interest from Serie A in him.",

    "fullText": "American bobsleigh veteran Elana Meyers Taylor had won everything there is to win in the sport - except for Olympic gold.\n\nThat was until Monday when, on her fifth attempt, she finally added that missing piece to her extraordinary collection.\n\nThe 41-year-old triumphed in the women's monobob to become the oldest individual Olympic champion at a Winter Games, overtaking Austrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl, 40.\n\nGold at Milan-Cortina adds to the three silver and two bronze medals she has already won across two events - the monobob and the two-woman bobsleigh - since competing at her first Games in Vancouver 16 years ago.\n\nHer combined time of 3:57:93 over four heats was enough to edge out Germany's Laura Nolte by just 0.04 seconds and compatriot Kaillie Armbruster Humphries by 0.12secs.\n\n\"Finally the gold! It took long enough, right?\" Meyers Taylor told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It just goes to show you... just to keep persevering, my team and everybody behind me, it means so much to come away as Olympic champion.\"\n\nVictory makes her the most decorated female bobsleigh pilot of all time as well as the first mother to win Olympic bobsleigh gold.\n\nThe four-time world champion is also the most decorated black athlete at a Winter Olympics and this, her sixth medal, ties her with speed skater Bonnie Blair for the most by an American woman.\n\nBut although she continues to write her name in the history books, for Meyers Taylor it is also about empowering female athletes and inspiring women.\n\nAs her gold was confirmed, Meyers Taylor sunk to her knees draped in the American flag and embraced her two young children.\n\nShe has made it no secret that her drive to continue to compete at the elite level is not only for her own family but for hard-working mothers everywhere.\n\n\"This medal is also for all those moms who weren't necessarily able to live their dreams, but their kids are now their dreams,\" she said.\n\n\"Because those people keep me grounded. Those people kept me going and those people are the ones who reach out to me when things are hard and encourage me.\"\n\nMeyers Taylor's children, Nico and Noah, are both deaf while the oldest, Nico, also has down syndrome.\n\nShe is married to former bobsledder Nic Taylor and the family travel around together on the sport's circuit for several months at a time.\n\n\"My kids have sacrificed so much. There's so many people who have helped me win this gold medal,\" she said.\n\n\"I've had different nannies throughout the years and every single one of them has done the work to help my kids get here and my husband, I can't even put into words what this means and how many people it took to win this.\"\n\nA disability advocate, Meyers Taylor said she feels encouraged by the communities she is helping to inspire.\n\n\"I've had so many people from around the world reaching out and telling me their stories and how they have a kid with down syndrome or a kid who is deaf and they believe in me - it has just been incredible,\" she said.\n\nFormer British bobsledder John Jackson, bronze medallist at Sochi 2014, knows her well from their early years on the bobsleigh circuit and said \"if there was one person on the whole circuit who I think any athlete and coach wanted to see win gold it was Elana\".\n\n\"She is not only a ferocious athlete but also a beautiful human being and a genuine person,\" he added.\n\n\"It has been a real show of dedication to keep going through the struggles of now being a mum in a high-performance sport, the dedication that takes to maintain that level of physical fitness and the hard work of being a parent. It shows her true nature.\"\n\nMeyers Taylor, who has placed on the podium six times in her five Olympic appearances, has shared it with compatriot Armbruster Humphries, 40, on five of those occasions.\n\nArmbruster Humphries, who has five Olympic medals of her own including three golds, became a mother 20 months ago and it is the first time two women over the age of 40 have finished on the podium at a Winter Games.\n\nBoth women celebrated with their children.\n\n\"You get a lot of people that like to write you off as soon as you reach 40, it's all downhill from there, is what you hear,\" she said. \"I think Elana and I are both proof that that's not true.\"\n\nThe two women are also credited with encouraging the International Olympic Committee to add the monobob to the women's schedule for the 2022 Games with the two-woman event the only one for women prior to that.\n\n\"It should be celebrated that they're both mums, using mum power, both in their early 40s and it's great to see them competing at the top of the world not only physically but the drive and experience too,\" said Jackson.\n\n\"There's a lot of younger athletes there who need to up their game to compete against these two world class athletes.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are in a tough spot when it comes to starting pitching, just one year removed from battling the injury bug throughout the entire season. The most recent blow to the rotation came Sunday, when the Braves announced that Hurston Waldrep is undergoing testing due to arm discomfort.\n\n“The Atlanta Braves' rotation took another hit Sunday when manager Walt Weiss said right-hander Hurston Waldrep may need surgery to remove \"loose bodies\" found in his arm. Waldrep complained of discomfort after throwing batting practice. Weiss said an MRI showed no ligament damage, but the team is waiting to learn more after Waldrep has additional tests,” ESPN wrote.\n\nThe injury concerns began on the first day of Spring Training, when Spencer Schwellenbach announced he would start the season on the 60-day injured list. It was not the start anyone in the Braves organization was hoping for.\n\n“The Braves opened camp this morning with an unwelcome update on talented young righty Spencer Schwellenbach. He’s been placed on the 60-day injured list due to inflammation in his right elbow, per Mark Bowman of MLB.com. The team’s hope is that the 25-year-old is dealing with bone spurs and not something more nefarious,” MLB Trade Rumors’ Steve Adams wrote.\n\nWith these injuries already piling up, the Braves are now trying to make one last push for Lucas Giolito, one of the final remaining starters in free agency.\n\n“Per league sources, Lucas Giolito’s market is gaining momentum toward a deal, likely this week. Atlanta and San Diego Padres have intensified their pursuit and moved to the forefront of discussions. The Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets have also remained in contact dating back to the Winter Meetings,” MLB reporter Julian Scott wrote.\n\nThe Braves appear to be going all-in on Giolito following the recent injury news involving Schwellenbach and Waldrep. Atlanta needs to land a starting pitcher who is at least somewhat appealing on the current market.\n\nTension is already building in Atlanta. If a move isn’t made quickly, the season could be in jeopardy before it even begins. And if the Braves continue to strike out, they may be forced to roll with what they have until the season progresses.",

    "fullText": "Few stories in recent baseball history have been as unexpected or captivating as the one unfolding around Joey Gallo, the veteran slugger and former star who’s attempting a comeback to the big leagues in a role few envisioned: as a pitcher.\n\nGallo, a two-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner best known for his prodigious power and towering home runs over a decade-long MLB career, is taking an unconventional path back to baseball’s highest level. After struggling as a hitter late in his career and bouncing between several teams, he has turned his focus to the mound in hopes of carving out a new chapter for himself in 2026.\n\nMORE: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDrafted by the Texas Rangers in 2012, Gallo built a reputation as one of the game’s most feared home-run hitters, posting back-to-back 40-plus homer seasons in 2017 and 2018. But his offensive contributions came with a high cost: Gallo struck out at one of the highest rates in baseball and finished his career with a batting average well below the league average.\n\nAs his defensive versatility diminished and offensive struggles mounted, he cycled through the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, Minnesota Twins, and Washington Nationals before hitting free agency.\n\nIn 2025, Gallo signed a minor-league deal with the Chicago White Sox, only to be released after he revealed his intention to transition to pitching — a move that stunned fans and analysts alike but also showed his determination to stay in the game.\n\nOne of the key reasons teams have taken note of Gallo’s transformation is his incredible arm strength. Throughout his career as an outfielder, he consistently ranked among the hardest throwers in MLB. His outfield throws clocked in the mid-90s and were well above average. That raw arm talent provides a foundation for his attempt to become a pitcher. That is something very few position players ever contemplate at the major-league level.\n\nSince announcing his intentions to switch roles, Gallo has been working on his delivery, mechanics, and pitch development. He has posted videos of bullpen sessions and workouts on social media, showcasing not just arm strength but a willingness to retool his entire approach to the game.\n\nWhat once seemed like an off-the-wall experiment has slowly gained traction. Reports from MLB insiders indicate that multiple teams have shown legitimate interest in evaluating Gallo on the mound. With spring training workouts already underway, Gallo has begun throwing for interested clubs in Florida. Scouts are watching closely to see how his pitches — reportedly reaching into the low-to-mid-90s — play in live settings.\n\nThis kind of curiosity isn’t unprecedented — former hitters like Anthony Gose and Tyler Naquin have pursued pitching conversions. There have been varying degrees of success in recent years, of course. Gallo’s case is still remarkable because of how firmly established he was as a slugger.\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Former MLB all-star hitter is attempting a comeback as a pitcher appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The 32-year-old guard has been excellent throughout his career with the Eagles and Steelers.\n\n\"During his three seasons in Pittsburgh, Seumalo showcased his talent as a run blocker in gap (82nd percentile) and zone (92nd percentile) concepts. But where he really sets himself apart is through his ability to sell the run out of play action without overextending, having generated the fourth-highest play-action PFF pass-blocking grade (87.8) among guards over the past three seasons.\"\n\nSeumalo has appeared in 125 games, including 104 starts, during his time with the Eagles (2016–2022) and Steelers (2023–2025). He also earned the first Pro Bowl recognition of his career with Pittsburgh in 2024.\n\nIf Pittsburgh loses out on Seumalo, Buffalo Bills guard David Edwards would make an excellent substitution, with our Steelers Wire free agency scouting report giving fans a better idea of his potential fit.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, including any offseason moves, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers predicted to lose Isaac Seumalo to Raiders, per PFF",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – Just like that, it appears the Milwaukee Brewers have their third baseman for 2026.\n\nAccording to a report from MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, Luis Rengifo has agreed to terms on a one-year pact worth $3.5 million with another $1.5 million available in incentives.\n\nThe deal, according to Feinsand, also includes a $10 million mutual option for 2027.\n\nAs of early Friday evening, Feb. 13 the Brewers had yet to announce the transaction.\n\nTo see Milwaukee make a move for Rengifo is hardly surprising considering the position had been thrown into tumult since the surprise trade of last season's starter, Caleb Durbin, to the Boston Red Sox on Feb. 9.\n\nDavid Hamilton, acquired in the Durbin deal, and Jett Williams were the most likely candidates for the job heading into camp until the Rengifo addition, with prospects Brock Wilken, Luke Adams and Jesús Made also expected to see time at third.\n\nIn Rengifo, the Brewers are buying low on a seven-year veteran of the major leagues who is coming off a down 2025 after compiling three straight productive seasons for the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nA switch-hitter who turns 29 on Feb. 26, Rengifo hit .238 with nine home runs and 43 runs batted in with an OPS of .622 and 10 stolen bases in a career-high 147 games with the Angels last year.\n\nRengifo's strikeout rate isn't awful (19.2%, 62nd percentile in the majors) but he doesn't walk much, either (6.1%, 24th percentile). In addition, he struggled hitting the ball hard (24th percentile or lower in three key categories) with just 15th percentile bat speed.\n\nDefensively, Rengifo also struggled, accounting for minus-seven outs above average and minus-five defensive runs saved in 76 games at third with a below-average throwing arm.\n\nOne facet of Rengifo's game is right up the Brewers' alley – versatility. He also played 74 games at second base and 10 more spread between all three outfield positions.\n\nRengifo even logged a couple innings at shortstop.\n\nHe represents the second veteran to reportedly agree to terms with the Brewers this week; catcher Gary Sánchez is also expected to come aboard on a one-year deal to serve as backup to William Contreras.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Brewers reportedly agree to deal with veteran infielder Luis Rengifo",

In his recent post, Diaz reiterated his belief that he launched the concept.\n\n“Let’s not act like I didn’t start a whole division bringing value to all these guys claiming they’re it. I gave opportunity and put notice on the dopest fights I got unfinished business, and I plan on going and taking what’s mine ASAP.”\n\n“First to ever start a division and the dopest one at that. You’re welcome, m————. I’ll see you soon, I’m coming.”\n\nThe message circulated rapidly, adding to ongoing debate about a potential return to the Octagon.\n\nThe BMF belt is currently set to be defended by Max Holloway against Charles Oliveira at UFC 326. Diaz has not fought in the UFC since his contract concluded following a win over Tony Ferguson.\n\nHe has since competed in boxing, including a rematch victory over Masvidal. Dana White has previously indicated Diaz would be welcome back should he decide to rejoin the organisation.\n\nWith his latest statement signalling intent, attention now shifts to whether Diaz will act on his vow to settle unfinished business inside the cage.\n\nConor McGregor vs. Nate Diaz rivalry massively changed Nick Diaz’s life\n\nJon Jones shares honest take on Nate Diaz, dismissing his ‘gangster’ image\n\nNate Diaz slammed as ‘delusional’ for targeting surprising name in UFC return bid",

    "description": "A software veteran predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers.",
    "fullText": "Software engineers are getting crushed by AI, and they think you're next.\n\nAI's ability to automate code is simultaneously making developers productive and overworked. One technologist said his job is harder than ever, lamenting that \"AI fatigue\" is real.\n\nThe good news is it won't last forever. The bad news is that's because most of them will be out of a job.\n\nSoftware veteran Steve Yegge predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers. (He wasn't a total drag. Yegge offered advice to software engineers for avoiding the 'vampiric effect' of AI.)\n\n\"Ok, but I don't work in tech. Why do I care?\" you callously ask. (So cold!)\n\nWell, according to the people in the thick of it, AI isn't stopping with them.\n\nMatt Shumer, the CEO of an AI startup, warned AI's disruption will be \"much bigger\" than COVID. The post has racked up more than 69 million views on X, gaining traction outside traditional tech circles. Shumer spoke to BI's Brent D. Griffiths about the post and the fact that he (surprise!) used AI to help him write it.\n\nIt's worth noting Shumer's company specializes in AI personal assistants. He certainly benefits from getting people on board with AI. But that doesn't invalidate a lot of his points about workers needing to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThere's a counterargument to the doomsday prophecy.\n\nMaybe engineering jobs are especially ripe for AI disruption?\n\nThe job, after all, is highly digital and requires hard skills, two factors that make it a strong candidate for AI automation.\n\nSoftware engineers have also been somewhat insulated from the tech-based disruptions the rest of us have endured and adapted to during the pre-AI times. A new tool here. A new app there. At some point, many of us have gotten numb to tech disrupting what we do. You just figure out how to adapt.\n\nMeanwhile, software engineers were living on easy street. You don't have to worry about the tools when you're the ones building them. For years, software developers enjoyed healthy salaries, good work-life balance, and fantastic job security.\n\nNow the tables are turned, and suddenly it's everyone's problem?\n\nI'm not suggesting AI won't impact the rest of us. For starters, entry-level jobs across the board appear to be on the chopping block thanks to AI. Consultants also seem ripe for some shakeups. And the legal industry is certainly feeling the heat.\n\n(I could mention journalism, but we were on the extinction list long before AI. When I started college in 2007, my professors all told me the industry was dying. Almost two decades later, we're still here. If anything, it looks like AI has created some high-paying jobs for writers.)\n\nAI might end up being massively disruptive for all of us, but at this point, we're all used to it.\n\nWhere do you stand on the AI doomsday prophecy?

    "fullText": "If Not Malik Willis, Who? Browns need to eye this veteran QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAndrew Berry didn’t slam the door on adding an outside quarterback this offseason, but if the Browns do go shopping, it shouldn’t be for Malik Willis.\n\nWillis is expected to command somewhere in the $30–40 million range, and that simply doesn’t line up with Cleveland’s salary cap reality. Deshaun Watson’s contract still looms large on the books, and tying up more major money in a quarterback who has barely played just doesn’t add up. That should be a non-starter for Berry.\n\nThe national media hype linking Willis to Cleveland is unfounded said longtime Browns analyst Tony Grossi on ESPN radio, and is a \"lazy\" take because of the team's uncertainty at the position. One example is this X post quoting NFL insider Jason La Canfora:\n\nPer @JasonLaCanfora Both the #Browns and #Dolphins are two of the most interested teams in QB Malik Willis in free agency\n\nThe speculation could be a deal similar to Justin Fields 2-years, 40 Million (30 Guaranteed)\n\nThis report indicates that Willis made a strong impression on…\n\n— Bob Pompeani (@KDPomp) February 10, 2026\n\nMore: Browns warning: Don’t fall for the $40M Malik Willis hype and salary cap trap\n\nWillis started one game this past season (a Packers loss) and has yet to show he can carry an offense over a long stretch. Investing that much cash in a dart throw QB with all the cap restraints already in place is a pipe dream at best.\n\nIf the Browns add a quarterback, the move should be about stability, not splash.\n\nTyler “Snoop” Huntley makes far more sense. He’s a reliable veteran backup who’s handled meaningful snaps, kept teams afloat, and understands what it means to step in without derailing a locker room.\n\nHe’s also been through Browns training camp before, and new head coach Todd Monken knows him well from their time in Baltimore. Maybe most appealing is that he won’t break the bank.\n\nThe priority in 2026 should be simple. Find out what you truly have in Shedeur Sanders by giving him a proper training camp and taking reps with the starters. A secondary goal should be seeing whether Deshaun Watson has anything left to contribute coming off of two Achilles surgeries.\n\nA steady backup like Huntley supports that plan.

    "description": "You’ve reached the Derek Carr portion of the Minnesota Vikings’ offseason. The veteran signal-caller entered the purple rumor mill this […]",
    "fullText": "You’ve reached the Derek Carr portion of the Minnesota Vikings’ offseason. The veteran signal-caller entered the purple rumor mill this week after reports indicated that the 34-year-old may want back in the big leagues.\n\nIt’s probably smoke, but Carr’s name fits the offseason carousel: a veteran bridge, a familiar resume, and a reasonable price tag.\n\nNeeding a quarterback to partner with J.J. McCarthy in 2026, the Vikings, in theory, could explore what it would take to pry Carr away from the New Orleans Saints, who still own his contractual rights. Carr previously retired last May.\n\nEvery avenue at QB has been exhausted for the Vikings’ rumor mill this offseason, and we’re only a month in.\n\nCarr will be a name in the quarterback carousel this offseason. NFL.com reported Monday, “As quarterback injuries mounted this season and into the playoffs, teams conducted due diligence on Carr, trying to gather information as to whether the former Saints franchise passer would consider coming out of retirement, sources tell The Insiders.”\n\n“The Bengals, for instance, contacted Carr after Joe Burrow went down with his turf toe injury. That work continues, and an offseason of quarterback uncertainty — with limited options in free agency, trades and the draft — makes Carr a possible solution in the right situation.”\n\nCarr started 10 games for the 2024 Saints, fired up a 15-touchdown to 5-interception split, and his team finished 5-5 on his watch.\n\nNFL.com continued, “The Saints still hold Carr’s rights, though Tyler Shough’s impressive rookie season, the amicable end to Carr’s time in New Orleans and the way the sides worked through any salary-cap issues add up to his tolled contract being an unlikely hurdle in the process.”\n\n“The Saints could ask for compensation in a trade, though the price surely wouldn’t be an unreasonable ask for a player who has no future in New Orleans.”\n\nThere is no explicit interest from the Vikings in Carr; we haven’t reached that juncture of the offseason. That’s a few weeks away, if any.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Vikings-themed websites and voices from running with the Carr-to-MIN theory. For example, Minnesota Sports Fan‘s Eric Strack wrote, “Obviously, Cincinnati won’t be a landing spot for Derek Carr anymore. But I know a place that would be. Out of all the quarterbacks the Vikings could go for, Carr might be the best realistic option, if he really is as healthy as Rapoport claims he is.”\n\n“The Vikings have made it abundantly clear to other teams and NFL insiders that ‘all bets are off’ this offseason, in their search for a veteran quarterback. And if you put Carr up against Kirk Cousins or Mac Jones… he might be the best of all three options.”\n\nVikings-oriented social media accounts, especially on X, ran with the Carr idea.\n\n#Saints QB Derek Carr could unretire if the right situation and coaching staff presents itself, per @RapSheet. \n\nDo you think the #Vikings should try to lure Carr out of retirement? pic.twitter.com/HKGkOSEOtQ\n\n— VikingzFanPage (@vikingzfanpage) February 9, 2026\n\nNJ.com‘s Chris Franklin named the Vikings and the Dolphins as two clubs that express interest in Carr. He noted on Minnesota, “Another team to watch would be the Minnesota Vikings. Last year’s starter J.J. McCarthy struggled mightily, completing just 57.6% of his passes for 1,632 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.”\n\n“Vikings head coach and offensive play-caller Kevin O’Connell will need to boost his offense to not only keep him off the hot seat but also to maximize the talent of wide receiver Justin Jefferson, who had career lows in receiving yards (1,048) and touchdowns (two). The Vikings would also have to hope their banged-up offensive line, including left tackle Christian Darrisaw and center Ryan Kelly, remains healthy.”\n\nScaled to a 17-game season, Carr’s numbers, on average, look like this since his career began in 2014:\n\nIt’s worth noting that the average includes his prime years; Carr will be 35 when the 2026 regular season begins.\n\nHere’s his NFL ranking per season in EPA+CPOE in the last decade:\n\n2016: 16th\n2017: 19th\n2018: 18th\n2019: 7th\n2020: 10th\n2021: 15th\n2022: 21st\n2023: 15th\n2024: 13th\n\nWith that efficiency, Carr would likely drag Minnesota to the postseason but stumble before the Super Bowl — a story fans know too well.\n\nJust Another Name in the Hopper\n\nFor now, Carr is just another name for the Vikings to consider in an offseason when they want to sign or trade for an extra quarterback. McCarthy will need an insurance policy or outright competition. Carr can provide either.\n\nThe annoying part of the blooming Carr sweepstakes is the Saints’ control. His next team must work out terms to take him away from New Orleans, and that might involve a draft pick. Most expect that draft capital to be negligible — like a 6th- or 7th-Round selection — but it won’t be as easy as signing Carr from free agency. The Saints hold the cards.\n\nCarr has thrown for over 4,000 yards in a season four times.\n\nMinnesota will operate this offseason, at least for a while, without an official general manager after Kwesi Adofo-Mensah was fired on January 30th. Rob Brzezinski holds an interim title, and he’s worked for the Vikings since 1999.",

    "description": "Opinion: After decades in the trenches, this engineer is done with hype cycles",
    "fullText": "Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is \"enterprise IT\" marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.\n\nDuring a coffee break at this year's CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won't name them – we're sure that they'd prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.\n\nThis vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we've had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.\n\nThey called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:\n\nAdding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…\n\nContainers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren't a deployment method. You shouldn't need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you're not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren't competent enough to deploy a container either.\n\nKubernetes: If you don't need containers, then you don't need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won't happen, so you won't lose any of that imaginary business.\n\n(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)\n\nThe cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company's important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.\n\n(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There's Just Somebody Else's Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)\n\nAnything \"as a service\" – it doesn't matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don't even get servers, just OS instances. That's even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don't even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it's running; you don't get software, and you don't even know what data you have or how it's stored – you're paying for access to your own stuff.\n\n(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch's Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)\n\nThe blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world's slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they're longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.\n\nWhich brings us round to \"generative AI\" or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can't be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn't. It's predictive text turned up to 11. It can't even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:\n\nThe \"i\" in \"LLM\" stands for intelligence.\n\n(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)\n\nHonestly, we can't fault any of this reasoning. We've looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it's not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it \"relatively new,\" it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google's Gmail in 2004.\n\nCloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.\n\nWhoever \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn't come to The Reg's attention until 2011.\n\n2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.\n\nKubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running \"Borg\" internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.\n\nSo in chronological order, those are:\n\n2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS\n\n2004: SaaS reaches the general public\n\n2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD's Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme\n\n2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world\n\n2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff\n\nAll right, yes, rather more than 15 years. \"A century of tech BS\" seems a bit over the top when it's only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.\n\nObviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers' religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl 60 is officially underway, with the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks trading blows for the Lombardi Trophy. On one side is Sam Darnold, a veteran whose career has shifted gears over the past two seasons. On the other is Drake Maye, the second-year quarterback who’s brought some life back to a franchise that got used to yearly Super Bowl trips under Tom Brady.\n\nThe stakes are clear, and the energy inside Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara shows it. But as much as fans are locked into what’s happening on the field, something else has taken over social media. Food. One specific item has blown up online.\n\nMORE: NFL WAGs turn heads on Sports Illustrated swimsuit covers ahead of Super Bowl 60\n\nBefore kickoff, a burger priced at $180 started making the rounds on social media. The reactions have been a mix of disbelief and jokes. Fans better have come hungry, because this is not some casual snack. They also better not have left their wallets at home.\n\nLevy Restaurants made just 200 of what they’re calling the LX Hammer Burger for Super Bowl Sunday. It’s a loaded cheeseburger with braised bone-in beef shank, roasted mirepoix demi-glace, and blue cheese fondue spilling over the sides. Everything sits on a brioche bun.\n\nHere it is, folks.\n\nThe LX Hammer Burger.\n\nIt’s $180 at the Super Bowl today. @LevyRestaurants is making 200.\n\nIt’s a cheeseburger with braised bone-in beef shank, roasted mirepoix demi-glace, and Point Reyes bleu cheese fondue on baked brioche bun. pic.twitter.com/JgkPQwDerN\n\n— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) February 8, 2026\n\nSome fans might be curious enough to give it a shot. Most people online cannot get past the price, calling it another case of Super Bowl excess.\n\nOne fan wrote, “I’d rather bite my thumb off and eat it rather than paying 180 for that. There is no doubts that the burger might be tasty, but for 180, nah. I’m expecting wagyu beef for that sum.”\n\nAnother commented, “At that price they can keep it\n\nalways eat somewhere other than the stadium!”\n\nThe most expensive concession item at Super Bowl LX is a $180 beef shank burger that feeds 4 people\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) February 8, 2026\n\nSomeone else wrote, “Mortgage just for a burger.”\n\nAnother fan added, “The majority of the people that would buy these aren’t sitting in a regular seat. They’ll be in a luxury box.”\n\nOne other fan chimed in, “Stop trying to normalize expensive concessions. I could doordash everything you see here, with a full 3 course meal and it’d cost half the price.”\n\nOne more fan wrote, “I know they need to make some margin but the markup on this is astronomical, even for stadium food.”\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL fans can’t believe the price of this Super Bowl 60 burger appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "\"It’ll be a memory that will never be forgotten,\" the 26-year Navy veteran said of the surprise.",
    "fullText": "It took a while for the news to sink in for Gary Schacher.\n\nHe was on a Zoom call with The American Legion and USAA to discuss the logistics of the 2026 Army-Navy game when he learned he was going to the Super Bowl.\n\n“We began talking about the Army-Navy game, and the person from USAA said, ‘Well, you know, the Army-Navy game is like the Super Bowl in college,’ and then he said, ‘Oh, and by the way, you’re going to the Super Bowl,’ and it didn’t register,” Schacher told the Deseret News on Tuesday.\n\n“It took a few more minutes of them to say it again and again that I was selected to go on a trip to the Super Bowl.”\n\nOnce the news finally hit him, Schacher was “shocked” and felt “extremely humbled.”\n\nSchacher, who served in the U.S. Navy and Navy Reserves for 26 years, is one of seven veterans surprised with trips to this year’s Super Bowl.\n\n“I had numerous friends volunteer to go with me, carry my bags. I told them they’d have to deal with my wife (Laurie) on that. She was coming with me,” he said.\n\nThe Navy veteran from Cobbleskill, New York, has USAA, The American Legion and New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart to thank for the opportunity.\n\nThe American Legion nominates veterans and then works with USAA, which partners with NFL players who have military connections or a history of military appreciation, to send those veterans to the Super Bowl.\n\nDart, who has family members who have served, partnered with USAA and The American Legion to announce Schacher’s selection on Jan. 29.\n\n#ad SZN 1 is done but still passing on blessings, sending fellow New Yorker GMC Gary S. to #SBLX in San Fran thanks to @USAA & @AmericanLegion. Gary spent 25+ years in the Navy. Proud to help honor his service 🏈🇺🇸 #SaluteToService pic.twitter.com/y03PUPfkkj\n\n— Jaxson Dart (@JaxsonDart) January 29, 2026\n\nIn a statement given to the Deseret News, Dart said he appreciated the connections he has made with fans and the New York community “who show up for us every single day.”\n\n“To show my appreciation, I’m grateful to work with USAA and The American Legion to recognize a deserving military veteran and NFL fan, GMC Gary Schacher with a trip to the Super Bowl! Coming from a military family myself, it’s important for me to honor those who served because we wouldn’t have the chance to do what we love on Sundays without the sacrifices made by heroes like Gary,” Dart said.\n\nAs part of Schacher’s trip, he gets to meet Dart and other NFL players in the Salute to Service Lounge at the Super Bowl.\n\nThat meeting is what Schacher’s looking forward to the most. Even though he’s a New York Jets fan, Schacher considers himself “a New York fan” and roots for the Giants — as long as they’re not playing the Jets.\n\n“He’s the up-and-coming star of the NFL,” Schacher said of Dart.\n\nThe topic Schacher really wants to talk to Dart about? His Corner Canyon High School connection with former Jets quarterback Zach Wilson.\n\nIn 1980, Schacher enlisted in the Navy at 19 years old in what he described as “a spur of the moment thing.”\n\nOne day, his friend, whose father served in the Army, asked Schacher if he wanted to come to the recruiter’s office with him.\n\nThere, they spoke to a Navy recruiter. A month later, Schacher and his friend had shipped out.\n\nThat “spur of the moment” led to 26 years of service. Schacher began his Navy career assigned to a ship in Mayport, Florida.\n\nAs a Navy reservist, he served with a Weapons Station Unit and a Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Unit. In 1990, he transferred to the Navy Seabees.\n\nHis service took him to several bases in the U.S. and overseas, including New Jersey, Rhode Island, Mississippi, Spain and Iraq, where he served his last tour.\n\nSchacher returned to active duty for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and 2004. He retired in 2006 at the rank of E7 Chief Petty Officer.\n\nSchacher’s two-plus decades of service earned him four Navy Commendation Medals and three Navy Achievement Medals, the Navy Expert Pistol Medal and the Navy Expert Rifle Medal.\n\nHe also received the New York Conspicuous Service Star and the New York Medal for Merit and was inducted into the New York State Senate Veterans Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nSchacher’s service to his fellow military men and women continued into his retirement as a founding member of the Leatherstocking Honor Flight, which transports World War II veterans to Washington, D.C., to visit the World War II memorial.\n\nHe also helped establish the Patriot Highlander Challenge obstacle course, a fundraiser for wounded veterans and support networks in New York.\n\nHe has also been heavily involved in The American Legion. In 2018, Schacher was the first Iraq War veteran to serve as commander of The American Legion Department of New York.\n\nThrough it all, Schacher has always loved playing and watching football, whether it’s high school, college or professional.\n\n“(It’s) just a great sport,” he said.\n\nSchacher sees parallels between the camaraderie found in the military and on football teams.\n\n“Because you’re so involved with your team, whether it’s military or athletics, the camaraderie is just unbelievable, and it’s part of why I joined The American Legion after I got out of the military was to keep that camaraderie,” he said.\n\nTwenty-one years ago, the Patriots beat the Eagles in the Super Bowl. At the time, Schacher was stationed in Iraq. The chief petty officer didn’t have access to a television feed to watch, but he remembers a concrete barrier on the base being painted in honor of the big game.\n\nSchacher doesn’t need to worry about having a television feed this year. He’ll be able to watch the game just fine from his seat at Levi’s Stadium.\n\n“I’m so extremely humbled to be chosen for this opportunity to both USAA and The American Legion and Jaxson Dart for making that press release inviting my wife and I. It’ll be a memory that will never be forgotten,” he said.\n\nWho will Schacher be cheering for Sunday? Definitely not his division rivals.\n\n“New England always destroys the Jets, so it’s hard for me to root for New England. So, I’m going to have to go with the Seattle Seahawks.”",

My ACL was fully functioning until last Friday. Just because it seems impossible to you doesn't mean it's not possible. And yes, my ACL is 100% ruptured. Not 80% or 50%. It's 100% gone.\"\n\nSutterer suggested that \"someone who had a prior tear/surgery may not be as swollen and painful with a repeat injury\" and \"the body has time to adapt and retrain muscles to support the knee\" if the injury is \"chronic\".\n\nVonn was 1.39 seconds off the fastest time of the day in Friday's training session, which took place in difficult weather and surface conditions.\n\nOn Saturday she improved on her time, completing the run in one minute 38.28 seconds, 0.37 seconds off compatriot Breezy Johnson, who clocked the fastest run, and more than six seconds faster than the first run.\n\nVonn is due to compete in Sunday's downhill competition but remains uncertain as to whether she will compete in the super-G and team events.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Raiders star pass rusher Maxx Crosby said Friday any talk of wanting out of Las Vegas did not come from him.\n\nOne NFL reporter said this week he expected Crosby to be traded because the seven-year veteran didn't want to go through another rebuild. Another NFL reporter said Crosby was especially interested in playing for New England coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nSpeaking from the team facility, Crosby said Friday on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that he intentionally hasn't spoken publicly this offseason because he learned he “can't control everything.”\n\n“Now that I'm quiet, I've got random people making big statements for me,” said Crosby, wearing a Raiders sweatshirt and skull cap. \"They're like, ‘Maxx must’ve told them this.' For me, I just sit back and laugh because I know my truth and when I go to bed at night, I have a smile on my face because I don't have to explain nothing to nobody.\n\n“I'm getting healthy. I'm in the building every single day. I'm in this building from 6 a.m. when it's dark out, and I'm here until almost 2. ... That's all I care about, so all the noise, that's news to me sometimes.\"\n\nSpeculation about Crosby's future with the Raiders ramped up late last season when the club placed him on injured reserve with two games left because of a knee injury. Crosby was not pleased about the decision and left the building.\n\nThe five-time Pro Bowler could attract a strong trade offer if the Raiders go that route. They are about to enter their third season in a row with a different head coach, with Seattle offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak expected to take the job after Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nLas Vegas comes off a 3-14 record, but will have the first pick in the draft and more than $91 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com.\n\nCrosby has had double-digit sacks three of the past four years, and this season had a career-high 28 tackles for loss.\n\nHe said his focus is on rehabilitating from left knee surgery that took place about a month ago.\n\n“I'm ahead of schedule, and it's business as usual,” Crosby said. “It's my eighth surgery in seven years. It's something that I've gotten used to. It's all about perspective, about how you approach what you want to accomplish. I'm willing to run that marathon.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Stefon Diggs played an instrumental role in the New England Patriots making it to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowler not only led New England in targets (102), receptions (85) and receiving yards (1,013) during the regular season but gave the offense a veteran presence in the locker room.\n\nDiggs revealed this week that he nearly joined the Patriots’ AFC Championship Game opponent — the Denver Broncos — over the offseason due in part to their head coach, Sean Payton.\n\n“I played against Sean Payton a lot. I’ve seen what his offense can do. So, that was the one thing,” the pass-catcher said, according to the Boston Herald’s Andrew Callahan. “And then a couple of people on the staff that I knew. (Quarterbacks coach) Davis Webb, I was familiar with. He helped me out a lot in Buffalo as far as learning the plays. … That’s kind of how it ended up happening.”\n\nDiggs added that in the end, New England’s decision to hire head coach Mike Vrabel last January, plus the presence of quarterback Drake Maye, influenced his final decision.\n\n“And in weighing my options on what’s going to be the best, I also like coach (Vrabel.) I had a little bit of interaction with him at the Pro Bowl and stuff like that,” the 32-year-old said, per Callahan. “And they had a young quarterback. They both had young quarterbacks. When you weigh all the pros and cons, I felt the Patriots were probably going to be the best fit.”\n\nEx-Patriots QB Joe Milton Dishes On Rumored Feud With Drake Maye",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn successfully completed her mandatory downhill training run at the Winter Olympics just one week after rupturing her left anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nThe 41-year-old announced on Tuesday that she had suffered the knee injury in a crash, which saw her airlifted to hospital, at the final World Cup race before the Games in Switzerland.\n\nBut Vonn, the Olympic downhill champion in 2010, completed a smooth run at the Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina in one minute 44.33 seconds, 1.39 seconds off the fastest time of the day.\n\nIn a powerful news conference earlier this week, Vonn had expressed her determination to compete in Sunday's downhill race but was unsure whether she would also make it to the team and Super-G events, which take place on 10 and 12 February respectively.\n\nSkiers must complete at least one training run to be able to compete in Sunday's race and will have the option of a second practice run on Saturday.\n\nIn a session heavily delayed because of foggy weather at the top of the course and already postponed from Thursday because of adverse weather conditions, many of the skiers missed gates on what was a soft course.\n\nThat means overall times might look fast but are somewhat deceptive - while missed gates in Sunday's race will result in disqualification.\n\nVonn appeared largely untroubled by her knee, which is supported by a brace, opting for an aggressive line to ensure she did not miss a gate in tough weather conditions and fist bumping compatriot Breezy Johnson after crossing the line.\n\nAfter finishing the run she was asked: \"All good?\"\n\n\"Yup,\" she replied, and walked away having said she would not speak to any media following the session.\n\nHer Norwegian coach and double Olympic gold medallist Aksel Lund Svindal did speak to reporters and said he thinks Vonn still has a chance of winning a medal.\n\n\"From what I saw today I think she can,\" he said.\n\n\"There were reserves today. She looked symmetrical. You've seen earlier this season that when she skis well, she can win. It's going to be hard but I think she could possibly bring that on Sunday.\"\n\nVonn has said that her knee is not swollen or painful and that is why she felt \"confident\" she could compete, posting a video on her Instagram of her doing a barbell squat in the gym on Thursday.\n\nThe four-time world champion was one of the favourites for the gold medal in Cortina prior to her injury and leads the standings in the downhill World Cup.\n\nVonn is aiming for a remarkable comeback having retired from the sport in 2019 before returning in December 2024 following a partial replacement of her right knee.\n\nWhat's happening and when at the Winter Olympics\n\nAll you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nChemmy Alcott, four-time Olympic Team GB skier\n\nIt's fair to say the girls expected a much more substantial base than what they skied on in this training run - there was a lot of head bobbling entering the finish and a bit of a lack of trust.\n\nThat's because of the warm weather - it's kind of like a sugar coating on the top of the slope so they're not getting that confidence or purchase on the outside ski.\n\nFor Vonn, it's fantastic to get the run in and it all came down to experience for her.\n\nShe knows this hill, this is one of her favourite hills and watching her ski with one ACL on that terrain you could tell that she reads the terrain and knows it.\n\nI think it will be a massive confidence boost for her, especially in these conditions where a lot of the other athletes struggled and she delivered a good performance.\n\nThere's things to work on, a few times you could see a bit of backing off on that knee but she successfully skied at 80mph with a torn ACL.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Arizona law enforcement officers mourned a veteran U.S. Marine and a trooper paramedic Friday while the cause of a helicopter crash that killed them during a shootout with a domestic violence suspect in Flagstaff remained under investigation.\n\nThe helicopter crew had been playing a common role, helping officers on the ground, Arizona Department of Public Safety Director Col. Jeffrey Glover said.\n\n“They have the ability of getting eyes and ears up top,” he said. “They have a very important role when they are running their missions.”\n\nThe aircraft had been inspected most recently on Jan. 29 and what caused it to crash was “under active investigation” by agencies including the National Transportation Safety Board, Glover said.\n\n“At this stage, it would be inappropriate and irresponsible to speculate,” he said.\n\nTrooper Hunter R. Bennett, 28, and pilot Robert Skankey, 61, were killed.\n\nThe suspect, whose identity has not been released, fired on officers from multiple rooftops in Flagstaff over almost two hours Wednesday night. He was captured minutes before the helicopter crash.\n\nThe confrontation began when law enforcement officers responded to a domestic violence call, Flagstaff Police Chief Sean Connolly said Thursday.\n\nAs the officers spoke with the victim in the front yard, the suspect opened fire on them from the back of the residence with a semiautomatic long rifle.\n\nA protracted gunbattle ensued, with the unidentified suspect “hopping from roof to roof” in the neighborhood while shooting at officers. The police chief described the neighborhood as “under siege” while the suspect shot on officers and into homes.\n\nThe suspect was taken to a hospital with nonfatal gunshot wounds.\n\nConnolly indicated three Flagstaff police officers and one Department of Public Safety employee fired their weapons during the altercation.\n\nSkankey was a longtime resident of Kingman, Arizona, city officials said in a statement. He had been hired by the Arizona Department of Public Safety in May 2021 and previously served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was married and had four children, Glover said.\n\nBennett was an honors graduate of Arizona State University and the top graduate of his 2023 Arizona Law Enforcement Academy class. He transferred to an air rescue unit in 2024 and months later married his high school sweetheart officials said.\n\nThe spelling of the pilot’s last name has been corrected from Skanky to Skankey, based on new information from authorities.",

    "title": "How Casemiro revived his Man Utd career",
    "description": "Casemiro's Manchester United career looked to be petering out, but the veteran midfielder has found a return to form this season.",
    "fullText": "It was the lowest point of Casemiro's Manchester United career. A 2-0 home defeat by Newcastle on 30 December 2024.\n\nThat night, his team-mate Joshua Zirkzee was sarcastically cheered off by his own supporters, substituted after just 33 minutes.\n\nBut the common consensus that night was that if Casemiro had been brought off at that point, the reaction would have been worse.\n\nThe 33-year-old didn't play for a month after that, consigned to the bench for the following five games.\n\nYet if there was a debate now as to which player United could least afford to lose for the rest of the season, Casemiro would be near the top of the list.\n\nOnce, the Brazilian looked leggy and exposed in midfield. Now, he shines. The midfielder will leave Old Trafford when his contract expires at the end of the season - and it looks as if he will do so on a positive note. How has the veteran turned it around?\n\nWhy Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision\n\n'Form is temporary, class is permanent,' the football adage goes. But form is dictated by a number of factors.\n\nA footballer's performances can be affected by the side they play for, their tactics, their team-mates. Form is about situation.\n\nSo it can look as if a player has become worse - when in reality, the conditions around them have changed, limiting their chance to thrive.\n\nThis season, Casemiro has found himself in the situations that get the best out of him, more often.\n\nWhen Ruben Amorim was United's head coach, between November 2024 and January 2026, Casemiro had to play in a physically demanding role.\n\nBut his pre-season preparation was key in matching those demands this season, with the midfielder visibly leaner and stronger.\n\n\"Pre-season [is] a time to really grind, and really do some real work, then during the season you can focus more on the games themselves,\" he said about his summer.\n\nAmorim also deserves some credit for improving the squad's fitness this season too, a notable strength of his.\n\nWhen Liverpool were looking at successors to Jurgen Klopp, one area they looked at was an ability to keep their players fit, at which Arne Slot ranked second only to the Portuguese manager.\n\nThe fact United haven't played in European competition this season and were eliminated early from the domestic cups - meaning a total of just 40 games - will have helped protect Casemiro's legs in his final season at United too.\n\nIn his short time as United head coach since replacing the sacked Amorim in January, Michael Carrick has improved the conditions that Casemiro has found himself in on the pitch.\n\nDefensively, moving from Amorim's 5-2-3 shape, which required players to press high at times, to a more conservative and compact 4-4-2 shape has reduced the distances he has to cover.\n\nAdmittedly, United have played teams that look to dominate the ball, but under Carrick, Casemiro is averaging 10.3km per 90 minutes compared to the 10.7km per 90 minutes he ran under Amorim.\n\nIn wide areas, particularly during the 2-0 win over Manchester City on 17 January, the full-back, winger and striker near the ball would come over to apply pressure alongside the closest United central midfielder. This reduced the distances Casemiro had to defend alone, allowing him to win the ball more effectively.\n\nConserving his energy and making the most of his actions is a theme that continues into his duelling statistics under Carrick. Casemiro has contested an average of 9.5 duels per 90 minutes under Carrick - compared to 12.6 under Amorim. His success rate, however, has jumped up from 51% to 58%.\n\nIn attack, Casemiro boasts five goals and two assists in the Premier League this season, one goal away from his most prolific league campaign ever.\n\nWith more non-penalty goals than Viktor Gyokeres, Mohamed Salah and Bukayo Saka, Casemiro's contributions in attack have put United in contention for Champions League qualification.\n\nFour of his goals have come directly from set-pieces or the phase of play immediately after.\n\nThis season, United have become the most efficient scorers from set-pieces. They have scored eight per 100 set-pieces in the Premier League - something Amorim's assistant Carlos Fernandes deserves praise for.\n\nFrom set-pieces, Casemiro has typically been found at the back post, using a burst of speed to get free of his marker before heading the ball home, as he did in the 3-2 win against Fulham last Sunday.\n\nUnited have often paired Casemiro's back-post position with having a nearby team-mate use their body to provide a 'screen' - blocking opponents from getting close to the Brazilian as the ball floats over their head.\n\nIn addition to his goals, his general play on the ball looks far better this season.\n\nCasemiro has a tendency to play direct passes often - which can be a good or bad trait depending on a team's tactics.\n\nWith Amorim in charge, players were encouraged to execute certain passing routines that ended with the midfielders playing direct passes quickly to attackers running in behind.\n\nThat made games more end-to-end. But if the defenders didn't step up as passes were played, it left the two midfielders with huge spaces to cover.\n\nPairing Casemiro with a strong runner in Bruno Fernandes helped mitigate some of these concerns but under Carrick, general play has been more measured.\n\nThe defensive midfield and attacking lines are closer together - with the team moving more collectively. With this more controlled approach in attack, Casemiro's direct passing becomes a necessary risk rather than something that exposes the weaknesses of the team.\n\nFor Matheus Cunha's goal against Fulham, the ball moved from the right side of the pitch to Casemiro in the centre. Casemiro turned his body and head to face towards the left, disguising his intentions - causing Fulham midfielder Alex Iwobi to shift that way.\n\nThis opened up space for Casemiro to play a through ball, resulting in Cunha's goal.\n\nDuring Casemiro's worst run of form, questions were asked of his ability on the ball, under pressure, in build-up play.\n\nThis season, Amorim often skipped short build-up, with goalkeeper Senne Lammens more suited to playing long. These more chaotic moments of the game suited Casemiro who often read where the ball would land, winning second balls proactively.\n\nAgainst Fulham, Carrick asked United to build out from the back at times, while accounting for Casemiro's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn build-up, Casemiro peeled wide at times. This dragged his marker, Iwobi, into an unfamiliar position while opening up a passing lane centrally for Kobbie Mainoo to receive the ball.\n\nFinding the more technically secure player under pressure is a sensible use of personnel. Casemiro then moved closer to Mainoo, asking for the ball, under less pressure.\n\nCasemiro was used in a similar way his most successful spell as a player at Real Madrid. Head coaches Zinedine Zidane and Carlo Ancelotti both asked Luka Modric and Toni Kroos to drop deep and build up play, pushing Casemiro further forward when Real had the ball, minimising the number of times he was in situations where he might struggle.\n\nFairly or not, the way a footballer finishes their career tends to dictate how they are remembered.\n\nRaheem Sterling, for instance, made his debut at 17, and has won numerous trophies, but perhaps gets less respect than he deserves because of how the past few years of his career have petered out.\n\nFor a player as accomplished as Casemiro, central to one of Real Madrid's greatest eras, there was a genuine risk of his reputation suffering after last season.\n\nThe manner of his revival - helped by his buying into Carrick's use of him - has laid the platform for a much happier conclusion to his career in England.\n\nWith United five points off third place, and with 42 points to play for, the serial winner will hope to leave Manchester United with no regrets.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Honors celebrated the defining performances and stories of the 2025 season, recognizing excellence that went far beyond the box score. From veteran stars reaching new heights to emerging talents announcing their arrival, this year’s winners reflected the league’s unique blend of longevity, resilience, and evolution. Together, these awards capture the moments and individuals who shaped the NFL’s narrative over the past season.\n\nMatthew Stafford captured his first NFL MVP award after a remarkable 17th season in the league. He led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes. His performance was a career-high and pivotal in the Rams’ offensive success, showcasing both precision and longevity at age 37. Stafford’s journey from years of underappreciated play in Detroit to peak form in Los Angeles adds a compelling arc to his MVP narrative. Despite his veteran status, he announced intentions to continue playing, hinting at even more chapters ahead.\n\nSmith-Njigba emerged as the league’s top offensive weapon, setting franchise records and finishing with 1,793 receiving yards — the most in the NFL for the 2025 season. His route running, consistency, and ability to create separation made him a matchup nightmare for defenses. He became the focal point of Seattle’s attack and proved he’s more than just a deep threat, becoming a true WR1. His production helped elevate the Seahawks into serious playoff contention.\n\nMyles Garrett’s season will go down in history — he shattered the NFL single-season sack record with 23 and logged 33 tackles for loss. His relentless pass rush and ability to disrupt games earned him Defensive Player of the Year honors for a second time. Garrett’s dominance, even when facing constant double teams, illustrated his evolution into one of the truly elite defenders in the league. His impact extended beyond sacks, as he altered offensive game plans weekly.\n\nMcMillan made an immediate splash in his rookie season, leading all first-year players in receiving and showcasing a polished route tree and natural ball skills. His chemistry with his quarterback and knack for big plays gave the Panthers a reliable and explosive weapon. The award signals the start of a potentially incredible NFL career, with McMillan already displaying pro-caliber instincts. His performance brought excitement to Carolina’s offense and optimism for the future.\n\nSchwesinger arrived as a surprise standout, amassing impressive tackle totals and impact plays that anchored the Browns’ defense. His instincts in coverage and physicality in run support distinguished him from his draft class peers. Winning Defensive Rookie of the Year validated his immediate contribution and hinted at future stardom. His emergence added a dynamic element to Cleveland’s defense.\n\nThuney’s performance as an interior offensive lineman earned him the inaugural Protector of the Year award, emphasizing his role in stabilizing the Bears’ offensive front. His pass protection and run-blocking prowess helped elevate Chicago’s offensive efficiency. Known for his intelligence and technique, Thuney became a leader on the line. This award recognizes the importance of unsung linemen who anchor offensive success.\n\nMcCaffrey’s journey back from significant injury was one of the most impressive stories of the season, finishing with over 2,100 scrimmage yards and 17 touchdowns. His versatility — as a runner, receiver, and team leader — made him indispensable to the 49ers’ offense. The award honors not just statistical excellence but resilience and dedication to rehabilitation. His triumphant return energized teammates and fans alike.\n\nVrabel guided the Patriots through a successful turnaround, leading them to an AFC East title and deep playoff push on his first year with the team. His leadership and game management earned recognition as Coach of the Year by his peers. Vrabel’s emphasis on culture and discipline translated into tangible improvement on the field. The award underscores his impact in transforming the Patriots into a contender.\n\nMcDaniels’ role as Assistant Coach of the Year reflects his influence in shaping the Patriots’ offensive identity and maximizing the talent on the roster. Known for his strategic approach and game-planning acumen, McDaniels helped elevate New England’s execution. His contributions were integral to the team’s success and competitive positioning.\n\nWagner was honored for his exceptional leadership on the field and impactful community service off it. The Walter Payton Man of the Year Award recognizes players who demonstrate commitment to their communities, and Wagner’s efforts have extended well beyond football. His charitable initiatives and mentorship work set a standard for NFL players. The award celebrates character and civic contribution.\n\nTaken as a whole, the complete list of 2026 NFL Honors winners tells the story of a season driven by elite play, leadership, and perseverance. Each awardee left a distinct imprint on their team and, in many cases, the broader direction of the league. As the NFL turns the page to a new season, these honorees stand as benchmarks for excellence and reminders of how special the 2025 campaign truly was.\n\nThe post Complete list of winners in 2026 NFL Honors appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets officially ended the soul searching portion of their offseason today, announcing the hire of Frank Reich as their new offensive coordinator.\n\nIn a move that feels both like a safe veteran play and a massive gamble, Head Coach Aaron Glenn has effectively handed Reich the keys to the kingdom. Glenn made it clear during the search that he wanted a head coach of the offense someone who could operate with total autonomy while Glenn refocuses on calling the defensive plays.\n\nBut for Jets fans, the question isn’t about Reich’s resume. It’s about which version of the man is stepping off the plane at Newark.\n\nTo understand the anxiety at One Jets Drive, you have to look at the two polar opposite outcomes of Reich’s recent career.\n\nThe Quarterback Whisperer (2017-2020) This is the Reich the Jets are praying for. This is the architect who helped Doug Pederson guide Nick Foles to a Super Bowl ring. This is the man who took a washed Philip Rivers in 2020 and squeezed out an 11-5 playoff season. This version of Reich is Multiple in the best way he adapts his scheme to his players, uses RPOs to protect his QB, and leans on a physical run game to set up deep shots.\n\nThe Scheme Rigid Veteran (2022-2023) This is the Reich who was fired mid season in back to back years. In Carolina, he was criticized for trying to force Bryce Young into a static pocket system that didn’t fit the rookie’s traits. The offense became predictable, horizontal, and frankly boring. This version of Reich prioritizes the system over the personnel, resulting in an offense that ranks in the bottom five of every meaningful category.\n\nIf Reich returns to his roots, the biggest winners are Breece Hall(If we bring him back. Please come back!) and Garrett Wilson.\n\nThe Run Game: Reich’s best years in Indy featured a dominant Jonathan Taylor. With Breece Hall, Reich has a weapon that can execute the Wide Zone scheme that defines his best work.\n\nThe X Factor: Garrett Wilson is the perfect rhythm receiver for Reich’s West Coast hybrid. If Reich can get back to the Triangle Reads and Mesh concepts that made the 2017 Eagles so dangerous, Wilson could see a career high in targets.",

    "fullText": "A veteran Paramount executive is leaving as David Ellison's company shakes up its ad sales leadership.\n\nChris Simon, a Paramount EVP of agency partnerships, is stepping down, three Paramount employees told Business Insider.\n\nSimon spent 31 years at the company, getting his start at CBS in the mid-'90s, and previously worked at USA Networks, according to his LinkedIn.\n\nTwo Paramount staffers said the news was shared during a mid-afternoon meeting on Wednesday, led by Jay Askinasi, Paramount's chief revenue officer, who joined the company in November.\n\nKaren Phillips, a 29-year company veteran whose title is also EVP of agency partnerships for Paramount Advertising, will oversee that team after Simon's departure, Askinasi told employees.\n\nAn experienced Paramount staffer briefed on the change described it as \"more strategic than financial,\" saying that consolidating Simon's position into Phillips' was done to \"remove duplication.\"\n\nA second employee characterized the move as being done to \"streamline processes\" and make \"Paramount easier to work with.\"\n\nA third Paramount insider familiar with the company's thinking said there were a few \"targeted changes\" on the personnel front in Paramount Advertising, \"focused on reducing complexity.\"\n\nSimon is \"stepping down,\" this person said, but would remain with the company for an unspecified period to ease the transition.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nSince taking the helm at Paramount in August, Ellison has made his mark on the company with moves like landing live UFC rights in the US, which is already showing signs of paying off, and by bringing in Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\nEllison also made a bold play to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, though WBD chose Netflix as its preferred acquirer — a decision Paramount is challenging with shareholders and in the courtroom.\n\nUnder Ellison, Paramount has also called most employees back to the office five days a week, made changes to its data and insights team, and looked to jazz up Paramount+ by exploring the addition of short-form video and interactive features.\n\nPersonnel shake-ups are common at companies with new leadership. Another change saw Paramount's head of streaming product and tech, Vibol Hou, leave the company at the end of January, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave a tip or Paramount-related story idea?

    "fullText": "The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is investigating the death of fishing boat captain and reality TV star Gus Sanfilippo, who died last week when his vessel capsized in Massachusetts (per CBS News).\n\nSanfilippo was the veteran captain of the Lilly Jean, which operated out of Gloucester, and a cast member on the reality show Nor’Easter Men. He died along with five of his fellow crew members and a NOAA fisheries observer when the 72-foot vessel capsized on Friday night as temperatures dipped to approximately 12 degrees Fahrenheit. The other victims have been identified as father and son Paul Beal Sr. and Paul Beal Jr.; John Rousanidis; Freeman Short; Sean Thierren; and 22-year-old NOAA observer Jada Sammitt, who recently graduated from an environmental biology program.\n\nThe Coast Guard will oversee the investigation from this point on. “The purpose of a Coast Guard investigation is to identify measures that can improve the safety of life and property at sea, not to assign civil or criminal blame,” said Lt. Cmdr. Brett Igo, the USCG Northeast District investigation oversight coordinator. Igo added that the investigation is expected to last several months, and that information will be released to the public as it becomes available.\n\nRescue officials responded to a distress call at around 7 a.m. local time on Jan. 30 roughly 25 miles off the coast of Cape Ann. After officials were unable to make contact with the crew, the Coast Guard issued an emergency alert and sent a helicopter along with a boat crew to the location. Rescuers found one person dead floating amongst debris of the Lilly Jean, though they have not confirmed whose body was found. Search and rescue efforts were suspended the following day after workers had searched a 1,000-square-mile radius and exhausted all efforts. All of the boat's seven occupants were officially declared dead later that day.\n\n“The decision to suspend the search was incredibly difficult,” said Capt. Jamie Frederick, commander of Coast Guard Sector Boston. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the family members and friends of the lost crew of the Lilly Jean, and with the entire Gloucester community during this heartbreaking time.”\n\nSebastian Noto, a fellow fisherman who worked closely with Sanfillipo, told NBC Boston that he spoke with his friend just hours before his death. “‘I quit. It’s too cold,’” Sanfilippo reportedly told Noto. “He was calm. He just couldn’t do the cold because the air holes were freezing.” “I was about 30 miles east of him,” Noto continued. “We usually work together all the time. We are like glue, man. We give a lot of information back-and-forth.”",

    "fullText": "Yankees reportedly pursuing $12M former MVP, 4-time Gold Glover, 7-time All-Star veteran originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees spent the entire offseason focused on signing one major free agent: Cody Bellinger, who is arguably the most versatile defender in the league. After months of negotiations, the Yankees finally reached an agreement to bring him back to the Bronx.\n\n“The New York Yankees and outfielder Cody Bellinger are in agreement on a five-year, $162.5 million contract, sources told ESPN's Jeff Passan on Wednesday, ending a standoff between two sides that preferred to reunite all winter long. The deal includes opt-outs after the second and third seasons, a $20 million signing bonus and a full no-trade clause, sources said,” ESPN’s Jorge Castillo wrote.\n\nWith Bellinger signed, it seemed the Yankees’ offseason was largely complete—until recently. The team is now seeking a right-handed bat still available on the market. One name they are pursuing is Paul Goldschmidt.\n\n“According to MLB insider Jon Heyman at the New York Post, the Yankees remain interested in retaining Goldschmidt on a new contract. Goldschmidt, 38, played 146 games for the Yanks in the 2025 season and posted a .731 OPS, which was actually an improvement over his .716 mark in 2024. The veteran first baseman smacked 10 home runs and drove in 45 runs, while continuing to play his typically reliable defense,” Fox Sports New Jersey’s Matt Dolloff wrote.\n\nGoldschmidt would serve strictly as a DH or a bench option. New York had decided to let him walk so Ben Rice could take over as the team’s first baseman.\n\n“Goldschmidt will not be re-signed, as Ben Rice is the club’s first baseman of the future,” The Athletic’s Chris Kirschner and Brendan Kuty wrote.\n\nGoldschmidt brings tremendous veteran leadership and a strong clubhouse presence. His playoff experience would be invaluable if the deal comes to fruition.\n\nThe Yankees are undoubtedly confident in their current roster, but there is always room for improvement. Adding Goldschmidt would bring back yet another familiar face to the Bronx.",

    "description": "Disney parks veteran Josh D'Amaro will take the torch from CEO Bob Iger. Here's the memo Disney's board chairman sent employees on Tuesday morning.",
    "fullText": "Disney just made it official: Josh D'Amaro will be its next CEO.\n\nD'Amaro, the experiences chairman who's been at the Mouse House since 1998, will take over for longtime CEO Bob Iger on March 18, Disney announced on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Josh possesses that rare combination of inspiring leadership and innovation with a keen eye for strategic growth opportunities and a deep passion for the Disney brand and its people — all of which make him the right person to take the helm as Disney's next CEO,\" James Gorman, Disney's board chairman, wrote in a memo to employees, which was viewed by Business Insider.\n\nGorman added that D'Amaro \"demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace.\"\n\nWhile D'Amaro's Disney's experience has thus far been limited to its Experiences division — which contains parks, cruises, and products — Gorman wrote that the incoming CEO \"has collaborated with some of the biggest names in entertainment\" while \"showcasing the power of combining Disney storytelling with cutting-edge technology.\"\n\nParks are a crucial pillar for Disney and generate the majority of its operating income. D'Amaro must manage the company's declining TV networks, which have been ravaged by cord-cutting, while continuing to grow streaming profits, which haven't yet made up the difference.\n\nDana Walden, the head of Disney Entertainment who was the other leading contender for the top job, is getting promoted to president and chief creative officer, Disney said.\n\n\"Dana is one of the most accomplished creative leaders in entertainment and has done an outstanding job,\" Gorman told employees.\n\nAfter two stints and nearly two decades as CEO, Iger will cede his role to D'Amaro next month and serve as a senior advisor until the end of the year. Iger's tenure will be remembered as a transformative era in which Disney bought Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, and entered into the streaming and AI age.\n\nRead the full memo from Gorman below:\n\nDear Disney Employees and Cast Members,\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to announce that Josh D'Amaro, Chairman of Disney Experiences, will be the next Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, effective at the Annual Meeting on March 18. Josh possesses that rare combination of inspiring leadership and innovation with a keen eye for strategic growth opportunities and a deep passion for the Disney brand and its people — all of which make him the right person to take the helm as Disney's next CEO.\n\nThis is wonderful news for all of us at Disney and I know you will join me in congratulating Josh on this well-deserved appointment.\n\nOver the past three years, the Disney Board has undertaken an exhaustive and disciplined process to identify and prepare the right leader for Disney's next chapter. Josh demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace. He has collaborated with some of the biggest names in entertainment to bring their stories to life in our parks, showcasing the power of combining Disney storytelling with cutting-edge technology. The Board believes he is exceptionally well prepared to guide this global company forward.\n\nBob Iger, who has led Disney to unprecedented success during his nearly two decades as CEO, has provided extensive mentorship to Josh throughout the succession process, and will continue to serve as Senior Advisor until his retirement from the company at the end of the year. Bob returned from retirement in 2022 at the Board's request to stabilize the company and make it fit for purpose, and to prepare Disney for this moment with a strong leadership bench, including potential successors. He has achieved all of this and more, and the Board and I are deeply grateful to Bob for his longstanding dedication to Disney.\n\nWe also announced today that Dana Walden will assume the role of President and Chief Creative Officer of The Walt Disney Company, also effective at the Annual Meeting. Dana is one of the most accomplished creative leaders in entertainment and has done an outstanding job as Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment since its formation in 2023. In this new role, she will report to Josh and work with him in ensuring that storytelling and creative expression across every audience touchpoint consistently reflect the brand, engage audiences at scale, and advance core business objectives — while driving enterprise-wide initiatives and translating vision into action.\n\nOver the past century since Walt and Roy founded this company, Disney has had a remarkable and storied history, built on creativity, imagination, and a unique ability to touch people's lives around the world. As we look to the future, we are lucky to have someone like Josh ready to guide this global company forward as CEO. We are also fortunate to have a deeply experienced management team in place, including Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, and the Disney executive officers. Their experience, judgment, and continuity will be an important asset to Josh as he begins this next chapter in Disney's history.\n\nAnd finally, after two years on the Disney Board, I can attest that this company's greatest strength is its people — the employees and Cast Members whose creativity, talent, and dedication bring the magic of Disney to life every day. On behalf of the Board and myself, I want to thank you for all you do as we prepare for this company's exciting next chapter. We are deeply honored to serve as your Directors.",

    "description": "Disney parks veteran Josh D'Amaro will soon take the torch from CEO Bob Iger. Get to know D'Amaro, who's been at Disney since 1998.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Josh D'Amaro is Disney's new top dog — or, in this case, mouse.\n\nD'Amaro, who oversees Disney's parks as its experiences chairman, was just chosen to succeed Bob Iger as CEO. Iger is set to step down on March 18, paving the way for D'Amaro to take over.\n\nD'Amaro is an \"exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,\" Iger said in a statement. Disney's board voted unanimously for his promotion on Monday, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe incoming CEO has big shoes to fill, and much to learn about Disney's business beyond its parks, cruises, and products. D'Amaro will be tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nHere's what Disney fans, employees, and investors need to know about D'Amaro as he becomes CEO.\n\nD'Amaro, a Massachusetts native, shares a birthday with Iger, who is exactly 20 years older. He'll be 55 years old on February 10, as his eventual predecessor turns 75. The two also appear to have a similar fashion sense. Both D'Amaro and Iger regularly don sweaters over collared shirts, and have a penchant for jackets paired with white shirts.\n\nFrom childhood, D'Amaro was a Disney fan. He told the Orlando Business Journal in 2020 that his must-do Disney World ride is \"Peter Pan's Flight,\" which he said he and his siblings rode as kids — an experience he said he tries to recreate \"whenever I'm here.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be CEO studied business administration at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He had transferred in from New York's Skidmore College, where he studied art and sculpting but had doubts about how he'd make a living, The New York Times reported.\n\nAfter graduating in 1993, D'Amaro worked at Boston-based Gillette for a few years.\n\nD'Amaro began his Disney journey in 1998, working at Disneyland as a business planner. Twenty years later, he became president of Disneyland, before moving from Anaheim to Orlando a year later to take the same position at Disney World.\n\nBefore that role, D'Amaro had worked on the park's business development, marketing strategy, and sales teams. D'Amaro also had roles at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland — a valuable experience, given how crucial China is to Disney's business.\n\nOutside the parks, D'Amaro had also worked in Disney's consumer products businesses as a VP of global licensing.\n\nAfter more than two decades at Disney, D'Amaro was promoted to Disney Experiences chairman to oversee parks, cruises, and consumer products in early 2020 — at the most difficult time possible amid a pandemic.\n\nD'Amaro filled a role left by then-CEO Bob Chapek, who was eventually pushed out and replaced by Iger, who had retired.\n\nUnder his tenure, Disney has continued to expand its parks business, including announcing its plans to launch a seventh park, located in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"For every one theme park visitor that we have in our existing experiences today, we believe there are 10 more out there that want to come and participate in the Disney experience,\" D'Amaro said in May at MoffettNathanson's media conference.\n\nUnder D'Amaro, an experiences business that slowed to a standstill during the pandemic roared back to life as Disney fans raced back to the parks after years of being cooped up at home.\n\nAs demand for Disney parks surged, so did prices. Park ticket costs have risen in each of the past four years, and profits, revenue, and visits have climbed as well.\n\nWhile Disney has received some criticism from fans for making its parks less affordable for middle-class families — with a slew of upcharges for fast-pass Lightning Lanes and costly food — those complaints don't appear to be hurting the company's bottom line.\n\nDisney's experiences segment just topped $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while its $3.3 billion in operating income made up more than 70% of the company's profit.\n\nAs CEO, D'Amaro must gain Wall Street's favor by pulling off similar feats in Disney's streaming, TV, and movie businesses. Disney's stock has fallen around 9% over the past year, and it's shed about 43% of its value from five years ago.\n\nAlthough another Iger unretirement and takeover is almost inconceivable, the longtime Disney leader has made clear that he's left the company on the right track, putting pressure on his successor.\n\nBoth the experiences and entertainment businesses \"have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on,\" Iger said on Disney's earnings call on Monday.\n\nIger also made it clear that his successor must be bold and make their own mark on Disney.\n\n\"When I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"",

    "description": "Longtime fund manager George Noble said the Fed under Kevin Warsh will keep fueling the forces that have boosted gold in the last year.",
    "fullText": "The metal market's tantrum in the aftermath of Donald Trump's nomination of a new Fed chief was wrongheaded, one longtime investor says.\n\nThat's because, according to veteran fund manager George Noble, Kevin Warsh is a dove who will keep adding fuel to the debasement trade, rather than the hawk markets have perceived him to be.\n\nNoble, the former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund and founder of two hedge funds, said in a post on X that Warsh has expressed a desire to lower rates, continuing a trend that's boosted haven assets like gold and silver over the last year.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty and waning investor confidence in risk assets spurred gold and silver to historic highs in 2025. Warsh's nomination spurred a reassessment of the debasement trade, but Noble doesn't see any reversal coming, pointing to a recent Fox News interview in which Warsh hinted at his dovish stance.\n\n\"The 'hawk' wants to slash rates by 200 basis points into a 'booming' economy,\" Noble wrote. \"That's not hawkish. That's pouring gasoline on a bonfire.\"\n\nIn Noble's view, the narrative that kicked off the precious metals plunge—that higher rates will boost the dollar and hurt the appeal of gold—collapses when you examine Warsh's history and statements from a macro perspective.\n\n\"The debasement trade isn't about who chairs the Fed, \"Noble said. \"It's about math. And if Warsh actually executes the plan he outlined on Fox News - slashing rates to 2% - gold at $4,500 is going to look like the bargain of the century.\"\n\nNoble doesn't think investors should rush to buy the dip in gold right now, given the extreme volatility. He speculated that gold and silver could still have further to fall and that investors should tread carefully.\n\n\"Let the market tell you where the bottom is. Then buy,\" he said.\n\"And when you do - favor the equities over the metals. The miners have lagged badly and offer better risk/reward from here.\"",

Fulham staged a fightback to equalise late on, but Sesko’s stoppage-time strike secured another three points for Carrick’s in-form team.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports at full-time, match-winner Sesko heaped praise on Casemiro’s role in the squad.\n\n“He is an unbelievable player, a legend.

I’m saying they’re not good at basketball, so focus on hoops,” Brooks said.\n\nThe remark was a clear shot at Green, whose podcast has become one of the most visible player-led platforms in the NBA.\n\nRather than focusing on specific games or moments, Brooks framed his criticism around commitment and performance.\n\nThe tension between Brooks and Green stretches back several seasons.\n\nIt became most visible during the 2022 NBA playoffs, when Brooks’ Memphis Grizzlies faced Green’s Golden State Warriors in a heated second-round series.\n\nThat matchup featured repeated verbal exchanges, physical play, and Brooks’ now-infamous “poke the bear” comments directed at the defending champions.\n\nGreen, a key part of four Warriors championship teams, responded at the time by questioning Brooks’ impact and playoff credentials.\n\nSince then, the two have traded indirect jabs through interviews and media appearances, even after Brooks moved on from Memphis.\n\nBrooks’ latest comments suggest that while the teams have changed, the personal edge has not. For both players, the back-and-forth has become part of a public rivalry that now extends beyond the court.\n\nHow a kid reminded Jordan Poole of getting punched by Draymond Green\n\nWhat is Jonathan Kuminga doing ‘too much’ amid trade interest from LA Lakers, reveals Draymond Green\n\n10 NBA players with most swearing fines, Draymond Green is only 8th",

    "fullText": "Every time the crypto market enters a dramatic phase, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is one of the first investors I turn to in order to understand the changing dynamics on the charts.\n\nWood is a veteran investor in the digital assets market. In fact, she claimed that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to gain Bitcoin (BTC) exposure in 2015.\n\nBitcoin hadn't reached even the $500 price mark in 2015, but it was a significant uptick since its launch in 2009. But Wood's pro-crypto move was met with sharp criticism.\n\nHowever, the confidence seems to have paid off over the years as Bitcoin kept hitting new highs. ARK Invest estimates the cryptocurrency's price will hit $1 million in 2030.\n\nWood also keeps buying shares of crypto companies such as:\n\nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.\n\nRobinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), an e-trading platform with crypto and tokenized stock offerings\n\nBlock (NYSE: SQ), Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin technology company\n\nBitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum (ETH) treasury company\n\nBullish (NYSE: BLSH), the crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel\n\nGiven Wood's deep expertise in crypto investments, it is worth understanding her perspective in the wake of Bitcoin's crash below $80,000 on Jan. 31.\n\nLorenzo Valente, ARK Invest's Director of Research, Digital Assets, recently shared an analysis in which he compared gold's market cap as a percentage of the U.S. M2 money supply.\n\nM2 is a broad measure of the U.S. money supply (cash, checking, savings, money market funds).\n\nAs per the analysis, gold's market cap is 170% of the entire U.S. money supply right now.\n\nThe figure is an all-time high (ATH); in fact, it is as high as it was in 1934 during the Great Depression and only slightly above the figure in 1980 when inflation peaked, the chart showed.\n\nIn simple words, gold is as expensive as it can be. Such peaks usually happen during periods of economic stress and dollar regime shift and often mark turning points, Valente said. For instance, gold crashed 60% after 1980.\n\nEven right now, it feels like a \"pivot moment\" and while nobody knows what happens next, those who know can make huge gains, he added.\n\nWhen ARK Invest shared its 2026 outlook on Jan. 15, the asset manager noted that the correlation between the Bitcoin and gold prices has been very low at 0.14 since early 2020.\n\nThis is exactly what Wood reiterated in response to Valente's X post. In simple terms, Bitcoin and gold usually don't move together on a daily or monthly basis.",

    "description": "Job seekers can stand out by contacting employers before roles are posted, a veteran career coach told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "The best way to beat the line for a job is to show up before there is one.\n\nTalking with an employer before the company ever posts a job — not after — could help you land a role there, veteran career coach Laura Labovich told Business Insider.\n\nShe recommends that job seekers identify where they want to work, examine their network for any ties to the organization, and start building relationships inside well before a job post even goes up.\n\n\"The way to win is to not apply. Get in before they have the opening. Make connections. Become an insider,\" Labovich said.\n\nIf you wait until you see a job post before contacting an employer, she said, you might already be too late. That's because once a role is posted, recruiters or HR will often feel compelled to tell you to apply online — even if they already know you — in order to ensure all candidates get equal consideration, Labovich said.\n\nGetting in line with everybody else can make the process seem \"more like a cattle call,\" she said.\n\nAside from generally feeling lousy, the take-a-number approach is also rarely the best path to landing a role, as almost anyone seeking a desk job can attest.\n\nThe average corporate job posting draws 250 applicants, Glassdoor reported in 2025. Among those, only four to six candidates typically advance to the interview round. And, of course, only one person ultimately gets the offer letter.\n\nHaving someone who can show your résumé to a recruiter or hiring manager and help you stand out is \"worth its weight in gold\" when there are so many people looking for jobs, said Rick Wargo, managing partner of the global technology practice at the recruitment firm Boyden.\n\n\"A warm introduction is always the best way to go about a job search,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nOf course, if you don't know about a forthcoming job, you can't make a pitch for it. Yet that doesn't mean you're powerless. What you can do is consider whether the employer has hired for the kinds of roles you might want — and use that insight to guide early outreach.\n\nThat's why, Wargo said, it's smart to start networking and making connections inside key companies long before you need a job.\n\n\"You don't go to fix the roof when it's raining,\" he said.\n\nTo beat the rush that often occurs when an employer lists an opening, you can contact people who might be at your level within an organization and ask questions such as, \"How do you like your job?\" \"How do you like the organization?\" and \"How did you get to where you did?\" said Labovich, who runs Career Strategy Group, an outplacement firm in the Washington, DC, area.\n\nIf it's someone higher up the food chain — potentially someone who might be the hiring manager for a future job — the ask should be smaller, she said.\n\n\"You don't want to say, 'I want a job,' because if you're getting to them early, there's no job yet,\" Labovich said. Instead, she recommends that job seekers seek advice, insight, recommendations, and referrals.\n\nThat contact can pay off: Messaging a hiring manager nearly triples your chance of getting hired, LinkedIn reports.\n\nUltimately, Labovich said, making connections inside an organization is one of the best ways to navigate a hiring process that often feels \"totally broken.\"\n\nThat's left many job seekers applying to as many roles as they can, even though many career coaches, including Labovich, urge that people prioritize networking instead.\n\n\"The way to apply for a job these days is to not apply for a job,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

Here's what changed, what it requires, and how to know if it's right for you.\n\nI've been running Vets Who Code since 2014. We've trained 300+ veterans. Graduates have collectively earned over $20 million at companies like Microsoft, Google, and Home Depot.\n\nAI didn't just add a new skill to learn—it rewrote the rules. Companies aren't hiring the same way they were two years ago. The engineers getting hired now are the ones who can build AI-enabled systems, not just consume them.\n\nThe structure is closer to joining an engineering team than attending a class.\n\nThe curriculum covers 128 skills across four phases, each validated against current job postings:\n\nPhase 1: Foundations\nTerminal mastery. VS Code configuration. Git and GitHub workflows. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python fundamentals. We don't allow AI tools here—the goal is building fluency you can rely on under pressure. You'll work through code challenges at an intermediate level before advancing.\n\nPhase 2: Software Engineering\nTypeScript. Next.js 14+ with App Router. Testing with Jest and Playwright. CI/CD with GitHub Actions. Vercel deployment. You'll ship real features to real users on the Vets Who Code platform.\n\nPhase 3: AI Engineering\nFastAPI with Pydantic v2. Google Gemini integration—text, multimodal, function calling. Professional prompt engineering. RAG systems with pgvector. AI agents with LangChain and LangGraph. Full-stack AI applications with streaming interfaces.\n\nPhase 4: Production Mastery\nTesting AI systems. LLMOps with LangSmith. Docker containerization. Google Cloud Run deployment. Load testing with K6. Ethics, safety, and governance.\n\nThat's 20-24 hours per week for 17 weeks.\n\nThe program is designed around people who have jobs, families, and responsibilities. But it does require consistent time and focus. The veterans who do well treat it as a serious commitment alongside the rest of their lives.\n\nThis program works best for people who:\n\nIf you're still exploring whether coding is for you, that's fine—but this isn't the right starting point. The pace is fast, and the cohort moves together. The pre-work exists so everyone starts ready.\n\nYou'll need a computer no more than two years old and reliable internet. The program is free—Vets Who Code is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\n\nI built this program because I wished it existed when I was making the transition myself.\n\nI learned to code while balancing military life, family, and the reality of starting over. That's why this program is:\n\nWhen you interview after this program, you won't show tutorials. You'll show commits to a live codebase with real users.\n\nApplications close February 14, 2026.\n\nStart the pre-work now: github.com/Vets-Who-Code/Prework\n\nIf you have questions, reach out.

    "fullText": "Charles Barkley isn’t holding back his disappointment over Michael Jordan’s NBC appearances this season. Fans had eagerly awaited the NBA legend’s insights on modern basketball as the network returned to airing games in 2025-26, but what aired left many underwhelmed.\n\nBarkley, speaking candidly, called the arrangement “disingenuous” and criticized NBC, claiming the rollout didn’t live up to the hype surrounding the six-time NBA Finals champion.\n\nCharles Barkley, whose relationship with Michael Jordan has cooled over the years, expressed frustration on SiriusXM NBA Radio. “I was excited to have Michael because Michael Jordan is the reason we all make this money from the NBA,” he said. He added, “But now you see this thing coming out with NBC… one interview five months ago, and you’re all gonna sprinkle it throughout the season? Come on, man. That’s disingenuous by NBC. That’s crazy.”\n\nBarkley didn’t mince words about how the network handled the coverage. “It’s a bad look for NBC, it’s just a bad look, plain and simple. They couldn’t fly to Michael like once a month and do a new interview? That makes NBC look really bad,” he added, emphasizing his disappointment in the setup. ( via Awful Announcing)\n\nMichael Jordan’s appearance was restricted to a single pre-recorded segment, MJ: Insights to Excellence, which ran across a few shows. While it offered some interesting takes, a lot of fans were hoping for deeper commentary on the state of today’s game. Host Mike Tirico defended the setup, saying Jordan “really wanted to talk about where he sees the game right now,” adding that viewers still got to hear his perspective, even if it wasn’t as in-depth as expected.\n\nTirico noted that Jordan’s love for basketball really shone through. He loves the game, and in some ways, he’s not a fan of where it’s headed, and he wanted to share that, Tirico said. Tirico also acknowledged that while the segment might not have satisfied every fan craving MJ insight, it was still special to hear from the legend himself. Tirico also hinted that future appearances could give fans even more of the coverage they’re hoping for.\n\nThe post NBA Veteran Targets Michael Jordan & NBC Deal: ‘It’s Bad’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

However, we went on to say that,\n\nKuo boils Apple’s thinking down to three key moves.\n\nAbsorb the pain now: Memory prices are rising at an incredible pace, and Apple is opting for margin pressure instead of consumer backlash.\n\nLockdown supply: Apple’s scale enables it to effectively secure components that others can’t, even as the shortages grow worse.\n\nPlay the long game: Any near-term margin hit will be viewed as temporary, with services revenue likely to backfill over time.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant risk that these pressures aren’t contained, as Kuo notes that iPhone memory prices are still being renegotiated quarterly rather than on a semiannual basis.",

Minutes later, he delivered again, hauling in a dramatic, corkscrew-style catch before lunging forward to convert a crucial first down and keep the clock moving. The Seahawks effectively iced the game when Kupp drew a defensive holding penalty downfield on former teammate Cobie Durant, extending the final drive and preventing Los Angeles from getting the ball back.\n\nThe significance of the moment was evident afterward.

    "description": "A \"brick wall\" moment changed his career. He wants younger generations to get that chance, too.",
    "fullText": "Three years out of law school, in 1990, David Goldschmidt landed the kind of assignment most young corporate lawyers only dream of: taking a company public.\n\nWhen a senior partner at the venerated New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom told him to \"run with\" biotech company Regeneron's IPO, his career changed.\n\nGoldschmidt sweated his way through writing the prospectus, translating the company's scientific ambitions into plain language for investors. Regeneron raised twice the expected amount in the initial offering.\n\nThe victory was volatile. The stock swung sharply after the IPO, prompting shareholder lawsuits. A federal judge dismissed the cases against Regeneron, finding the company's disclosures to be accurate and legally sufficient. And for Goldschmidt, the trial by fire taught him something.\n\n\"I could do this,\" he remembers thinking.\n\nGoldschmidt rose through the ranks to become a partner and, eventually, the global head of Skadden's capital markets practice, advising companies on raising capital in the public or private markets. His name appeared routinely on the opening pages of S-1 filings, including those of Casper, Match Group, and Rivian Automotive, whose $12 billion raise was one of the largest US IPOs in history. In 2025 alone, the hundred-person Skadden group handled more than $300 billion worth of transactions.\n\nGoldschmidt retired last month after 37 years at Skadden, ending a tenure that made him a rare constant in an industry increasingly defined by churn.\n\nWhile he stayed put, the ground beneath him did not. From his perch at Skadden, the fourth-highest-grossing law firm in the country, Goldschmidt worked through a technological revolution that shifted the legal industry from analog to algorithmic.\n\nHe's not convinced smarter machines make for better lawyers.\n\nI met Goldschmidt two weeks before he retired, in a conference room high above Manhattan's West Side. The 62-year-old looked relaxed in a tailored navy suit. He asked for a coffee, and within minutes, a pair of staffers set up a full barista station on the credenza. We each poured, and I asked him when he decided he wanted to be a lawyer.\n\n\"Five years into practicing,\" he said.\n\nGoldschmidt went to law school unsure about what kind of law he wanted to practice, driven only by a curiosity about \"how the markets work,\" he said. At first, he purposely avoided Big Law, starting at the smaller, white-shoe firm Breed, Abbott & Morgan. On his first day at the New York office, a woman in HR led him on a meet-and-greet with the partners. With each knock on a partner's door, the mood darkened.\n\nAt one office, the woman began her script. \"How are you doing today? This is Mr. Goldschmidt. He's starting today —\"\n\n\"How do you think I'm doing?\" the partner cut in. \"The market's down 22%.\"\n\nIt was October 19, 1987, Black Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 500 points, wiping out roughly half a trillion dollars in market value.\n\nThe crash was violent but brief, and soon leveraged buyouts and mergers exploded. For law firms working those deals, the frenzy translated into enormous amounts of work. Goldschmidt realized that the \"genteel\" lifestyle he had sought was an illusion.\n\n\"Regardless of what size law firm you work at, you're going to work hard,\" he said. Within his first year, he left to join Skadden's capital markets practice, securing a front-row seat to the global economy that he would occupy for the next 37 years. He fell in love with the fervor of the environment and the people hustling beside him.\n\nThe intensity of the work hasn't changed. The work itself has.\n\nWhen he started, his desk held a LexisNexis terminal, an angular box with a built-in keyboard used for case law research; he used it as a surface for Post-it notes. He wrote documents longhand on a legal pad, handing them off to a typing pool staffed by, as Goldschmidt recalls, \"aspiring actors.\"\n\nEditing a document meant two associates sitting side by side with the new and old versions, reading the first word of every line aloud to mark where the draft had changed. He dashed to meet the mail courier at 9 p.m. to make sure clients had the documents in the morning.\n\nGoldschmidt saw this as valuable repetition, learning through what he calls \"sweat equity.\" He didn't study judgment; he accumulated it. Even as Microsoft Word replaced typing pools and due diligence moved online, much of the mental work of synthesizing information remained.\n\nThose reps became part of Goldschmidt's value to clients, said Jeffrey Horowitz, a longtime Bank of America executive who worked with him across multiple transactions. \"You're getting long-term advice — grounded in history and a real relationship,\" he said.\n\nRegeneron remains a Skadden client, now a roughly $77 billion biotech. Its cofounder and CEO, Dr. Leonard Schleifer, remembers Goldschmidt as a \"workhorse,\" citing his attention to detail and command of the law.\n\nNow, with the legal industry on the cusp of another shift, artificial intelligence is beginning to absorb some of the routine work that once consumed junior lawyers' time. Goldman Sachs has said the technology could someday automate 44% of legal work.\n\nGoldschmidt's own introduction to the technology came from his son, then a Big Law associate. He gave him a demo of a legal software called Harvey, which could draft and find answers in documents that might take an associate hours of slogging. \"It just blew me away,\" Goldschmidt said.\n\nThat efficiency raised a fundamental question. How do you train young lawyers when machines do the work for them?\n\nFor Goldschmidt, the value of sweat equity isn't just hard work. It's the intellectual struggle of problem-solving. Learning, he said, happens when you \"hit a brick wall and veer off\" to find another path. If new tools surface answers instantly, he worries, junior lawyers may lose not only the habit of wrestling a question to its conclusion, but the legal fundamentals needed to recognize when a chatbot is hallucinating or getting it wrong.\n\nStill, Goldschmidt is careful not to romanticize the past. \"It may be easier,\" he said. But law, he argues, has never been a profession where fulfillment comes from sitting at a desk and simply executing tasks.\n\n\"A fulfilling career,\" he said, \"is going out there, stretching, meeting people, learning — seeing what's around the bend.\"\n\nInside Skadden, Goldschmidt said, there's a saying: Walk through walls for the client.\n\nThat ethos only intensified as new tools arrived. Legal work, after all, is a service business. Email and cellphones reset expectations for speed and responsiveness. Now, clients are pushing law firms to adopt artificial intelligence in the name of more efficient service. Skadden pays for its lawyers to have access to Harvey and other tools used for research, drafting, and document review.\n\nFor Goldschmidt, even the early technology was a \"double-edged sword.\" A BlackBerry meant he could finally go to a movie on a Saturday night without worrying he might miss a call. But it also meant there was no longer any real off-switch. The culture didn't always allow lawyers to check out.\n\nGoldschmidt remembers around that time reading an article about email that described how Bill Gates would sit down at his computer at night and respond to his messages in one sitting. \"How lucky is that guy,\" Goldschmidt remembers thinking, \"that he can wait till the end of the day?\"\n\nAs Goldschmidt prepared to retire on New Year's Eve, he remained optimistic about the next generation of lawyers, provided they remember that the job requires more than just prompting chatbots. Looking back on the shift from legal pads to large language models, he offers a final assessment of his four decades in the arena — not as a protagonist, but as an essential witness.\n\n\"I may not have invented anything,\" Goldschmidt said. \"I may not have started a company that changed anything. But I had a front-row seat to all those people, those companies, who did.\"\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent with Business Insider, covering the intersection of law and technology.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Fitness and United States Marine Corps. veteran. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's interesting about my day is that it's never really routine.\n\nIt's highly dependent on where I'm working from, so if I'm in my main office in Manhattan, the day is quite different than if I'm at home in Lake Tahoe. It's fulfilling to not have the same routine over and over again.\n\nI've been doing this for 34 years, so monotony is a killer for me.\n\nWhere my job gets fun is if I'm on the road, I'm in gyms. My team and get to go to our more than 500 gyms, and I love meeting the members.\n\nLately, we've been spending a lot of time on understanding where AI is going to integrate perfectly with the member experience and the team member experience. We're testing some ideas out in the field.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm in a rut from a strategy standpoint, creatively, I go to the gyms. I think all the answers are in the gyms. So I talk to my teams about what's working, what's not.\n\nPeople think I'm kind of a hard guy, but I think I'm pretty relaxed, especially on the road. There are just a few non-negotiables I have in my regular cadence to stay on track.\n\nTypically, I get up at 5:45 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., depending on the day. My morning is like an old grandpa's. I watch the business news, see how the markets are trending. I usually have my one cup of coffee for the day.\n\nRight now, my morning is special — I had a granddaughter born last June, so she's up really early, my daughter's up really early, so I usually get to chat with them via text or FaceTime before everything has started. Once that's done, I start my emails. The majority of my day is set up around Zoom rodeos, performance updates, executive leadership team meetings, or huddles.\n\nThis may be funny, but when I'm on the road, I need to have a desk or a sitting area so I have space to think and stretch my legs. I can't just be checking emails from bed.\n\nI also need to get a protein shake in the morning, especially when I'm on the road. I'm not going to sit down and have a hotel breakfast or stop anywhere.\n\nI believe fitness is medicine. I'm 58 now, and I'm chasing being happy, healthy, and mobile in my eighties and nineties, so it's really about staying active, keeping moving.\n\nWhen I was in the Marine Corps., I worked out in the morning. Prior to 2020, I worked out at the end of my day.\n\nI'm finding that the midday routine is best for me now, to block out some time.\n\nAt lunchtime, around 1 p.m., I break for exercise. So about 12:45, I wind down my meetings, and I'm either headed to Pilates or the gym.\n\nI can walk to our gym, which is great. It's about a 20-minute walk there and back, so you get 40 minutes of cardio with your weightlifting.\n\nI don't lift for ego anymore. I rarely bench. I used to bench press all the time, and I was very proud of what I could bench press. Now, I don't bench press at all because it's so hard on my shoulders. I do a lot more dumbbell workouts now, a lot more machine lifting.\n\nHaving lifted weights since I was 14, I felt like Pilates was an opportunity for me to try to lengthen, strengthen, and activate some of the smaller muscles.\n\nIt changed my life, to be honest with you. I became much more limber, a lot less tight. At first, I was the only man in the Pilates class, but I've been telling my neighbors and building a little army of Pilates guys.\n\nI've done both yoga and Pilates, and prefer Pilates because there is a little bit of strength with mobility and balance.\n\nAfter the gym, I'll have lunch, and then I'm back at the office for more calls, meetings, and so forth. It's problem-solving, it's answering questions, and then I wrap up my day.\n\nI like to get out of here by 5:30 p.m. to get a walk in, especially this time of year, because it's cold and it's just refreshing.\n\nWe eat dinner around 6:30 or 7 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I aren't big on sitcom television, but we do like series. She likes anything out of England, the BBC. I'm more into military history, US history, or westerns. We settled in the middle with dramatic crime whodunnit type of series.\n\nI do have a passion for \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race.\" People laugh at me, but I just love competition.\n\nThen I read a little bit, and I'm in bed usually by 11.",

The 24-year-old tight end rejoins the Steelers after a stint with the team during training camp and on the practice squad this past season.\n\nWe have signed TE J.J. Galbreath to a Reserve/Future contract. @BordasLaw\n\n— Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) January 23, 2026\n\nGalbreath originally joined the Steelers as an undrafted free agent out of South Dakota after the 2025 Draft. The six-foot-four pass catcher shone for the Coyotes, amassing 1355 yards and 13 touchdowns during his college career. Galbreath earned first-team AP All-American honors his senior season. However, he was cut during the team’s final roster cuts in August. Galbreath briefly rejoined the team on the practice squad, but was cut after week two and has been a free agent ever since.\n\nHe appeared in three preseason games for the Steelers this past season, but only collected three catches for 23 yards during his time on the field. This reserve/future deal will now give Galbreath a better chance to impress the new coaching staff during offseason workouts and in training camp in Latrobe.\n\nWith fellow tight end Connor Heyward set to become a free agent, Galbreath will now have another shot to potentially crack the 53-man roster this season for the Steelers.",

He has not given up on a fight he has been waiting years to make happen. But while he waits, there could be another opportunity taking shape over in the wrestling world.\n\nChandler has not fought since his loss to Paddy Pimblett in April 2024, but he recently stepped back into combat sports by returning to his wrestling background.\n\nThe 39-year-old made his debut with Real American Freestyle earlier this month, picking up a win over Chad Mendes at the promotion’s fifth event.\n\nHe seems intent on staying active under the RAF banner, and a new opportunity has already come up. UFC lightweight contender Arman Tsarukyan has called him out for a match.\n\nSpeaking on The Ariel Helwani Show, he said: “I saw somebody comment the other day, ‘Man, Arman’s done a really good job of staying relevant during this time.’ I get it. He talks about everybody. He’s saying my name.\n\n“One thing I will say about Arman, the dude has stayed busy with these grappling matches. I watched him wrestle live at RAF; he did a great job there.\n\n“I think I am interested (in facing Tsarukyan). My plan A, the one thing I’m focused on, is fighting at the White House.\n\n“His future is somewhat up in the air. Mine’s up in the air as well, but less up in the air than his is.\n\n“Who knows. But yeah, I’ll wrestle against him.”\n\nTsarukyan’s next wrestling match may not be against Chandler.\n\nTalks are reportedly underway for a potential bout with Dustin Poirier, which would take place under the Hype FC banner.\n\nNo further details have emerged since Hype FC CEO Armand Martirosian first mentioned the discussions in an interview on Jason Takhtadjian’s YouTube channel.\n\nPoirier and Chandler have their own history, having faced off at Madison Square Garden back in late 2022. ‘The Diamond’ came out on top that night at UFC 281 and later accused Chandler of fish-hooking during the bout",

    "description": "Hedge fund founder George Noble says OpenAI is a warning for the wider AI boom. He says the \"low hanging fruit is gone\" as AI costs increase.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI has laid out some ambitious plans for 2026, but according to George Noble, the ChatGPT maker is a cautionary tale for the wider AI theme.\n\nThe hedge fund investor and former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund doesn't think the AI startup will be able to justify its lofty growth projections, but more than that, he thinks investors should avoid the AI trade and shift their focus to other areas of the market before the tide turns.\n\nThe hedge fund founder laid out his thesis on OpenAI's red flags in a detailed X post on Tuesday, highlighting the \"code red\" moment announced by CEO Sam Altman in December 2025.\n\nIn his view, it all comes down to financials, specifically a math problem that isn't being widely discussed. \n\n\"It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better,\" he said. \"The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.\"\n\nNoble thinks OpenAI's annual revenue has to reach $200 billion by 2030 in order for the company's projections to be justified.\n\nPointing to the broader market, he advised AI startup founders to exit their companies while the boom is still going, adding that he believes the AI hype cycle is nearing its peak. He thinks investors should shift their focus to other parts of the market, as both the AI trade and the Magnificent Seven will be impacted if OpenAI begins to struggle.\n\n\"If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming,\" he advised. \"The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.\"\n\nThe particular sector in this case is small-mid cap stocks, which is where Noble sees real value and growth potential. He added that there is a value disconnect between Big Tech stocks and their small-cap peers, which are trading at near-decade lows.\n\nFor that reason, Noble sees an opportunity for investors to move away from the most crowded stocks that carried the AI trade in 2025 and focus on the lesser-known value plays that have been quietly making progress while AI-linked names continue to dominate the headlines.\n\n\"Markets can price risk,\" he noted. \"But they can't price chaos.\nAnd OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.\"",

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Jeremy Grantham says AI is one of the biggest bubbles in history — and it's likely to tank the stock market when it bursts.\n\n\"I think it's obviously a bubble, and I think it's quite a simple story,\" the veteran investor and GMO cofounder said during the latest episode of the \"Merryn Talks Money\" podcast.\n\nGrantham compared AI to the railroad and the internet, two world-changing inventions marked by early investment bubbles which, when they popped, \"brought the economy to its knees for a year or two\" and \"everybody lost their money.\"\n\nContrary to common belief, \"bubbles don't occur when there's some crummy idea that gets touted,\" Grantham said. \"All the bubbles are associated with serious things, and the more serious, the bigger the bubble.\"\n\nGrantham emphasized the \"iron law\" that when an asset doubles in price, the return from holding it halves from that point forward.\n\n\"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward,\" he said. \"And it will happen this time. And my guess is after a while, sooner or later, the market will become a whole lot cheaper.\"\n\nGrantham, who had predicted an epic market crash four years ago, said the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2023 generated immense buzz around AI and sparked major capital outlays by companies, ultimately staving off an economic slump.\n\nThe market historian said that Big Tech companies have used their dominant market positions and influence to boost their profit margins to \"excessive levels,\" but that won't stop the bubble he sees from bursting.\n\nThe \"probabilities that AI will not bust are slim to none,\" he said. \"It meets every condition of the railroads and the Internet. It's a powerful idea that's attracted everybody's money.\"\n\n\"And so my guess is Nvidia will lead it down, and all the others will follow for a while, and then out of the ashes several of them will once again inherit the world,\" he said.\n\nGrantham also flagged institutional inertia and herd mentality as factors preventing the market from coming to its senses.\n\nPut differently, industry professionals aren't sounding the alarm on valuations out of fear that the bubble will keep growing and they'll underperform their rivals, hurt their reputations, and lose clients or even their jobs.\n\n\"They all look around nervously at each other, but they keep going,\" he said. \"As long as the music's playing, they're going to be dancing. Doesn't matter that they know the market is silly.\"\n\nGrantham is one of several high-profile investors, including Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame, who have warned AI stocks are overvalued and predicted a market downturn is coming.\n\nYet the US stock market has continued to march higher in spite of the skeptics, with the benchmark S&P 500 rising around 80% over the past five years.\n\n\"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed comparisons between the AI boom and dot-com bubble in interviews with Business Insider last fall.\n\nO'Leary said \"you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis,\" while Gerber said today's valuations are warranted as AI companies have enormous growth potential and their profitability is \"just insane.\"",

    "fullText": "Matthew Stafford has spent most of the 2025 season making quarterback play look effortless, but Sunday’s divisional playoff game against the Chicago Bears was a rare quiet afternoon by his standards. The veteran passer failed to throw a touchdown for the first time all year, completing just 20 of 42 attempts for 258 yards in the Rams’ gritty 20–17 overtime victory.\n\nEven in a win that sent Los Angeles to the NFC Championship, Stafford was his own harshest critic. Despite the celebration around him, Stafford didn’t hide from his uneven performance. Speaking after the game, he admitted he never found his usual rhythm.\n\n“No, I definitely didn’t get into a great rhythm today, there’s no question about that,” Stafford said post-game. “Had some opportunities in the pass game, just some things that made it tough. Obviously, I can be better.”\n\nThe Bears’ remarkable season came to a heartbreaking end at SoFi Stadium. Chicago had captured the NFC North, knocked off the Packers in the wild-card round, and taken organizational steps that hadn’t been seen in decades. They nearly added another chapter to that story, rallying in the final minute when Caleb Williams found Cole Kmet on a stunning fourth-down strike to tie the game with 17 seconds left.\n\nOvertime, however, belonged to the Rams. Williams threw a costly interception on a potential game-winning drive, and Los Angeles methodically moved into range for Harrison Mevis, who drilled a 42-yard field goal to seal the victory. The Rams now advance to face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, while Chicago is left watching two teams sitting exactly where it hopes to be next season. So, despite the sub-par stat line, Stafford isn’t all that regretful.\n\n“But playoff football is about winning the football game. I played great, threw for a bunch of yards last year in the snow and we lost, and that sucks. I’m happy to have played a little bit worse today and go home with a win. We’ll take that.”\n\nHis stat line backed up the self-assessment: a 47.6 percent completion rate, no touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 67.4 passer rating. It was far from the form that had defined his regular season.\n\nOne off night doesn’t erase what has been a historic campaign. It wouldn’t be a stretch to call this the best season of Stafford’s 17-year career. The 37-year-old averaged 276.9 passing yards per game and eclipsed 4,600 yards for the fifth time, highlighted by a 457-yard explosion against Seattle in Week 16.\n\nHe finished the regular season with more than 45 touchdown passes, leading the league by a wide margin —Jared Goff’s 34 was the next closest total — while throwing just eight interceptions despite consistently pushing the ball downfield. Those numbers kept him firmly in the MVP conversation even as the Rams split their final six games.\n\nSunday’s matchup showed a different version of the Rams offense. Los Angeles leaned heavily on the pass early, asking Stafford to drop back 40 times in regulation while running just seven times in the first half. The ground game found more life after the break, but the contest remained tight thanks to Chicago’s balanced attack of 160 rushing yards on 39 attempts.\n\nIn the end, style points didn’t matter. The Rams capitalized when it counted, and Stafford, despite his first touchdown-less outing, did enough to move his team one step closer to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe post “I Can Be Better”: Matthew Stafford Gets Honest About 0-TD Game vs. Bears Despite 45+ TDs This Season appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season is the best for the Chicago Bears in quite some time, as they finished the regular season 11-6, winning the NFC North, and have the chance to reach the NFC championship game if they can defeat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night.\n\nMany people have stated the reasons they believe the Bears have had a franchise-altering season, such as the hiring of head coach Ben Johnson and the rise of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams. Both have, without a doubt, had a significant positive impact on the team.\n\nHowever, Johnson gave an unlikely reason for the team's success this season: a player who has been in the league for a long time.\n\nMore: Bears' Colston Loveland is 2nd in NFL history with crazy stats, joining Gronk with this record\n\nVeteran backup quarterback Case Keenum received high praise from his head coach for the role he has played this season for Chicago, despite not taking any snaps with the team.\n\n\"He's been tremendous in terms of Caleb's growth. That was really the thought process of bringing him in, a guy with skins on the wall. He's played in big games himself at a high level. He's won big games. He's lost big games. His experience has really been something that all these young players can really lean into,\" Johnson said to the media on Friday.\n\nJohnson makes a great point as Keenum has seen it all in his 13 seasons in the league and has been a servicable backup for most of his years, so even though it doesn't sound ideal, it shouldn't be as surprising that this young Bears team has leaned on the veteran.\n\nKeenum's leadership will be needed for at least one game against one of his former teams, the Rams, which is set to be the team's most formidable opponent yet.\n\nCaleb Williams fires back at Packers’ super fan Lil Wayne after wild tweet\n\nChicago Bears now know who they will face in divisional round of playoffs\n\nBears, Bills, Rams set an NFL playoff record already with crazy comeback history\n\nCaleb Williams planted an image in Packers fans' heads that will haunt them all offseason\n\nCaleb Williams gets emotional paying tribute to Ben Johnson after Bears' playoff win",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Draft is expected to lack top-tier quarterbacks, which could lead to a flurry of veteran quarterbacks changing teams this offseason. One signal-caller who is expected to draw considerable attention on the trade market is Mac Jones.\n\nJones signed a two-year contract worth $8.4 million with the 49ers this offseason. With Brock Purdy established as San Francisco’s starting quarterback, the 49ers may consider trading Jones.\n\nWith the limited number of quarterbacks in free agency, Jones could potentially bring in a significant amount of draft capital. According to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, it’s likely that Jones could yield a Day 2 and a Day 3 pick in return.\n\n“I’d say a Day 2 pick, and maybe a Day 3 pick swap for Jones,” Breer wrote on Friday. “The Jets’ trade of Sam Darnold to the Panthers might be the best recent comp I could find, and New York got a 2021 sixth-round pick and ’22 second- and fourth-rounders for the quarterback. I’d guess the price would be a little less because Darnold had two years left on his rookie deal, and he was a little younger, too.”\n\nThe Patriots drafted Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft, and he enjoyed success during his rookie season, helping New England reach the playoffs. However, the next two seasons with the Patriots didn’t go as planned, leading to New England trading Jones to the Jacksonville Jaguars in March of 2024.\n\nJones bounced back this season while Purdy was sidelined with an injury. He appeared in 11 games, starting eight of them, and threw for 2,151 yards along with 13 touchdowns.\n\nThere’s a possibility that Jones could return to the AFC East next season, as both the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets are expected to be on the lookout for quarterback help.\n\nWhy TV Analyst Guaranteed Patriots Playoff Win Over Texans",

Curry, the 1994 Sixth Man of the Year, ranks second in points in franchise history and spent 10 of his 16 NBA seasons in Charlotte (1988-98). He currently serves as a team ambassador. pic.twitter.com/coSL3ntP5a\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) January 14, 2026\n\nCurry is now more widely recognized as the father of Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry. However, long before his eldest son started making waves in the NBA and rewriting records, Dell was known as one of the best long-distance shooters of his era.\n\nCharlotte was fortunate to have Dell Curry for 10 of his 16 years in the league. During his tenure with the Hornets, the team made four appearances in the Eastern Conference playoffs, advancing to the semifinals on two occasions. Curry played much of his career in a reserve or sixth-man role and earned the Sixth Man of the Year award during the 1993-94 season.\n\nThat year, Curry played all 82 games, averaging a career-high 16.3 points, along with 3.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists, while shooting 40.2% from three-point range. The season before winning the Sixth Man award, Curry finished fourth in voting, and he remained in the top five in two of the three seasons following his win. In 1994-95, he finished second behind New York Knicks power forward Anthony Mason for the Sixth Man Award.\n\nAlthough Curry played for five different teams over his career, his prime years and best on-court performance were with Charlotte. During his decade with the Hornets, he averaged 14 points, 2.9 rebounds, 2 assists, 1.1 steals, and shot 40.5% from three.\n\nIn recent years, Curry has served as an ambassador for the Hornets and spends time watching his sons, Stephen and Seth, drain threes from all over the court. Dell is also a broadcaster for the Hornets, calling games on FanDuel and Amazon Prime Video’s NBA coverage.",

    "description": "A \"nasty\" 15% sell-off could hit crowded trades this spring, says Tom Sosnoff.",
    "fullText": "The hottest AI trade on Wall Street has officially become \"boring.\"\n\n\"Nvidia would be a very boring idea ... because we all know the story,\" serial entrepreneur Tom Sosnoff told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe former founder of Thinkorswim and Tastytrade argued that despite Nvidia's technological dominance, the stock's story is too well-known and it may be priced for perfection.\n\nSosnoff isn't a tech skeptic. In fact, he's a fan of the product. He likened Nvidia's (NVDA) AI platforms to having a \"genius best friend\" with a 165 IQ available at all times.\n\nThe problem, he argued, is that Nvidia is now \"totally fully priced.\" When most analysts and retail traders are already on one side of the boat, that \"boring\" reality suggests there are very few surprise scenarios that can drive the price significantly higher from here.\n\n\"I look at Nvidia and I'm thinking to myself, how much more upside [is] in here and what kind of downside is there if this thing rolls over?\" Sosnoff said. \"It's not a function of ... Nvidia itself. It's just a function of price.\"\n\nThe warning comes at a time when market volatility is hovering at multi-year lows and stocks are sitting at record levels. In the past year, Nvidia's shares have risen roughly 40%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) recently closed at all-time highs this month.\n\nSosnoff isn't predicting a total market collapse, but he's bracing for a reality check. He anticipates a \"nasty sell-off\" in the range of 10% to 15% potentially hitting between March and May.\n\n\"The odds favor the downside in the market,\" said Sosnoff. He noted that while the equity market is partying, the bond market has remained eerily stagnant. If that volatility returns, the \"fully priced\" darlings like Nvidia are often the first to feel the gravity. Moreover, market fickleness could materialize when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nAnother provocative take is that Nvidia's reign as the world's most valuable company is under threat. When asked if the AI giant would still have its crown at the end of the year, Sosnoff was skeptical.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be Nvidia,\" he said regarding the market cap race. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has recently edged out Apple (AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world, and it's within striking distance of Nvidia as it surges past $4 trillion.",

    "title": "Former NBA veteran gives caution to Fred Warner returning from his ankle injury",
    "description": "There is a counterargument to 49ers LB Fred Warner returning for the playoffs",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have floated around the NFC Championship as a potential game for linebacker Fred Warner to return. Warner has not appeared in a game since October 12, when he dislocated his ankle in Week 6.\n\nAfter Sunday’s game, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said the chances are “Not very high” of Warner playing in the Divisional Round. The team playing on a short week could certainly influence Shanahan’s decision.\n\nWarner has different ideas. He uploaded a video of himself doing drills on Monday:\n\n.@fred_warner showing his recovery progress 👀\n\n(via @fred_warner) pic.twitter.com/X94flz0i1l\n\nOn The Ryen Russillo Show, before Wild Card weekend, Warner said:\n\n“I’m ready whenever they’re ready. There’s some T’s that gotta be crossed, I’s that gotta be dotted. Unfortunately, if it were just up to me, I’d be out there this weekend, but it’s unfortunately not that way. I’ve got to make sure I’m checking all the boxes, and everybody has to give me the okay before they let me go out there. But I’m pushing, man. I’m training hard. I’m back doing full football drills and everything, so time will tell. We gotta pull the win off first.”\n\nThis could also be a scenario where the team is protecting Warner from himself. In his mind, he was probably ready to play in Week 17. But, as he said, every box needs to be checked. While the team would love to have Warner on the field in the Divisional Round, the last thing they want to do is sacrifice the longevity of his career.\n\nFormer NBA all-star Michael Redd, who played from 2000 to 2012, shared his thoughts on the topic:\n\nLooks like a near-miraculous comeback. Near, but not totally. Here’s my OG advice no one asked for: We’ve seen this play out before. Could name countless examples, but let’s go…Brandon Roy came back in 8 days from meniscus surgery in 2010. Retired at 27 with no cartilage left. Robert Williams rushed back for the Celtics playoff series in 2022, still dealing with it, seems like. KD tore his Achilles coming back too early in 2019, back but missed ton of time. Look, injuries robbed me of the back half of my career too, so I get wanting to be out there…especially for the playoffs. But take your time. Come back 100%. You’re not the difference between winning a title or not. And if you are? You’ll be that guy next year too. Your body is your career. Have to protect it. Fans will understand and appreciate the extra good years that you/they get out of it!\n\nWarner was in the conversation for Defensive Player of the Year before sustaining an ankle injury, so there’s a strong argument that he could be the difference in winning a title or not. But that doesn’t make Redd’s point moot.\n\nWarner is under contract for four more seasons. There are no guarantees the 49ers will be back in the playoffs, but this is a team that has proven to be a consistent postseason contender. Big picture, you want Warner on the field for the duration of the decade, not the 2025 regular season.\n\nRE: Fred Warner and a potential return to #49ers. This Sunday would mark 21 days until the Super Bowl. Opening his practice window at any point from then would give maximum time possible to evaluate if he's ready to go with no real down side. \n\n(That's probably true now, too,…\n\n— Nick Wagoner (@nwagoner) January 13, 2026\n\nAs Nick Wagoner stated above, the 49ers could open Warner’s practice window this week.",

That trip ended with Sunday night's loss to the Patriots and Mack is back to contemplating his football future for the second straight year.\n\nOn Monday, Mack said that he will \"make a decision based on how I'm feeling and how my family is feeling, the vibes\" and that he isn't going to rush that call.\n\n\"You feel different in the sense of understanding how much time do you really have left to play at a certain level and what is that going to look like moving forward,\" Mack said, via the team's website. \"You don't want to make a decision based on how you feel in the present moment, especially after a tough loss. It's about taking time and taking that step back. I feel like it's the same in that sense, taking a step back and trying to really not put too much emotion behind the decision to do whatever it is I'm going to do.\"\n\nIn addition to his pass rush ability, Mack was a key part of the run defense for the Chargers and his departure would leave a big hole for the team to fill heading into next season.",

Duarte (@michaeljduarte) January 12, 2026\n\nCharly Hill, who graduated from Miami in 2024 and has interned and freelanced at Bleacher Report, TNT Sports and NBC, joined as a sports content creator.\n\nI’m not typically active on Twitter, but that’s all about to change with my new role at the California Post as a Sports Content Creator\n\nSo excited to be a part of what’s shaping up to be an incredible year for California sports! pic.twitter.com/EOieGODH0b\n\n— charly d (@charlydyannhill) January 8, 2026\n\nBolch, who has covered UCLA athletics for the Los Angeles Times for more than a decade and spent 26 years at the paper overall, becomes the latest high-profile addition for the California Post, which has aggressively targeted established Southern California journalists to anchor its coverage.\n\nHis move follows the recent exits of former Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez and Dodgers beat writer Jack Harris, who  announced last month they were joining the California Post.\n\nWith Bolch’s departure, the Los Angeles Times is now left with just nine full-time sports staff writers, a stark contraction for a paper that once boasted one of the deepest sports departments in the country.\n\nOutside of the editors, the Los Angeles Times sports staff is currently led by columnist Bill Plaschke, senior writers Bill Shaikin and Kevin Baxter, Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Broderick Turner on the Lakers, Ryan Kartje on USC, Gary Klein on the Rams, Sam Farmer on the Chargers and Eric Sondheimer on high schools.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was slated to have the second-largest contingent of sports staffers covering the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo behind NBC, which is the broadcast home of the Olympics, before the pandemic. The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have made some good moves this offseason, trading for Sonny Gray, Johan Oviedo and Willson Contreras. They’ve improved their rotation and upgraded at first base, especially defensively.\n\nWhat they haven’t done yet, however, is sign a Major League free agent two months into the offseason. After the Colorado Rockies signed veteran pitcher Michael Lorenzen to a one-year deal on Wednesday night, the Red Sox are now the only team that still hasn’t signed an MLB free agent this winter.\n\nGiven the team’s high payroll, goals and publicly expressed needs, that’s pretty shocking.\n\nIt’s not for a lack of trying. Boston made an offer to Pete Alonso before he signed with the Baltimore Orioles and has also made an “aggressive” offer to Alex Bregman. Time will tell if Bregman re-signs with the Red Sox, but there’s a good chance that he does.\n\nThe Red Sox are officially the only MLB club that has yet to sign a big-league free agent this offseason 😬 pic.twitter.com/c3ePQSL52Z\n\n— NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSBoston) January 8, 2026\n\nThose are big moves, however, and big moves don’t usually happen overnight. It’s more surprising that Boston hasn’t at least done a one-year deal for a reliever or depth player, who are much more plentiful and easier to sign.\n\nSpring Training is five weeks away, so there’s still time. Craig Breslow has a reputation for being patient and deliberate, and he hasn’t proven to be the kind of executive who recklessly throws money around. He has a plan, and he sticks to it.\n\nThe Red Sox have managed to make several good additions so far without spending any money in free agency. If they want someone like Bregman or Bo Bichette, however, that will have to change.\n\nYankees Predicted To Sign Former NL MVP While Red Sox Eye Different Free Agent",
