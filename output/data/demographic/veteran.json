    "fullText": "Indianapolis Colts unretired longtime NFL veteran quarterback Philip Rivers will wear #17 again for the Horseshoe, which was the same number he wore back in 2020—and throughout his 8x NFL Pro Bowl career with the Chargers organization, as well as for NC State and in high school:\n\nWith Daniel Jones on injured reserve, new Colts QB Philip Rivers can get his old No. 17 back, as @mchappell51 reported. And once again, Rivers will wear No. 17. pic.twitter.com/kEPdI653Oz\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 10, 2025\n\nBecause injured starting quarterback Daniel Jones was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending Achilles injury, his #17 is eligible to be recirculated to Rivers for the remainder of the 2025 campaign.\n\nPer NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, an NFL spokesman indicated that, “The league approved it as it does not present a competitive issue as one player will be wearing that number.”\n\nRivers also texted Jones to ensure the former Colts starting quarterback was okay with him using his legendary #17 again. Rivers was already seen on the Colts practice field during Wednesday’s indoor practice, repping his #17.\n\nIt may not mean much, but Rivers likely would’ve looked weird with another jersey number (and we all know #18 was already unavailable!)\n\nIt’s best to have the 44-year-old quarterback most comfortable resuming his pro career, and it also provides Colts fans who bought a Rivers jersey back in 2020 the opportunity to wear a current one again—without any change to a new jersey number for the remainder of this year.",

    "description": "Three veteran starters have been ruled out for LSU's appearance in the Texas Bowl in late December.",
    "fullText": "LSU football will take the field for the Texas Bowl without three key starters. According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "title": "The Devils Should Target Ryan O’Reilly Before They Target Steven Stamkos",
    "description": "The Devils are interested in a couple veteran Nashville Predators. Here’s why only one of them is worth pursuing.",
    "fullText": "The trade winds are starting to blow in the NHL, and with the New Jersey Devils recent skid, cries have started coming out from all corners of the internet and the Devils fanbase for GM Tom Fitzgerald to do something before these recent struggles derails the season.\n\nElliotte Friedman reported Saturday that Fitzgerald is indeed looking around and gauging what the market looks like. Not only have the Devils been linked to Quinn Hughes, but they’ve also been linked to Ryan O’Reilly and Steven Stamkos of the Nashville Predators.\n\nI don’t really have much more else to add about the Quinn Hughes situation, as I’ve said my piece on that matter last week. Fitzgerald wouldn’t be doing his job if he wasn’t checking in on the availability of one of the best defensemen in the NHL….never mind the fact he’s also the brother of two players already on the Devils. The Devils having interest in Quinn Hughes isn’t some manufactured thing that is just being thrown out there willy nilly for clicks. It’s a very real possibility that it could happen, so of course Fitzgerald is going to check in there.\n\nWith that said, I haven’t said much about the Ryan O’Reilly and/or Steven Stamkos situation, aside from what I wrote about those players last season. But I think if it came down to one or the other, the choice is clear.\n\nThe Devils should prioritize O’Reilly over Stamkos.\n\nThe Devils went into the season with a plan of having Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier, and Cody Glass as their Top 3 centers, with Luke Glendening apparently winning the 4C job over Juho Lammikko after impressing in training camp on a PTO.\n\nAfter free agency came and went, I figured that the Devils plan was to make Dawson Mercer the 3C and have Cody Glass be the 4C, but apparently I was wrong.\n\nAll of this was always a questionable plan at best.\n\nSay what you will about Jack Hughes’s injury history, and say that you will about how fluky this year’s injury was with Hughes getting injured at a team dinner of all settings. Considering Hughes’s history, it would not have been unreasonable for Fitzgerald to come up with a better alternative than “just shift Mercer to center” in case Hughes missed time again. And sure enough, Hughes missed time again. It might be the flukiest of fluky flukes to ever fluke, but its still a failure from an organizational level to properly prepare for this potential scenario that had a realistic chance of happening.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Devils nearly let Cody Glass walk away in free agency before they thought better of it when it was apparent he would be scooped up quickly if he hit the open market. Add in the fact that Glass has his own injury history since coming to the Devils. Add in that Nico Hischier bears the brunt of playing in all situations and playing the toughest minutes of anyone on the roster. And add in the fact that the Devils plan for 4C was taking a flier on the winner of a training camp competition between a player who had been out of the NHL for a few seasons and a PTO signing.\n\nThis might be a bit of a simplistic take on my part, but its not a coincidence or an accident that when the Devils have looked their best this season, it has been when their centers were healthy and available. The top lines worked and all showed cohesion. It’s also not a coincidence or accident that Mercer himself has looked the best he’s looked when playing on Nico Hischier’s wing rather than centering his own line.\n\nNo, there’s no replacing a player like Jack Hughes when he misses time, but you give yourself a better shot of treading water when you have an NHL caliber option who can slide into that spot. Adding a player like O’Reilly would make a huge difference for this group. And what about when you get Hughes back? All of a sudden you have an embarrassment of riches at a critically important position. Where Ryan O’Reilly is an overqualified 3C and Cody Glass is an overqualified 4C.\n\nGo back and look at the center depth on the most recent Stanley Cup champions. Where the Panthers had Anton Lundell as their 3C throughout their run. Where the Golden Knights had some combination of Jack Eichel, Chandler Stephenson, and William Karlsson down the middle. Where the Lightning won their Cups with Yanni Gourde as their 3C, but they were also deep enough to move Anthony Cirelli or Brayden Point there when needed. Where until this season, the Avs weren’t the same after losing Nazem Kadri. I’d keep going on and on but you understand the point I’m trying to make.\n\nYou need to be deep down the middle if you want to be taken seriously as a championship contender. You need to be deep down the middle if you want to maximize the wingers you’ve brought in. The Devils are not.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Ryan O’Reilly is the same two-way player he was when he won a Selke trophy in St. Louis. He turns 35 years old later this season and while he’s still effective, he is approaching the 1200 game milestone.\n\nThat said, with 21 points in 28 games, he’s still more than capable of chipping in offensively. He’s more than capable of playing in all situations and holding his own.\n\nI’m also not suggesting that Nico Hischier isn’t capable of handling everything that he handles in his on-ice role. But wouldn’t Hischier potentially be more valuable to the Devils if the team had another alternative who could take some of those defensive obligations off of his plate? Jack Hughes is better defensively than he gets credit for, but nobody is going to confuse him for Patrice Bergeron in terms of being a Selke-caliber defensive forward. Cody Glass doesn’t contribute much on the penalty kill (he’s only played 2:58 there this year). Luke Glendening does play on the kill, but he’s a fairly limited player at this stage of his career. Anything you get from him offensively is a bonus.\n\nAdding a player like O’Reilly and leaning on him to play those minutes should have a positive impact on the Devils penalty kill, which ranks 17th in the league as of this writing. And it should give the Devils another option at 5v5 as well.\n\nSteven Stamkos was already on the decline when he left the Tampa Bay Lightning, and things haven’t looked better through his first season plus as a member of the Nashville Predators. He’s not really a center anymore, despite Predators coach Andrew Brunette shifting him between center and wing in an attempt to give them a spark. He doesn’t drive play anymore, he’s not shooting as much as he has in the past, he’s no longer an elite level skater, he’s not much of a defensive forward, and he no longer has elite level players alongside him like he did in Tampa.\n\nYes, Stamkos could potentially chip in a little bit offensively on the power play. And yes, he might look better playing with better players than Luke Evangelista on his line. I would guess that the Devils envision him playing alongside Jack Hughes and Jesper Bratt and burying the feeds that he used to get from elite level playmakers like Nikita Kucherov.\n\nBut the Devils don’t really need another overpaid player who barely does anything at 5v5. They already have one of those in Ondrej Palat, and Stamkos’s contract is even worse.\n\nThe 2025-26 Devils need stability down the middle more than they need a scoring winger. They needed this before Jack Hughes got hurt and that need is only exasperated the more we see they don’t have an answer at such a critically important position. And even if one believed the opposite was true, the last thing the Devils need is a soon-to-be 36-year-old Stamkos, who is under contract for $8M AAV for two more seasons after this one. I don’t even know how the Devils would make that contract fit given their current cap situation, but I know I want no part of that.\n\nOn the flip side, O’Reilly is under contract for $4.5M AAV for one more season after this one, which is more than reasonable for a middle six center. I get that with him being a year younger than Stamkos, he’s not exactly a spring chicken either, but I think its clear that O’Reilly has more left in the tank than Stamkos, and its not nearly as onerous a commitment either.\n\nObviously, this is all dependant on asking price, and there might wind up being other options that make themselves available as the season rolls along. But it certainly sounds like the Predators are open for business, and with how tight the NHL standings are, the teams that separate themselves from the pack are likely going to be the ones who are proactive fixing their issues with their rosters rather than being reactive and waiting until the deadline for prices to go down.\n\nWhat gives me pause is sitting by and doing nothing isn’t going to do anything to fix the issue. Not only is it not acceptable for this team and where they are on their timeline, I think we’ve seen enough mediocre to bad hockey to know that its not going to magically fix itself. I pointed out when I broke down every trade Fitzgerald has made that only once did he go out early in the season and make a trade to address a glaring hole. It was a bad one. It was acquiring Jon Gillies.",

    "description": "LPGA winners Ryann O'Toole, Hinako Shibuno and Jodi Ewart Shadoff all re-earn their full playing privileges in Q-Series Final",
    "fullText": "Ryann O’Toole didn’t imagine she would put this on her December itinerary, but there she was playing golf in Alabama this past week trying to salvage her LPGA Tour card. It was a wise decision.\n\nThe 38-year-old O’Toole, a UCLA alum who first gained recognition as a competitor on Golf Channel’s “Big Break,” has won one tournament on tour, and she has the chance to add more titles after shooting a bogey-free 65 with seven birdies on Tuesday in the final round of LPGA Q-Series Final Qualifying in Mobile. In the event shortened from 90 holes to 72 because of a day lost to bad weather, O’Toole finished tied for third at 11 under and was the top American qualifier. The top 25 and ties earned their tour card, with 31 golfers being the final total at Robert Trent Jones Trail Magnolia Grove.\n\nO’Toole has 20 career top-10s, but she made the cut in only half her 16 starts in 2025, with no top-10s, and finished 137th on the CME Points Rankings.\n\n“The last time I was here [at Q-Series] was 2014, and I told myself after that week, I never want to have to be back,” O’Toole said. “But you never know what happens, and here I was back having to re-qualify. It's stressful, it's a grind, it's mentally and emotionally draining. Then this week, with just the weather, I mean it being freezing, the delays, the rain, every single morning was early. … It became a physical grind.\n\n“I just think there's so much emotion that goes into this that it is a tough week. With 15 years on tour, there are mixed emotions going into it. I wasn't sure if I was even going to decide to go back to Q School or if I was just going to start the next chapter of my life. But at the same time it would be really weird to start January 1 and go, ‘What do you mean I don't have full status? What do you mean? I'm not a professional on the LPGA?’ That wasn't OK for me.”\n\nGerman golfer Helen Briem earned her LPGA Tour card in impressive fashion. She shot a four-under 68 to earn medalist honors at 13 under. Briem, 20, moves to the LPGA after having played on the Ladies European Tour.\n\n“Right now, I'm a bit lost for words. I entered this week with not a lot of expectations,” said Brie. “But, overall, I'm really happy that I am able to play LPGA next year, and that’s really cool.”\n\nMajor winner Hinako Shibuno, arguably the most popular Japanese golfer, got her tour card back again, too. The 2019 AIG Women’s British Open champion made it on the number at five under after closing with a 72. Shibuno, 27, struggled on the LPGA this season, making just 10 cuts in 23 starts while notching only one top-10 finish.\n\nAnother veteran to re-earn her card is former European Solheim Cup player Jodi Ewart Shadoff. The 37-year-old, who won her lone LPGA title in 2022 and has top-10 finishes in three of the tour’s five majors, shot 71 and was among the final eight players who tied for 24th.\n\nAmong the notable players who missed getting their cards was 17-year-old Floridian Gianna Clemente, who turned pro this year, advanced through Second Stage and fell three shots off the cut. Kim Kaufman, 34, who battled breast cancer this year and finished chemotherapy in the summer, finished at four over. Among the past college stars who didn’t get their cards were 2023 U.S. Women’s Amateur champion and Auburn alum Megan Schofill (even par), 2024 NCAA individual champion Adela Cernousek of Texas A&M (16 over), USC’s Amari Avery (one under) and Wake Forest’s Rachel Kuehn (eight over).",
