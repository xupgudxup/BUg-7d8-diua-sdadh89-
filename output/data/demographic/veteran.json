    "fullText": "Applications close February 14, 2026. The cohort starts April 7th.\n\nWe rebuilt the program from scratch this year. Here's what changed, what it requires, and how to know if it's right for you.\n\nI've been running Vets Who Code since 2014. We've trained 300+ veterans. Graduates have collectively earned over $20 million at companies like Microsoft, Google, and Home Depot.\n\nAI didn't just add a new skill to learn—it rewrote the rules. Companies aren't hiring the same way they were two years ago. The engineers getting hired now are the ones who can build AI-enabled systems, not just consume them.\n\nThe structure is closer to joining an engineering team than attending a class.\n\nThe curriculum covers 128 skills across four phases, each validated against current job postings:\n\nPhase 1: Foundations\nTerminal mastery. VS Code configuration. Git and GitHub workflows. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python fundamentals. We don't allow AI tools here—the goal is building fluency you can rely on under pressure. You'll work through code challenges at an intermediate level before advancing.\n\nPhase 2: Software Engineering\nTypeScript. Next.js 14+ with App Router. Testing with Jest and Playwright. CI/CD with GitHub Actions. Vercel deployment. You'll ship real features to real users on the Vets Who Code platform.\n\nPhase 3: AI Engineering\nFastAPI with Pydantic v2. Google Gemini integration—text, multimodal, function calling. Professional prompt engineering. RAG systems with pgvector. AI agents with LangChain and LangGraph. Full-stack AI applications with streaming interfaces.\n\nPhase 4: Production Mastery\nTesting AI systems. LLMOps with LangSmith. Docker containerization. Google Cloud Run deployment. Load testing with K6. Ethics, safety, and governance.\n\nThat's 20-24 hours per week for 17 weeks.\n\nThe program is designed around people who have jobs, families, and responsibilities. But it does require consistent time and focus. The veterans who do well treat it as a serious commitment alongside the rest of their lives.\n\nThis program works best for people who:\n\nIf you're still exploring whether coding is for you, that's fine—but this isn't the right starting point. The pace is fast, and the cohort moves together. The pre-work exists so everyone starts ready.\n\nYou'll need a computer no more than two years old and reliable internet. The program is free—Vets Who Code is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\n\nI built this program because I wished it existed when I was making the transition myself.\n\nI learned to code while balancing military life, family, and the reality of starting over. That's why this program is:\n\nWhen you interview after this program, you won't show tutorials. You'll show commits to a live codebase with real users.\n\nApplications close February 14, 2026.\n\nStart the pre-work now: github.com/Vets-Who-Code/Prework\n\nIf you have questions, reach out. If you're ready, start the pre-work.\n\nJerome Hardaway is an Air Force Veteran, a Senior AI Engineer, the founder of Vets Who Code, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has trained 300+ veterans in software engineering.",

    "fullText": "Charles Barkley isn’t holding back his disappointment over Michael Jordan’s NBC appearances this season. Fans had eagerly awaited the NBA legend’s insights on modern basketball as the network returned to airing games in 2025-26, but what aired left many underwhelmed.\n\nBarkley, speaking candidly, called the arrangement “disingenuous” and criticized NBC, claiming the rollout didn’t live up to the hype surrounding the six-time NBA Finals champion.\n\nCharles Barkley, whose relationship with Michael Jordan has cooled over the years, expressed frustration on SiriusXM NBA Radio. “I was excited to have Michael because Michael Jordan is the reason we all make this money from the NBA,” he said. He added, “But now you see this thing coming out with NBC… one interview five months ago, and you’re all gonna sprinkle it throughout the season? Come on, man. That’s disingenuous by NBC. That’s crazy.”\n\nBarkley didn’t mince words about how the network handled the coverage. “It’s a bad look for NBC, it’s just a bad look, plain and simple. They couldn’t fly to Michael like once a month and do a new interview? That makes NBC look really bad,” he added, emphasizing his disappointment in the setup. ( via Awful Announcing)\n\nMichael Jordan’s appearance was restricted to a single pre-recorded segment, MJ: Insights to Excellence, which ran across a few shows. While it offered some interesting takes, a lot of fans were hoping for deeper commentary on the state of today’s game. Host Mike Tirico defended the setup, saying Jordan “really wanted to talk about where he sees the game right now,” adding that viewers still got to hear his perspective, even if it wasn’t as in-depth as expected.\n\nTirico noted that Jordan’s love for basketball really shone through. He loves the game, and in some ways, he’s not a fan of where it’s headed, and he wanted to share that, Tirico said. Tirico also acknowledged that while the segment might not have satisfied every fan craving MJ insight, it was still special to hear from the legend himself. Tirico also hinted that future appearances could give fans even more of the coverage they’re hoping for.\n\nThe post NBA Veteran Targets Michael Jordan & NBC Deal: ‘It’s Bad’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

However, we went on to say that,\n\nKuo boils Apple’s thinking down to three key moves.\n\nAbsorb the pain now: Memory prices are rising at an incredible pace, and Apple is opting for margin pressure instead of consumer backlash.\n\nLockdown supply: Apple’s scale enables it to effectively secure components that others can’t, even as the shortages grow worse.\n\nPlay the long game: Any near-term margin hit will be viewed as temporary, with services revenue likely to backfill over time.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant risk that these pressures aren’t contained, as Kuo notes that iPhone memory prices are still being renegotiated quarterly rather than on a semiannual basis.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp played a decisive role in ending Los Angeles’ season, delivering three of the most pivotal moments in Seattle’s 31–27 victory in the NFC championship.\n\nSeattle scored its final points on Kupp’s 13-yard touchdown reception, a play that swung momentum late in the game. Minutes later, he delivered again, hauling in a dramatic, corkscrew-style catch before lunging forward to convert a crucial first down and keep the clock moving. The Seahawks effectively iced the game when Kupp drew a defensive holding penalty downfield on former teammate Cobie Durant, extending the final drive and preventing Los Angeles from getting the ball back.\n\nThe significance of the moment was evident afterward. Kupp exited the locker room before media arrived, leaving the stadium quietly with his family, a clear indication of how personal the game had been for him.\n\nMORE: Seahawks fans will love these 11 Super Bowl predictions from ESPN\n\nThat emotion had been simmering for months. The Rams’ decision to release Kupp earlier in the season was perceived by some in Seattle as disrespectful, and tensions between the two organizations reportedly boiled over during a Week 16 matchup at the same stadium.\n\nAccording to The Athletic’s Mike Silver and multiple witnesses, a late red-zone fumble by Kupp in that game — which halted a potential Seahawks scoring drive — sparked a heated confrontation between members of both coaching staffs.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks could end up trading Sam Darnold this offseason despite Super Bowl appearance\n\nAs Rams and Seahawks coaches exited their suites at halftime and entered a shared elevator to field level, Rams assistants were discussing the fumble. One offensive coach reportedly asked which Seattle player was responsible, and when told it was Kupp, reacted with a snicker, as if the answer were expected.\n\nThat response infuriated Seahawks outside linebackers coach Chris Partridge, whose anger escalated the situation.

    "title": "A Skadden veteran's uneasy take on smarter machines",
    "description": "A \"brick wall\" moment changed his career. He wants younger generations to get that chance, too.",
    "fullText": "Three years out of law school, in 1990, David Goldschmidt landed the kind of assignment most young corporate lawyers only dream of: taking a company public.\n\nWhen a senior partner at the venerated New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom told him to \"run with\" biotech company Regeneron's IPO, his career changed.\n\nGoldschmidt sweated his way through writing the prospectus, translating the company's scientific ambitions into plain language for investors. Regeneron raised twice the expected amount in the initial offering.\n\nThe victory was volatile. The stock swung sharply after the IPO, prompting shareholder lawsuits. A federal judge dismissed the cases against Regeneron, finding the company's disclosures to be accurate and legally sufficient. And for Goldschmidt, the trial by fire taught him something.\n\n\"I could do this,\" he remembers thinking.\n\nGoldschmidt rose through the ranks to become a partner and, eventually, the global head of Skadden's capital markets practice, advising companies on raising capital in the public or private markets. His name appeared routinely on the opening pages of S-1 filings, including those of Casper, Match Group, and Rivian Automotive, whose $12 billion raise was one of the largest US IPOs in history. In 2025 alone, the hundred-person Skadden group handled more than $300 billion worth of transactions.\n\nGoldschmidt retired last month after 37 years at Skadden, ending a tenure that made him a rare constant in an industry increasingly defined by churn.\n\nWhile he stayed put, the ground beneath him did not. From his perch at Skadden, the fourth-highest-grossing law firm in the country, Goldschmidt worked through a technological revolution that shifted the legal industry from analog to algorithmic.\n\nHe's not convinced smarter machines make for better lawyers.\n\nI met Goldschmidt two weeks before he retired, in a conference room high above Manhattan's West Side. The 62-year-old looked relaxed in a tailored navy suit. He asked for a coffee, and within minutes, a pair of staffers set up a full barista station on the credenza. We each poured, and I asked him when he decided he wanted to be a lawyer.\n\n\"Five years into practicing,\" he said.\n\nGoldschmidt went to law school unsure about what kind of law he wanted to practice, driven only by a curiosity about \"how the markets work,\" he said. At first, he purposely avoided Big Law, starting at the smaller, white-shoe firm Breed, Abbott & Morgan. On his first day at the New York office, a woman in HR led him on a meet-and-greet with the partners. With each knock on a partner's door, the mood darkened.\n\nAt one office, the woman began her script. \"How are you doing today? This is Mr. Goldschmidt. He's starting today —\"\n\n\"How do you think I'm doing?\" the partner cut in. \"The market's down 22%.\"\n\nIt was October 19, 1987, Black Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 500 points, wiping out roughly half a trillion dollars in market value.\n\nThe crash was violent but brief, and soon leveraged buyouts and mergers exploded. For law firms working those deals, the frenzy translated into enormous amounts of work. Goldschmidt realized that the \"genteel\" lifestyle he had sought was an illusion.\n\n\"Regardless of what size law firm you work at, you're going to work hard,\" he said. Within his first year, he left to join Skadden's capital markets practice, securing a front-row seat to the global economy that he would occupy for the next 37 years. He fell in love with the fervor of the environment and the people hustling beside him.\n\nThe intensity of the work hasn't changed. The work itself has.\n\nWhen he started, his desk held a LexisNexis terminal, an angular box with a built-in keyboard used for case law research; he used it as a surface for Post-it notes. He wrote documents longhand on a legal pad, handing them off to a typing pool staffed by, as Goldschmidt recalls, \"aspiring actors.\"\n\nEditing a document meant two associates sitting side by side with the new and old versions, reading the first word of every line aloud to mark where the draft had changed. He dashed to meet the mail courier at 9 p.m. to make sure clients had the documents in the morning.\n\nGoldschmidt saw this as valuable repetition, learning through what he calls \"sweat equity.\" He didn't study judgment; he accumulated it. Even as Microsoft Word replaced typing pools and due diligence moved online, much of the mental work of synthesizing information remained.\n\nThose reps became part of Goldschmidt's value to clients, said Jeffrey Horowitz, a longtime Bank of America executive who worked with him across multiple transactions. \"You're getting long-term advice — grounded in history and a real relationship,\" he said.\n\nRegeneron remains a Skadden client, now a roughly $77 billion biotech. Its cofounder and CEO, Dr. Leonard Schleifer, remembers Goldschmidt as a \"workhorse,\" citing his attention to detail and command of the law.\n\nNow, with the legal industry on the cusp of another shift, artificial intelligence is beginning to absorb some of the routine work that once consumed junior lawyers' time. Goldman Sachs has said the technology could someday automate 44% of legal work.\n\nGoldschmidt's own introduction to the technology came from his son, then a Big Law associate. He gave him a demo of a legal software called Harvey, which could draft and find answers in documents that might take an associate hours of slogging. \"It just blew me away,\" Goldschmidt said.\n\nThat efficiency raised a fundamental question. How do you train young lawyers when machines do the work for them?\n\nFor Goldschmidt, the value of sweat equity isn't just hard work. It's the intellectual struggle of problem-solving. Learning, he said, happens when you \"hit a brick wall and veer off\" to find another path. If new tools surface answers instantly, he worries, junior lawyers may lose not only the habit of wrestling a question to its conclusion, but the legal fundamentals needed to recognize when a chatbot is hallucinating or getting it wrong.\n\nStill, Goldschmidt is careful not to romanticize the past. \"It may be easier,\" he said. But law, he argues, has never been a profession where fulfillment comes from sitting at a desk and simply executing tasks.\n\n\"A fulfilling career,\" he said, \"is going out there, stretching, meeting people, learning — seeing what's around the bend.\"\n\nInside Skadden, Goldschmidt said, there's a saying: Walk through walls for the client.\n\nThat ethos only intensified as new tools arrived. Legal work, after all, is a service business. Email and cellphones reset expectations for speed and responsiveness. Now, clients are pushing law firms to adopt artificial intelligence in the name of more efficient service. Skadden pays for its lawyers to have access to Harvey and other tools used for research, drafting, and document review.\n\nFor Goldschmidt, even the early technology was a \"double-edged sword.\" A BlackBerry meant he could finally go to a movie on a Saturday night without worrying he might miss a call. But it also meant there was no longer any real off-switch. The culture didn't always allow lawyers to check out.\n\nGoldschmidt remembers around that time reading an article about email that described how Bill Gates would sit down at his computer at night and respond to his messages in one sitting. \"How lucky is that guy,\" Goldschmidt remembers thinking, \"that he can wait till the end of the day?\"\n\nAs Goldschmidt prepared to retire on New Year's Eve, he remained optimistic about the next generation of lawyers, provided they remember that the job requires more than just prompting chatbots. Looking back on the shift from legal pads to large language models, he offers a final assessment of his four decades in the arena — not as a protagonist, but as an essential witness.\n\n\"I may not have invented anything,\" Goldschmidt said. \"I may not have started a company that changed anything. But I had a front-row seat to all those people, those companies, who did.\"\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent with Business Insider, covering the intersection of law and technology.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Fitness and United States Marine Corps. veteran. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's interesting about my day is that it's never really routine.\n\nIt's highly dependent on where I'm working from, so if I'm in my main office in Manhattan, the day is quite different than if I'm at home in Lake Tahoe. It's fulfilling to not have the same routine over and over again.\n\nI've been doing this for 34 years, so monotony is a killer for me.\n\nWhere my job gets fun is if I'm on the road, I'm in gyms. My team and get to go to our more than 500 gyms, and I love meeting the members.\n\nLately, we've been spending a lot of time on understanding where AI is going to integrate perfectly with the member experience and the team member experience. We're testing some ideas out in the field.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm in a rut from a strategy standpoint, creatively, I go to the gyms. I think all the answers are in the gyms. So I talk to my teams about what's working, what's not.\n\nPeople think I'm kind of a hard guy, but I think I'm pretty relaxed, especially on the road. There are just a few non-negotiables I have in my regular cadence to stay on track.\n\nTypically, I get up at 5:45 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., depending on the day. My morning is like an old grandpa's. I watch the business news, see how the markets are trending. I usually have my one cup of coffee for the day.\n\nRight now, my morning is special — I had a granddaughter born last June, so she's up really early, my daughter's up really early, so I usually get to chat with them via text or FaceTime before everything has started. Once that's done, I start my emails. The majority of my day is set up around Zoom rodeos, performance updates, executive leadership team meetings, or huddles.\n\nThis may be funny, but when I'm on the road, I need to have a desk or a sitting area so I have space to think and stretch my legs. I can't just be checking emails from bed.\n\nI also need to get a protein shake in the morning, especially when I'm on the road. I'm not going to sit down and have a hotel breakfast or stop anywhere.\n\nI believe fitness is medicine. I'm 58 now, and I'm chasing being happy, healthy, and mobile in my eighties and nineties, so it's really about staying active, keeping moving.\n\nWhen I was in the Marine Corps., I worked out in the morning. Prior to 2020, I worked out at the end of my day.\n\nI'm finding that the midday routine is best for me now, to block out some time.\n\nAt lunchtime, around 1 p.m., I break for exercise. So about 12:45, I wind down my meetings, and I'm either headed to Pilates or the gym.\n\nI can walk to our gym, which is great. It's about a 20-minute walk there and back, so you get 40 minutes of cardio with your weightlifting.\n\nI don't lift for ego anymore. I rarely bench. I used to bench press all the time, and I was very proud of what I could bench press. Now, I don't bench press at all because it's so hard on my shoulders. I do a lot more dumbbell workouts now, a lot more machine lifting.\n\nHaving lifted weights since I was 14, I felt like Pilates was an opportunity for me to try to lengthen, strengthen, and activate some of the smaller muscles.\n\nIt changed my life, to be honest with you. I became much more limber, a lot less tight. At first, I was the only man in the Pilates class, but I've been telling my neighbors and building a little army of Pilates guys.\n\nI've done both yoga and Pilates, and prefer Pilates because there is a little bit of strength with mobility and balance.\n\nAfter the gym, I'll have lunch, and then I'm back at the office for more calls, meetings, and so forth. It's problem-solving, it's answering questions, and then I wrap up my day.\n\nI like to get out of here by 5:30 p.m. to get a walk in, especially this time of year, because it's cold and it's just refreshing.\n\nWe eat dinner around 6:30 or 7 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I aren't big on sitcom television, but we do like series. She likes anything out of England, the BBC. I'm more into military history, US history, or westerns. We settled in the middle with dramatic crime whodunnit type of series.\n\nI do have a passion for \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race.\" People laugh at me, but I just love competition.\n\nThen I read a little bit, and I'm in bed usually by 11.",

The 24-year-old tight end rejoins the Steelers after a stint with the team during training camp and on the practice squad this past season.\n\nWe have signed TE J.J. Galbreath to a Reserve/Future contract. @BordasLaw\n\n— Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) January 23, 2026\n\nGalbreath originally joined the Steelers as an undrafted free agent out of South Dakota after the 2025 Draft. The six-foot-four pass catcher shone for the Coyotes, amassing 1355 yards and 13 touchdowns during his college career. Galbreath earned first-team AP All-American honors his senior season. However, he was cut during the team’s final roster cuts in August. Galbreath briefly rejoined the team on the practice squad, but was cut after week two and has been a free agent ever since.\n\nHe appeared in three preseason games for the Steelers this past season, but only collected three catches for 23 yards during his time on the field. This reserve/future deal will now give Galbreath a better chance to impress the new coaching staff during offseason workouts and in training camp in Latrobe.\n\nWith fellow tight end Connor Heyward set to become a free agent, Galbreath will now have another shot to potentially crack the 53-man roster this season for the Steelers.",

He has not given up on a fight he has been waiting years to make happen. But while he waits, there could be another opportunity taking shape over in the wrestling world.\n\nChandler has not fought since his loss to Paddy Pimblett in April 2024, but he recently stepped back into combat sports by returning to his wrestling background.\n\nThe 39-year-old made his debut with Real American Freestyle earlier this month, picking up a win over Chad Mendes at the promotion’s fifth event.\n\nHe seems intent on staying active under the RAF banner, and a new opportunity has already come up. UFC lightweight contender Arman Tsarukyan has called him out for a match.\n\nSpeaking on The Ariel Helwani Show, he said: “I saw somebody comment the other day, ‘Man, Arman’s done a really good job of staying relevant during this time.’ I get it. He talks about everybody. He’s saying my name.\n\n“One thing I will say about Arman, the dude has stayed busy with these grappling matches. I watched him wrestle live at RAF; he did a great job there.\n\n“I think I am interested (in facing Tsarukyan). My plan A, the one thing I’m focused on, is fighting at the White House.\n\n“His future is somewhat up in the air. Mine’s up in the air as well, but less up in the air than his is.\n\n“Who knows. But yeah, I’ll wrestle against him.”\n\nTsarukyan’s next wrestling match may not be against Chandler.\n\nTalks are reportedly underway for a potential bout with Dustin Poirier, which would take place under the Hype FC banner.\n\nNo further details have emerged since Hype FC CEO Armand Martirosian first mentioned the discussions in an interview on Jason Takhtadjian’s YouTube channel.\n\nPoirier and Chandler have their own history, having faced off at Madison Square Garden back in late 2022. ‘The Diamond’ came out on top that night at UFC 281 and later accused Chandler of fish-hooking during the bout",

    "fullText": "OpenAI has laid out some ambitious plans for 2026, but according to George Noble, the ChatGPT maker is a cautionary tale for the wider AI theme.\n\nThe hedge fund investor and former director of the Fidelity Overseas Fund doesn't think the AI startup will be able to justify its lofty growth projections, but more than that, he thinks investors should avoid the AI trade and shift their focus to other areas of the market before the tide turns.\n\nThe hedge fund founder laid out his thesis on OpenAI's red flags in a detailed X post on Tuesday, highlighting the \"code red\" moment announced by CEO Sam Altman in December 2025.\n\nIn his view, it all comes down to financials, specifically a math problem that isn't being widely discussed. \n\n\"It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better,\" he said. \"The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.\"\n\nNoble thinks OpenAI's annual revenue has to reach $200 billion by 2030 in order for the company's projections to be justified.\n\nPointing to the broader market, he advised AI startup founders to exit their companies while the boom is still going, adding that he believes the AI hype cycle is nearing its peak. He thinks investors should shift their focus to other parts of the market, as both the AI trade and the Magnificent Seven will be impacted if OpenAI begins to struggle.\n\n\"If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming,\" he advised. \"The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.\"\n\nThe particular sector in this case is small-mid cap stocks, which is where Noble sees real value and growth potential. He added that there is a value disconnect between Big Tech stocks and their small-cap peers, which are trading at near-decade lows.\n\nFor that reason, Noble sees an opportunity for investors to move away from the most crowded stocks that carried the AI trade in 2025 and focus on the lesser-known value plays that have been quietly making progress while AI-linked names continue to dominate the headlines.\n\n\"Markets can price risk,\" he noted. \"But they can't price chaos.\nAnd OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.\"",

    "fullText": "A PGA Tour veteran has sent a jolt through the golf world with a candid take on LIV Golf’s ripple effect. While many criticize LIV Golf and the professionals who play in it, Tom Hoge doesn’t. The reason – the Saudi-backed league has helped him financially in a unique way.\n\n“Well, I would say personally speaking, I’m probably the player that’s benefited absolutely the most from LIV coming along. I played well in 2022 right before LIV got going, which brought an offer from LIV, so I went down that road for a little bit. But, sticking with the PGA Tour and the changes they made, I’ve played in every signature event since they were established. And I would say nobody’s benefited more financially than I have cuz I’ve played well in some of those events and been in all of them,” Tom Hoge revealed in conversation with Trey Wingo.\n\n“So, it’s been fantastic for me. So, I shouldn’t be the guy here, complaining about any of that coming along. But it is tough for the game of golf that there’s a lot of great players that are on LIV that we’re not competing with against every week like we were.”\n\nThe 36-year-old PGA Tour professional from Statesville, North Carolina, stated that LIV’s inception has brought him financial benefits. However, he is not the only one. Many professionals on the PGA Tour have benefited indirectly from LIV’s inception. As former CEO Greg Norman highlighted, the Saudi-backed league disrupted the market, which was essential to restoring balance.\n\nBefore LIV’s arrival, the prize pools for PGA Tour events weren’t that large. And there weren’t many additional benefits that athletes enjoy today. For instance, the PGA Tour started its for-profit entity and offered equity stakes to golfers. The standard prize pool on the PGA Tour was around $8-$9 million. Then came LIV Golf, offering $20-$25 million per event. This put pressure on the PGA Tour to pay golfers more.\n\nThus, the PGA Tour started elevating events in 2023, which officially became the Signature Events in 2024. These events feature higher prize money of around $20 million or more.\n\nSince Tom Hoge performed well in 2022, he has been eligible to play Signature Events until now. In 2025, too, he was eligible for and played all Signature Events. He posted strong results in many of them, including T8 at The Sentry ($550,000), T3 at THE PLAYERS Championship ($1,325,000), T5 at Valero Texas Open ($304,000), T14 at the Masters ($336,000), and T7 at the Memorial ($603,200). These finishes underscore his claim of major financial gains from post-LIV Tour upgrades.\n\nIn 2024, he also finished strongly at many events. Hoge received $642,500 at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, $646,000 at the 2024 The Genesis Invitational, $389,666 at the 2024 Arnold Palmer Invitational, and $1,160,000 at the Travelers Championship. This shows that a large part of his official money came from the Signature events in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile he enjoys the financial benefits, he also misses playing with some of the best golfers. Playing against strong competitors makes an athlete strong. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Joaquin Niemann, and Patrick Reed are some of the many gold golfers playing LIV Golf. Their exclusion from PGA Tour events influences the field’s strength, which also impacts the OWGR points.\n\nAlthough Tom Hoge is happy with almost every change the PGA Tour has gone through after LIV’s inception, he dislikes one thing that may come from 2027.\n\nTiger Woods’s Future Competition Committee (FCC) planned for a redesigned schedule from 2027. The new schedule will likely feature fewer events and may start in February instead of January. Woods and the FCC aim to mitigate viewership competition from the NFL in January. CEO Brian Rolapp supports this view and the redesigned schedule. However, Tom Hoge doesn’t.\n\nHoge told Golf Channel the pre-LIV model worked well. It allowed players to pick events freely with equal stature throughout the season. He praised past flexibility where stars like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson elevated chosen events without a rigid top-heavy structure. If the redesigned schedule reduces the number of events, it will take away this flexibility. Therefore, Hoge opposed a reduced schedule. Instead, he valued the ability to take a month off or play four straight weeks.\n\nTom Hoge’s comments highlight how LIV Golf’s arrival reshaped his financial outlook while also changing the competitive feel of the PGA Tour. As golf moves toward another possible shift, his perspective reflects both gratitude for new opportunities and concern for what may be lost.\n\nThe post Greg Norman Was Right All Along as PGA Tour Champ Owns Up to Benefiting from LIV Golf appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Jeremy Grantham says AI is one of the biggest bubbles in history — and it's likely to tank the stock market when it bursts.\n\n\"I think it's obviously a bubble, and I think it's quite a simple story,\" the veteran investor and GMO cofounder said during the latest episode of the \"Merryn Talks Money\" podcast.\n\nGrantham compared AI to the railroad and the internet, two world-changing inventions marked by early investment bubbles which, when they popped, \"brought the economy to its knees for a year or two\" and \"everybody lost their money.\"\n\nContrary to common belief, \"bubbles don't occur when there's some crummy idea that gets touted,\" Grantham said. \"All the bubbles are associated with serious things, and the more serious, the bigger the bubble.\"\n\nGrantham emphasized the \"iron law\" that when an asset doubles in price, the return from holding it halves from that point forward.\n\n\"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward,\" he said. \"And it will happen this time. And my guess is after a while, sooner or later, the market will become a whole lot cheaper.\"\n\nGrantham, who had predicted an epic market crash four years ago, said the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2023 generated immense buzz around AI and sparked major capital outlays by companies, ultimately staving off an economic slump.\n\nThe market historian said that Big Tech companies have used their dominant market positions and influence to boost their profit margins to \"excessive levels,\" but that won't stop the bubble he sees from bursting.\n\nThe \"probabilities that AI will not bust are slim to none,\" he said. \"It meets every condition of the railroads and the Internet. It's a powerful idea that's attracted everybody's money.\"\n\n\"And so my guess is Nvidia will lead it down, and all the others will follow for a while, and then out of the ashes several of them will once again inherit the world,\" he said.\n\nGrantham also flagged institutional inertia and herd mentality as factors preventing the market from coming to its senses.\n\nPut differently, industry professionals aren't sounding the alarm on valuations out of fear that the bubble will keep growing and they'll underperform their rivals, hurt their reputations, and lose clients or even their jobs.\n\n\"They all look around nervously at each other, but they keep going,\" he said. \"As long as the music's playing, they're going to be dancing. Doesn't matter that they know the market is silly.\"\n\nGrantham is one of several high-profile investors, including Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame, who have warned AI stocks are overvalued and predicted a market downturn is coming.\n\nYet the US stock market has continued to march higher in spite of the skeptics, with the benchmark S&P 500 rising around 80% over the past five years.\n\n\"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed comparisons between the AI boom and dot-com bubble in interviews with Business Insider last fall.\n\nO'Leary said \"you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis,\" while Gerber said today's valuations are warranted as AI companies have enormous growth potential and their profitability is \"just insane.\"",

    "fullText": "Matthew Stafford has spent most of the 2025 season making quarterback play look effortless, but Sunday’s divisional playoff game against the Chicago Bears was a rare quiet afternoon by his standards. The veteran passer failed to throw a touchdown for the first time all year, completing just 20 of 42 attempts for 258 yards in the Rams’ gritty 20–17 overtime victory.\n\nEven in a win that sent Los Angeles to the NFC Championship, Stafford was his own harshest critic. Despite the celebration around him, Stafford didn’t hide from his uneven performance. Speaking after the game, he admitted he never found his usual rhythm.\n\n“No, I definitely didn’t get into a great rhythm today, there’s no question about that,” Stafford said post-game. “Had some opportunities in the pass game, just some things that made it tough. Obviously, I can be better.”\n\nThe Bears’ remarkable season came to a heartbreaking end at SoFi Stadium. Chicago had captured the NFC North, knocked off the Packers in the wild-card round, and taken organizational steps that hadn’t been seen in decades. They nearly added another chapter to that story, rallying in the final minute when Caleb Williams found Cole Kmet on a stunning fourth-down strike to tie the game with 17 seconds left.\n\nOvertime, however, belonged to the Rams. Williams threw a costly interception on a potential game-winning drive, and Los Angeles methodically moved into range for Harrison Mevis, who drilled a 42-yard field goal to seal the victory. The Rams now advance to face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, while Chicago is left watching two teams sitting exactly where it hopes to be next season. So, despite the sub-par stat line, Stafford isn’t all that regretful.\n\n“But playoff football is about winning the football game. I played great, threw for a bunch of yards last year in the snow and we lost, and that sucks. I’m happy to have played a little bit worse today and go home with a win. We’ll take that.”\n\nHis stat line backed up the self-assessment: a 47.6 percent completion rate, no touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 67.4 passer rating. It was far from the form that had defined his regular season.\n\nOne off night doesn’t erase what has been a historic campaign. It wouldn’t be a stretch to call this the best season of Stafford’s 17-year career. The 37-year-old averaged 276.9 passing yards per game and eclipsed 4,600 yards for the fifth time, highlighted by a 457-yard explosion against Seattle in Week 16.\n\nHe finished the regular season with more than 45 touchdown passes, leading the league by a wide margin —Jared Goff’s 34 was the next closest total — while throwing just eight interceptions despite consistently pushing the ball downfield. Those numbers kept him firmly in the MVP conversation even as the Rams split their final six games.\n\nSunday’s matchup showed a different version of the Rams offense. Los Angeles leaned heavily on the pass early, asking Stafford to drop back 40 times in regulation while running just seven times in the first half. The ground game found more life after the break, but the contest remained tight thanks to Chicago’s balanced attack of 160 rushing yards on 39 attempts.\n\nIn the end, style points didn’t matter. The Rams capitalized when it counted, and Stafford, despite his first touchdown-less outing, did enough to move his team one step closer to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe post “I Can Be Better”: Matthew Stafford Gets Honest About 0-TD Game vs. Bears Despite 45+ TDs This Season appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season is the best for the Chicago Bears in quite some time, as they finished the regular season 11-6, winning the NFC North, and have the chance to reach the NFC championship game if they can defeat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night.\n\nMany people have stated the reasons they believe the Bears have had a franchise-altering season, such as the hiring of head coach Ben Johnson and the rise of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams. Both have, without a doubt, had a significant positive impact on the team.\n\nHowever, Johnson gave an unlikely reason for the team's success this season: a player who has been in the league for a long time.\n\nMore: Bears' Colston Loveland is 2nd in NFL history with crazy stats, joining Gronk with this record\n\nVeteran backup quarterback Case Keenum received high praise from his head coach for the role he has played this season for Chicago, despite not taking any snaps with the team.\n\n\"He's been tremendous in terms of Caleb's growth. That was really the thought process of bringing him in, a guy with skins on the wall. He's played in big games himself at a high level. He's won big games. He's lost big games. His experience has really been something that all these young players can really lean into,\" Johnson said to the media on Friday.\n\nJohnson makes a great point as Keenum has seen it all in his 13 seasons in the league and has been a servicable backup for most of his years, so even though it doesn't sound ideal, it shouldn't be as surprising that this young Bears team has leaned on the veteran.\n\nKeenum's leadership will be needed for at least one game against one of his former teams, the Rams, which is set to be the team's most formidable opponent yet.\n\nCaleb Williams fires back at Packers’ super fan Lil Wayne after wild tweet\n\nChicago Bears now know who they will face in divisional round of playoffs\n\nBears, Bills, Rams set an NFL playoff record already with crazy comeback history\n\nCaleb Williams planted an image in Packers fans' heads that will haunt them all offseason\n\nCaleb Williams gets emotional paying tribute to Ben Johnson after Bears' playoff win",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Draft is expected to lack top-tier quarterbacks, which could lead to a flurry of veteran quarterbacks changing teams this offseason. One signal-caller who is expected to draw considerable attention on the trade market is Mac Jones.\n\nJones signed a two-year contract worth $8.4 million with the 49ers this offseason. With Brock Purdy established as San Francisco’s starting quarterback, the 49ers may consider trading Jones.\n\nWith the limited number of quarterbacks in free agency, Jones could potentially bring in a significant amount of draft capital. According to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, it’s likely that Jones could yield a Day 2 and a Day 3 pick in return.\n\n“I’d say a Day 2 pick, and maybe a Day 3 pick swap for Jones,” Breer wrote on Friday. “The Jets’ trade of Sam Darnold to the Panthers might be the best recent comp I could find, and New York got a 2021 sixth-round pick and ’22 second- and fourth-rounders for the quarterback. I’d guess the price would be a little less because Darnold had two years left on his rookie deal, and he was a little younger, too.”\n\nThe Patriots drafted Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft, and he enjoyed success during his rookie season, helping New England reach the playoffs. However, the next two seasons with the Patriots didn’t go as planned, leading to New England trading Jones to the Jacksonville Jaguars in March of 2024.\n\nJones bounced back this season while Purdy was sidelined with an injury. He appeared in 11 games, starting eight of them, and threw for 2,151 yards along with 13 touchdowns.\n\nThere’s a possibility that Jones could return to the AFC East next season, as both the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets are expected to be on the lookout for quarterback help.\n\nWhy TV Analyst Guaranteed Patriots Playoff Win Over Texans",

Curry, the 1994 Sixth Man of the Year, ranks second in points in franchise history and spent 10 of his 16 NBA seasons in Charlotte (1988-98). He currently serves as a team ambassador. pic.twitter.com/coSL3ntP5a\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) January 14, 2026\n\nCurry is now more widely recognized as the father of Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry. However, long before his eldest son started making waves in the NBA and rewriting records, Dell was known as one of the best long-distance shooters of his era.\n\nCharlotte was fortunate to have Dell Curry for 10 of his 16 years in the league. During his tenure with the Hornets, the team made four appearances in the Eastern Conference playoffs, advancing to the semifinals on two occasions. Curry played much of his career in a reserve or sixth-man role and earned the Sixth Man of the Year award during the 1993-94 season.\n\nThat year, Curry played all 82 games, averaging a career-high 16.3 points, along with 3.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists, while shooting 40.2% from three-point range. The season before winning the Sixth Man award, Curry finished fourth in voting, and he remained in the top five in two of the three seasons following his win. In 1994-95, he finished second behind New York Knicks power forward Anthony Mason for the Sixth Man Award.\n\nAlthough Curry played for five different teams over his career, his prime years and best on-court performance were with Charlotte. During his decade with the Hornets, he averaged 14 points, 2.9 rebounds, 2 assists, 1.1 steals, and shot 40.5% from three.\n\nIn recent years, Curry has served as an ambassador for the Hornets and spends time watching his sons, Stephen and Seth, drain threes from all over the court. Dell is also a broadcaster for the Hornets, calling games on FanDuel and Amazon Prime Video’s NBA coverage.",

    "description": "A \"nasty\" 15% sell-off could hit crowded trades this spring, says Tom Sosnoff.",
    "fullText": "The hottest AI trade on Wall Street has officially become \"boring.\"\n\n\"Nvidia would be a very boring idea ... because we all know the story,\" serial entrepreneur Tom Sosnoff told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe former founder of Thinkorswim and Tastytrade argued that despite Nvidia's technological dominance, the stock's story is too well-known and it may be priced for perfection.\n\nSosnoff isn't a tech skeptic. In fact, he's a fan of the product. He likened Nvidia's (NVDA) AI platforms to having a \"genius best friend\" with a 165 IQ available at all times.\n\nThe problem, he argued, is that Nvidia is now \"totally fully priced.\" When most analysts and retail traders are already on one side of the boat, that \"boring\" reality suggests there are very few surprise scenarios that can drive the price significantly higher from here.\n\n\"I look at Nvidia and I'm thinking to myself, how much more upside [is] in here and what kind of downside is there if this thing rolls over?\" Sosnoff said. \"It's not a function of ... Nvidia itself. It's just a function of price.\"\n\nThe warning comes at a time when market volatility is hovering at multi-year lows and stocks are sitting at record levels. In the past year, Nvidia's shares have risen roughly 40%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) recently closed at all-time highs this month.\n\nSosnoff isn't predicting a total market collapse, but he's bracing for a reality check. He anticipates a \"nasty sell-off\" in the range of 10% to 15% potentially hitting between March and May.\n\n\"The odds favor the downside in the market,\" said Sosnoff. He noted that while the equity market is partying, the bond market has remained eerily stagnant. If that volatility returns, the \"fully priced\" darlings like Nvidia are often the first to feel the gravity. Moreover, market fickleness could materialize when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nAnother provocative take is that Nvidia's reign as the world's most valuable company is under threat. When asked if the AI giant would still have its crown at the end of the year, Sosnoff was skeptical.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be Nvidia,\" he said regarding the market cap race. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has recently edged out Apple (AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world, and it's within striking distance of Nvidia as it surges past $4 trillion.",

    "description": "There is a counterargument to 49ers LB Fred Warner returning for the playoffs",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have floated around the NFC Championship as a potential game for linebacker Fred Warner to return. Warner has not appeared in a game since October 12, when he dislocated his ankle in Week 6.\n\nAfter Sunday’s game, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said the chances are “Not very high” of Warner playing in the Divisional Round. The team playing on a short week could certainly influence Shanahan’s decision.\n\nWarner has different ideas. He uploaded a video of himself doing drills on Monday:\n\n.@fred_warner showing his recovery progress 👀\n\n(via @fred_warner) pic.twitter.com/X94flz0i1l\n\nOn The Ryen Russillo Show, before Wild Card weekend, Warner said:\n\n“I’m ready whenever they’re ready. There’s some T’s that gotta be crossed, I’s that gotta be dotted. Unfortunately, if it were just up to me, I’d be out there this weekend, but it’s unfortunately not that way. I’ve got to make sure I’m checking all the boxes, and everybody has to give me the okay before they let me go out there. But I’m pushing, man. I’m training hard. I’m back doing full football drills and everything, so time will tell. We gotta pull the win off first.”\n\nThis could also be a scenario where the team is protecting Warner from himself. In his mind, he was probably ready to play in Week 17. But, as he said, every box needs to be checked. While the team would love to have Warner on the field in the Divisional Round, the last thing they want to do is sacrifice the longevity of his career.\n\nFormer NBA all-star Michael Redd, who played from 2000 to 2012, shared his thoughts on the topic:\n\nLooks like a near-miraculous comeback. Near, but not totally. Here’s my OG advice no one asked for: We’ve seen this play out before. Could name countless examples, but let’s go…Brandon Roy came back in 8 days from meniscus surgery in 2010. Retired at 27 with no cartilage left. Robert Williams rushed back for the Celtics playoff series in 2022, still dealing with it, seems like. KD tore his Achilles coming back too early in 2019, back but missed ton of time. Look, injuries robbed me of the back half of my career too, so I get wanting to be out there…especially for the playoffs. But take your time. Come back 100%. You’re not the difference between winning a title or not. And if you are? You’ll be that guy next year too. Your body is your career. Have to protect it. Fans will understand and appreciate the extra good years that you/they get out of it!\n\nWarner was in the conversation for Defensive Player of the Year before sustaining an ankle injury, so there’s a strong argument that he could be the difference in winning a title or not. But that doesn’t make Redd’s point moot.\n\nWarner is under contract for four more seasons. There are no guarantees the 49ers will be back in the playoffs, but this is a team that has proven to be a consistent postseason contender. Big picture, you want Warner on the field for the duration of the decade, not the 2025 regular season.\n\nRE: Fred Warner and a potential return to #49ers. This Sunday would mark 21 days until the Super Bowl. Opening his practice window at any point from then would give maximum time possible to evaluate if he's ready to go with no real down side. \n\n(That's probably true now, too,…\n\n— Nick Wagoner (@nwagoner) January 13, 2026\n\nAs Nick Wagoner stated above, the 49ers could open Warner’s practice window this week.",

I feel like it's the same in that sense, taking a step back and trying to really not put too much emotion behind the decision to do whatever it is I'm going to do.\"\n\nIn addition to his pass rush ability, Mack was a key part of the run defense for the Chargers and his departure would leave a big hole for the team to fill heading into next season.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — The California Post has hired veteran sportswriter Ben Bolch from the Los Angeles Times, marking the third departure from the Times’ sports section to the New York Post–backed West Coast startup as it ramps up staffing ahead of its official launch later this month.\n\nPERSONAL NEWS: After 26 years at the Los Angeles Times, I am joining the new sports team at @capostsports under the direction of @Ryan_Kostecka as a senior college sports reporter. My first day is Jan. 20. We are building something special and I hope you'll join us.\n\n— Ben Bolch (@latbbolch) January 12, 2026\n\nIt was one of several moves the California Post sports staff made on Monday.\n\nVincent Bonsignore, who had covered the Las Vegas Raiders the previous six years for the Las Vegas Review-Journal and had spent nearly two decades covering Los Angeles sports for the Southern California News Group, joined the Post as a senior NFL columnist.\n\nCareer news: After 6 amazing years covering the @Raiders for the Review-Journal, I am joining the new sports team at @capostsports under the leadership of @Ryan_Kostecka as a senior NFL columnist. I start next week.

Duarte (@michaeljduarte) January 12, 2026\n\nCharly Hill, who graduated from Miami in 2024 and has interned and freelanced at Bleacher Report, TNT Sports and NBC, joined as a sports content creator.\n\nI’m not typically active on Twitter, but that’s all about to change with my new role at the California Post as a Sports Content Creator\n\nSo excited to be a part of what’s shaping up to be an incredible year for California sports! pic.twitter.com/EOieGODH0b\n\n— charly d (@charlydyannhill) January 8, 2026\n\nBolch, who has covered UCLA athletics for the Los Angeles Times for more than a decade and spent 26 years at the paper overall, becomes the latest high-profile addition for the California Post, which has aggressively targeted established Southern California journalists to anchor its coverage.\n\nHis move follows the recent exits of former Los Angeles Times sports columnist Dylan Hernandez and Dodgers beat writer Jack Harris, who  announced last month they were joining the California Post.\n\nWith Bolch’s departure, the Los Angeles Times is now left with just nine full-time sports staff writers, a stark contraction for a paper that once boasted one of the deepest sports departments in the country.\n\nOutside of the editors, the Los Angeles Times sports staff is currently led by columnist Bill Plaschke, senior writers Bill Shaikin and Kevin Baxter, Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Broderick Turner on the Lakers, Ryan Kartje on USC, Gary Klein on the Rams, Sam Farmer on the Chargers and Eric Sondheimer on high schools.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was slated to have the second-largest contingent of sports staffers covering the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo behind NBC, which is the broadcast home of the Olympics, before the pandemic. The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

They’ve improved their rotation and upgraded at first base, especially defensively.\n\nWhat they haven’t done yet, however, is sign a Major League free agent two months into the offseason. After the Colorado Rockies signed veteran pitcher Michael Lorenzen to a one-year deal on Wednesday night, the Red Sox are now the only team that still hasn’t signed an MLB free agent this winter.\n\nGiven the team’s high payroll, goals and publicly expressed needs, that’s pretty shocking.\n\nIt’s not for a lack of trying. Boston made an offer to Pete Alonso before he signed with the Baltimore Orioles and has also made an “aggressive” offer to Alex Bregman. Time will tell if Bregman re-signs with the Red Sox, but there’s a good chance that he does.\n\nThe Red Sox are officially the only MLB club that has yet to sign a big-league free agent this offseason 😬 pic.twitter.com/c3ePQSL52Z\n\n— NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSBoston) January 8, 2026\n\nThose are big moves, however, and big moves don’t usually happen overnight. It’s more surprising that Boston hasn’t at least done a one-year deal for a reliever or depth player, who are much more plentiful and easier to sign.\n\nSpring Training is five weeks away, so there’s still time. Craig Breslow has a reputation for being patient and deliberate, and he hasn’t proven to be the kind of executive who recklessly throws money around. He has a plan, and he sticks to it.\n\nThe Red Sox have managed to make several good additions so far without spending any money in free agency. If they want someone like Bregman or Bo Bichette, however, that will have to change.\n\nYankees Predicted To Sign Former NL MVP While Red Sox Eye Different Free Agent",

    "title": "A Facebook veteran took a big career risk that resulted in a 'giant failure' — but embracing a 'J-curve' career path paid off",
    "description": "Molly Graham, former Facebook and Google executive, shares how a risky career move and embracing a J-shaped career path grew her expertise.",
    "fullText": "At 25 years old, Molly Graham was thriving in Facebook's HR department when a senior executive urged her to transfer out of her stable role and help build a mobile phone instead.\n\nShe took the risk — and it could have derailed her career.\n\nBut Graham, who later became a C-suite executive at some of America's biggest companies and philanthropies, now views that risky bet as one of the most important moves she ever made.\n\n\"It just felt like falling off a cliff,\" Graham, now the founder of Glue Club, said in a recent interview on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast. \"Taking risks, accepting the terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it.\"\n\nGraham described the experience as part of what she calls the \"J-curve\" — a career trajectory where a risky move leads to an initial drop before eventually producing outsized gains. Visually, she describes it as standing on a ledge, stepping off, sinking briefly, and then rising far higher than where you started — just like the shape of the letter J.\n\nThe concept, which she has also written about in her Lessons Substack, challenges the idea of a steady career ladder that steadily moves up and to the right.\n\nInstead of climbing rung by rung with promotions every two to five years, Graham argues that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from jumping into roles you aren't ready for and surviving any setbacks.\n\nGraham's own J-curve began when billionaire investor and \"All-in\" podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya, then Facebook's vice president of growth, recruited her to help develop a smartphone, encouraging her to make the move by sketching out the J-shaped trajectory on a whiteboard.\n\nHe brought her on despite her having no experience in product development, dropping her into rooms filled with engineers and phone specialists with deep subject matter expertise. She recalled feeling like an \"idiot\" for much of her first six months.\n\nAt her midyear review, Palihapitiya delivered what Graham called the worst performance evaluation she had ever received. But the new experience eventually expanded her expertise.\n\n\"Slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I like drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone, trying to explain to him kind of like why something he wanted to do was not possible,\" Graham said. \"And I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, 'Oh like I actually know things.' And slowly then over the following three years I became an expert in mobile.\"\n\nPalihapitiya did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"The phone itself was a giant failure — a massive, costly failure for Facebook,\" Graham told Rachitsky on the podcast. \"But it was not a failure for me.\"\n\nShe credits the experience with teaching her that she could operate far outside her comfort zone — a lesson that later helped her take on senior leadership roles, including serving as COO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million, and overseeing operations at the $7.4 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nThe J-curve, Graham said, is especially common at fast-moving companies like Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and SpaceX, where leaders value employees who are willing to take big risks early and learn quickly. In those environments, proving adaptability can matter more than checking every qualification box.\n\nNot everyone supported Graham's decision at the time. She said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, then the number two at the tech giant, advised against the move — as did her father.\n\n\"When wiser, more experienced people questioned the job offer, it definitely made me pause,\" Graham told Business Insider in a follow-up email. \"But my gut felt really strongly that I needed to take the risk.\"\n\nThat instinct, she said, ultimately helped her discover what kind of work she didn't want to do, and where her strengths lay. She didn't want to sift through mock ups of hardware design and argue about a button's placement. Instead, she sharpened her management skills and prepared to help lead large organizations.\n\n\"The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs,\" Graham told Rachitsky. \"They can take you to places that you never could have imagined.\"",

    "fullText": "USC has beefed up its defensive line room once again, landing Penn State defensive end transfer Zuriah Fisher out of the NCAA Transfer Portal.\n\nFisher, a fifth-year redshirt senior, appeared in 11 games this season for the Nittany Lions and had his best statistical season yet. The 6-foot-3, 265-pounder totaled 19 tackles, 3.5 TFLs and a pair of sacks while also forcing a fumble.\n\n“I think internally within our program, I think there is a lot of confidence that Fish has got a chance to have a big year,” former head coach James Franklin said of Fisher prior to this season. “He’s like one of those guys that I don’t think anybody’s talking about right now, outside of the program, based on just not seeing him recently, but there’s a lot of excitement internally, with our players, with our staff. I think those things are really apparent.”\n\nThat came after sitting out the 2024 campaign due to injury, giving him a medical redshirt that season. In 2023, Fisher played in all 13 of the team’s games, notching 16 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and three sacks. Prior to that, he appeared in 10 games over his first three seasons with PSU.\n\nA member of the Class of 2020, he is expected to have one year of eligibility remaining with the Trojans. As a high schooler, Fisher was a four-star prospect and tabbed as the nation’s No. 320 overall recruit and No. 20 EDGE in his class.\n\nNow, after finishing his sixth year at the college level this fall, he’ll look for a breakout opportunity in Los Angeles. The Trojans are expected to bring back their top three pass rushers in underclassmen Kameryn Crawford, Jide Abasiri and Braylan Shelby.\n\nThe young trio totaled 13.5 sacks last season, and USC also brings in one of the nation’s premier defensive end recruits in five-star Luke Wafle. With so much young talent, a veteran presence like Fisher could elevate the Trojans into one of the best pass-rushing groups in the country next year.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots went to battle last Sunday with a limited wide receiver room.\n\nVeteran pass catcher Mack Hollins missed his second consecutive game. Hollins went on the injured reserve after an injury suffered in Week 16. He will be on the sideline until at least the AFC Conference Championship Game.\n\nUndrafted rookie receiver Efton Chism III played in 44% of the offense’s snaps against the Miami Dolphins, just one week after logging a career-high 41 snaps played in the blowout win over the New York Jets.\n\nChism was the team’s sixth receiver all season, but has had to step up in Hollins’ absence.\n\nAs such, there is room for one more receiver on New England’s practice squad as a post-season insurance policy.\n\nThe Patriots hosted two free-agent wide receivers on Tuesday to potentially fill this vacancy, ESPN’s Mike Reiss reported on X.\n\nThe first was former Division II standout Cole Burgess. Burgess recorded 3,133 yards in his four-year career for the Cortland Red Dragons. He tallied 87 receptions for 1,375 yards and 16 touchdowns as a senior. He has spent the last two seasons on the Cincinnati Bengals’ practice squad.\n\nThe other receiver is the New York Jets undrafted free agent rookie signing Dymere Miller. Miller was a practice squad player for the Patriots’ AFC East rival, and he, too, took a unique route to the NFL.\n\nHe began his college career playing for FCS Monmouth in New Jersey. In his third year at Monmouth, he was a Walter Payton Award finalist (the FCS version of the Heisman Trophy). In that historic season, he set school records for single-season receptions with 90, single-season receiving yards with 1,293 and a single-game record when he recorded 333 receiving yards in a loss to UNH.\n\nMiller then transferred to Rutgers, where he played a more than respectable senior season that earned him a spot on an NFL roster.\n\nNo signings have been made, but the Patriots have remained diligent in pursuing potential roster-strengthening opportunities.\n\nPatriots Rumors: Assistant To Interview For Head Coaching Vacancy",

According to The Advocate's Wilson Alexander, the Tigers are signing former Boise State safety Ty Benefield.\n\nBenefield is one of the top safeties in the portal. Per 247Sports, Benefield is the No. 33-ranked player available. The On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings consider Benefield top-10 at his position.\n\nBenefield brings a wealth of experience to LSU's defense, playing over 2,000 snaps in three years at Boise State. In 2025, he made 80 tackles and recorded 30 stops to go along with two interceptions and three pressures. In his career, he's racked up 71 stops, five interceptions, two forced fumbles, 15 pressures, and three sacks.\n\nBenefield is versatile. LSU returns TaMarcus Cooley and Da'Shawn Spears at safety, but LSU DC Blake Baker likes to play three safeties in his dime package. We could see Benefield assume the STAR role if LSU opts to play a traditional defensive back in that position with Harold Perkins off to the NFL.\n\nLSU is signing Boise State transfer safety Ty Benefield, a source confirmed with @theadvocatebr.

    "description": "Are the Phillies exploring other options to bringing back the veteran catcher?",
    "fullText": "When the offseason began, it seemed that it was a given that J.T. Realmuto would return to the Phillies. While he was a free agent able to sign with any team he chose, it seemed like he wanted to return to Philadelphia, and the Phillies wanted him back.\n\nBut we’ve reached January, and Realmuto has yet to re-sign. And then, a few days ago, there were rumors that the Phillies were interested in free agent infielder Bo Bichette. According to Scott Lauber, if the Phillies signed Bichette, there wouldn’t be room in the budget for Realmuto, and they’d have to seek other options at catcher.\n\nIf the #Phillies & JT Realmuto aren’t able to come to an agreement, @PhillyInquirer Scott Lauber (@ScottLauber) says the following could be options.\n\nLauber says a #Phillies reunion with JT Realmuto is still the likeliest scenario. pic.twitter.com/rZ8DJlGZlM\n\n— Alex Coll (@Alexcoll_) January 3, 2026\n\nBichette would be a sizable upgrade over Alec Bohm at third base. The two-time All-Star will be 28 next season and is coming off a year where he had an .840 OPS. His right-handed bat would fit nicely in the top of the Phillies’ order with Trea Turner, Bryce Harper, and Kyle Schwarber.\n\nThe question is: How much of a downgrade would the Realmuto replacements be at catcher?\n\nIt isn’t clear how good Realmuto himself will be over the next few seasons. Realmuto is still good defensively – although not as good as in his Gold Glove-winning prime – but offensively, he’s steadily progressed from “good hitter” to “good hitter for a catcher” to “good enough hitter for a good defensive catcher.” (.700 OPS with 12 home runs in 2025.) At age 35, with a lot of innings under his belt, it’s hard to see that trend reversing significantly.\n\nPart of the reason it seemed like Realmuto was destined to return was because there was a dearth of options to replace him. Rafael Marchan hasn’t shown he can stay healthy for a full season and hit poorly in his 118 plate appearances last season. The best free agent option appears to Victor Caratini, who is a solid hitter, but entering his age 32 season, has only played more than 100 games in a season twice. (One of those coming last year.) It’s possible that a tandem of Caratini and Marchan could be viable, but certainly not a given.\n\nPivot off of Jt Realmuto, go sign Victor Caratini for much less…\n\nCaratini in 2025:\n.259/.324/.404 (.728 OPS)\n12 HRs\n46 RBIs\n105 wRC+\n0.8 fWAR\n\nRealmuto in 2025:\n.257/.315/.384 (.700 OPS)\n12 HRs\n52 RBIs\n94 wRC+\n2.1 fWAR\n\nAre you in on Victor Caratini?#RingTheBell pic.twitter.com/OhYywhlvP1\n\n— SleeperPhillies (@SleeperPhillies) December 28, 2025\n\nAs far as trades go, Adley Rutschman is the biggest name thought to be available, but there are questions with him as well. His offensive numbers have taken a severe downturn the past two years, and he was downright bad at the plate for much of 2025.\n\nTrade Target Review:\n\nOrioles C Adley Rutschman\n\n2025 Stats (90 Games):\n.220/.307/.366 (.673 OPS)\n1.9 WAR\n92 wRC+\n.334 xwOBA\n9 HRs\n29 RBIs#RingTheBell pic.twitter.com/4sNIu27TQt\n\n— SleeperPhillies (@SleeperPhillies) November 14, 2025\n\nAdditionally, the Phillies might not have the trade capital to get him. If they signed Bichette, they’d be theoretically more willing to trade prospect Aidan Miller, but the Orioles appear pretty set in the infield at the moment and might not value Miller that highly. And Andrew Painter would be a high price to pay for a player coming off a poor season.\n\nWhile this is all fun to discuss, I think this is largely just a case of agents and teams trying to improve their positions via the media. Bichette’s agent wants teams to think that the Phillies are interested to put more pressure on his other more likely suitors. And the Phillies are happy to play into it, to put more pressure on Realmuto to just re-sign with them already before they pivot to other options.\n\nIn the end, I’d say the most likely scenario is that Bichette signs elsewhere, and the Phillies and Realmuto compromise on a two-to-three-year contract. But until that actually happens, expect to read more speculation from media members about the Phillies’ potential alternative plans.",

    "title": "After getting laid off from a corporate job, I started bartending — and it changed my approach to office work",
    "description": "Marketing veteran Julie Levin briefly turned to bartending after being laid off. The experience changed her approach to corporate work.",
    "fullText": "After getting laid off in 2023, marketing veteran Julie Levin worked part time as a bartender for about six months as she considered her next steps. Levin is now the head of brand partnerships at Two Things, a New York City consultancy specializing in business transformations. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI moved across the country from LA to the New York area in 2022 for a really exciting job that I thought would mark the next phase of my career. But in 2023, there was a lot going on in the marketing industry, and I was laid off.\n\nIt was a setback I hadn't anticipated. It really called into question what was next for me. It's a scary place to be.\n\nI started doing some consulting, but I also wanted to be thoughtful and take time to calibrate. That's why I added bartending, which I'd done in college, into the mix. I thought it would be a way to have fun during a stressful time and make some extra money. It taught more lessons than I bargained for, in the best of ways.\n\nI had bartended at this place during the summer in college, when it was a dive. It's now fine dining with proper mixology. That meant it wasn't pouring beers and shots and easy high-balls. It was complex drinks. Not only did we have to follow the recipe for them at a high volume, but we were expected to create drinks.\n\nThere's nothing more humbling than getting behind the bar, because my corporate success wasn't relevant. The idea of not hiding behind a title was illuminating.\n\nI've always had a good work ethic, but bartending is next level. It's not just physical. There is an emotional element to it. Being behind that bar, engaging with people, and stripping away any artifice and pretense — it's a really cool thing.\n\nThere is this expectation, when you hear about people who bartend at a place like that, that you're going to walk out with 1,500 bucks every time. That's not true. It's really hard in the service industry. Bartending also shows you how good you have it in the corporate world.\n\nWhen I was bartending, there was an \"aha\" moment, and it was completely attitudinal. It's about getting more flies with honey. I think I was a late-bloomer in this sense — it didn't really dawn on me until I was behind the bar.\n\nThere were people who were full-time bartenders. When they were in a bad mood, they brought it with them. Meanwhile, you're this customer paying $20-plus a cocktail, just looking to have a nice time. You've got this surly bartender who acts like they're doing you a favor.\n\nInitially, I wanted to be part of things, and I'd complain alongside them. Then I was like, \"Wait a second. This is ridiculous. Put a smile on your face.\"\n\nIt's not that easy to stand there for eight hours and sling complicated drinks. But be pleasant; be happy — that's not that heavy of a lift. The second I did that, everything changed. It actually became the fun experience I thought it would be.\n\nAll of a sudden, I set this new tone, and it was transformational. That is something I try to carry with me. Bring a good attitude, even if you don't feel like you want to, and the circumstances suck, and your manager is the worst.\n\nPeople would be like, \"You're such a good bartender.\" The truth is, I wasn't that great. I was serviceable. Maybe, in time, I could have become amazing. But the attitude shift was infectious, and it made a huge difference.\n\nAfter bartending, I brought that spirit back to my team, and I got shout-outs all the time — not for the work I did, which I thought was pretty significant.\n\nThe praise largely came because I brought a positive attitude and a cheery spirit. No one would have said that about me for the first 20 years of my career. They would have said, \"She's really capable, really smart, but sometimes demanding and intense.\"\n\nPeople who lack the ability to roll up their sleeves and get in the weeds and also be nice to people — regardless of their title, or if they can do something for them — are going to have a really hard time.\n\nBartending forced me to rethink everything and see things that I wouldn't have seen, and enjoy every step of it, challenging and otherwise.\n\nIt teaches you the resilience and problem-solving capabilities to challenge yourself and be fearless. If you don't have those skill sets today, it's going to be hard for you to be successful.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "After a scare earlier this week, the Seahawks aren’t down to their undrafted rookie third-string left tackle, after all.\n\nJosh Jones was the starter in place of injured Charles Cross for the third consecutive week Saturday, in pregame drills about a half hour before Seattle kicked off at the San Francisco 49ers for the NFC West title.\n\nJones had been questionable to play. He missed practices Tuesday and Wednesday with ankle and knee issues. Coach Mike Macdonald said the veteran swing tackle had gotten “banged up a little” last weekend in the Seahawks’ win at Carolina.\n\nJones began trending toward playing when he practiced on a limited basis Thursday.\n\nThe team signed rookie free agent Amari Kight from the practice squad to the active roster earlier this week, as insurance. He was backing up Jones in pregame drills Saturday.\n\nMacdonald said Friday the Seahawks believe Cross will be able to play in their first playoff game. He’s been out since he injured his hamstring on Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal on the final play Dec. 14 against Indianapolis.\n\nThere were no surprises in Seattle’s inactive players for the game Saturday.\n\nThey were quarterback Jalen Milroe, injured starting safety Coby Bryant, linebacker Jared Ivey, Cross, rookie offensive linemen Bryce Cabledue and Mason Richman and rookie tight end Nick Kallerup.\n\nTy Okada was poised to start again for Bryant, who has a knee injury. It was to be Oakada’s 11th start the season. The first nine was when safety Julian Love was out injured.",

    "description": "Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo should be no stranger to upcoming open head coaching interviews.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, Indianapolis Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo is among the initial top interview candidates for the New York Giants current head coaching vacancy:\n\n“The first assignment is to find a new head coach. The Giants fired Brian Daboll almost eight weeks ago and named Mike Kafka the interim head coach,” writes Ranaan.\n\n“The team had a head start on compiling a list of candidates that includes former NFL head coach Mike McCarthy, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Raiders coach and Giants player Antonio Pierce and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, among others. Kafka will also be given an interview.”\n\nWhoever is ultimately hired in New York will replace Brian Daboll, who coached the Giants from 2022-25.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Anarumo has been linked to an NFL head coaching opening, as he’s previously been connected in-season as a top candidate for the Tennessee Titans vacancy through multiple league reports respectively.\n\nNicknamed the “Mad Scientist,” the 59-year-old veteran defensive coordinator has been lauded for his ability to tailor his defensive gameplans weekly to stopping the opposing competition, even giving the likes of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes some trouble in the past among other elite quarterbacks.\n\nIn his debut campaign with the Colts, there’s no question that Anarumo has been a significant upgrade to his Colts veteran defensive coordinator predecessor Gus Bradley.\n\nWhen healthy and going right, the Colts had a formidable unit this season.\n\nThat being said, after losing arguably the defense’s three best players down the season’s late stretch due to key injuries, namely to DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward, the Colts defense has since fallen on some hard times to close out this season. It no longer recently resembles the Top 10 defensive unit that it was for the majority of the 2025 campaign because of the loss of its best players.\n\nIt’s hard to win on defense in the NFL without your horses. Much less, there’s personnel issues with the Colts lack of consistent outside pass rush that go beyond Anarumo and key injuries down the final stretch.\n\nAnarumo has paid his coaching dues, has a track record of success, and is deserving of strong consideration for any NFL head coaching opening this upcoming offseason. However, it would be a real shame if he only gets to coach the Colts defense for one season. To me, he’s a top candidate to return in Indianapolis as defensive coordinator even in the rare case that Colts head coach Shane Steichen surprisingly doesn’t.\n\nGiven that we really didn’t see this unit fully together healthy upon Gardner’s arrival, Anarumo’s coaching best is still theoretically yet to come in Indianapolis—if we even get to see it again.",

    "description": "A viral TikTok video about retired United captain and USAF veteran Theresa Claiborne comes at a time when diversity in aviation is under threat.",
    "fullText": "When a TikTok video about her career racked up millions of views last year, 66-year-old retired airline pilot and military veteran Captain Theresa Claiborne suddenly became visible to a generation that had largely never heard of her.\n\nClaiborne has been an aviation trailblazer for decades. The Sacramento-raised aviator, who came from a military family, was commissioned as an Air Force second lieutenant in 1981 and soon became the service's first Black woman pilot.\n\nShe went on to primarily fly the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker before embarking on a decadeslong career at United Airlines that broke the white-male mold of who becomes an airline pilot.\n\nShe spoke to Business Insider at a time when efforts to boost diversity in aviation have come under threat, and when very few Black women pursue careers as pilots, despite a need for more aviators amid an ongoing industry shortage.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly blamed DEI policies for issues in roles like air traffic control and piloting, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has questioned whether military standards have been lowered to accommodate women.\n\nShortly after a January plane crash over Washington, DC, President Donald Trump suggested — without evidence — that DEI efforts may have been a factor. The NTSB made no mention of DEI in its preliminary report and has not yet published its final report that would include probable cause.\n\nClaiborne called this type of messaging \"damaging,\" saying women and people of color bring valuable skills to aviation. She said she hopes the spotlight on her career will boost confidence for aspiring pilots.\n\n\"No airline is going to hire people just because; there's too much responsibility,\" Claiborne said. \"I don't like the chatter we're seeing; I'm qualified and so is every other person in the flight deck — every last one of them.\"\n\nData from the online career platform Zippia, which is compiled from federal records, shows that only 7% of US airline pilots are women. Even fewer come from minority groups: 6.9% of commercial pilots are Latino or Hispanic, and only about 1 in 40 are Black. Roughly 82% are white.\n\nFewer than 150 Black women in the US hold an airline transport, commercial, military, or certified flight instructor pilot's license, according to the nonprofit organization co-founded by Claiborne in 2017 called Sisters of the Skies.\n\nThe group introduces young women of color to aviation and offers mentorship and scholarship opportunities.\n\nClaiborne said earning a spot in training was \"a hard road\" because, at the time, the male-dominated Air Force was accepting just 10 women a year as aviators. She was selected after the program was later expanded to allow up to 30 women.\n\n\"They were testing out women to see if we could handle it — not that we hadn't already done that in 1942 with the WASPs,\" she said, referring to the Women Airforce Service Pilots who flew non-combat missions during World War II.\n\nClaiborne said she completed a series of qualifying exams covering skills such as piloting and navigation before earning certification on the KC-135 refueling tanker.\n\nShe said she didn't know she would make history until shortly before — a reality that she said brought intense pressure but still felt like a \"pinch me\" moment.\n\nHowever, despite her rank and title, Claiborne said she often felt she had to prove herself each time she stepped onto the flight deck, adding that women — particularly Black women — were rarely given the same benefit of the doubt as their white male counterparts.\n\n\"There's always going to be some bias,\" Claiborne said. \"But if you don't give them a reason to think we can't cut the mustard, then they'd have to look deep to find it.\"\n\nAs of May 2024, there were about 700 female pilots in the USAF, according to the service. The USAF did not immediately respond to a request for 2025 data.\n\nClaiborne left active duty in 1988 and continued her military career in the Air Force Reserves, serving as a flight commander and KC-135 instructor pilot before retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 2003.\n\nShe maintained her reserve status even after joining United.\n\nClaiborne joined United in 1990 as a flight engineer on the Boeing 727 trijet. At the time, she was one of just a few Black women pilots at the company. She retired in May 2024 as a captain on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.\n\n\"When I retired, I wanted there to be at least 10 women who look like me at United, and we've accomplished that,\" she said. \"If you can see it, you can be it.\"\n\nClaiborne flew nearly every major Boeing passenger jet during her time at United — the 737, 747, 757, and 767 — with long-haul routes taking her to almost every corner of the globe. She described it as a rewarding career that was made possible by her military experience.\n\nClaiborne said that, for her, the transition from the USAF to commercial aviation was smooth skill-wise because she already had experience flying \"heavy\" aircraft in the KC-135, meaning those with hefty payloads, and could handle other big Boeing planes.\n\nThe largest plane she flew — which she said was also her favorite — was the mammoth Boeing 747 double-decker: \"I'm five feet two, so people would ask me, 'How do you fly such a big airplane?'\" Claiborne said. \"You trim it; I would fly with my fingertips.\"\n\nTrimming refers to adjusting an aircraft's control surfaces so it maintains a steady flight path without requiring constant pressure on the controls from the pilot.\n\nWhile the technical skills carried over, Claiborne said her mission dramatically changed.\n\nAt United, the job was to fly passengers safely from point A to point B. While still requiring a niche skill set, she said the work was less complex than Air Force missions that could involve a wide range of logistical and operational objectives, including combat.\n\nClaiborne also said airline pay was higher.\n\nWhile salaries were lower in the 1990s when she started, United 787 captains — the position where Claiborne ended her career — start at about $426 an hour under the current pilot union contract. That figure does not include per diem or additional pay opportunities, like on holidays.\n\nShe added that her responsibilities largely ended once the aircraft was shut down. Aside from the occasional safety report, she said she no longer brought home the volume of paperwork required in the military, like post-flight performance evaluations and other operational reports.\n\nCulturally, however, some challenges remained.\n\n\"People would look at me as a Black woman and think, 'How did she get here?' — I got here the same way everyone else did: I'm qualified; I passed the tests,\" Claiborne said. \"I tell young women to just be the best they can be and to fly a good airplane.\"",

    "description": "Dallas will need to bolster the backfield over the offseason.",
    "fullText": "Cowboys listed as ideal landing spot for veteran running back in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter missing out on postseason play for a second consecutive season, the Dallas Cowboys will have some major questions to answer over the offseason, including what they plan to do at the running back position.\n\nThe Cowboys got some surprisingly productive play from Javonte Williams this season. The fifth-year back has started in all 16 games for Dallas on the current campaign and tallied 1,201 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He also has 35 receptions for 137 yards and two more TDs.\n\nUnfortunately for Dallas, Williams is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and his productive play over the course of the campaign may have elevated him out of the Cowboys’ price range, which would leave them seeking a replacement.\n\nThat’s where veteran back J.K. Dobbins could come in. Like Williams, Dobbins is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and he could prove to be a realistic, affordable target for Dallas.\n\nFor those reasons, the Cowboys were recently listed as an ideal landing spot for Dobbins by Alex Kay of Bleacher Report.\n\n“With Dobbins missing multiple games in all six of his NFL seasons—including all of the 2021 campaign and almost all of 2023—it'll be tough for him to earn any sort of long-term deal from a club,” Kay wrote. “… Dobbins will be well worth rolling the dice on for a cash-strapped club like the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMore Dallas Cowboys news: Dak Prescott explains why he wants to play in regular season finale for Cowboys\n\n\"The team could be priced out of retaining Javonte Williams and will want to make up that lost production by coming to terms on a cheap, incentive-laden deal with Dobbins.”\n\nWhen it comes to Dobbins, health has always been a consistent concern as he’s missed a chunk of time in each of the last four seasons. He started strong in Denver this season before eventually being placed on the IR with a foot injury. Prior to the injury though, Dobbins had a solid season for the Broncos, tallying 772 rushing yads and four touchdowns in 10 appearances.\n\nHe’s still just 27 years old, so he should still have plenty of gas left in the tank, as long as he can stay on the field. Given their other options, Dobbins could certainly be worth a flyer for the Cowboys, who could also look to add a running back in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft.",

    "fullText": "A Wall Street veteran warned jubilant silver traders to be careful after a searing rally in the precious metal's price — days before it went into reverse.\n\nWriting on X over the weekend, Peter Brandt congratulated those who've won big by betting on silver and platinum in recent months, but cautioned the market could quickly turn on them.\n\n\"Being right is fun,\" he wrote. \"But know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected. And tops come quickly when they come. And retracements are almost always full.\"\n\nEarly on Monday, the market did indeed turn. Silver breached $80 an ounce for the first time before falling to around $70 by the market's close. They rebounded 10% to around $78 on Tuesday. Silver futures have surged by over 150% this year.\n\nMonday's plunge followed a decision by exchange operator CME to raise margin requirements for trading various metals contracts, which forced traders to stump up more cash to place their bets.\n\nIf you are long Silver and/or Platinum, I say \"Well done.\"\nCongrats. Perhaps this is your first futures market trade. Being right is fun.\nBut know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected\nAnd tops come quickly when they come\nAnd retracements are almost always full pic.twitter.com/w32o9OuXKj\n\nBrandt, who's been trading commodities for nearly 50 years and has more than 840,000 followers on X, also struck a wary tone in a Monday afternoon post on X following silver's drop.\n\nHe wrote that in virtually every market cycle, even the \"stubborn bulls\" who've sworn they'll never sell inevitably reach a point where they \"no longer care if price goes to zero or a million, they have had enough pain and they want out.\"\n\nBrandt said he's \"not sure\" the silver market is there yet. \"Time will tell,\" he added.\n\nTrue story\nI've been through many many many huge bull market cycles in metals, grains, softs, livestock, alt coins, et al\nThere is a point when late-to-buy bulls swear that they will never get out -- that they will hang on even if price goes to zero\nIn almost every case the low…\n\nSilver, gold, and other precious metals have soared to new highs this year as falling interest rates have boosted their appeal relative to cash and bonds.\n\nSome traders have bought silver to gain exposure to the AI boom, as the metal is a key component in AI infrastructure, such as microchips and data centers. Because it conducts electricity well, it's used in circuit boards, switches, EVs, and batteries, which is also driving demand for the metal right now.\n\nInvestors have also piled into precious metals as hedges against geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty, which threatens to weaken currencies such as the dollar and weigh on other assets such as stocks.\n\nIn a separate post late Monday on X, Brandt defended his cautious attitude toward the silver rally, noting that he has been trading silver since it was priced below $4 an ounce in the 1970s and has traded as much as 200,000 ounces in a single order.\n\n\"Yet, I am jealous because there is an entire generation of Z babies trading on Silver on laptops from their mommy's basements that know everything there is to know about Silver,\" he posted, followed by a succession of laughing-while-crying emojis.\n\nBrandt also dismissed the idea that silver's price boom reflects a structural imbalance between supply and demand that will forestall any price decline.\n\n\"It has never been different,\" he wrote. \"Never will be. So enjoy it now.\"\n\n\"This price action has NOTHING to do with supply shortages,\" he wrote in another post. \"This now is a game of money.\"",

    "description": "A veteran of the agency claims he’s faced workplace discrimination due to his sexual orientation.",
    "fullText": "A veteran Washington State Patrol trooper claims he’s faced discrimination and hostility in the agency due to his sexual orientation — issues that reportedly reached a breaking point when WSP personnel created and circulated a demeaning video of him generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nCollin Overend Pearson, who’s a Pierce County resident and gay, alleges that he’s been subjected to “repeated instances of discriminatory and unconstitutional conduct by WSP and its officers” during nearly two decades of employment, according to a lawsuit filed Dec. 19 in Pierce County Superior Court.\n\nThe conduct has damaged his reputation, the complaint said.\n\nIn a statement Monday, WSP spokesperson Chris Loftis declined to comment on the allegations, citing the agency’s policy and practice regarding pending litigation.\n\n“The Washington State Patrol believes that all employees have the right to work in an environment where skills, abilities, and dignity are valued and that is free from bias, harassment, and intimidation,” Loftis said.\n\nPearson is assigned to WSP’s District 1, which covers Pierce and Thurston counties, according to attorney Mark Conrad, who’s representing Pearson.\n\nPrior to suing the state, which allegedly failed to take appropriate actions to curb the discrimination and hostility, Pearson filed a legal claim against it late last year that served as a notice for it to put an end to the bad behavior, Conrad said in an interview Monday.\n\n“Instead of stopping, the conduct escalated,” Conrad said.\n\nIn December, WSP personnel created an AI-generated video that depicted Pearson and another uniformed, male trooper kissing on a roadside, the lawsuit claims. A voiceover in the video states, “this is SWAT training, no homo,” — using a derogatory phrase that insinuates “homosexuality is inferior or insulting,” according to the suit.\n\nConrad said the video was circulated among troopers and appears real, which is what he believes makes it so damaging beyond it being plainly derogatory and intended to humiliate his client. The deepfake also showed that at least some WSP personnel feel emboldened to engage in conduct demeaning to LGBTQ+ employees, he said.\n\nIt was the last straw for Pearson, according to Conrad, who said his client had put much thought into a “very difficult” decision to sue. The lawsuit accuses the state, by and through the WSP, of discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy, and it seeks unspecified damages to be proven at trial as well as legal fees.\n\nDespite the personal nature of the claims within the complaint, it was important to Pearson that he step forward, including by using his full name and not just his initials in the public filing, “to ensure that other people don’t have to face the environment that he’s currently facing,” Conrad said.\n\n“This can’t be tolerated in the workplace,” he said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites other alleged instances of discrimination, including when Pearson’s job offer in Des Moines was rescinded after a WSP captain advised the chief of that police department against hiring him, and when WSP detectives investigated an anonymous complaint that accused Pearson of threatening patrons while working off-duty at a Tacoma gay bar.\n\nPearson never worked at the bar, according to Conrad, and the suit said the complainant’s claim against Pearson was deemed to be unfounded. Conrad said he didn’t know the reason why the WSP captain had interfered in Pearson’s career move, nor did he know the status of an internal complaint that Pearson had filed in response.\n\nIn one instance, when Pearson inadvertently missed work, the WSP reacted more strongly than it did in similar situations involving other troopers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPearson had been out sick for two days in December 2023 and overslept for a shift after his phone died. He didn’t notify his supervisor that he would miss work. A trooper was dispatched to Pearson’s home, where a man who was staying with Pearson answered the door and Pearson was awoken and interrogated by the trooper, according to the suit. Later that day, WSP personnel sent Ruston Police Department officers to conduct an additional check at the home, the suit said.\n\nThe missed workday prompted a formal months-long WSP investigation that involved outside agencies and included interviews with Pearson’s colleagues and scrutiny of his personal life, according to the suit. Ultimately, it was recommended Pearson be suspended for five days without pay for violations of “neglect of duty” and “use of alcohol — off duty,” the suit said.\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Washington State Patrol Troopers Association president Spike Unruh objected to the latter violation, arguing that WSP had unlawfully entered Pearson’s home without his consent, according to the suit.\n\n“Unruh also presented evidence that numerous troopers had previously overslept and were not subjected to home entry or similar treatment, and that it was not standard practice to involve outside agencies or conduct multiple home visits when a trooper failed to show for one workday,” the suit said.\n\nThe WSP’s probe “had effectively ‘outed’ Plaintiff’s sexuality to the entire (Office of Professional Standards) section, further compounding the emotional toll of the situation,” the suit said.\n\nIn August 2024, the WSP acknowledged that the entry into Pearson’s home was illegal and that no information obtained during that entry could be used against him, according to the suit, which said that the agency reclassified the off-duty alcohol violation as “undetermined.”",

    "fullText": "Dani Carvajal is about to enter the final six months of his contract at Real Madrid, leading to question marks about his future beyond this season.\n\nThe 33-year-old right-back’s recent trip to Qatar only served to fuel speculations that he might consider moving on in the summer to reunite with close friend, brother-in-law, and former teammate Joselu.\n\nSo far, there has been no move from the club’s side to initiate talks about an extension either, leading to major uncertainty over his future.\n\nHowever, according to AS, Carvajal’s future and continuity at Real Madrid beyond his current contract appears to be on track.\n\nIndeed, unlike Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who appear certain to leave, Carvajal can be relatively calm about his situation at Real Madrid, as he is seen as a ‘special case’.\n\nThe veteran right-back will turn 34 in January and has only been able to spend 445 minutes on the pitch over the past 15 months. And, so far, the club have not yet made a definitive decision on whether to offer him another year.\n\nSet to continue for one more year? (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, due to his authority and importance in the dressing room as club captain and because, what he still has left to offer on a sporting level, despite the uncertainty surrounding his physical condition, the odds are in favour of his staying.\n\nMoreover, Real Madrid are not searching for a new right-back and are focusing on other positions ahead of the summer.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold is still in the process of settling at the club, and using Federico Valverde as a right-back outside of emergency situations could once again provoke the Uruguayan’s displeasure.\n\nIn short, the current planning includes Carvajal as part of the project, especially as if he manages to halt his recent run of injuries and find continuity in 2026, he will further strengthen his case on the pitch.\n\nThe Real Madrid captain is working tirelessly to recover from his most recent serious physical problem, an issue in his knee which needed him to undergo arthroscopy in October.\n\nCarvajal is close to returning and could be included in the trip to Jeddah for the Spanish Super Cup. As for his continuity, it now seems more a matter of timing than of doubt.",

    "description": "Caleb Downs had to be reminded that he was getting ready for his sixth College Football Playoff game, which probably won’t be rare a decade from now but is unique in just the second year of the expanded 12-team format.",
    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — Caleb Downs had to be reminded that he was getting ready for his sixth College Football Playoff game, which probably won’t be rare a decade from now but is unique in just the second year of the expanded 12-team format.\n\nThe Ohio State safety smiled at the thought and figured it couldn’t hurt to have played in the CFP as a freshman at Alabama, losing 27-20 to Michigan in overtime before transferring to the Wolverines’ biggest rival and winning four postseason games and a national championship with the Buckeyes a year ago.\n\n“That could be a positive, just knowing that I’ve been in this situation so many times,” said Downs, a two-time Associated Press All-American. “At the end of the day, it’s not about me. It’s about everybody else feeling confident during the game. Really just trying to push that to all my teammates.”\n\nHe’s talking younger teammates such as freshman Devin Sanchez, a backup cornerback who has tried to imagine the nerves and emotions in the hours before kickoff in a Cotton Bowl quarterfinal against No. 10 Miami.\n\nThe Hurricanes (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) are first-time CFP qualifiers, but got a start on those nerves with the 10-3 first-round victory at Texas A&M on Dec. 20.\n\nThe third-ranked Buckeyes (12-1, CFP No. 2) got a first-round bye despite losing to top-ranked Indiana in the Big Ten championship game.\n\n“Lean on them a lot, more than you think,” Sanchez said. “They’re guys that have been here a lot of times, a couple of guys have been to the Cotton Bowl for the third straight year in a row. So this is not a new place for them. As a new guy, there’s nothing I can do but lean on them. The speed will be a little different. The intensity will be up a little bit more. Just lean on those guys, and when my number’s called just be able to go out there and make sure that they trust me to be out there.”\n\nDowns remembers the nerves from his CFP debut with the Crimson Tide. He was in the Rose Bowl, a spectacle he had seen on TV as a kid.\n\n“That was probably the biggest game I had played at the time,” said Downs, one of the top players in the 2024 portal as the first freshman to lead the storied Alabama program in tackles. “Knowing that, it was a little bit of nerves.”\n\nThe Buckeyes were in the Cotton Bowl for last season’s semifinals, beating Texas 28-14 after comfortable wins over Tennessee at home and No. 1 Oregon in a Rose Bowl quarterfinal.\n\nDowns found a way to leave the Rose Bowl with a better feeling. Now he’ll be back on the field where he intercepted Texas’ Quinn Ewers almost a year ago, in what will be his 44th game in just three seasons.\n\n“I think just in general with Caleb, just the amount of experience he has playing football is probably the most important thing,” first-year defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said. “His professionalism and how he prepares is probably the best example that I can point to for all the players.”\n\nDowns, a projected first-round pick should he decide to enter the NFL draft in April, isn’t the only experienced defensive back. Davison Igbinosun and Jermaine Matthews Jr., the starting cornerbacks in front of Sanchez, have been around awhile.\n\nIgbinosun was on the 2023 Ohio State team that also played in the Cotton Bowl, a 14-3 loss to Missouri after missing out on the last four-team playoff.\n\nA year later, Downs was with him, believing the experience of being in the playoff didn’t matter as much as losing in the playoff.\n\n“It definitely added a little bit of fuel to the fire because I lost my freshman year,” Downs said. “It made me want to come back and play better. I think that was a lot of what everybody else on the team felt because they didn’t have the success they wanted to earlier in their career. I think that was a hungry team. And we’ve got to be the same way this year.”",

    "description": "A US Navy special operations veteran told BI that ground robots are helpful, but it's best to have more cheap one than fewer expensive ones.",
    "fullText": "With drones always buzzing overhead, ready to dive bomb soldiers or relay targeting data to an artillery gun crew, it can be far too dangerous to send a human being to rescue the wounded, so Ukraine is turning to robots to evacuate injured troops.\n\nA US veteran in Ukraine who saw them in action told Business Insider they're effective — and said Ukraine is right to keep them simple and cheap, given that many may not make it back.\n\nUkraine is using a growing number of ground robots, a kind of drone, to combat Russia's invasion by carrying supplies, acting as bombs, and evacuating injured soldiers.\n\nMany of these systems come from Ukrainian companies and manufacturers located within Ukraine's European partners. It's technology that militaries are increasingly paying attention to, seeing it as a solution that could save lives on the modern battlefield, though across NATO and Western forces, the focus is mainly on doctrine, testing, and prototyping.\n\nEven in Ukraine, uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) only make up a small fraction of the drones in use in battle.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is now helping out a nonprofit in Ukraine. He told Business Insider that using ground robots for casualty evacuation isn't perfect, but it's useful. He said that the West should take note but avoid overengineering or overspending on these kinds of systems.\n\nThe robots are \"not always a success, but at least it's something,\" he said.\n\nThe casualty evacuation robots function like remote-controlled stretchers, but rescuing wounded troops is far from foolproof: with so many drones overhead, they're easy to spot — and just as easy to attack.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have pointed to the limits of ground robots in evacuating the wounded, noting that while they can be a lifeline for a wounded soldier when it is too unsafe for their comrades to come get them, they can be jammed, they break down, and they can be targeted just like anything else moving in battle.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, head of robotic systems for the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that they are a last resort tool because a wounded soldier could wind up in \"an even worse situation.\"\n\nThey are a \"last hope kind of thing,\" Wells explained. \"And that shouldn't cost a lot of money and should be something that's easily developed, replaced, and deployed.\"\n\nWells' work in Ukraine aims to help civilians survive the war. He is there with Task Force Antal, a nonprofit organization run by US veterans that provides medical training, supplies, and evacuation support to civilians, especially in front-line areas.\n\nHe said that the evacuation robots don't need to be flawless technology — the tech is evolving so fast that whatever works today may well be redesigned next week anyway. What matters, he said, is getting something usable into the field now, because saving lives outranks engineering elegance.\n\nWells said the robot he saw in action was \"low tech\" but got the job done, explaining that he would rather have 10 robots worth $1,000 than one that was more advanced and worth $100,000.\n\n\"You kind of just need something that's effective, essentially a stretcher with wheels that gives hope to the person that's injured.\" It doesn't need to be more complicated than that.\n\nIn talks with Business Insider, Ukrainian soldiers, foreign volunteers, and arms makers have emphasized key lessons for the West: prioritize more cheap systems over a few exquisite ones, don’t pour money into technology that may quickly become obsolete, and resist the urge to overengineer and overspend on gear meant for a battlefield that changes every week.\n\nWhen it comes to robots for evacuation, Wells said that the best thing is to keep technology cheap and expendable so troops don't think they \"have to use this because it costs so much money.\"",

    "description": "Should the New York Jets consider bringing in another veteran bridge quarterback this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on season-ending IR earlier this week. It all but guarantees the end of Fields' disappointing tenure in East Rutherford. The Jets could release him this offseason and absorb a $22 million dead cap charge by doing so.\n\nDespite the somewhat sizable financial penalty, Fields' pending release feels like a foregone conclusion. Fellow veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor is on an expiring contract. Taylor probably won't be back with the Jets in 2026 either.\n\nGeneral manager Darren Mougey will be tasked with acquiring at least one, maybe two, quarterbacks this offseason. Currently equipped with two first-round selections in the 2026 NFL draft (and three more in 2027), the Jets could target a quarterback in this year's class like Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore. With the Jets currently slated to pick 4th and 18th overall, that may require a slight but aggressive move up the draft order.\n\nMougey should also consider bringing in another bridge quarterback. Right now, there's no guaranteeing the Jets end up with Mendoza or Moore. Even if they do, an experienced mentor could accelerate their development.\n\nIn recent memory, rookie quarterbacks who enjoyed immediate success were experienced college quarterbacks. Jayden Daniels, Bo Nix, Cam Ward, and Tyler Shough were multi-year starters. Other successful NFL quarterbacks like Justin Herbert, Drake Maye, and Jordan Love weren't Week 1 starters, and in Love's case, sat for multiple seasons.\n\nMendoza has 945 career collegiate passing attempts (and counting). Moore is a first-year starter. Not making comparisons, but recent draft picks who busted like Zach Wilson (sorry, Jets fans) and Trey Lance were inexperienced and asked to do too much right away.\n\nKyler Murray, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith (imagine that, ha) are among the veteran quarterbacks expected to be available this offseason. Murray and Tagovailoa may not be \"bridge\" options by definition based on the financial commitment needed. But someone like Jacoby Brissett or Malik Willis would be an upgrade on Fields/Taylor while buying the Jets time to develop a rookie quarterback, or draft one in 2027 instead of 2026.\n\nMougey has big decisions to make this offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Should the Jets consider bringing in another bridge QB this offseason?",

    "description": "The Golden State Warriors veteran forward has offered to come off the bench if it helps the team",
    "fullText": "The Golden State Warriors are still searching for the right combination of talent, both in the starting lineup and off the bench. Steve Kerr's job has been made harder by the team's brutal schedule to start the season and the string f injuries throughout the roster. As such, we're yet to see what the Warriors can do when they're working with a sustained period of health.\n\nNevertheless, Kerr and his veteran leaders are undoubtedly looking for ways to help give the team a boost. According to Kerr, speaking at a post-practice news conference, Draymond Green has offered to come off the bench if the coaching staff believes it will give the team the balance it needs. Kerr, however, is not currently looking to make that change.\n\n“He told me, this year, ‘I'll go to the bench if you need me to.’ I know what Draymond is about,\" Kerr said. \"He's about winning...That's not even a consideration for me right now,” he said, “Because I'm really excited about this starting lineup: Steph, Draymond, Moses (Moody), (Quinten Post), Jimmy, I think it's a great starting lineup for us, because we get the size and shooting of Quentin next to Dray, which takes the pressure off of him. And Dre is at his best next to Steph. He should play most of his minutes with Steph. Those two guys are incredible together.\"\n\nGreen has struggled on offense this season. He's got more personal fouls than he does made field goals. However, he's still an integral part of the starting lineup and is operating as the team's primary playmaker. Furthermore, his defensive IQ and ability to quarterback a defense provide an important leadership dynamic that helps set a tone to begin the game.\n\nNevertheless, if the Warriors continue to struggle building momentum, Kerr may look to experiment with different roster combinations in the future, and there is always the potential for Green to move into a second unit role later in the year.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Steve Kerr reveals selfless offer from Draymond Green",

    "fullText": "An especially introspective Steve Kerr told reporters Wednesday that there's beauty in the struggle while he reflected on the state of his Golden State Warriors and the blowup he had with Draymond Green during the third quarter of a 120-97 win over the Orlando Magic two days earlier.\n\nKerr and Green were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout Monday night. After an animated exchange, Green decided to remove himself and left for the Chase Center locker rooms.\n\nAlthough he eventually returned to the bench, he didn't check back into the game.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nKerr said he and his do-it-all forward had a \"great chat\" Wednesday. The longtime Warriors head coach said he and Green apologized to each other as well as to the team.\n\nKerr explained that it was not his finest hour, nor was it a good look for his group.\n\n\"That was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange,\" Kerr said Wednesday.\n\n\"These things, they happen, especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"\n\nKerr added: \"I care so much about Draymond, and the relationship we have is like family. And like family, you go through ups and downs. And my No. 1 goal honestly is for him to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting — metaphorically, not literally — and competing together until we're both gone. And I believe that's going to happen because I believe in Draymond, and I believe in myself and I believe in everything we've built for 12 years.\"\n\nFull soundbite of Steve Kerr on the heated exchange with Draymond Green:\n\n“I regret my actions in that exchange and I apologized to Dray, he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\nKerr reflected on their 12 years of winning together, expressing his belief in Green. pic.twitter.com/xpWhHFwZoA\n\n— Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) December 24, 2025\n\nThe Warriors famously selected Green out of Michigan State with the 35th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 draft. Kerr has coached him from the 2014-15 season on. Since, Green has emerged as a four-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. Together, Kerr and Green have won four NBA championships.\n\nWhile Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and then Kevin Durant, consistently shot the lights out, Green has left his own mark on the organization: with defensive tenacity, heady court vision and physical rebounding, plus timely scoring.\n\n\"We have four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people have played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it. I don't think we have any without Draymond. That's how much he impacts winning.\n\n\"So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty. We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize.\"\n\nKerr cited a long history of turning negative moments into positive momentum during his relationship with Green, who Kerr described as \"very complex.\" While Green has racked up technical fouls and served his fair share of suspensions for outbursts during a 14-season NBA career, he's also known for his basketball acumen and his contemplative commentary.\n\n\"We've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result,\" Kerr said, via Warriors reporter Kenzo Fukuda.\n\nWith the win over the Magic, the Warriors improved to 15-15. They've won back-to-back games for the fifth time this season. But they've still yet to string together more than three victories in a row.\n\nThis version of Golden State is spearheaded by Curry, Green and Jimmy Butler III. They're all at least 35 years old. Butler is a Warriors transplant who helped spark a second-half run last season, which ended in the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in the first game of the series.\n\n\"Where we are as a team, as an organization, the most important thing for me is for guys to recognize that there's beauty in the struggle. There's beauty in what we're trying to accomplish right now,\" Kerr said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman.\n\n\"We are no longer the '17 Warriors, dominating the league. We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everyone knows that. So what is up to us? How do we carry ourselves night to night? How connected are we? And can we give ourselves another swing at the plate? We did that last year. I was really proud of the team last year. Despite the loss to Minnesota, injury to Steph. Who knows how long we would've gone? But we gave ourselves a chance. That's the goal here.\n\n\"We know where we are. We've got to know who we are, we've got to know what's possible, and we've got to take pride in the struggle, because this is part of life.\"\n\nKerr said he believes sorting out the tiff with Green has been a major step in this Warriors team working through its issues.\n\nHe sees an opportunity for Golden State to make another run like last year's.\n\nAs for Green, Kerr wants him to finish his career in a Warriors uniform.\n\n\"He's undyingly loyal and passionate, and I will go to bat for him as long as I'm coaching him here,\" Kerr said, per Emerman. \"Honestly, I'd go to bat for him 20 years from now when we haven't been together. That's how strongly I feel about him. And that's how I want this thing to end with us, whenever that is.\"",

    "fullText": "Chaim Bloom has made it a priority this offseason to strengthen the team’s pitching staff and depth as a primary goal. After trading veteran starting pitcher Sonny Gray to the Boston Red Sox before Thanksgiving and returning MLB-ready Richard Fitts and minor league upside starter Brandon Clarke, as well as the recent trade of First Basemen Willson Contreras, also to Boston, for Hunter Dobbins, Yhoiker Fajardo, and Blake Aita the front office continues to pursue pitching through trades and free agency. Even if all of the arms acquired this offseason don’t reach the major leagues thats okay because young controllable pitching is the single most sought-after commodity, and the surplus can be used to acquire and upgrade other areas of the roster that may be lacking when the time comes to compete once more. Other names on the block include Brendan Donovan, JoJo Romero, Lars Nootbaar, and Nolan Arenado.\n\nAfter trading away Ryan Helsley, Phil Maton, and Steven Matz at the deadline, non-tendering John King, and all but expecting JoJo Romero to be pitching elsewhere in 2026. Chaim Bloom has publicly spoken about a desire to have a veteran presence in the bullpen to help the young relievers mature as everyday big leaguers. From the outside, they view their pitch to prospective free agents as pointing towards Andrew Kittredge and Phil Maton and point out that if you come to St. Louis for a year, you can re-establish yourself to earn a larger payday where there are innings and opportunity aplenty! If/when JoJo Romero is traded away, the team will only have fringe 40-man arm Nick Raquet from the left side on the 40-man roster. The Cardinals could consider multiple left-handed options if that indeed comes to fruition.\n\nChaim Bloom has staunchly been against promoting players before they are fully ready to move up, which is why I don’t view Quinn Matthews, Brycen Mautz, Pete Hansen, Ixan Henderson, Liam Doyle, etc., as options for the bullpen at the beginning of the 2026 season. Matthews is still trying to master AAA, and none of the other four have even competed in Triple-A, so they don’t know how their stuff will perform with a new variable added to their situation, like pitching with the big league ball.\n\nWhen trying to scope out who could be a potential target or fit, we can look for clues in the profile of arms the team has already acquired under the new leadership’s guided focus. Going back to this year’s draft selecting Liam Doyle and Tanner Franklin, the trade deadline in acquiring Nate Dohm and Frank Ellisalt, the trade for Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke, or even their Rule 5 selection in Matt Pushard. High octane fastball’s appear to be the vogue guiding light for their player development group. Of course, I always bring names to the table. I would never leave you, the reader, without something to chew on or consider, so here are three names from the left side and the right side who bring one of a big fastball, veteran leadership/experience, or a combination of the two!\n\n2025 – 39 G 4.63 ERA 4.25 FIP 3.86 xFIP 32 K 35 IP\n\nBorucki will remind some fans of JoJo Romero as he throws his Slider 41% of the time as his primary pitch and produced a whiff% of 37.7. Overall, he had a .117/.229/.150 with a .188 wOBA against 70 LHB last season. His Sinker sits in the 93-94 range, which is plenty hard enough when batters are trying to decipher between that and an 85 MPH sweeping slider. The 10 MPH of separation between speeds works well to keep hitters off balance and produce some pretty ugly swings and misses. Borucki is probably one of the best available left-handers who offers the combination of stuff, performance, and experience left available on the open market.\n\n2025 – 19 G 8.31 ERA 5.77 FIP 5.18 xFIP 21 K 21.2 IP\n\nFor a pitcher with as much octane as Perez has, he strangely generates a whiff rate below 25%, which is just a little below league average. Perez IS however, a soft contact merchant. His Barrel rate of 2.9% and groundball rate of 60.9 % would both rank in the 99th percentile if he had a qualified number of innings pitched last season. The 16.4 BB% is the real kicker with Cionel, and I don’t know how you remedy that in my limited understanding of pitching mechanics, but perhaps the Cardinals would. Sitting at 95.6 MPH on average from his fastball, he certainly fits the “throws gas” north star the front office has established. .265/.390/.324 .331 wOBA against 43 LHB last season, you can clearly tell that the walks were what bit him. The .324 SLG is more than good enough if Perez can keep the ball in the zone. Busch will keep the ball in the park, and perhaps the Cardinals could catch lightning in a bottle as Perez would be a sought-after commodity with an additional year of club control accruing just over 4 years of service time so far at the deadline if the Cardinals can hone him in.\n\n2025 – 48 G 4.52 ERA 4.57 FIP 4.30 xFIP 53 K 67.2 IP\n\nI talked about Suter at the beginning of the offseason, and I believe his existence on the roster would still add a lot of value. Suter is a Harvard grad and can pitch multiple innings in relief; he can serve as an opener, and he would allow Manager Oli Marmol more flexibility with his bullpen usage. He’s one of the quickest workers in the big leagues, and that matters on 100-degree St. Louis days to keep players from baking in the sun. Suter would also fit PERFECTLY as the bullpen mentor as a reigning Clemente Award nominee. Those are all the “glue” reasons why Suter would fit. His under-the-hood metrics would make him almost the antithesis of our “North Star type.” But, while his average fastball velocity is in the 1st percentile at 87.9, his extension of 7.5 ft put him in the 99th percentile, which, as we know, increases perceived velocity and makes pitches appear to come out faster than they are because theyre being released so much closer than hitters are used to. His average exit velo against is 99th percentile at 85.8 mph, his BB% is low at 6.2%, his hard hit rate is 96th percentile at 32.9%, and he generates groundballs at a 45.4% clip. 18.2 K% is below average but not non-existent, as he’s a veteran who knows how to pitch and can get a strikeout when he needs one. There isn’t a whole lot of upside to be had in this profile, but when you value a Swiss Army knife type pitcher who can pitch in a variety of roles and situations thats valuable to a team with a young staff to help navigate and get through a full 162.\n\n2025 – 65 G 5.30 ERA 4.40 FIP 4.98 xFIP 58 K 56 IP\n\nImagine the flexibility that a roster that contained both Brent Suter and Ryne Stanek would provide! Stanek is a little bit like Cionel Perez in that his inability to throw strikes consistently in 2025 is what really hurt his overall numbers. Stanek can really step on the gas pedal with his average fastball velocity at 98.5 MPH, which had him in the 96th percentile. The 12.5 BB% doesn’t help things, and he’s a flyball pitcher – that CAN work, pitching your home games at Busch. Chaim had Stanek in Tampa Bay and knows just what he’s capable of, having experience pitching in a multitude of roles from opening to closing. Think of Ryan Helsley with Stanek. The fastball is hard but straight, but the slider is the true equalizer, generating an over 45% whiff rate! The numbers Stanek posted last season won’t get him big money this offseason, but he sure provides his next team a lot of tools to work with that could get the most out of him in 2026.\n\n2025 – 30 G 5.08 ERA 4.95 FIP 4.23 xFIP 28 K 33.2 IP\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Shawn Dubin that’s okay. Drafted in the 13th round of the 2018 draft, Dubin throws 6 unique pitches and could be similar to Kyle Leahy before Leahy broke out in 2025. Dubin limits hard contact, keeps the ball on the ground, but is below league average when it comes to strikeout stuff, generating swing and miss, and enticing batters to chase. Dubin is out of minor league options, so the flexibility is very limited, but he has 5 years of remaining control and could be signed to a minor league deal. If the Cardinals felt they could get a higher gear out of his stuff, then it’s possible they could find one of those late-blossoming gems to the already growing group of depth.\n\n2025 – 59 G 4.48 ERA 4.13 FIP 4.48 xFIP 58 K 60.1 IP\n\nRafael Montero will give Cardinals fans Carlos Martinez vibes for sure. Coming from a smaller stature and a whip-like arm motion, it’s very tsunami-esque, so is the erratic command at times. At 14.6 BB% in 2025, that part rings true. It’s 4 pitches that all have positive traits coming out of his hand, and his splitter was a +4 in run value last season to pair with a 95+ mph heater and an above-average breaking ball as well. Montero also has closing experience, with 30 saves credited to him from 2020-2023 as a closer by committee type situation in Houston before the arrival of Josh Hader. Command will always be the biggest question mark with Montero, but for the most part, the results are there, and the Cardinals could entice him with the potential to put him in late-game high-leverage/closing situations that could inevitably lead to a mid-season trade to a contender that would return more prospects to the Cardinals’ growing pipeline.\n\nAre any of these guys true difference makers in the grand scheme of things? Probably not. But the benefit of being in the situation the Cardinals are they can take swings on upside arms like Montero, Stanek, and Perez, but also benefit from veterans like Borucki and Suter, while also having the opportunity to give guys like Dubin a real shot at a big league roster spot. When doing some research on the free agent reliever market this weekend, these were the names remaining that stuck out to me the most, and the ones I think the Cardinals could buy low on and get really good value out of. Ultimately, what the team can accomplish on the trade market will tell the tale of what roster needs will remain heading into spring training, but be certain that more changes to the roster are coming – how soon is anyone’s guess at this point.",

Our young guys can learn a lot from him.”\n\n#Saints HC Kellen Moore on Taysom Hill:\n\n\"This league talks about trying to get Taysom Hills on your football team ... no one seems to be able to duplicate it.\" pic.twitter.com/JtZkkQWbVr\n\n— NOF (@nofnetwork) December 21, 2025\n\nIn Sunday’s game, Hill delivered an effort that was vintage Swiss Army Knife.\n\nHe led New Orleans in rushing, made plays from his tight end position and even threw a touchdown with under two minutes to play.\n\nThat score was something the Saints acknowledged they were trying to get for Hill, in case he doesn’t return.\n\nWhen he heard the team was trying to get Hill a touchdown, Olave made sure he was on the field at a point in the game when he didn’t need to be in the contest risking injury.\n\n“Definitely wanted to be a part of that, especially knowing they wanted to get Taysom a touchdown, so I wanted to be a part of that — a deep ball, too — so I definitely wanted to be in there,” Olave said.",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

    "title": "Democrats Just Won Seats in Mississippi. The Supreme Court Could Block a Repeat.",
    "description": "A veteran civil rights attorney won a landmark redistricting case. He fears such wins could soon vanish.",
    "fullText": "The beleaguered Voting Rights Act is on the ropes again — and it may soon suffer a crippling strike.\n\nThe Supreme Court seems on the verge of making it much harder to use the landmark civil rights measure to force states to draw districts where minority candidates stand a strong chance of winning. And a key provision that lets private groups sue under the 60-year-old law could be the next to fall.\n\nThat would be a huge blow to civil rights lawyers like Mississippi’s Carroll Rhodes, who’s spent his career leveraging the Voting Rights Act to increase the political power of Black people and other minorities.\n\n“It becomes almost an impossible hill to climb,” Rhodes told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the VRA has been battered by a series of hits from the increasingly conservative high court. In 2013, the justices knocked out a key pillar of the law by eliminating “pre-clearance” requirements for advance approval of voting changes, including redistricting, in most or all of nine states and a smattering of localities.\n\nIn recent months, petitions have stacked up at the Supreme Court that could lead to the justices wiping out the long-assumed right of private groups and individuals to bring lawsuits under the law. And, earlier this month, the high court blocked a lower court’s Voting Rights Act ruling and gave Texas a green light to redraw its congressional map at President Donald Trump’s request in order to give Republicans up to five additional House seats.\n\nDespite those challenges, litigators like Rhodes have had significant success harnessing the VRA. A lawsuit he pressed forced redistricting and a special election in Mississippi last month led to Black Democrats picking up two additional seats in the state’s House. The incremental gain broke a longstanding GOP supermajority in a state that is nearly 40 percent Black — the highest percentage in the nation. Those sorts of advances for minority representation could come to a halt if the Supreme Court rules against the law.\n\nI reached Rhodes at his law office in the small town of Hazelhurst, Miss. and asked him to take stock of the bruises the VRA has sustained, the threats it faces at the moment and how he’s managed to use the law to advance minority power in his home state.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act has taken a lot of major hits from the Supreme Court in the past couple decades. Many lawyers now see it as teetering on the brink of irrelevance or impotence. What are the stakes in the pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, and whether states doing redistricting can sometimes make use of race to comply with the VRA?\n\nSome people are concerned that the Voting Rights Act might be on its way out, but I'm an eternal optimist. Given that the Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress pursuant to the 15th Amendment, and the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote on an equal basis, not on account of race, to everyone — I think in the Callais case that they're going to resolve that issue in favor of [the law] being upheld.\n\nYou’ve had considerable success in Mississippi with the Voting Rights Act and the state legislature there. Does that confound perceptions that the VRA is at death’s door?\n\nWe have been successful. A lot of civil rights organizations and civil rights opponents have been successful in using the Voting Rights Act to increase the number of Black elected officials.\n\nIn Mississippi, for the most part, whites do not vote for Black candidates in contested elections, and that's why the Voting Rights Act has been so successful in creating Black majority districts.\n\nWhen you have a minority population that's large enough, concentrated enough, and they're in these election districts where they cannot elect candidates of their choice — because the majority population always votes against their candidates of choice — you have to redraw the districts in such a way so you give this large, geographically insular minority group the ability to elect the representative of their choice. And Mississippi's demographics have made it easier for us to be successful here.\n\nHas there been a concrete impact to this?\n\nThere was a time where we had 45 or 50 Black people elected from Black majority districts in the Mississippi Legislature. And there were Black chairmen of different committees, even the powerful committees. But what has happened over the years, more and more white Democrats have left the Democratic Party and gone toward the Republican Party, so now you have a [GOP] supermajority in the Senate. We broke that in this last election.\n\nWhen you break the supermajority in the Senate, money bills, especially taxing and spending, budget, a lot of times it takes a supermajority to get those bills passed. If there is no supermajority, then that means that the Republican leadership within the Senate will have to negotiate with most of the Black people elected as Democrats.\n\nHave those legislators been able to use this effective veto to actually get some spending concessions in terms of, “You're going to spend in this part of the state or on these types of programs?”\n\nWe won't know yet because the special election just took place, and the legislature comes back in January. So, we will see if this cohesive group of Black Democrats can get some concessions.\n\nIn 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the Shelby County decision, which ended the requirement that many states, including Mississippi, most places across the South and a few in the North, had to submit any voting changes — including redistricting — to the Justice Department to get approved. The maps that Mississippi adopted in 2022, which you successfully challenged in court, were they put in place initially because of the Shelby County decision?\n\nThey were able to do it directly because of Shelby County, yes. And John Roberts got it wrong. I agree with Justice Ginsburg who said at the time, it’s like standing up under the umbrella and it's not raining and saying, “Oh, it's not raining, so you can let the umbrella down.” That's what that Roberts decision did: took the umbrella down. And rain is falling everywhere.\n\nUnder the process essentially abandoned after Shelby County, the maps had to be submitted to Washington, and that took place under presidents both Republican and Democrat. The maps that you challenged, do you think President Obama's Justice Department would have approved them? What about President George W. Bush’s Justice Department or President Donald Trump’s Justice Department?\n\nThe Trump Justice Department would have approved them, but no other president. And I'm going to go back to Obama, Biden, Clinton, I'd even go back to Ronald Reagan. The strange thing is that Ronald Reagan initially was opposed to the Voting Rights Act extension in 1982 but wound up signing it and cited it as the crown jewel of American democracy. And so the Trump Justice Department probably is the only one, because the Trump Justice Department had flipped what the purpose of the Voting Rights Act was — to protect minority voters — to say it's to protect white voters.\n\nRoberts has been on the court now for 22 years. The first decade and a half or so, he was viewed uniformly as hostile to voting rights enforcement. That was seen as one of his animating issues. But there have been a few decisions in recent years where the court has not been as aggressive toward the Voting Rights Act as some expected. It seems like Roberts went along with this current Callais case being punted for a year, which basically left those districts in place through the current election cycle. Is there something going on with Roberts? Do you think he has shifted or moderated at all?\n\nMy personal take is that he really is really an incrementalist. He's not for upending longstanding precedent and what the country has become accustomed to. He believes in incremental changes and I think the Shelby County decision came about because he genuinely thought that so much advancement had been made in this area that it was no longer necessary for those protections. And I think after Shelby County, he's seen that those protections are still needed. His views might be moderating somewhat. He might see the damage that Shelby County decision has caused.\n\nYou've had this span of four or five decades to look at how these things have developed. How has technology changed this process of redistricting? Has it made it easier for those trying to dilute the power of minority voters to do that, and have people on your side of the fight been able to harness that technology in any similar fashion to fight back against those efforts?\n\nWhen I first started out in this area, the map drawers used maps and pencils and even had notepads to add before the calculators came. Then calculators and then the programs and social science has developed over the years, too. Statistical analysis has become more and more sophisticated, and the technology has become more and more sophisticated.\n\nMy take is that whoever writes the algorithm, whoever writes the code, the code can be written in such a way that it could lead to more discrimination and make it harder to undo.\n\nWe do have folks on our side who are using technology, but technology was used in the Texas case to draw districts in such a way that discriminated against Black and Latino voters in Texas.\n\nYou were a teenager when a lot of these landmark civil rights laws were passed in the ‘60s. Do you personally have memories of what the Jim Crow South was like? Did any of your relatives experience some of these more bizarre tests that were used for decades before that to exclude Black people from voting, like, ‘How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?’ or ‘How many jelly beans are in the jar?’\n\nOh, yes. I was born in ‘51. I grew up in a segregated neighborhood, went to an all-Black high school, segregated high school, segregated elementary school. I remember going to the dentist. And the dentist office had two entrances, one for white, one for “colored,” and going through the white side, they had air conditioning. They had magazines. The “colored” side did not.\n\nWe had field trips to the courthouse, where the courthouse had white and “colored” water fountains. And we had to sit in the balcony. I remember a third grade field trip to the courthouse and we watched a trial where a white lawyer was defending a Black man accused of some crime. And he was saying, “This was a good Nigra” — N-I-G-R-A.\n\nAnd so I grew up through it and I also remember my parents when the Voting Rights Act was first passed, and they did have federal registrars around, but all of the neighbors, my parents and everybody not only did they go and register to vote, they voted in every election, no matter what.\n\nThere were people telling us stories. Tim Winston owned a funeral home here and he was one of the few Black people who was able to register prior to the Voting Rights Act being passed, and he told stories of how they were turning away Black folks by asking them ridiculous questions. So, yeah, I remember, personally, stories of how hard it was before the Voting Rights Act was passed and after it was passed.\n\nIf the Voting Rights Act Section Two were to be knocked out and it wasn't a tool you could use anymore, what would be the strategy after that? Would that mean there's no option for civil rights groups? What is the world going to look like if the VRA is not available for private groups to litigate?\n\nIt almost becomes an impossible hill to climb. You have to go back to the 15th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult, or the 14th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult. All a legislative body has to do is say, “We didn't draw the district based on race. We drew them based on partisanship, and they're entitled to the presumption that there was a good faith effort to do that, and it's hard.” We had overwhelming evidence in Texas that partisanship was not the real reason. If that cannot overcome a presumption that the legislator was acting in good faith, going forward, it's going to be impossible to prove a racial gerrymandering claim.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the federal Constitution puts no limits on partisan gerrymandering, even as the justices continue to aggressively police use of race in redistricting. Is that line meaningful?\n\nRace and party, in Mississippi, there’s no distinction. It’s a fiction.",

    "description": "Denzel Perryman, Derwin James Jr. and Tony Jefferson reflect on how they are preparing their younger Chargers teammates for the looming playoff challenge ahead.",
    "fullText": "Denzel Perryman quickly listed name after name as he dove deep into his mental roster of the 2015 Chargers.\n\nManti Teʻo, Melvin Ingram, Kavell Conner and Donald Butler took Perryman under their wing, the Chargers linebacker said. The 11-year veteran said he relied on older teammates when he entered the NFL as they helped him adjust to the schedule and regimen of professional football.\n\n“When I was a young guy,” Perryman said, “my head was all over the place — just trying to get the gist of the NFL. They taught me how to be where my mind is.”\n\nWith the Chargers (10-4) entering the final stretch of the season and on the cusp of clinching a playoff berth heading into Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1), veterans have played an important role in the team winning six of its last seven games.\n\nA win over the Cowboys coupled with either a loss or tie by the Houston Texans on Sunday afternoon or an Indianapolis Colts loss or tie on Monday night would secure a playoff berth for the Chargers.\n\nPerryman, who recorded a season-best nine tackles in the Chargers' win over the Kansas City Chiefs last week, credits Philip Rivers and the rest of the Chargers' veterans for showing him \"how to be a pro\" a decade ago. Now he's passing along those lessons to younger players in a transfer of generational knowledge across the Chargers' locker room.\n\n“When I came in as a young guy, I thought this happens every year,” safety Derwin James Jr. said of winning, starting his career on a 12-4 Chargers team in 2018. “Remember the standard. Remember, whatever we're doing now, to uphold the standard, so that way, when guys change, coaches change, anything changes, the standard remains.”\n\nRunning off the field at Arrowhead Stadium, third-year safety Daiyan Henley charged at a celebrating Tony Jefferson, a veteran mentor at his position who was waiting for teammates after being ejected for an illegal hit on Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton.\n\nAfter the game Jefferson and Henley hopped around like schoolchildren on the playground. That’s the atmosphere the veterans want to create, Jefferson said, one in which younger players in the secondary can turn to him.\n\n“That's what we're here for,” Jefferson said. “For them to watch us and follow, follow our lead, and see how we do our thing.”\n\nIt's not just the veteran stars that are making a difference. Marcus Williams, a 29-year-old safety with 109 games of NFL experience, replaced Jefferson against the Chiefs after being elevated from the practice squad. The 2017 second-round pick played almost every snap in Jefferson's place, collecting four tackles.\n\n\"That just starts with the culture coach [Jim] Harbaugh creates,” defensive coordinator Jesse Minter said. “It's really a 70-man roster.\"\n\nHarbaugh highlighted defensive lineman/fullback Scott Matlock’s blocking technique — a ba-boop, ba-boop, as Harbaugh put it and mimed with his arms — on designed runs as an example of a veteran bolstering an offensive line trying to overcome the absence of Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater.\n\nHarbaugh said his father, Jack, taught Matlock the ba-boop, ba-boop blocking technique during an August practice.\n\n\"He's severely underrated as an athlete,” quarterback Justin Herbert said of the 6-foot-4, 296-pound Matlock, who also catches passes in the flat as a fullback.\n\nWith three games left in the regular season, Jefferson said the focus is on replicating the postseason-like efforts they gave in consecutive wins over the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“It was good that they were able to get a taste of that,” Jefferson said of his younger teammates playing against last season's Super Bowl teams, “because these games down the stretch are really what's to come in the playoffs.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "What keeps the money doctor up at night?\n\nSteve Hanke, a veteran economist and applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said there are two significant problems in the US economy and markets that are keeping him from getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne is inflation, which he thinks could start to spiral out of the Fed's control.\n\nThe other is high stock prices, which will start crashing back to earth, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"What is keeping me up at night is the idea that the Fed is going to be unable to hit its inflation target in 2026,\" the veteran economist and commodities trader wrote.\n\n\"As far as the stock market is concerned, my Dr. X's Bubble Detector is sitting at an all-time high, indicating that we are in a bubble,\" he added of equity prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, there are a few signs that price growth in the US is starting to heat up again. Headline inflation was cooler than expected in November, but still considerably above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nHanke, who has described himself as a \"money doctor\" and has long held the view that the money supply is a key driver of inflation, also pointed to the recent growth in the M2 money supply. That's a measure of the amount of cash flowing around the economy, and it has climbed by $3.5 trillion over the past five years, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\n\"For me, that is the most important metric,\" Hanke said of the inflation outlook. \"It looks like the money supply is going to be goosed, if not over-goosed.\"\n\nThere are a few developments that look like they can stoke inflation leading into the next year, Hanke said:\n\n\"My concern is that, after letting the money supply explode in 2020-21 and imposing inflation on Americans, the Fed has failed to put the inflation Genie back in the bottle,\" Hanke said.\n\nThe outlook for the stock market doesn't look much better, in Hanke's view. He pointed to bloated valuations in the tech sector as the mania for artificial intelligence reaches new heights.\n\n\"As far as the warning signs concerning the course of an AI bubble, you will never know when you will realize a Wile E. Coyote moment,\" he said, later adding that he advised investors to rebalance their portfolios.\n\nHanke, known for his persistently bearish forecasts for markets and the economy, has long forewarned of trouble heading for the US. In October, he speculated that AI companies today could eventually see a dot-com-style fate once they started missing their growth forecasts.\n\nLast year, he also doubled down on his call that the US economy was headed for a recession, but told Business Insider he had recently started leaning away from that stance on account of hotter inflation.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrade talks surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers are heating up, and the Lakers appear to be in pursuit of a veteran forward.\n\nAccording to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Lakers are pursuing New Orleans Pelicans wing Herb Jones.\n\n“The Los Angeles Lakers are monitoring the trade market for a defensive wing upgrade, league sources told HoopsHype. Among the 3-and-D wing upgrades on their wish list is New Orleans Pelicans forward Herb Jones, league sources say.”\n\nJones is widely considered one of the NBA’s top defenders. He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes certain loves take immense detours and then come back, sometimes football can deliver surprising returns. Rhetoric aside, Serie A has taught us that age can be just a number, and so the possibility of seeing Thiago Silva in Serie A again is not so remote.\n\nWatch all of Serie BKT live on OneFootball for only €9.99 per month. \n\nAfter Modric’s arrival in August, the return of the Brazilian defender to Milan is making fans dream, but above all, it could rewrite a record that was broken only this summer. It’s all about turning 41 last September.\n\nCurrently, Edin Dzeko holds the record as the oldest outfield player to return to Serie A, signing with Fiorentina at 39 years and 3 months. Before him, however, other big names made history:\n\nBruno Alves (Parma) – 36 years and 7 months\n\nTomas Danilevicius (Parma) – 35 years and 11 months\n\nCiro Immobile (Bologna) – 35 years and 4 months\n\nLuca Toni (Fiorentina) – 35 years and 3 months\n\nAlexis Sanchez (Inter) – 34 years and 8 months\n\nRoberto Donadoni (Milan) – 34 years and 6 months\n\nGeorges Grün (Reggiana) – 34 years and 5 months\n\nOliver Bierhoff (Chievo Verona) – 34 years and 3 months\n\nIf Thiago Silva’s return were to happen, the Brazilian would make his comeback at 41 years and 4 months, surpassing everyone and bringing experience and solidity to the Rossoneri defense.\n\nA “monstrous” age that would place him among the oldest players ever to set foot on a Serie A pitch, a list led by legendary goalkeepers:\n\n🧤 Marco Ballotta (Lazio) – 44 years and 1 month\n\n🧤 Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus) – 43 years and 3 months\n\n🧤 Pepe Reina (Como) – 42 years and 8 months\n\n🧤 Francesco Antonioli (Cesena) – 42 years and 7 months\n\n🧤 Gianluca Pegolo (Sassuolo) – 41 years and 9 months\n\n🧤 Alberto Fontana (Palermo) – 41 years and 9 months\n\n🧤 Roberto Colombo (Cagliari) – 41 years and 7 months\n\n🎯 Zlatan Ibrahimović (Milan) – 41 years and 5 months\n\n🧤 Dino Zoff (Juventus) – 41 years and 2 months\n\n🧱 Alessandro Costacurta (Milan) – 41 years and 25 days\n\nThiago Silva would not only bring impressive numbers, but also leadership and defensive solidity that Milan could take advantage of in the second half of the season.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins made a quiet but smart move on Wednesday, agreeing to a minor league contract with right-handed pitcher Dan Altavilla, according to Francys Romero.\n\nThe 33-year-old reliever is expected to receive a non-roster invite to major league spring training, where he will compete for a spot in the Twins' bullpen.\n\ntwins add reliever dan altavilla to the mix \n\naltavilla added a changeup last year and saw some success with it (.172 baa 36% whiff) \n\nif he could add a little more glove side movement out of that slider he’s got a solid arsenal to work with pic.twitter.com/iGmYVtxuCw\n\n— parker hageman (@HagemanParker) December 18, 2025\n\nAltavilla comes to Minnesota after spending the 2025 season with the Chicago White Sox, where he posted a solid 2.48 ERA across 29 innings in 28 relief appearances.\n\nThe veteran right-hander also recorded two saves and showed he can still get outs at the big league level after missing most of the previous three seasons due to Tommy John surgery and other injuries.\n\nThe Twins finished the 2025 season with a 70-92 record, placing fourth in the AL Central and missing the playoffs.\n\nA big reason for their struggles was the bullpen, which was gutted at the trade deadline when the team dealt away several key relievers including Jhoan Duran and Griffin Jax.\n\nExcited for this opportunity with the @Twins 🔥 pic.twitter.com/61MHWn8jqE\n\n— Dan Altavilla (@DanAlt3225) December 18, 2025\n\nHeading into the offseason, Minnesota's relief corps was thin and in need of depth.\n\nJustin Topa, Cole Sands, and Kody Funderburk appear to be the only pitchers locked into opening day bullpen roles, which leaves plenty of room for a veteran like Altavilla to earn a spot.\n\nThe Twins were also linked to right-hander Brad Keller before he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so adding Altavilla helps fill that gap.\n\nAltavilla's best weapon is his fastball, which still sits in the 96-97 MPH range and can overpower hitters when he locates it well.\n\nHe also throws a sinker that generated ground balls at a strong 51.3 percent clip in 2025, along with a slider and a changeup he developed last season with Chicago.\n\nThe Sox may well see plenty of former pitcher Dan Altavilla next year, as the veteran reliever has just signed a minor league contract with the Twins.\n\nHe had a 2.48 ERA in 29 appearances during his one year with the Sox this season. pic.twitter.com/IFmuL1zZtM\n\n— SleeperWhiteSox (@SleeperWhiteSox) December 18, 2025\n\nThe concerns with Altavilla are in his command and strikeout numbers.\n\nHis 17.5% strikeout rate and 12.5 percent walk rate in 2025 were both worse than the league average, and his 5.45 FIP suggests some regression could be coming.\n\nBut for a minor league deal with no guaranteed money, the risk is low and the upside is real if the Twins can help him refine his control.\n\nDan Altavilla, Filthy Sinkers. 😷 pic.twitter.com/9WwyBX526v\n\n— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 10, 2025\n\nThe Pennsylvania native has spent parts of eight seasons in the big leagues with four different teams, including Seattle, San Diego, Kansas City, and Chicago.\n\nHe knows what it takes to pitch in the majors, and his experience could be valuable for a young Twins team looking to rebuild.\n\nFor Minnesota, Altavilla represents exactly the kind of low-cost addition they need to make this offseason. If he earns a roster spot, he could provide solid middle relief innings.\n\nIf not, the Twins lose nothing. Either way, it is a smart gamble for a team looking to get back on track in 2026.",

Watt ruled out and NT Keeanu Benton (ankle), DE Yahya Black (shoulder), and DE Derrick Harmon (knee) all trending in the wrong direction, Heyward’s inclusion on the injury report couldn’t come at a worse time — especially when factoring in Dolphins superstar De'Von Achane, who’s expected to play on Monday night after battling a rib injury throughout practice.\n\nWe at Steelers Wire remain committed to providing updates on Heyward’s condition ahead of the Week 15 matchup against Miami, with Saturday’s practice likely giving us a better idea of his availability for Monday.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' Cam Heyward dealing with knee injury ahead of Week 15",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt’s safe to say the Los Angeles Lakers will look a bit different by the time the Feb. 5 trade deadline passes.\n\nThe franchise has plenty of tradable assets it can use in a midseason deal to upgrade its roster. Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk is under the impression that Luka Doncic’s 6-foot-10 former Dallas Mavericks teammate is among the assets the Lakers will move on from this season.\n\n“The Golden State Warriors proved last season why it can be advantageous to make a move early,” Rovenchuk wrote Friday. “They acquired Dennis Schroder, gave the experiment a shot, and rerouted him in favor of eventually securing Jimmy Butler when the initial venture failed.”\n\n“If the Lakers were going to replicate a similar approach, there is one clear member of the roster who stands out as a part of the outgoing package for Los Angeles. That would be Maxi Kleber.”\n\n“Kleber has been sidelined recently, dealing with a lower back injury. With the Lakers struggling to find defense, athleticism, shooting, and bench scoring, any one of these needs could have him moved before even being given the opportunity to return to the court for Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile it may not be easy to believe, Kleber was once a valuable stretch four who played respectable pick-and-pop basketball alongside Doncic in Los Angeles.\n\nFast forward to the 2025-26 season, and Kleber, who was included in the blockbuster Feb. 2 trade that landed Doncic with the Lakers, is a low-impact contributor for JJ Redick’s crew.\n\nWhile Kleber is shooting 37.5% from three, he’s contributing just 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game in 12.1 minutes, signaling that it may be time to part ways with the 33-year-old big man.\n\nIf one thing’s certain, Kleber is running out of time to prove himself in Los Angeles.\n\nMore NBA: Spurs' Stephon Castle makes basketball history never done ever before in NBA",

The length and salary of the contract is not yet known.\n\nMilner seemed like he was destined to head to Chicago prior to the 2025 season. The Cubs were in need of left-handed bullpen help and with Milner's background in Milwaukee with current manager Craig Counsell, a pairing of the two sides made perfect sense. That ultimately didn't happen, and Milner headed to Texas to pitch for the Rangers last season.\n\nThe version of Milner that Chicago will be getting is an intriguing question. Is it the 1.82 ERA and 1.7 WAR in 2023? Or is it the -0.6 WAR each of the previous two seasons with a 3.84 ERA being the lowest of those respective seasons? The Cubs obviously hope it is the 2023 version, but the previous two seasons have not indicated that the old version will be returning.\n\nChicago is expected to remain in the market for bullpen arms, a group that was a strength down the stretch last season.\n\nMore MLB: Cubs predicted to trade for $6.5 million All-Star ace to create 1-2 punch with Shota Imanaga",

    "fullText": "Indianapolis Colts unretired longtime NFL veteran quarterback Philip Rivers will wear #17 again for the Horseshoe, which was the same number he wore back in 2020—and throughout his 8x NFL Pro Bowl career with the Chargers organization, as well as for NC State and in high school:\n\nWith Daniel Jones on injured reserve, new Colts QB Philip Rivers can get his old No. 17 back, as @mchappell51 reported. And once again, Rivers will wear No. 17. pic.twitter.com/kEPdI653Oz\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 10, 2025\n\nBecause injured starting quarterback Daniel Jones was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending Achilles injury, his #17 is eligible to be recirculated to Rivers for the remainder of the 2025 campaign.\n\nPer NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, an NFL spokesman indicated that, “The league approved it as it does not present a competitive issue as one player will be wearing that number.”\n\nRivers also texted Jones to ensure the former Colts starting quarterback was okay with him using his legendary #17 again. Rivers was already seen on the Colts practice field during Wednesday’s indoor practice, repping his #17.\n\nIt may not mean much, but Rivers likely would’ve looked weird with another jersey number (and we all know #18 was already unavailable!)\n\nIt’s best to have the 44-year-old quarterback most comfortable resuming his pro career, and it also provides Colts fans who bought a Rivers jersey back in 2020 the opportunity to wear a current one again—without any change to a new jersey number for the remainder of this year.",

    "description": "Three veteran starters have been ruled out for LSU's appearance in the Texas Bowl in late December.",
    "fullText": "LSU football will take the field for the Texas Bowl without three key starters. According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "title": "The Devils Should Target Ryan O’Reilly Before They Target Steven Stamkos",
    "description": "The Devils are interested in a couple veteran Nashville Predators. Here’s why only one of them is worth pursuing.",
    "fullText": "The trade winds are starting to blow in the NHL, and with the New Jersey Devils recent skid, cries have started coming out from all corners of the internet and the Devils fanbase for GM Tom Fitzgerald to do something before these recent struggles derails the season.\n\nElliotte Friedman reported Saturday that Fitzgerald is indeed looking around and gauging what the market looks like. Not only have the Devils been linked to Quinn Hughes, but they’ve also been linked to Ryan O’Reilly and Steven Stamkos of the Nashville Predators.\n\nI don’t really have much more else to add about the Quinn Hughes situation, as I’ve said my piece on that matter last week. Fitzgerald wouldn’t be doing his job if he wasn’t checking in on the availability of one of the best defensemen in the NHL….never mind the fact he’s also the brother of two players already on the Devils. The Devils having interest in Quinn Hughes isn’t some manufactured thing that is just being thrown out there willy nilly for clicks. It’s a very real possibility that it could happen, so of course Fitzgerald is going to check in there.\n\nWith that said, I haven’t said much about the Ryan O’Reilly and/or Steven Stamkos situation, aside from what I wrote about those players last season. But I think if it came down to one or the other, the choice is clear.\n\nThe Devils should prioritize O’Reilly over Stamkos.\n\nThe Devils went into the season with a plan of having Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier, and Cody Glass as their Top 3 centers, with Luke Glendening apparently winning the 4C job over Juho Lammikko after impressing in training camp on a PTO.\n\nAfter free agency came and went, I figured that the Devils plan was to make Dawson Mercer the 3C and have Cody Glass be the 4C, but apparently I was wrong.\n\nAll of this was always a questionable plan at best.\n\nSay what you will about Jack Hughes’s injury history, and say that you will about how fluky this year’s injury was with Hughes getting injured at a team dinner of all settings. Considering Hughes’s history, it would not have been unreasonable for Fitzgerald to come up with a better alternative than “just shift Mercer to center” in case Hughes missed time again. And sure enough, Hughes missed time again. It might be the flukiest of fluky flukes to ever fluke, but its still a failure from an organizational level to properly prepare for this potential scenario that had a realistic chance of happening.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Devils nearly let Cody Glass walk away in free agency before they thought better of it when it was apparent he would be scooped up quickly if he hit the open market. Add in the fact that Glass has his own injury history since coming to the Devils. Add in that Nico Hischier bears the brunt of playing in all situations and playing the toughest minutes of anyone on the roster. And add in the fact that the Devils plan for 4C was taking a flier on the winner of a training camp competition between a player who had been out of the NHL for a few seasons and a PTO signing.\n\nThis might be a bit of a simplistic take on my part, but its not a coincidence or an accident that when the Devils have looked their best this season, it has been when their centers were healthy and available. The top lines worked and all showed cohesion. It’s also not a coincidence or accident that Mercer himself has looked the best he’s looked when playing on Nico Hischier’s wing rather than centering his own line.\n\nNo, there’s no replacing a player like Jack Hughes when he misses time, but you give yourself a better shot of treading water when you have an NHL caliber option who can slide into that spot. Adding a player like O’Reilly would make a huge difference for this group. And what about when you get Hughes back? All of a sudden you have an embarrassment of riches at a critically important position. Where Ryan O’Reilly is an overqualified 3C and Cody Glass is an overqualified 4C.\n\nGo back and look at the center depth on the most recent Stanley Cup champions. Where the Panthers had Anton Lundell as their 3C throughout their run. Where the Golden Knights had some combination of Jack Eichel, Chandler Stephenson, and William Karlsson down the middle. Where the Lightning won their Cups with Yanni Gourde as their 3C, but they were also deep enough to move Anthony Cirelli or Brayden Point there when needed. Where until this season, the Avs weren’t the same after losing Nazem Kadri. I’d keep going on and on but you understand the point I’m trying to make.\n\nYou need to be deep down the middle if you want to be taken seriously as a championship contender. You need to be deep down the middle if you want to maximize the wingers you’ve brought in. The Devils are not.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Ryan O’Reilly is the same two-way player he was when he won a Selke trophy in St. Louis. He turns 35 years old later this season and while he’s still effective, he is approaching the 1200 game milestone.\n\nThat said, with 21 points in 28 games, he’s still more than capable of chipping in offensively. He’s more than capable of playing in all situations and holding his own.\n\nI’m also not suggesting that Nico Hischier isn’t capable of handling everything that he handles in his on-ice role. But wouldn’t Hischier potentially be more valuable to the Devils if the team had another alternative who could take some of those defensive obligations off of his plate? Jack Hughes is better defensively than he gets credit for, but nobody is going to confuse him for Patrice Bergeron in terms of being a Selke-caliber defensive forward. Cody Glass doesn’t contribute much on the penalty kill (he’s only played 2:58 there this year). Luke Glendening does play on the kill, but he’s a fairly limited player at this stage of his career. Anything you get from him offensively is a bonus.\n\nAdding a player like O’Reilly and leaning on him to play those minutes should have a positive impact on the Devils penalty kill, which ranks 17th in the league as of this writing. And it should give the Devils another option at 5v5 as well.\n\nSteven Stamkos was already on the decline when he left the Tampa Bay Lightning, and things haven’t looked better through his first season plus as a member of the Nashville Predators. He’s not really a center anymore, despite Predators coach Andrew Brunette shifting him between center and wing in an attempt to give them a spark. He doesn’t drive play anymore, he’s not shooting as much as he has in the past, he’s no longer an elite level skater, he’s not much of a defensive forward, and he no longer has elite level players alongside him like he did in Tampa.\n\nYes, Stamkos could potentially chip in a little bit offensively on the power play. And yes, he might look better playing with better players than Luke Evangelista on his line. I would guess that the Devils envision him playing alongside Jack Hughes and Jesper Bratt and burying the feeds that he used to get from elite level playmakers like Nikita Kucherov.\n\nBut the Devils don’t really need another overpaid player who barely does anything at 5v5. They already have one of those in Ondrej Palat, and Stamkos’s contract is even worse.\n\nThe 2025-26 Devils need stability down the middle more than they need a scoring winger. They needed this before Jack Hughes got hurt and that need is only exasperated the more we see they don’t have an answer at such a critically important position. And even if one believed the opposite was true, the last thing the Devils need is a soon-to-be 36-year-old Stamkos, who is under contract for $8M AAV for two more seasons after this one. I don’t even know how the Devils would make that contract fit given their current cap situation, but I know I want no part of that.\n\nOn the flip side, O’Reilly is under contract for $4.5M AAV for one more season after this one, which is more than reasonable for a middle six center. I get that with him being a year younger than Stamkos, he’s not exactly a spring chicken either, but I think its clear that O’Reilly has more left in the tank than Stamkos, and its not nearly as onerous a commitment either.\n\nObviously, this is all dependant on asking price, and there might wind up being other options that make themselves available as the season rolls along. But it certainly sounds like the Predators are open for business, and with how tight the NHL standings are, the teams that separate themselves from the pack are likely going to be the ones who are proactive fixing their issues with their rosters rather than being reactive and waiting until the deadline for prices to go down.\n\nWhat gives me pause is sitting by and doing nothing isn’t going to do anything to fix the issue. Not only is it not acceptable for this team and where they are on their timeline, I think we’ve seen enough mediocre to bad hockey to know that its not going to magically fix itself. I pointed out when I broke down every trade Fitzgerald has made that only once did he go out early in the season and make a trade to address a glaring hole. It was a bad one. It was acquiring Jon Gillies.",

    "description": "LPGA winners Ryann O'Toole, Hinako Shibuno and Jodi Ewart Shadoff all re-earn their full playing privileges in Q-Series Final",
    "fullText": "Ryann O’Toole didn’t imagine she would put this on her December itinerary, but there she was playing golf in Alabama this past week trying to salvage her LPGA Tour card. It was a wise decision.\n\nThe 38-year-old O’Toole, a UCLA alum who first gained recognition as a competitor on Golf Channel’s “Big Break,” has won one tournament on tour, and she has the chance to add more titles after shooting a bogey-free 65 with seven birdies on Tuesday in the final round of LPGA Q-Series Final Qualifying in Mobile. In the event shortened from 90 holes to 72 because of a day lost to bad weather, O’Toole finished tied for third at 11 under and was the top American qualifier. The top 25 and ties earned their tour card, with 31 golfers being the final total at Robert Trent Jones Trail Magnolia Grove.\n\nO’Toole has 20 career top-10s, but she made the cut in only half her 16 starts in 2025, with no top-10s, and finished 137th on the CME Points Rankings.\n\n“The last time I was here [at Q-Series] was 2014, and I told myself after that week, I never want to have to be back,” O’Toole said. “But you never know what happens, and here I was back having to re-qualify. It's stressful, it's a grind, it's mentally and emotionally draining. Then this week, with just the weather, I mean it being freezing, the delays, the rain, every single morning was early. … It became a physical grind.\n\n“I just think there's so much emotion that goes into this that it is a tough week. With 15 years on tour, there are mixed emotions going into it. I wasn't sure if I was even going to decide to go back to Q School or if I was just going to start the next chapter of my life. But at the same time it would be really weird to start January 1 and go, ‘What do you mean I don't have full status? What do you mean? I'm not a professional on the LPGA?’ That wasn't OK for me.”\n\nGerman golfer Helen Briem earned her LPGA Tour card in impressive fashion. She shot a four-under 68 to earn medalist honors at 13 under. Briem, 20, moves to the LPGA after having played on the Ladies European Tour.\n\n“Right now, I'm a bit lost for words. I entered this week with not a lot of expectations,” said Brie. “But, overall, I'm really happy that I am able to play LPGA next year, and that’s really cool.”\n\nMajor winner Hinako Shibuno, arguably the most popular Japanese golfer, got her tour card back again, too. The 2019 AIG Women’s British Open champion made it on the number at five under after closing with a 72. Shibuno, 27, struggled on the LPGA this season, making just 10 cuts in 23 starts while notching only one top-10 finish.\n\nAnother veteran to re-earn her card is former European Solheim Cup player Jodi Ewart Shadoff. The 37-year-old, who won her lone LPGA title in 2022 and has top-10 finishes in three of the tour’s five majors, shot 71 and was among the final eight players who tied for 24th.\n\nAmong the notable players who missed getting their cards was 17-year-old Floridian Gianna Clemente, who turned pro this year, advanced through Second Stage and fell three shots off the cut. Kim Kaufman, 34, who battled breast cancer this year and finished chemotherapy in the summer, finished at four over. Among the past college stars who didn’t get their cards were 2023 U.S. Women’s Amateur champion and Auburn alum Megan Schofill (even par), 2024 NCAA individual champion Adela Cernousek of Texas A&M (16 over), USC’s Amari Avery (one under) and Wake Forest’s Rachel Kuehn (eight over).",
