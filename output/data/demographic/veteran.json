    "fullText": "Cowboys listed as ideal landing spot for veteran running back in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter missing out on postseason play for a second consecutive season, the Dallas Cowboys will have some major questions to answer over the offseason, including what they plan to do at the running back position.\n\nThe Cowboys got some surprisingly productive play from Javonte Williams this season. The fifth-year back has started in all 16 games for Dallas on the current campaign and tallied 1,201 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He also has 35 receptions for 137 yards and two more TDs.\n\nUnfortunately for Dallas, Williams is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and his productive play over the course of the campaign may have elevated him out of the Cowboys’ price range, which would leave them seeking a replacement.\n\nThat’s where veteran back J.K. Dobbins could come in. Like Williams, Dobbins is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and he could prove to be a realistic, affordable target for Dallas.\n\nFor those reasons, the Cowboys were recently listed as an ideal landing spot for Dobbins by Alex Kay of Bleacher Report.\n\n“With Dobbins missing multiple games in all six of his NFL seasons—including all of the 2021 campaign and almost all of 2023—it'll be tough for him to earn any sort of long-term deal from a club,” Kay wrote. “… Dobbins will be well worth rolling the dice on for a cash-strapped club like the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMore Dallas Cowboys news: Dak Prescott explains why he wants to play in regular season finale for Cowboys\n\n\"The team could be priced out of retaining Javonte Williams and will want to make up that lost production by coming to terms on a cheap, incentive-laden deal with Dobbins.”\n\nWhen it comes to Dobbins, health has always been a consistent concern as he’s missed a chunk of time in each of the last four seasons. He started strong in Denver this season before eventually being placed on the IR with a foot injury. Prior to the injury though, Dobbins had a solid season for the Broncos, tallying 772 rushing yads and four touchdowns in 10 appearances.\n\nHe’s still just 27 years old, so he should still have plenty of gas left in the tank, as long as he can stay on the field. Given their other options, Dobbins could certainly be worth a flyer for the Cowboys, who could also look to add a running back in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft.",

    "fullText": "A Wall Street veteran warned jubilant silver traders to be careful after a searing rally in the precious metal's price — days before it went into reverse.\n\nWriting on X over the weekend, Peter Brandt congratulated those who've won big by betting on silver and platinum in recent months, but cautioned the market could quickly turn on them.\n\n\"Being right is fun,\" he wrote. \"But know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected. And tops come quickly when they come. And retracements are almost always full.\"\n\nEarly on Monday, the market did indeed turn. Silver breached $80 an ounce for the first time before falling to around $70 by the market's close. They rebounded 10% to around $78 on Tuesday. Silver futures have surged by over 150% this year.\n\nMonday's plunge followed a decision by exchange operator CME to raise margin requirements for trading various metals contracts, which forced traders to stump up more cash to place their bets.\n\nIf you are long Silver and/or Platinum, I say \"Well done.\"\nCongrats. Perhaps this is your first futures market trade. Being right is fun.\nBut know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected\nAnd tops come quickly when they come\nAnd retracements are almost always full pic.twitter.com/w32o9OuXKj\n\nBrandt, who's been trading commodities for nearly 50 years and has more than 840,000 followers on X, also struck a wary tone in a Monday afternoon post on X following silver's drop.\n\nHe wrote that in virtually every market cycle, even the \"stubborn bulls\" who've sworn they'll never sell inevitably reach a point where they \"no longer care if price goes to zero or a million, they have had enough pain and they want out.\"\n\nBrandt said he's \"not sure\" the silver market is there yet. \"Time will tell,\" he added.\n\nTrue story\nI've been through many many many huge bull market cycles in metals, grains, softs, livestock, alt coins, et al\nThere is a point when late-to-buy bulls swear that they will never get out -- that they will hang on even if price goes to zero\nIn almost every case the low…\n\nSilver, gold, and other precious metals have soared to new highs this year as falling interest rates have boosted their appeal relative to cash and bonds.\n\nSome traders have bought silver to gain exposure to the AI boom, as the metal is a key component in AI infrastructure, such as microchips and data centers. Because it conducts electricity well, it's used in circuit boards, switches, EVs, and batteries, which is also driving demand for the metal right now.\n\nInvestors have also piled into precious metals as hedges against geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty, which threatens to weaken currencies such as the dollar and weigh on other assets such as stocks.\n\nIn a separate post late Monday on X, Brandt defended his cautious attitude toward the silver rally, noting that he has been trading silver since it was priced below $4 an ounce in the 1970s and has traded as much as 200,000 ounces in a single order.\n\n\"Yet, I am jealous because there is an entire generation of Z babies trading on Silver on laptops from their mommy's basements that know everything there is to know about Silver,\" he posted, followed by a succession of laughing-while-crying emojis.\n\nBrandt also dismissed the idea that silver's price boom reflects a structural imbalance between supply and demand that will forestall any price decline.\n\n\"It has never been different,\" he wrote. \"Never will be. So enjoy it now.\"\n\n\"This price action has NOTHING to do with supply shortages,\" he wrote in another post. \"This now is a game of money.\"",

    "title": "An AI deepfake was final straw for a Washington State Trooper. He’s suing",
    "description": "A veteran of the agency claims he’s faced workplace discrimination due to his sexual orientation.",
    "fullText": "A veteran Washington State Patrol trooper claims he’s faced discrimination and hostility in the agency due to his sexual orientation — issues that reportedly reached a breaking point when WSP personnel created and circulated a demeaning video of him generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nCollin Overend Pearson, who’s a Pierce County resident and gay, alleges that he’s been subjected to “repeated instances of discriminatory and unconstitutional conduct by WSP and its officers” during nearly two decades of employment, according to a lawsuit filed Dec. 19 in Pierce County Superior Court.\n\nThe conduct has damaged his reputation, the complaint said.\n\nIn a statement Monday, WSP spokesperson Chris Loftis declined to comment on the allegations, citing the agency’s policy and practice regarding pending litigation.\n\n“The Washington State Patrol believes that all employees have the right to work in an environment where skills, abilities, and dignity are valued and that is free from bias, harassment, and intimidation,” Loftis said.\n\nPearson is assigned to WSP’s District 1, which covers Pierce and Thurston counties, according to attorney Mark Conrad, who’s representing Pearson.\n\nPrior to suing the state, which allegedly failed to take appropriate actions to curb the discrimination and hostility, Pearson filed a legal claim against it late last year that served as a notice for it to put an end to the bad behavior, Conrad said in an interview Monday.\n\n“Instead of stopping, the conduct escalated,” Conrad said.\n\nIn December, WSP personnel created an AI-generated video that depicted Pearson and another uniformed, male trooper kissing on a roadside, the lawsuit claims. A voiceover in the video states, “this is SWAT training, no homo,” — using a derogatory phrase that insinuates “homosexuality is inferior or insulting,” according to the suit.\n\nConrad said the video was circulated among troopers and appears real, which is what he believes makes it so damaging beyond it being plainly derogatory and intended to humiliate his client. The deepfake also showed that at least some WSP personnel feel emboldened to engage in conduct demeaning to LGBTQ+ employees, he said.\n\nIt was the last straw for Pearson, according to Conrad, who said his client had put much thought into a “very difficult” decision to sue. The lawsuit accuses the state, by and through the WSP, of discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy, and it seeks unspecified damages to be proven at trial as well as legal fees.\n\nDespite the personal nature of the claims within the complaint, it was important to Pearson that he step forward, including by using his full name and not just his initials in the public filing, “to ensure that other people don’t have to face the environment that he’s currently facing,” Conrad said.\n\n“This can’t be tolerated in the workplace,” he said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites other alleged instances of discrimination, including when Pearson’s job offer in Des Moines was rescinded after a WSP captain advised the chief of that police department against hiring him, and when WSP detectives investigated an anonymous complaint that accused Pearson of threatening patrons while working off-duty at a Tacoma gay bar.\n\nPearson never worked at the bar, according to Conrad, and the suit said the complainant’s claim against Pearson was deemed to be unfounded. Conrad said he didn’t know the reason why the WSP captain had interfered in Pearson’s career move, nor did he know the status of an internal complaint that Pearson had filed in response.\n\nIn one instance, when Pearson inadvertently missed work, the WSP reacted more strongly than it did in similar situations involving other troopers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPearson had been out sick for two days in December 2023 and overslept for a shift after his phone died. He didn’t notify his supervisor that he would miss work. A trooper was dispatched to Pearson’s home, where a man who was staying with Pearson answered the door and Pearson was awoken and interrogated by the trooper, according to the suit. Later that day, WSP personnel sent Ruston Police Department officers to conduct an additional check at the home, the suit said.\n\nThe missed workday prompted a formal months-long WSP investigation that involved outside agencies and included interviews with Pearson’s colleagues and scrutiny of his personal life, according to the suit. Ultimately, it was recommended Pearson be suspended for five days without pay for violations of “neglect of duty” and “use of alcohol — off duty,” the suit said.\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Washington State Patrol Troopers Association president Spike Unruh objected to the latter violation, arguing that WSP had unlawfully entered Pearson’s home without his consent, according to the suit.\n\n“Unruh also presented evidence that numerous troopers had previously overslept and were not subjected to home entry or similar treatment, and that it was not standard practice to involve outside agencies or conduct multiple home visits when a trooper failed to show for one workday,” the suit said.\n\nThe WSP’s probe “had effectively ‘outed’ Plaintiff’s sexuality to the entire (Office of Professional Standards) section, further compounding the emotional toll of the situation,” the suit said.\n\nIn August 2024, the WSP acknowledged that the entry into Pearson’s home was illegal and that no information obtained during that entry could be used against him, according to the suit, which said that the agency reclassified the off-duty alcohol violation as “undetermined.”",

    "fullText": "Dani Carvajal is about to enter the final six months of his contract at Real Madrid, leading to question marks about his future beyond this season.\n\nThe 33-year-old right-back’s recent trip to Qatar only served to fuel speculations that he might consider moving on in the summer to reunite with close friend, brother-in-law, and former teammate Joselu.\n\nSo far, there has been no move from the club’s side to initiate talks about an extension either, leading to major uncertainty over his future.\n\nHowever, according to AS, Carvajal’s future and continuity at Real Madrid beyond his current contract appears to be on track.\n\nIndeed, unlike Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who appear certain to leave, Carvajal can be relatively calm about his situation at Real Madrid, as he is seen as a ‘special case’.\n\nThe veteran right-back will turn 34 in January and has only been able to spend 445 minutes on the pitch over the past 15 months. And, so far, the club have not yet made a definitive decision on whether to offer him another year.\n\nSet to continue for one more year? (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, due to his authority and importance in the dressing room as club captain and because, what he still has left to offer on a sporting level, despite the uncertainty surrounding his physical condition, the odds are in favour of his staying.\n\nMoreover, Real Madrid are not searching for a new right-back and are focusing on other positions ahead of the summer.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold is still in the process of settling at the club, and using Federico Valverde as a right-back outside of emergency situations could once again provoke the Uruguayan’s displeasure.\n\nIn short, the current planning includes Carvajal as part of the project, especially as if he manages to halt his recent run of injuries and find continuity in 2026, he will further strengthen his case on the pitch.\n\nThe Real Madrid captain is working tirelessly to recover from his most recent serious physical problem, an issue in his knee which needed him to undergo arthroscopy in October.\n\nCarvajal is close to returning and could be included in the trip to Jeddah for the Spanish Super Cup. As for his continuity, it now seems more a matter of timing than of doubt.",

    "description": "Caleb Downs had to be reminded that he was getting ready for his sixth College Football Playoff game, which probably won’t be rare a decade from now but is unique in just the second year of the expanded 12-team format.",
    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — Caleb Downs had to be reminded that he was getting ready for his sixth College Football Playoff game, which probably won’t be rare a decade from now but is unique in just the second year of the expanded 12-team format.\n\nThe Ohio State safety smiled at the thought and figured it couldn’t hurt to have played in the CFP as a freshman at Alabama, losing 27-20 to Michigan in overtime before transferring to the Wolverines’ biggest rival and winning four postseason games and a national championship with the Buckeyes a year ago.\n\n“That could be a positive, just knowing that I’ve been in this situation so many times,” said Downs, a two-time Associated Press All-American. “At the end of the day, it’s not about me. It’s about everybody else feeling confident during the game. Really just trying to push that to all my teammates.”\n\nHe’s talking younger teammates such as freshman Devin Sanchez, a backup cornerback who has tried to imagine the nerves and emotions in the hours before kickoff in a Cotton Bowl quarterfinal against No. 10 Miami.\n\nThe Hurricanes (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) are first-time CFP qualifiers, but got a start on those nerves with the 10-3 first-round victory at Texas A&M on Dec. 20.\n\nThe third-ranked Buckeyes (12-1, CFP No. 2) got a first-round bye despite losing to top-ranked Indiana in the Big Ten championship game.\n\n“Lean on them a lot, more than you think,” Sanchez said. “They’re guys that have been here a lot of times, a couple of guys have been to the Cotton Bowl for the third straight year in a row. So this is not a new place for them. As a new guy, there’s nothing I can do but lean on them. The speed will be a little different. The intensity will be up a little bit more. Just lean on those guys, and when my number’s called just be able to go out there and make sure that they trust me to be out there.”\n\nDowns remembers the nerves from his CFP debut with the Crimson Tide. He was in the Rose Bowl, a spectacle he had seen on TV as a kid.\n\n“That was probably the biggest game I had played at the time,” said Downs, one of the top players in the 2024 portal as the first freshman to lead the storied Alabama program in tackles. “Knowing that, it was a little bit of nerves.”\n\nThe Buckeyes were in the Cotton Bowl for last season’s semifinals, beating Texas 28-14 after comfortable wins over Tennessee at home and No. 1 Oregon in a Rose Bowl quarterfinal.\n\nDowns found a way to leave the Rose Bowl with a better feeling. Now he’ll be back on the field where he intercepted Texas’ Quinn Ewers almost a year ago, in what will be his 44th game in just three seasons.\n\n“I think just in general with Caleb, just the amount of experience he has playing football is probably the most important thing,” first-year defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said. “His professionalism and how he prepares is probably the best example that I can point to for all the players.”\n\nDowns, a projected first-round pick should he decide to enter the NFL draft in April, isn’t the only experienced defensive back. Davison Igbinosun and Jermaine Matthews Jr., the starting cornerbacks in front of Sanchez, have been around awhile.\n\nIgbinosun was on the 2023 Ohio State team that also played in the Cotton Bowl, a 14-3 loss to Missouri after missing out on the last four-team playoff.\n\nA year later, Downs was with him, believing the experience of being in the playoff didn’t matter as much as losing in the playoff.\n\n“It definitely added a little bit of fuel to the fire because I lost my freshman year,” Downs said. “It made me want to come back and play better. I think that was a lot of what everybody else on the team felt because they didn’t have the success they wanted to earlier in their career. I think that was a hungry team. And we’ve got to be the same way this year.”",

    "fullText": "With drones always buzzing overhead, ready to dive bomb soldiers or relay targeting data to an artillery gun crew, it can be far too dangerous to send a human being to rescue the wounded, so Ukraine is turning to robots to evacuate injured troops.\n\nA US veteran in Ukraine who saw them in action told Business Insider they're effective — and said Ukraine is right to keep them simple and cheap, given that many may not make it back.\n\nUkraine is using a growing number of ground robots, a kind of drone, to combat Russia's invasion by carrying supplies, acting as bombs, and evacuating injured soldiers.\n\nMany of these systems come from Ukrainian companies and manufacturers located within Ukraine's European partners. It's technology that militaries are increasingly paying attention to, seeing it as a solution that could save lives on the modern battlefield, though across NATO and Western forces, the focus is mainly on doctrine, testing, and prototyping.\n\nEven in Ukraine, uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) only make up a small fraction of the drones in use in battle.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is now helping out a nonprofit in Ukraine. He told Business Insider that using ground robots for casualty evacuation isn't perfect, but it's useful. He said that the West should take note but avoid overengineering or overspending on these kinds of systems.\n\nThe robots are \"not always a success, but at least it's something,\" he said.\n\nThe casualty evacuation robots function like remote-controlled stretchers, but rescuing wounded troops is far from foolproof: with so many drones overhead, they're easy to spot — and just as easy to attack.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have pointed to the limits of ground robots in evacuating the wounded, noting that while they can be a lifeline for a wounded soldier when it is too unsafe for their comrades to come get them, they can be jammed, they break down, and they can be targeted just like anything else moving in battle.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, head of robotic systems for the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that they are a last resort tool because a wounded soldier could wind up in \"an even worse situation.\"\n\nThey are a \"last hope kind of thing,\" Wells explained. \"And that shouldn't cost a lot of money and should be something that's easily developed, replaced, and deployed.\"\n\nWells' work in Ukraine aims to help civilians survive the war. He is there with Task Force Antal, a nonprofit organization run by US veterans that provides medical training, supplies, and evacuation support to civilians, especially in front-line areas.\n\nHe said that the evacuation robots don't need to be flawless technology — the tech is evolving so fast that whatever works today may well be redesigned next week anyway. What matters, he said, is getting something usable into the field now, because saving lives outranks engineering elegance.\n\nWells said the robot he saw in action was \"low tech\" but got the job done, explaining that he would rather have 10 robots worth $1,000 than one that was more advanced and worth $100,000.\n\n\"You kind of just need something that's effective, essentially a stretcher with wheels that gives hope to the person that's injured.\" It doesn't need to be more complicated than that.\n\nIn talks with Business Insider, Ukrainian soldiers, foreign volunteers, and arms makers have emphasized key lessons for the West: prioritize more cheap systems over a few exquisite ones, don’t pour money into technology that may quickly become obsolete, and resist the urge to overengineer and overspend on gear meant for a battlefield that changes every week.\n\nWhen it comes to robots for evacuation, Wells said that the best thing is to keep technology cheap and expendable so troops don't think they \"have to use this because it costs so much money.\"",

    "description": "Should the New York Jets consider bringing in another veteran bridge quarterback this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on season-ending IR earlier this week. It all but guarantees the end of Fields' disappointing tenure in East Rutherford. The Jets could release him this offseason and absorb a $22 million dead cap charge by doing so.\n\nDespite the somewhat sizable financial penalty, Fields' pending release feels like a foregone conclusion. Fellow veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor is on an expiring contract. Taylor probably won't be back with the Jets in 2026 either.\n\nGeneral manager Darren Mougey will be tasked with acquiring at least one, maybe two, quarterbacks this offseason. Currently equipped with two first-round selections in the 2026 NFL draft (and three more in 2027), the Jets could target a quarterback in this year's class like Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore. With the Jets currently slated to pick 4th and 18th overall, that may require a slight but aggressive move up the draft order.\n\nMougey should also consider bringing in another bridge quarterback. Right now, there's no guaranteeing the Jets end up with Mendoza or Moore. Even if they do, an experienced mentor could accelerate their development.\n\nIn recent memory, rookie quarterbacks who enjoyed immediate success were experienced college quarterbacks. Jayden Daniels, Bo Nix, Cam Ward, and Tyler Shough were multi-year starters. Other successful NFL quarterbacks like Justin Herbert, Drake Maye, and Jordan Love weren't Week 1 starters, and in Love's case, sat for multiple seasons.\n\nMendoza has 945 career collegiate passing attempts (and counting). Moore is a first-year starter. Not making comparisons, but recent draft picks who busted like Zach Wilson (sorry, Jets fans) and Trey Lance were inexperienced and asked to do too much right away.\n\nKyler Murray, Tua Tagovailoa, and Geno Smith (imagine that, ha) are among the veteran quarterbacks expected to be available this offseason. Murray and Tagovailoa may not be \"bridge\" options by definition based on the financial commitment needed. But someone like Jacoby Brissett or Malik Willis would be an upgrade on Fields/Taylor while buying the Jets time to develop a rookie quarterback, or draft one in 2027 instead of 2026.\n\nMougey has big decisions to make this offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Should the Jets consider bringing in another bridge QB this offseason?",

    "description": "The Golden State Warriors veteran forward has offered to come off the bench if it helps the team",
    "fullText": "The Golden State Warriors are still searching for the right combination of talent, both in the starting lineup and off the bench. Steve Kerr's job has been made harder by the team's brutal schedule to start the season and the string f injuries throughout the roster. As such, we're yet to see what the Warriors can do when they're working with a sustained period of health.\n\nNevertheless, Kerr and his veteran leaders are undoubtedly looking for ways to help give the team a boost. According to Kerr, speaking at a post-practice news conference, Draymond Green has offered to come off the bench if the coaching staff believes it will give the team the balance it needs. Kerr, however, is not currently looking to make that change.\n\n“He told me, this year, ‘I'll go to the bench if you need me to.’ I know what Draymond is about,\" Kerr said. \"He's about winning...That's not even a consideration for me right now,” he said, “Because I'm really excited about this starting lineup: Steph, Draymond, Moses (Moody), (Quinten Post), Jimmy, I think it's a great starting lineup for us, because we get the size and shooting of Quentin next to Dray, which takes the pressure off of him. And Dre is at his best next to Steph. He should play most of his minutes with Steph. Those two guys are incredible together.\"\n\nGreen has struggled on offense this season. He's got more personal fouls than he does made field goals. However, he's still an integral part of the starting lineup and is operating as the team's primary playmaker. Furthermore, his defensive IQ and ability to quarterback a defense provide an important leadership dynamic that helps set a tone to begin the game.\n\nNevertheless, if the Warriors continue to struggle building momentum, Kerr may look to experiment with different roster combinations in the future, and there is always the potential for Green to move into a second unit role later in the year.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Steve Kerr reveals selfless offer from Draymond Green",

    "description": "Kerr reflected Wednesday on not only the heated exchange with his veteran do-it-all forward but also on the state of the Warriors.",
    "fullText": "An especially introspective Steve Kerr told reporters Wednesday that there's beauty in the struggle while he reflected on the state of his Golden State Warriors and the blowup he had with Draymond Green during the third quarter of a 120-97 win over the Orlando Magic two days earlier.\n\nKerr and Green were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout Monday night. After an animated exchange, Green decided to remove himself and left for the Chase Center locker rooms.\n\nAlthough he eventually returned to the bench, he didn't check back into the game.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nKerr said he and his do-it-all forward had a \"great chat\" Wednesday. The longtime Warriors head coach said he and Green apologized to each other as well as to the team.\n\nKerr explained that it was not his finest hour, nor was it a good look for his group.\n\n\"That was a time I needed to be calm in the huddle, and so I regret my actions in that exchange,\" Kerr said Wednesday.\n\n\"These things, they happen, especially when you get two incredibly competitive people like Dray and me. So over the 12 years we've been together, this has happened occasionally, and I'm not proud of it.\"\n\nKerr added: \"I care so much about Draymond, and the relationship we have is like family. And like family, you go through ups and downs. And my No. 1 goal honestly is for him to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting — metaphorically, not literally — and competing together until we're both gone. And I believe that's going to happen because I believe in Draymond, and I believe in myself and I believe in everything we've built for 12 years.\"\n\nFull soundbite of Steve Kerr on the heated exchange with Draymond Green:\n\n“I regret my actions in that exchange and I apologized to Dray, he apologized to me. We both apologized to the team.”\n\nKerr reflected on their 12 years of winning together, expressing his belief in Green. pic.twitter.com/xpWhHFwZoA\n\n— Kenzo Fukuda (@kenzofuku) December 24, 2025\n\nThe Warriors famously selected Green out of Michigan State with the 35th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 draft. Kerr has coached him from the 2014-15 season on. Since, Green has emerged as a four-time All-Star, one-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year and nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. Together, Kerr and Green have won four NBA championships.\n\nWhile Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, and then Kevin Durant, consistently shot the lights out, Green has left his own mark on the organization: with defensive tenacity, heady court vision and physical rebounding, plus timely scoring.\n\n\"We have four banners out there, and obviously a lot of people have played important roles in that, but I've said this before, and I truly believe it. I don't think we have any without Draymond. That's how much he impacts winning.\n\n\"So his ability to channel that passion, that emotion, that raw rage that he has is a key component to what makes us successful. And what I said about the other night, I didn't channel my own raw emotion and rage, of which there is plenty. We are far more alike than anyone would ever realize.\"\n\nKerr cited a long history of turning negative moments into positive momentum during his relationship with Green, who Kerr described as \"very complex.\" While Green has racked up technical fouls and served his fair share of suspensions for outbursts during a 14-season NBA career, he's also known for his basketball acumen and his contemplative commentary.\n\n\"We've always, always found a way to not only bounce back, but to make strides as a result,\" Kerr said, via Warriors reporter Kenzo Fukuda.\n\nWith the win over the Magic, the Warriors improved to 15-15. They've won back-to-back games for the fifth time this season. But they've still yet to string together more than three victories in a row.\n\nThis version of Golden State is spearheaded by Curry, Green and Jimmy Butler III. They're all at least 35 years old. Butler is a Warriors transplant who helped spark a second-half run last season, which ended in the Western Conference semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves after Curry suffered a hamstring strain in the first game of the series.\n\n\"Where we are as a team, as an organization, the most important thing for me is for guys to recognize that there's beauty in the struggle. There's beauty in what we're trying to accomplish right now,\" Kerr said Wednesday, via The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman.\n\n\"We are no longer the '17 Warriors, dominating the league. We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everyone knows that. So what is up to us? How do we carry ourselves night to night? How connected are we? And can we give ourselves another swing at the plate? We did that last year. I was really proud of the team last year. Despite the loss to Minnesota, injury to Steph. Who knows how long we would've gone? But we gave ourselves a chance. That's the goal here.\n\n\"We know where we are. We've got to know who we are, we've got to know what's possible, and we've got to take pride in the struggle, because this is part of life.\"\n\nKerr said he believes sorting out the tiff with Green has been a major step in this Warriors team working through its issues.\n\nHe sees an opportunity for Golden State to make another run like last year's.\n\nAs for Green, Kerr wants him to finish his career in a Warriors uniform.\n\n\"He's undyingly loyal and passionate, and I will go to bat for him as long as I'm coaching him here,\" Kerr said, per Emerman. \"Honestly, I'd go to bat for him 20 years from now when we haven't been together. That's how strongly I feel about him. And that's how I want this thing to end with us, whenever that is.\"",

    "fullText": "Chaim Bloom has made it a priority this offseason to strengthen the team’s pitching staff and depth as a primary goal. After trading veteran starting pitcher Sonny Gray to the Boston Red Sox before Thanksgiving and returning MLB-ready Richard Fitts and minor league upside starter Brandon Clarke, as well as the recent trade of First Basemen Willson Contreras, also to Boston, for Hunter Dobbins, Yhoiker Fajardo, and Blake Aita the front office continues to pursue pitching through trades and free agency. Even if all of the arms acquired this offseason don’t reach the major leagues thats okay because young controllable pitching is the single most sought-after commodity, and the surplus can be used to acquire and upgrade other areas of the roster that may be lacking when the time comes to compete once more. Other names on the block include Brendan Donovan, JoJo Romero, Lars Nootbaar, and Nolan Arenado.\n\nAfter trading away Ryan Helsley, Phil Maton, and Steven Matz at the deadline, non-tendering John King, and all but expecting JoJo Romero to be pitching elsewhere in 2026. Chaim Bloom has publicly spoken about a desire to have a veteran presence in the bullpen to help the young relievers mature as everyday big leaguers. From the outside, they view their pitch to prospective free agents as pointing towards Andrew Kittredge and Phil Maton and point out that if you come to St. Louis for a year, you can re-establish yourself to earn a larger payday where there are innings and opportunity aplenty! If/when JoJo Romero is traded away, the team will only have fringe 40-man arm Nick Raquet from the left side on the 40-man roster. The Cardinals could consider multiple left-handed options if that indeed comes to fruition.\n\nChaim Bloom has staunchly been against promoting players before they are fully ready to move up, which is why I don’t view Quinn Matthews, Brycen Mautz, Pete Hansen, Ixan Henderson, Liam Doyle, etc., as options for the bullpen at the beginning of the 2026 season. Matthews is still trying to master AAA, and none of the other four have even competed in Triple-A, so they don’t know how their stuff will perform with a new variable added to their situation, like pitching with the big league ball.\n\nWhen trying to scope out who could be a potential target or fit, we can look for clues in the profile of arms the team has already acquired under the new leadership’s guided focus. Going back to this year’s draft selecting Liam Doyle and Tanner Franklin, the trade deadline in acquiring Nate Dohm and Frank Ellisalt, the trade for Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke, or even their Rule 5 selection in Matt Pushard. High octane fastball’s appear to be the vogue guiding light for their player development group. Of course, I always bring names to the table. I would never leave you, the reader, without something to chew on or consider, so here are three names from the left side and the right side who bring one of a big fastball, veteran leadership/experience, or a combination of the two!\n\n2025 – 39 G 4.63 ERA 4.25 FIP 3.86 xFIP 32 K 35 IP\n\nBorucki will remind some fans of JoJo Romero as he throws his Slider 41% of the time as his primary pitch and produced a whiff% of 37.7. Overall, he had a .117/.229/.150 with a .188 wOBA against 70 LHB last season. His Sinker sits in the 93-94 range, which is plenty hard enough when batters are trying to decipher between that and an 85 MPH sweeping slider. The 10 MPH of separation between speeds works well to keep hitters off balance and produce some pretty ugly swings and misses. Borucki is probably one of the best available left-handers who offers the combination of stuff, performance, and experience left available on the open market.\n\n2025 – 19 G 8.31 ERA 5.77 FIP 5.18 xFIP 21 K 21.2 IP\n\nFor a pitcher with as much octane as Perez has, he strangely generates a whiff rate below 25%, which is just a little below league average. Perez IS however, a soft contact merchant. His Barrel rate of 2.9% and groundball rate of 60.9 % would both rank in the 99th percentile if he had a qualified number of innings pitched last season. The 16.4 BB% is the real kicker with Cionel, and I don’t know how you remedy that in my limited understanding of pitching mechanics, but perhaps the Cardinals would. Sitting at 95.6 MPH on average from his fastball, he certainly fits the “throws gas” north star the front office has established. .265/.390/.324 .331 wOBA against 43 LHB last season, you can clearly tell that the walks were what bit him. The .324 SLG is more than good enough if Perez can keep the ball in the zone. Busch will keep the ball in the park, and perhaps the Cardinals could catch lightning in a bottle as Perez would be a sought-after commodity with an additional year of club control accruing just over 4 years of service time so far at the deadline if the Cardinals can hone him in.\n\n2025 – 48 G 4.52 ERA 4.57 FIP 4.30 xFIP 53 K 67.2 IP\n\nI talked about Suter at the beginning of the offseason, and I believe his existence on the roster would still add a lot of value. Suter is a Harvard grad and can pitch multiple innings in relief; he can serve as an opener, and he would allow Manager Oli Marmol more flexibility with his bullpen usage. He’s one of the quickest workers in the big leagues, and that matters on 100-degree St. Louis days to keep players from baking in the sun. Suter would also fit PERFECTLY as the bullpen mentor as a reigning Clemente Award nominee. Those are all the “glue” reasons why Suter would fit. His under-the-hood metrics would make him almost the antithesis of our “North Star type.” But, while his average fastball velocity is in the 1st percentile at 87.9, his extension of 7.5 ft put him in the 99th percentile, which, as we know, increases perceived velocity and makes pitches appear to come out faster than they are because theyre being released so much closer than hitters are used to. His average exit velo against is 99th percentile at 85.8 mph, his BB% is low at 6.2%, his hard hit rate is 96th percentile at 32.9%, and he generates groundballs at a 45.4% clip. 18.2 K% is below average but not non-existent, as he’s a veteran who knows how to pitch and can get a strikeout when he needs one. There isn’t a whole lot of upside to be had in this profile, but when you value a Swiss Army knife type pitcher who can pitch in a variety of roles and situations thats valuable to a team with a young staff to help navigate and get through a full 162.\n\n2025 – 65 G 5.30 ERA 4.40 FIP 4.98 xFIP 58 K 56 IP\n\nImagine the flexibility that a roster that contained both Brent Suter and Ryne Stanek would provide! Stanek is a little bit like Cionel Perez in that his inability to throw strikes consistently in 2025 is what really hurt his overall numbers. Stanek can really step on the gas pedal with his average fastball velocity at 98.5 MPH, which had him in the 96th percentile. The 12.5 BB% doesn’t help things, and he’s a flyball pitcher – that CAN work, pitching your home games at Busch. Chaim had Stanek in Tampa Bay and knows just what he’s capable of, having experience pitching in a multitude of roles from opening to closing. Think of Ryan Helsley with Stanek. The fastball is hard but straight, but the slider is the true equalizer, generating an over 45% whiff rate! The numbers Stanek posted last season won’t get him big money this offseason, but he sure provides his next team a lot of tools to work with that could get the most out of him in 2026.\n\n2025 – 30 G 5.08 ERA 4.95 FIP 4.23 xFIP 28 K 33.2 IP\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Shawn Dubin that’s okay. Drafted in the 13th round of the 2018 draft, Dubin throws 6 unique pitches and could be similar to Kyle Leahy before Leahy broke out in 2025. Dubin limits hard contact, keeps the ball on the ground, but is below league average when it comes to strikeout stuff, generating swing and miss, and enticing batters to chase. Dubin is out of minor league options, so the flexibility is very limited, but he has 5 years of remaining control and could be signed to a minor league deal. If the Cardinals felt they could get a higher gear out of his stuff, then it’s possible they could find one of those late-blossoming gems to the already growing group of depth.\n\n2025 – 59 G 4.48 ERA 4.13 FIP 4.48 xFIP 58 K 60.1 IP\n\nRafael Montero will give Cardinals fans Carlos Martinez vibes for sure. Coming from a smaller stature and a whip-like arm motion, it’s very tsunami-esque, so is the erratic command at times. At 14.6 BB% in 2025, that part rings true. It’s 4 pitches that all have positive traits coming out of his hand, and his splitter was a +4 in run value last season to pair with a 95+ mph heater and an above-average breaking ball as well. Montero also has closing experience, with 30 saves credited to him from 2020-2023 as a closer by committee type situation in Houston before the arrival of Josh Hader. Command will always be the biggest question mark with Montero, but for the most part, the results are there, and the Cardinals could entice him with the potential to put him in late-game high-leverage/closing situations that could inevitably lead to a mid-season trade to a contender that would return more prospects to the Cardinals’ growing pipeline.\n\nAre any of these guys true difference makers in the grand scheme of things? Probably not. But the benefit of being in the situation the Cardinals are they can take swings on upside arms like Montero, Stanek, and Perez, but also benefit from veterans like Borucki and Suter, while also having the opportunity to give guys like Dubin a real shot at a big league roster spot. When doing some research on the free agent reliever market this weekend, these were the names remaining that stuck out to me the most, and the ones I think the Cardinals could buy low on and get really good value out of. Ultimately, what the team can accomplish on the trade market will tell the tale of what roster needs will remain heading into spring training, but be certain that more changes to the roster are coming – how soon is anyone’s guess at this point.",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

    "title": "Democrats Just Won Seats in Mississippi. The Supreme Court Could Block a Repeat.",
    "description": "A veteran civil rights attorney won a landmark redistricting case. He fears such wins could soon vanish.",
    "fullText": "The beleaguered Voting Rights Act is on the ropes again — and it may soon suffer a crippling strike.\n\nThe Supreme Court seems on the verge of making it much harder to use the landmark civil rights measure to force states to draw districts where minority candidates stand a strong chance of winning. And a key provision that lets private groups sue under the 60-year-old law could be the next to fall.\n\nThat would be a huge blow to civil rights lawyers like Mississippi’s Carroll Rhodes, who’s spent his career leveraging the Voting Rights Act to increase the political power of Black people and other minorities.\n\n“It becomes almost an impossible hill to climb,” Rhodes told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the VRA has been battered by a series of hits from the increasingly conservative high court. In 2013, the justices knocked out a key pillar of the law by eliminating “pre-clearance” requirements for advance approval of voting changes, including redistricting, in most or all of nine states and a smattering of localities.\n\nIn recent months, petitions have stacked up at the Supreme Court that could lead to the justices wiping out the long-assumed right of private groups and individuals to bring lawsuits under the law. And, earlier this month, the high court blocked a lower court’s Voting Rights Act ruling and gave Texas a green light to redraw its congressional map at President Donald Trump’s request in order to give Republicans up to five additional House seats.\n\nDespite those challenges, litigators like Rhodes have had significant success harnessing the VRA. A lawsuit he pressed forced redistricting and a special election in Mississippi last month led to Black Democrats picking up two additional seats in the state’s House. The incremental gain broke a longstanding GOP supermajority in a state that is nearly 40 percent Black — the highest percentage in the nation. Those sorts of advances for minority representation could come to a halt if the Supreme Court rules against the law.\n\nI reached Rhodes at his law office in the small town of Hazelhurst, Miss. and asked him to take stock of the bruises the VRA has sustained, the threats it faces at the moment and how he’s managed to use the law to advance minority power in his home state.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act has taken a lot of major hits from the Supreme Court in the past couple decades. Many lawyers now see it as teetering on the brink of irrelevance or impotence. What are the stakes in the pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, and whether states doing redistricting can sometimes make use of race to comply with the VRA?\n\nSome people are concerned that the Voting Rights Act might be on its way out, but I'm an eternal optimist. Given that the Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress pursuant to the 15th Amendment, and the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote on an equal basis, not on account of race, to everyone — I think in the Callais case that they're going to resolve that issue in favor of [the law] being upheld.\n\nYou’ve had considerable success in Mississippi with the Voting Rights Act and the state legislature there. Does that confound perceptions that the VRA is at death’s door?\n\nWe have been successful. A lot of civil rights organizations and civil rights opponents have been successful in using the Voting Rights Act to increase the number of Black elected officials.\n\nIn Mississippi, for the most part, whites do not vote for Black candidates in contested elections, and that's why the Voting Rights Act has been so successful in creating Black majority districts.\n\nWhen you have a minority population that's large enough, concentrated enough, and they're in these election districts where they cannot elect candidates of their choice — because the majority population always votes against their candidates of choice — you have to redraw the districts in such a way so you give this large, geographically insular minority group the ability to elect the representative of their choice. And Mississippi's demographics have made it easier for us to be successful here.\n\nHas there been a concrete impact to this?\n\nThere was a time where we had 45 or 50 Black people elected from Black majority districts in the Mississippi Legislature. And there were Black chairmen of different committees, even the powerful committees. But what has happened over the years, more and more white Democrats have left the Democratic Party and gone toward the Republican Party, so now you have a [GOP] supermajority in the Senate. We broke that in this last election.\n\nWhen you break the supermajority in the Senate, money bills, especially taxing and spending, budget, a lot of times it takes a supermajority to get those bills passed. If there is no supermajority, then that means that the Republican leadership within the Senate will have to negotiate with most of the Black people elected as Democrats.\n\nHave those legislators been able to use this effective veto to actually get some spending concessions in terms of, “You're going to spend in this part of the state or on these types of programs?”\n\nWe won't know yet because the special election just took place, and the legislature comes back in January. So, we will see if this cohesive group of Black Democrats can get some concessions.\n\nIn 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the Shelby County decision, which ended the requirement that many states, including Mississippi, most places across the South and a few in the North, had to submit any voting changes — including redistricting — to the Justice Department to get approved. The maps that Mississippi adopted in 2022, which you successfully challenged in court, were they put in place initially because of the Shelby County decision?\n\nThey were able to do it directly because of Shelby County, yes. And John Roberts got it wrong. I agree with Justice Ginsburg who said at the time, it’s like standing up under the umbrella and it's not raining and saying, “Oh, it's not raining, so you can let the umbrella down.” That's what that Roberts decision did: took the umbrella down. And rain is falling everywhere.\n\nUnder the process essentially abandoned after Shelby County, the maps had to be submitted to Washington, and that took place under presidents both Republican and Democrat. The maps that you challenged, do you think President Obama's Justice Department would have approved them? What about President George W. Bush’s Justice Department or President Donald Trump’s Justice Department?\n\nThe Trump Justice Department would have approved them, but no other president. And I'm going to go back to Obama, Biden, Clinton, I'd even go back to Ronald Reagan. The strange thing is that Ronald Reagan initially was opposed to the Voting Rights Act extension in 1982 but wound up signing it and cited it as the crown jewel of American democracy. And so the Trump Justice Department probably is the only one, because the Trump Justice Department had flipped what the purpose of the Voting Rights Act was — to protect minority voters — to say it's to protect white voters.\n\nRoberts has been on the court now for 22 years. The first decade and a half or so, he was viewed uniformly as hostile to voting rights enforcement. That was seen as one of his animating issues. But there have been a few decisions in recent years where the court has not been as aggressive toward the Voting Rights Act as some expected. It seems like Roberts went along with this current Callais case being punted for a year, which basically left those districts in place through the current election cycle. Is there something going on with Roberts? Do you think he has shifted or moderated at all?\n\nMy personal take is that he really is really an incrementalist. He's not for upending longstanding precedent and what the country has become accustomed to. He believes in incremental changes and I think the Shelby County decision came about because he genuinely thought that so much advancement had been made in this area that it was no longer necessary for those protections. And I think after Shelby County, he's seen that those protections are still needed. His views might be moderating somewhat. He might see the damage that Shelby County decision has caused.\n\nYou've had this span of four or five decades to look at how these things have developed. How has technology changed this process of redistricting? Has it made it easier for those trying to dilute the power of minority voters to do that, and have people on your side of the fight been able to harness that technology in any similar fashion to fight back against those efforts?\n\nWhen I first started out in this area, the map drawers used maps and pencils and even had notepads to add before the calculators came. Then calculators and then the programs and social science has developed over the years, too. Statistical analysis has become more and more sophisticated, and the technology has become more and more sophisticated.\n\nMy take is that whoever writes the algorithm, whoever writes the code, the code can be written in such a way that it could lead to more discrimination and make it harder to undo.\n\nWe do have folks on our side who are using technology, but technology was used in the Texas case to draw districts in such a way that discriminated against Black and Latino voters in Texas.\n\nYou were a teenager when a lot of these landmark civil rights laws were passed in the ‘60s. Do you personally have memories of what the Jim Crow South was like? Did any of your relatives experience some of these more bizarre tests that were used for decades before that to exclude Black people from voting, like, ‘How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?’ or ‘How many jelly beans are in the jar?’\n\nOh, yes. I was born in ‘51. I grew up in a segregated neighborhood, went to an all-Black high school, segregated high school, segregated elementary school. I remember going to the dentist. And the dentist office had two entrances, one for white, one for “colored,” and going through the white side, they had air conditioning. They had magazines. The “colored” side did not.\n\nWe had field trips to the courthouse, where the courthouse had white and “colored” water fountains. And we had to sit in the balcony. I remember a third grade field trip to the courthouse and we watched a trial where a white lawyer was defending a Black man accused of some crime. And he was saying, “This was a good Nigra” — N-I-G-R-A.\n\nAnd so I grew up through it and I also remember my parents when the Voting Rights Act was first passed, and they did have federal registrars around, but all of the neighbors, my parents and everybody not only did they go and register to vote, they voted in every election, no matter what.\n\nThere were people telling us stories. Tim Winston owned a funeral home here and he was one of the few Black people who was able to register prior to the Voting Rights Act being passed, and he told stories of how they were turning away Black folks by asking them ridiculous questions. So, yeah, I remember, personally, stories of how hard it was before the Voting Rights Act was passed and after it was passed.\n\nIf the Voting Rights Act Section Two were to be knocked out and it wasn't a tool you could use anymore, what would be the strategy after that? Would that mean there's no option for civil rights groups? What is the world going to look like if the VRA is not available for private groups to litigate?\n\nIt almost becomes an impossible hill to climb. You have to go back to the 15th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult, or the 14th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult. All a legislative body has to do is say, “We didn't draw the district based on race. We drew them based on partisanship, and they're entitled to the presumption that there was a good faith effort to do that, and it's hard.” We had overwhelming evidence in Texas that partisanship was not the real reason. If that cannot overcome a presumption that the legislator was acting in good faith, going forward, it's going to be impossible to prove a racial gerrymandering claim.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the federal Constitution puts no limits on partisan gerrymandering, even as the justices continue to aggressively police use of race in redistricting. Is that line meaningful?\n\nRace and party, in Mississippi, there’s no distinction. It’s a fiction.",

    "fullText": "Denzel Perryman quickly listed name after name as he dove deep into his mental roster of the 2015 Chargers.\n\nManti Teʻo, Melvin Ingram, Kavell Conner and Donald Butler took Perryman under their wing, the Chargers linebacker said. The 11-year veteran said he relied on older teammates when he entered the NFL as they helped him adjust to the schedule and regimen of professional football.\n\n“When I was a young guy,” Perryman said, “my head was all over the place — just trying to get the gist of the NFL. They taught me how to be where my mind is.”\n\nWith the Chargers (10-4) entering the final stretch of the season and on the cusp of clinching a playoff berth heading into Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1), veterans have played an important role in the team winning six of its last seven games.\n\nA win over the Cowboys coupled with either a loss or tie by the Houston Texans on Sunday afternoon or an Indianapolis Colts loss or tie on Monday night would secure a playoff berth for the Chargers.\n\nPerryman, who recorded a season-best nine tackles in the Chargers' win over the Kansas City Chiefs last week, credits Philip Rivers and the rest of the Chargers' veterans for showing him \"how to be a pro\" a decade ago. Now he's passing along those lessons to younger players in a transfer of generational knowledge across the Chargers' locker room.\n\n“When I came in as a young guy, I thought this happens every year,” safety Derwin James Jr. said of winning, starting his career on a 12-4 Chargers team in 2018. “Remember the standard. Remember, whatever we're doing now, to uphold the standard, so that way, when guys change, coaches change, anything changes, the standard remains.”\n\nRunning off the field at Arrowhead Stadium, third-year safety Daiyan Henley charged at a celebrating Tony Jefferson, a veteran mentor at his position who was waiting for teammates after being ejected for an illegal hit on Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton.\n\nAfter the game Jefferson and Henley hopped around like schoolchildren on the playground. That’s the atmosphere the veterans want to create, Jefferson said, one in which younger players in the secondary can turn to him.\n\n“That's what we're here for,” Jefferson said. “For them to watch us and follow, follow our lead, and see how we do our thing.”\n\nIt's not just the veteran stars that are making a difference. Marcus Williams, a 29-year-old safety with 109 games of NFL experience, replaced Jefferson against the Chiefs after being elevated from the practice squad. The 2017 second-round pick played almost every snap in Jefferson's place, collecting four tackles.\n\n\"That just starts with the culture coach [Jim] Harbaugh creates,” defensive coordinator Jesse Minter said. “It's really a 70-man roster.\"\n\nHarbaugh highlighted defensive lineman/fullback Scott Matlock’s blocking technique — a ba-boop, ba-boop, as Harbaugh put it and mimed with his arms — on designed runs as an example of a veteran bolstering an offensive line trying to overcome the absence of Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater.\n\nHarbaugh said his father, Jack, taught Matlock the ba-boop, ba-boop blocking technique during an August practice.\n\n\"He's severely underrated as an athlete,” quarterback Justin Herbert said of the 6-foot-4, 296-pound Matlock, who also catches passes in the flat as a fullback.\n\nWith three games left in the regular season, Jefferson said the focus is on replicating the postseason-like efforts they gave in consecutive wins over the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“It was good that they were able to get a taste of that,” Jefferson said of his younger teammates playing against last season's Super Bowl teams, “because these games down the stretch are really what's to come in the playoffs.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Steve Hanke, a veteran economist, said he can't sleep at night thinking about inflation and high stock prices in the US.",
    "fullText": "What keeps the money doctor up at night?\n\nSteve Hanke, a veteran economist and applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said there are two significant problems in the US economy and markets that are keeping him from getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne is inflation, which he thinks could start to spiral out of the Fed's control.\n\nThe other is high stock prices, which will start crashing back to earth, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"What is keeping me up at night is the idea that the Fed is going to be unable to hit its inflation target in 2026,\" the veteran economist and commodities trader wrote.\n\n\"As far as the stock market is concerned, my Dr. X's Bubble Detector is sitting at an all-time high, indicating that we are in a bubble,\" he added of equity prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, there are a few signs that price growth in the US is starting to heat up again. Headline inflation was cooler than expected in November, but still considerably above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nHanke, who has described himself as a \"money doctor\" and has long held the view that the money supply is a key driver of inflation, also pointed to the recent growth in the M2 money supply. That's a measure of the amount of cash flowing around the economy, and it has climbed by $3.5 trillion over the past five years, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\n\"For me, that is the most important metric,\" Hanke said of the inflation outlook. \"It looks like the money supply is going to be goosed, if not over-goosed.\"\n\nThere are a few developments that look like they can stoke inflation leading into the next year, Hanke said:\n\n\"My concern is that, after letting the money supply explode in 2020-21 and imposing inflation on Americans, the Fed has failed to put the inflation Genie back in the bottle,\" Hanke said.\n\nThe outlook for the stock market doesn't look much better, in Hanke's view. He pointed to bloated valuations in the tech sector as the mania for artificial intelligence reaches new heights.\n\n\"As far as the warning signs concerning the course of an AI bubble, you will never know when you will realize a Wile E. Coyote moment,\" he said, later adding that he advised investors to rebalance their portfolios.\n\nHanke, known for his persistently bearish forecasts for markets and the economy, has long forewarned of trouble heading for the US. In October, he speculated that AI companies today could eventually see a dot-com-style fate once they started missing their growth forecasts.\n\nLast year, he also doubled down on his call that the US economy was headed for a recession, but told Business Insider he had recently started leaning away from that stance on account of hotter inflation.",

    "fullText": "NBA Insider says Lakers interested in Pelicans' Herb Jones originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrade talks surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers are heating up, and the Lakers appear to be in pursuit of a veteran forward.\n\nAccording to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Lakers are pursuing New Orleans Pelicans wing Herb Jones.\n\n“The Los Angeles Lakers are monitoring the trade market for a defensive wing upgrade, league sources told HoopsHype. Among the 3-and-D wing upgrades on their wish list is New Orleans Pelicans forward Herb Jones, league sources say.”\n\nJones is widely considered one of the NBA’s top defenders. He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes certain loves take immense detours and then come back, sometimes football can deliver surprising returns. Rhetoric aside, Serie A has taught us that age can be just a number, and so the possibility of seeing Thiago Silva in Serie A again is not so remote.\n\nWatch all of Serie BKT live on OneFootball for only €9.99 per month. \n\nAfter Modric’s arrival in August, the return of the Brazilian defender to Milan is making fans dream, but above all, it could rewrite a record that was broken only this summer. It’s all about turning 41 last September.\n\nCurrently, Edin Dzeko holds the record as the oldest outfield player to return to Serie A, signing with Fiorentina at 39 years and 3 months. Before him, however, other big names made history:\n\nBruno Alves (Parma) – 36 years and 7 months\n\nTomas Danilevicius (Parma) – 35 years and 11 months\n\nCiro Immobile (Bologna) – 35 years and 4 months\n\nLuca Toni (Fiorentina) – 35 years and 3 months\n\nAlexis Sanchez (Inter) – 34 years and 8 months\n\nRoberto Donadoni (Milan) – 34 years and 6 months\n\nGeorges Grün (Reggiana) – 34 years and 5 months\n\nOliver Bierhoff (Chievo Verona) – 34 years and 3 months\n\nIf Thiago Silva’s return were to happen, the Brazilian would make his comeback at 41 years and 4 months, surpassing everyone and bringing experience and solidity to the Rossoneri defense.\n\nA “monstrous” age that would place him among the oldest players ever to set foot on a Serie A pitch, a list led by legendary goalkeepers:\n\n🧤 Marco Ballotta (Lazio) – 44 years and 1 month\n\n🧤 Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus) – 43 years and 3 months\n\n🧤 Pepe Reina (Como) – 42 years and 8 months\n\n🧤 Francesco Antonioli (Cesena) – 42 years and 7 months\n\n🧤 Gianluca Pegolo (Sassuolo) – 41 years and 9 months\n\n🧤 Alberto Fontana (Palermo) – 41 years and 9 months\n\n🧤 Roberto Colombo (Cagliari) – 41 years and 7 months\n\n🎯 Zlatan Ibrahimović (Milan) – 41 years and 5 months\n\n🧤 Dino Zoff (Juventus) – 41 years and 2 months\n\n🧱 Alessandro Costacurta (Milan) – 41 years and 25 days\n\nThiago Silva would not only bring impressive numbers, but also leadership and defensive solidity that Milan could take advantage of in the second half of the season.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins made a quiet but smart move on Wednesday, agreeing to a minor league contract with right-handed pitcher Dan Altavilla, according to Francys Romero.\n\nThe 33-year-old reliever is expected to receive a non-roster invite to major league spring training, where he will compete for a spot in the Twins' bullpen.\n\ntwins add reliever dan altavilla to the mix \n\naltavilla added a changeup last year and saw some success with it (.172 baa 36% whiff) \n\nif he could add a little more glove side movement out of that slider he’s got a solid arsenal to work with pic.twitter.com/iGmYVtxuCw\n\n— parker hageman (@HagemanParker) December 18, 2025\n\nAltavilla comes to Minnesota after spending the 2025 season with the Chicago White Sox, where he posted a solid 2.48 ERA across 29 innings in 28 relief appearances.\n\nThe veteran right-hander also recorded two saves and showed he can still get outs at the big league level after missing most of the previous three seasons due to Tommy John surgery and other injuries.\n\nThe Twins finished the 2025 season with a 70-92 record, placing fourth in the AL Central and missing the playoffs.\n\nA big reason for their struggles was the bullpen, which was gutted at the trade deadline when the team dealt away several key relievers including Jhoan Duran and Griffin Jax.\n\nExcited for this opportunity with the @Twins 🔥 pic.twitter.com/61MHWn8jqE\n\n— Dan Altavilla (@DanAlt3225) December 18, 2025\n\nHeading into the offseason, Minnesota's relief corps was thin and in need of depth.\n\nJustin Topa, Cole Sands, and Kody Funderburk appear to be the only pitchers locked into opening day bullpen roles, which leaves plenty of room for a veteran like Altavilla to earn a spot.\n\nThe Twins were also linked to right-hander Brad Keller before he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so adding Altavilla helps fill that gap.\n\nAltavilla's best weapon is his fastball, which still sits in the 96-97 MPH range and can overpower hitters when he locates it well.\n\nHe also throws a sinker that generated ground balls at a strong 51.3 percent clip in 2025, along with a slider and a changeup he developed last season with Chicago.\n\nThe Sox may well see plenty of former pitcher Dan Altavilla next year, as the veteran reliever has just signed a minor league contract with the Twins.\n\nHe had a 2.48 ERA in 29 appearances during his one year with the Sox this season. pic.twitter.com/IFmuL1zZtM\n\n— SleeperWhiteSox (@SleeperWhiteSox) December 18, 2025\n\nThe concerns with Altavilla are in his command and strikeout numbers.\n\nHis 17.5% strikeout rate and 12.5 percent walk rate in 2025 were both worse than the league average, and his 5.45 FIP suggests some regression could be coming.\n\nBut for a minor league deal with no guaranteed money, the risk is low and the upside is real if the Twins can help him refine his control.\n\nDan Altavilla, Filthy Sinkers. 😷 pic.twitter.com/9WwyBX526v\n\n— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 10, 2025\n\nThe Pennsylvania native has spent parts of eight seasons in the big leagues with four different teams, including Seattle, San Diego, Kansas City, and Chicago.\n\nHe knows what it takes to pitch in the majors, and his experience could be valuable for a young Twins team looking to rebuild.\n\nFor Minnesota, Altavilla represents exactly the kind of low-cost addition they need to make this offseason. If he earns a roster spot, he could provide solid middle relief innings.\n\nIf not, the Twins lose nothing. Either way, it is a smart gamble for a team looking to get back on track in 2026.",

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will be without wide receiver Davante Adams for the Week 16 game against the Seattle Seahawks, which will have huge playoff implications.\n\nAdams landed on the injury report once again this week with a hamstring issue. He was on the Week 15 injury report with the hamstring, also, but aggravated the issue and was forced to exit last week's game early.\n\nAdams didn't practice at all this week before drawing the doubtful tag and being ruled out on Thursday night ahead of kickoff.\n\nHere's what we know about his return timeline.\n\nAt this point, Adams should be considered week to week.\n\nAdams' injury isn't a season-ending issue, so he will be back at some point. When that is, remains to be seen.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport said earlier on Thursday that the hope is Adams could return next week, but that is far from certain.\n\n\"So, don't expect him to play tonight, but the hope is, next game, if there's enough time to recover, we could see Davante out there.\"\n\nBut, earlier in the week, Rapoport floated the possibility that Adams could miss the rest of the regular season with his hamstring injury.\n\n\"There are only a couple types of injuries this time of year: there's an injury where a guy is fine, there's an injury where he's back for the playoffs, and then he's done,\" Rapoport said. \"The hope is that this is one of those he's back for the playoffs.\"\n\nWhat Adams has going for him next week is the Rams will enjoy a mini-bye thanks to their Thursday night game in Week 16, giving him 11 days with Los Angeles playing on Monday night in Week 17.\n\nAnother positive for Adams was his ability to do at least some work in pre-game warm-ups on Thursday night.\n\nWe should get our next update on Adams at the top of next week, but if not it won't come any later than Thursday, when Los Angeles drops its first injury report of the week.\n\nWhy CeeDee Lamb's 2 missed practices aren't a concern for Week 16\n\nQuinn Ewers can end 21-year drought for Texas quarterbacks\n\nBroncos' NFL record could be shattered by Dolphins in 2026\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt’s safe to say the Los Angeles Lakers will look a bit different by the time the Feb. 5 trade deadline passes.\n\nThe franchise has plenty of tradable assets it can use in a midseason deal to upgrade its roster. Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk is under the impression that Luka Doncic’s 6-foot-10 former Dallas Mavericks teammate is among the assets the Lakers will move on from this season.\n\n“The Golden State Warriors proved last season why it can be advantageous to make a move early,” Rovenchuk wrote Friday. “They acquired Dennis Schroder, gave the experiment a shot, and rerouted him in favor of eventually securing Jimmy Butler when the initial venture failed.”\n\n“If the Lakers were going to replicate a similar approach, there is one clear member of the roster who stands out as a part of the outgoing package for Los Angeles. That would be Maxi Kleber.”\n\n“Kleber has been sidelined recently, dealing with a lower back injury. With the Lakers struggling to find defense, athleticism, shooting, and bench scoring, any one of these needs could have him moved before even being given the opportunity to return to the court for Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile it may not be easy to believe, Kleber was once a valuable stretch four who played respectable pick-and-pop basketball alongside Doncic in Los Angeles.\n\nFast forward to the 2025-26 season, and Kleber, who was included in the blockbuster Feb. 2 trade that landed Doncic with the Lakers, is a low-impact contributor for JJ Redick’s crew.\n\nWhile Kleber is shooting 37.5% from three, he’s contributing just 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game in 12.1 minutes, signaling that it may be time to part ways with the 33-year-old big man.\n\nIf one thing’s certain, Kleber is running out of time to prove himself in Los Angeles.\n\nMore NBA: Spurs' Stephon Castle makes basketball history never done ever before in NBA",

    "fullText": "Report: Cubs ink deal with veteran left-handed reliever originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJust one day after the conclusion of the 2025 MLB Winter Meetings, multiple relievers found new homes for 2026 and beyond.\n\nThat included left-hander Hoby Milner, as according to Michael Cerami of Bleacher Nation, Miler and the Chicago Cubs are in agreement on a contract. The length and salary of the contract is not yet known.\n\nMilner seemed like he was destined to head to Chicago prior to the 2025 season. The Cubs were in need of left-handed bullpen help and with Milner's background in Milwaukee with current manager Craig Counsell, a pairing of the two sides made perfect sense. That ultimately didn't happen, and Milner headed to Texas to pitch for the Rangers last season.\n\nThe version of Milner that Chicago will be getting is an intriguing question. Is it the 1.82 ERA and 1.7 WAR in 2023? Or is it the -0.6 WAR each of the previous two seasons with a 3.84 ERA being the lowest of those respective seasons? The Cubs obviously hope it is the 2023 version, but the previous two seasons have not indicated that the old version will be returning.\n\nChicago is expected to remain in the market for bullpen arms, a group that was a strength down the stretch last season.\n\nMore MLB: Cubs predicted to trade for $6.5 million All-Star ace to create 1-2 punch with Shota Imanaga",

Rivers was already seen on the Colts practice field during Wednesday’s indoor practice, repping his #17.\n\nIt may not mean much, but Rivers likely would’ve looked weird with another jersey number (and we all know #18 was already unavailable!)\n\nIt’s best to have the 44-year-old quarterback most comfortable resuming his pro career, and it also provides Colts fans who bought a Rivers jersey back in 2020 the opportunity to wear a current one again—without any change to a new jersey number for the remainder of this year.",

    "fullText": "LSU football will take the field for the Texas Bowl without three key starters. According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "title": "The Devils Should Target Ryan O’Reilly Before They Target Steven Stamkos",
    "description": "The Devils are interested in a couple veteran Nashville Predators. Here’s why only one of them is worth pursuing.",
    "fullText": "The trade winds are starting to blow in the NHL, and with the New Jersey Devils recent skid, cries have started coming out from all corners of the internet and the Devils fanbase for GM Tom Fitzgerald to do something before these recent struggles derails the season.\n\nElliotte Friedman reported Saturday that Fitzgerald is indeed looking around and gauging what the market looks like. Not only have the Devils been linked to Quinn Hughes, but they’ve also been linked to Ryan O’Reilly and Steven Stamkos of the Nashville Predators.\n\nI don’t really have much more else to add about the Quinn Hughes situation, as I’ve said my piece on that matter last week. Fitzgerald wouldn’t be doing his job if he wasn’t checking in on the availability of one of the best defensemen in the NHL….never mind the fact he’s also the brother of two players already on the Devils. The Devils having interest in Quinn Hughes isn’t some manufactured thing that is just being thrown out there willy nilly for clicks. It’s a very real possibility that it could happen, so of course Fitzgerald is going to check in there.\n\nWith that said, I haven’t said much about the Ryan O’Reilly and/or Steven Stamkos situation, aside from what I wrote about those players last season. But I think if it came down to one or the other, the choice is clear.\n\nThe Devils should prioritize O’Reilly over Stamkos.\n\nThe Devils went into the season with a plan of having Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier, and Cody Glass as their Top 3 centers, with Luke Glendening apparently winning the 4C job over Juho Lammikko after impressing in training camp on a PTO.\n\nAfter free agency came and went, I figured that the Devils plan was to make Dawson Mercer the 3C and have Cody Glass be the 4C, but apparently I was wrong.\n\nAll of this was always a questionable plan at best.\n\nSay what you will about Jack Hughes’s injury history, and say that you will about how fluky this year’s injury was with Hughes getting injured at a team dinner of all settings. Considering Hughes’s history, it would not have been unreasonable for Fitzgerald to come up with a better alternative than “just shift Mercer to center” in case Hughes missed time again. And sure enough, Hughes missed time again. It might be the flukiest of fluky flukes to ever fluke, but its still a failure from an organizational level to properly prepare for this potential scenario that had a realistic chance of happening.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Devils nearly let Cody Glass walk away in free agency before they thought better of it when it was apparent he would be scooped up quickly if he hit the open market. Add in the fact that Glass has his own injury history since coming to the Devils. Add in that Nico Hischier bears the brunt of playing in all situations and playing the toughest minutes of anyone on the roster. And add in the fact that the Devils plan for 4C was taking a flier on the winner of a training camp competition between a player who had been out of the NHL for a few seasons and a PTO signing.\n\nThis might be a bit of a simplistic take on my part, but its not a coincidence or an accident that when the Devils have looked their best this season, it has been when their centers were healthy and available. The top lines worked and all showed cohesion. It’s also not a coincidence or accident that Mercer himself has looked the best he’s looked when playing on Nico Hischier’s wing rather than centering his own line.\n\nNo, there’s no replacing a player like Jack Hughes when he misses time, but you give yourself a better shot of treading water when you have an NHL caliber option who can slide into that spot. Adding a player like O’Reilly would make a huge difference for this group. And what about when you get Hughes back? All of a sudden you have an embarrassment of riches at a critically important position. Where Ryan O’Reilly is an overqualified 3C and Cody Glass is an overqualified 4C.\n\nGo back and look at the center depth on the most recent Stanley Cup champions. Where the Panthers had Anton Lundell as their 3C throughout their run. Where the Golden Knights had some combination of Jack Eichel, Chandler Stephenson, and William Karlsson down the middle. Where the Lightning won their Cups with Yanni Gourde as their 3C, but they were also deep enough to move Anthony Cirelli or Brayden Point there when needed. Where until this season, the Avs weren’t the same after losing Nazem Kadri. I’d keep going on and on but you understand the point I’m trying to make.\n\nYou need to be deep down the middle if you want to be taken seriously as a championship contender. You need to be deep down the middle if you want to maximize the wingers you’ve brought in. The Devils are not.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Ryan O’Reilly is the same two-way player he was when he won a Selke trophy in St. Louis. He turns 35 years old later this season and while he’s still effective, he is approaching the 1200 game milestone.\n\nThat said, with 21 points in 28 games, he’s still more than capable of chipping in offensively. He’s more than capable of playing in all situations and holding his own.\n\nI’m also not suggesting that Nico Hischier isn’t capable of handling everything that he handles in his on-ice role. But wouldn’t Hischier potentially be more valuable to the Devils if the team had another alternative who could take some of those defensive obligations off of his plate? Jack Hughes is better defensively than he gets credit for, but nobody is going to confuse him for Patrice Bergeron in terms of being a Selke-caliber defensive forward. Cody Glass doesn’t contribute much on the penalty kill (he’s only played 2:58 there this year). Luke Glendening does play on the kill, but he’s a fairly limited player at this stage of his career. Anything you get from him offensively is a bonus.\n\nAdding a player like O’Reilly and leaning on him to play those minutes should have a positive impact on the Devils penalty kill, which ranks 17th in the league as of this writing. And it should give the Devils another option at 5v5 as well.\n\nSteven Stamkos was already on the decline when he left the Tampa Bay Lightning, and things haven’t looked better through his first season plus as a member of the Nashville Predators. He’s not really a center anymore, despite Predators coach Andrew Brunette shifting him between center and wing in an attempt to give them a spark. He doesn’t drive play anymore, he’s not shooting as much as he has in the past, he’s no longer an elite level skater, he’s not much of a defensive forward, and he no longer has elite level players alongside him like he did in Tampa.\n\nYes, Stamkos could potentially chip in a little bit offensively on the power play. And yes, he might look better playing with better players than Luke Evangelista on his line. I would guess that the Devils envision him playing alongside Jack Hughes and Jesper Bratt and burying the feeds that he used to get from elite level playmakers like Nikita Kucherov.\n\nBut the Devils don’t really need another overpaid player who barely does anything at 5v5. They already have one of those in Ondrej Palat, and Stamkos’s contract is even worse.\n\nThe 2025-26 Devils need stability down the middle more than they need a scoring winger. They needed this before Jack Hughes got hurt and that need is only exasperated the more we see they don’t have an answer at such a critically important position. And even if one believed the opposite was true, the last thing the Devils need is a soon-to-be 36-year-old Stamkos, who is under contract for $8M AAV for two more seasons after this one. I don’t even know how the Devils would make that contract fit given their current cap situation, but I know I want no part of that.\n\nOn the flip side, O’Reilly is under contract for $4.5M AAV for one more season after this one, which is more than reasonable for a middle six center. I get that with him being a year younger than Stamkos, he’s not exactly a spring chicken either, but I think its clear that O’Reilly has more left in the tank than Stamkos, and its not nearly as onerous a commitment either.\n\nObviously, this is all dependant on asking price, and there might wind up being other options that make themselves available as the season rolls along. But it certainly sounds like the Predators are open for business, and with how tight the NHL standings are, the teams that separate themselves from the pack are likely going to be the ones who are proactive fixing their issues with their rosters rather than being reactive and waiting until the deadline for prices to go down.\n\nWhat gives me pause is sitting by and doing nothing isn’t going to do anything to fix the issue. Not only is it not acceptable for this team and where they are on their timeline, I think we’ve seen enough mediocre to bad hockey to know that its not going to magically fix itself. I pointed out when I broke down every trade Fitzgerald has made that only once did he go out early in the season and make a trade to address a glaring hole. It was a bad one. It was acquiring Jon Gillies.",

    "description": "LPGA winners Ryann O'Toole, Hinako Shibuno and Jodi Ewart Shadoff all re-earn their full playing privileges in Q-Series Final",
    "fullText": "Ryann O’Toole didn’t imagine she would put this on her December itinerary, but there she was playing golf in Alabama this past week trying to salvage her LPGA Tour card. It was a wise decision.\n\nThe 38-year-old O’Toole, a UCLA alum who first gained recognition as a competitor on Golf Channel’s “Big Break,” has won one tournament on tour, and she has the chance to add more titles after shooting a bogey-free 65 with seven birdies on Tuesday in the final round of LPGA Q-Series Final Qualifying in Mobile. In the event shortened from 90 holes to 72 because of a day lost to bad weather, O’Toole finished tied for third at 11 under and was the top American qualifier. The top 25 and ties earned their tour card, with 31 golfers being the final total at Robert Trent Jones Trail Magnolia Grove.\n\nO’Toole has 20 career top-10s, but she made the cut in only half her 16 starts in 2025, with no top-10s, and finished 137th on the CME Points Rankings.\n\n“The last time I was here [at Q-Series] was 2014, and I told myself after that week, I never want to have to be back,” O’Toole said. “But you never know what happens, and here I was back having to re-qualify. It's stressful, it's a grind, it's mentally and emotionally draining. Then this week, with just the weather, I mean it being freezing, the delays, the rain, every single morning was early. … It became a physical grind.\n\n“I just think there's so much emotion that goes into this that it is a tough week. With 15 years on tour, there are mixed emotions going into it. I wasn't sure if I was even going to decide to go back to Q School or if I was just going to start the next chapter of my life. But at the same time it would be really weird to start January 1 and go, ‘What do you mean I don't have full status? What do you mean? I'm not a professional on the LPGA?’ That wasn't OK for me.”\n\nGerman golfer Helen Briem earned her LPGA Tour card in impressive fashion. She shot a four-under 68 to earn medalist honors at 13 under. Briem, 20, moves to the LPGA after having played on the Ladies European Tour.\n\n“Right now, I'm a bit lost for words. I entered this week with not a lot of expectations,” said Brie. “But, overall, I'm really happy that I am able to play LPGA next year, and that’s really cool.”\n\nMajor winner Hinako Shibuno, arguably the most popular Japanese golfer, got her tour card back again, too. The 2019 AIG Women’s British Open champion made it on the number at five under after closing with a 72. Shibuno, 27, struggled on the LPGA this season, making just 10 cuts in 23 starts while notching only one top-10 finish.\n\nAnother veteran to re-earn her card is former European Solheim Cup player Jodi Ewart Shadoff. The 37-year-old, who won her lone LPGA title in 2022 and has top-10 finishes in three of the tour’s five majors, shot 71 and was among the final eight players who tied for 24th.\n\nAmong the notable players who missed getting their cards was 17-year-old Floridian Gianna Clemente, who turned pro this year, advanced through Second Stage and fell three shots off the cut. Kim Kaufman, 34, who battled breast cancer this year and finished chemotherapy in the summer, finished at four over. Among the past college stars who didn’t get their cards were 2023 U.S. Women’s Amateur champion and Auburn alum Megan Schofill (even par), 2024 NCAA individual champion Adela Cernousek of Texas A&M (16 over), USC’s Amari Avery (one under) and Wake Forest’s Rachel Kuehn (eight over).",
