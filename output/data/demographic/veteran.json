    "description": "A veteran civil rights attorney won a landmark redistricting case. He fears such wins could soon vanish.",
    "fullText": "The beleaguered Voting Rights Act is on the ropes again — and it may soon suffer a crippling strike.\n\nThe Supreme Court seems on the verge of making it much harder to use the landmark civil rights measure to force states to draw districts where minority candidates stand a strong chance of winning. And a key provision that lets private groups sue under the 60-year-old law could be the next to fall.\n\nThat would be a huge blow to civil rights lawyers like Mississippi’s Carroll Rhodes, who’s spent his career leveraging the Voting Rights Act to increase the political power of Black people and other minorities.\n\n“It becomes almost an impossible hill to climb,” Rhodes told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the VRA has been battered by a series of hits from the increasingly conservative high court. In 2013, the justices knocked out a key pillar of the law by eliminating “pre-clearance” requirements for advance approval of voting changes, including redistricting, in most or all of nine states and a smattering of localities.\n\nIn recent months, petitions have stacked up at the Supreme Court that could lead to the justices wiping out the long-assumed right of private groups and individuals to bring lawsuits under the law. And, earlier this month, the high court blocked a lower court’s Voting Rights Act ruling and gave Texas a green light to redraw its congressional map at President Donald Trump’s request in order to give Republicans up to five additional House seats.\n\nDespite those challenges, litigators like Rhodes have had significant success harnessing the VRA. A lawsuit he pressed forced redistricting and a special election in Mississippi last month led to Black Democrats picking up two additional seats in the state’s House. The incremental gain broke a longstanding GOP supermajority in a state that is nearly 40 percent Black — the highest percentage in the nation. Those sorts of advances for minority representation could come to a halt if the Supreme Court rules against the law.\n\nI reached Rhodes at his law office in the small town of Hazelhurst, Miss. and asked him to take stock of the bruises the VRA has sustained, the threats it faces at the moment and how he’s managed to use the law to advance minority power in his home state.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act has taken a lot of major hits from the Supreme Court in the past couple decades. Many lawyers now see it as teetering on the brink of irrelevance or impotence. What are the stakes in the pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, and whether states doing redistricting can sometimes make use of race to comply with the VRA?\n\nSome people are concerned that the Voting Rights Act might be on its way out, but I'm an eternal optimist. Given that the Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress pursuant to the 15th Amendment, and the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote on an equal basis, not on account of race, to everyone — I think in the Callais case that they're going to resolve that issue in favor of [the law] being upheld.\n\nYou’ve had considerable success in Mississippi with the Voting Rights Act and the state legislature there. Does that confound perceptions that the VRA is at death’s door?\n\nWe have been successful. A lot of civil rights organizations and civil rights opponents have been successful in using the Voting Rights Act to increase the number of Black elected officials.\n\nIn Mississippi, for the most part, whites do not vote for Black candidates in contested elections, and that's why the Voting Rights Act has been so successful in creating Black majority districts.\n\nWhen you have a minority population that's large enough, concentrated enough, and they're in these election districts where they cannot elect candidates of their choice — because the majority population always votes against their candidates of choice — you have to redraw the districts in such a way so you give this large, geographically insular minority group the ability to elect the representative of their choice. And Mississippi's demographics have made it easier for us to be successful here.\n\nHas there been a concrete impact to this?\n\nThere was a time where we had 45 or 50 Black people elected from Black majority districts in the Mississippi Legislature. And there were Black chairmen of different committees, even the powerful committees. But what has happened over the years, more and more white Democrats have left the Democratic Party and gone toward the Republican Party, so now you have a [GOP] supermajority in the Senate. We broke that in this last election.\n\nWhen you break the supermajority in the Senate, money bills, especially taxing and spending, budget, a lot of times it takes a supermajority to get those bills passed. If there is no supermajority, then that means that the Republican leadership within the Senate will have to negotiate with most of the Black people elected as Democrats.\n\nHave those legislators been able to use this effective veto to actually get some spending concessions in terms of, “You're going to spend in this part of the state or on these types of programs?”\n\nWe won't know yet because the special election just took place, and the legislature comes back in January. So, we will see if this cohesive group of Black Democrats can get some concessions.\n\nIn 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the Shelby County decision, which ended the requirement that many states, including Mississippi, most places across the South and a few in the North, had to submit any voting changes — including redistricting — to the Justice Department to get approved. The maps that Mississippi adopted in 2022, which you successfully challenged in court, were they put in place initially because of the Shelby County decision?\n\nThey were able to do it directly because of Shelby County, yes. And John Roberts got it wrong. I agree with Justice Ginsburg who said at the time, it’s like standing up under the umbrella and it's not raining and saying, “Oh, it's not raining, so you can let the umbrella down.” That's what that Roberts decision did: took the umbrella down. And rain is falling everywhere.\n\nUnder the process essentially abandoned after Shelby County, the maps had to be submitted to Washington, and that took place under presidents both Republican and Democrat. The maps that you challenged, do you think President Obama's Justice Department would have approved them? What about President George W. Bush’s Justice Department or President Donald Trump’s Justice Department?\n\nThe Trump Justice Department would have approved them, but no other president. And I'm going to go back to Obama, Biden, Clinton, I'd even go back to Ronald Reagan. The strange thing is that Ronald Reagan initially was opposed to the Voting Rights Act extension in 1982 but wound up signing it and cited it as the crown jewel of American democracy. And so the Trump Justice Department probably is the only one, because the Trump Justice Department had flipped what the purpose of the Voting Rights Act was — to protect minority voters — to say it's to protect white voters.\n\nRoberts has been on the court now for 22 years. The first decade and a half or so, he was viewed uniformly as hostile to voting rights enforcement. That was seen as one of his animating issues. But there have been a few decisions in recent years where the court has not been as aggressive toward the Voting Rights Act as some expected. It seems like Roberts went along with this current Callais case being punted for a year, which basically left those districts in place through the current election cycle. Is there something going on with Roberts? Do you think he has shifted or moderated at all?\n\nMy personal take is that he really is really an incrementalist. He's not for upending longstanding precedent and what the country has become accustomed to. He believes in incremental changes and I think the Shelby County decision came about because he genuinely thought that so much advancement had been made in this area that it was no longer necessary for those protections. And I think after Shelby County, he's seen that those protections are still needed. His views might be moderating somewhat. He might see the damage that Shelby County decision has caused.\n\nYou've had this span of four or five decades to look at how these things have developed. How has technology changed this process of redistricting? Has it made it easier for those trying to dilute the power of minority voters to do that, and have people on your side of the fight been able to harness that technology in any similar fashion to fight back against those efforts?\n\nWhen I first started out in this area, the map drawers used maps and pencils and even had notepads to add before the calculators came. Then calculators and then the programs and social science has developed over the years, too. Statistical analysis has become more and more sophisticated, and the technology has become more and more sophisticated.\n\nMy take is that whoever writes the algorithm, whoever writes the code, the code can be written in such a way that it could lead to more discrimination and make it harder to undo.\n\nWe do have folks on our side who are using technology, but technology was used in the Texas case to draw districts in such a way that discriminated against Black and Latino voters in Texas.\n\nYou were a teenager when a lot of these landmark civil rights laws were passed in the ‘60s. Do you personally have memories of what the Jim Crow South was like? Did any of your relatives experience some of these more bizarre tests that were used for decades before that to exclude Black people from voting, like, ‘How many bubbles are in a bar of soap?’ or ‘How many jelly beans are in the jar?’\n\nOh, yes. I was born in ‘51. I grew up in a segregated neighborhood, went to an all-Black high school, segregated high school, segregated elementary school. I remember going to the dentist. And the dentist office had two entrances, one for white, one for “colored,” and going through the white side, they had air conditioning. They had magazines. The “colored” side did not.\n\nWe had field trips to the courthouse, where the courthouse had white and “colored” water fountains. And we had to sit in the balcony. I remember a third grade field trip to the courthouse and we watched a trial where a white lawyer was defending a Black man accused of some crime. And he was saying, “This was a good Nigra” — N-I-G-R-A.\n\nAnd so I grew up through it and I also remember my parents when the Voting Rights Act was first passed, and they did have federal registrars around, but all of the neighbors, my parents and everybody not only did they go and register to vote, they voted in every election, no matter what.\n\nThere were people telling us stories. Tim Winston owned a funeral home here and he was one of the few Black people who was able to register prior to the Voting Rights Act being passed, and he told stories of how they were turning away Black folks by asking them ridiculous questions. So, yeah, I remember, personally, stories of how hard it was before the Voting Rights Act was passed and after it was passed.\n\nIf the Voting Rights Act Section Two were to be knocked out and it wasn't a tool you could use anymore, what would be the strategy after that? Would that mean there's no option for civil rights groups? What is the world going to look like if the VRA is not available for private groups to litigate?\n\nIt almost becomes an impossible hill to climb. You have to go back to the 15th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult, or the 14th Amendment and prove intentional discrimination, which is difficult. All a legislative body has to do is say, “We didn't draw the district based on race. We drew them based on partisanship, and they're entitled to the presumption that there was a good faith effort to do that, and it's hard.” We had overwhelming evidence in Texas that partisanship was not the real reason. If that cannot overcome a presumption that the legislator was acting in good faith, going forward, it's going to be impossible to prove a racial gerrymandering claim.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the federal Constitution puts no limits on partisan gerrymandering, even as the justices continue to aggressively police use of race in redistricting. Is that line meaningful?\n\nRace and party, in Mississippi, there’s no distinction. It’s a fiction.",

    "description": "Denzel Perryman, Derwin James Jr. and Tony Jefferson reflect on how they are preparing their younger Chargers teammates for the looming playoff challenge ahead.",
    "fullText": "Denzel Perryman quickly listed name after name as he dove deep into his mental roster of the 2015 Chargers.\n\nManti Teʻo, Melvin Ingram, Kavell Conner and Donald Butler took Perryman under their wing, the Chargers linebacker said. The 11-year veteran said he relied on older teammates when he entered the NFL as they helped him adjust to the schedule and regimen of professional football.\n\n“When I was a young guy,” Perryman said, “my head was all over the place — just trying to get the gist of the NFL. They taught me how to be where my mind is.”\n\nWith the Chargers (10-4) entering the final stretch of the season and on the cusp of clinching a playoff berth heading into Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1), veterans have played an important role in the team winning six of its last seven games.\n\nA win over the Cowboys coupled with either a loss or tie by the Houston Texans on Sunday afternoon or an Indianapolis Colts loss or tie on Monday night would secure a playoff berth for the Chargers.\n\nPerryman, who recorded a season-best nine tackles in the Chargers' win over the Kansas City Chiefs last week, credits Philip Rivers and the rest of the Chargers' veterans for showing him \"how to be a pro\" a decade ago. Now he's passing along those lessons to younger players in a transfer of generational knowledge across the Chargers' locker room.\n\n“When I came in as a young guy, I thought this happens every year,” safety Derwin James Jr. said of winning, starting his career on a 12-4 Chargers team in 2018. “Remember the standard. Remember, whatever we're doing now, to uphold the standard, so that way, when guys change, coaches change, anything changes, the standard remains.”\n\nRunning off the field at Arrowhead Stadium, third-year safety Daiyan Henley charged at a celebrating Tony Jefferson, a veteran mentor at his position who was waiting for teammates after being ejected for an illegal hit on Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton.\n\nAfter the game Jefferson and Henley hopped around like schoolchildren on the playground. That’s the atmosphere the veterans want to create, Jefferson said, one in which younger players in the secondary can turn to him.\n\n“That's what we're here for,” Jefferson said. “For them to watch us and follow, follow our lead, and see how we do our thing.”\n\nIt's not just the veteran stars that are making a difference. Marcus Williams, a 29-year-old safety with 109 games of NFL experience, replaced Jefferson against the Chiefs after being elevated from the practice squad. The 2017 second-round pick played almost every snap in Jefferson's place, collecting four tackles.\n\n\"That just starts with the culture coach [Jim] Harbaugh creates,” defensive coordinator Jesse Minter said. “It's really a 70-man roster.\"\n\nHarbaugh highlighted defensive lineman/fullback Scott Matlock’s blocking technique — a ba-boop, ba-boop, as Harbaugh put it and mimed with his arms — on designed runs as an example of a veteran bolstering an offensive line trying to overcome the absence of Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater.\n\nHarbaugh said his father, Jack, taught Matlock the ba-boop, ba-boop blocking technique during an August practice.\n\n\"He's severely underrated as an athlete,” quarterback Justin Herbert said of the 6-foot-4, 296-pound Matlock, who also catches passes in the flat as a fullback.\n\nWith three games left in the regular season, Jefferson said the focus is on replicating the postseason-like efforts they gave in consecutive wins over the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“It was good that they were able to get a taste of that,” Jefferson said of his younger teammates playing against last season's Super Bowl teams, “because these games down the stretch are really what's to come in the playoffs.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Steve Hanke, a veteran economist, said he can't sleep at night thinking about inflation and high stock prices in the US.",
    "fullText": "What keeps the money doctor up at night?\n\nSteve Hanke, a veteran economist and applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said there are two significant problems in the US economy and markets that are keeping him from getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne is inflation, which he thinks could start to spiral out of the Fed's control.\n\nThe other is high stock prices, which will start crashing back to earth, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"What is keeping me up at night is the idea that the Fed is going to be unable to hit its inflation target in 2026,\" the veteran economist and commodities trader wrote.\n\n\"As far as the stock market is concerned, my Dr. X's Bubble Detector is sitting at an all-time high, indicating that we are in a bubble,\" he added of equity prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, there are a few signs that price growth in the US is starting to heat up again. Headline inflation was cooler than expected in November, but still considerably above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nHanke, who has described himself as a \"money doctor\" and has long held the view that the money supply is a key driver of inflation, also pointed to the recent growth in the M2 money supply. That's a measure of the amount of cash flowing around the economy, and it has climbed by $3.5 trillion over the past five years, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\n\"For me, that is the most important metric,\" Hanke said of the inflation outlook. \"It looks like the money supply is going to be goosed, if not over-goosed.\"\n\nThere are a few developments that look like they can stoke inflation leading into the next year, Hanke said:\n\n\"My concern is that, after letting the money supply explode in 2020-21 and imposing inflation on Americans, the Fed has failed to put the inflation Genie back in the bottle,\" Hanke said.\n\nThe outlook for the stock market doesn't look much better, in Hanke's view. He pointed to bloated valuations in the tech sector as the mania for artificial intelligence reaches new heights.\n\n\"As far as the warning signs concerning the course of an AI bubble, you will never know when you will realize a Wile E. Coyote moment,\" he said, later adding that he advised investors to rebalance their portfolios.\n\nHanke, known for his persistently bearish forecasts for markets and the economy, has long forewarned of trouble heading for the US. In October, he speculated that AI companies today could eventually see a dot-com-style fate once they started missing their growth forecasts.\n\nLast year, he also doubled down on his call that the US economy was headed for a recession, but told Business Insider he had recently started leaning away from that stance on account of hotter inflation.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTrade talks surrounding the Los Angeles Lakers are heating up, and the Lakers appear to be in pursuit of a veteran forward.\n\nAccording to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Lakers are pursuing New Orleans Pelicans wing Herb Jones.\n\n“The Los Angeles Lakers are monitoring the trade market for a defensive wing upgrade, league sources told HoopsHype. Among the 3-and-D wing upgrades on their wish list is New Orleans Pelicans forward Herb Jones, league sources say.”\n\nJones is widely considered one of the NBA’s top defenders. He’s averaged 1.6 steals and 0.7 blocks during his five NBA seasons. He would give the Lakers an aggressive defender who can match up with guards at the point of attack.\n\nJones has been a key member of the Pelicans’ rotation since his rookie year in 2021. He’s averaging 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and shooting 40.3% from the field this season. He’s also been a reliable 3-point shooter, shooting 33.7% this season and 36.2% for his career.\n\nHe only played 20 games last season due to a posterior labrum tear in his right shoulder. He’s already matched that total this season but missed around a week in November with a calf strain.\n\nJones is set to make $13.9 million this season and signed a three-year, $67.58M extension with the Pelicans last summer. The Lakers have limited future draft picks and cap space. Their 2031 unprotected first round pick could be enticing to the Pelicans, who could look to retool their roster around their rookies.",

Rhetoric aside, Serie A has taught us that age can be just a number, and so the possibility of seeing Thiago Silva in Serie A again is not so remote.\n\nWatch all of Serie BKT live on OneFootball for only €9.99 per month. \n\nAfter Modric’s arrival in August, the return of the Brazilian defender to Milan is making fans dream, but above all, it could rewrite a record that was broken only this summer.

    "description": "Minnesota takes a low-risk chance on a hard-throwing right-hander coming off a solid 2025 with the White Sox.",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins made a quiet but smart move on Wednesday, agreeing to a minor league contract with right-handed pitcher Dan Altavilla, according to Francys Romero.\n\nThe 33-year-old reliever is expected to receive a non-roster invite to major league spring training, where he will compete for a spot in the Twins' bullpen.\n\ntwins add reliever dan altavilla to the mix \n\naltavilla added a changeup last year and saw some success with it (.172 baa 36% whiff) \n\nif he could add a little more glove side movement out of that slider he’s got a solid arsenal to work with pic.twitter.com/iGmYVtxuCw\n\n— parker hageman (@HagemanParker) December 18, 2025\n\nAltavilla comes to Minnesota after spending the 2025 season with the Chicago White Sox, where he posted a solid 2.48 ERA across 29 innings in 28 relief appearances.\n\nThe veteran right-hander also recorded two saves and showed he can still get outs at the big league level after missing most of the previous three seasons due to Tommy John surgery and other injuries.\n\nThe Twins finished the 2025 season with a 70-92 record, placing fourth in the AL Central and missing the playoffs.\n\nA big reason for their struggles was the bullpen, which was gutted at the trade deadline when the team dealt away several key relievers including Jhoan Duran and Griffin Jax.\n\nExcited for this opportunity with the @Twins 🔥 pic.twitter.com/61MHWn8jqE\n\n— Dan Altavilla (@DanAlt3225) December 18, 2025\n\nHeading into the offseason, Minnesota's relief corps was thin and in need of depth.\n\nJustin Topa, Cole Sands, and Kody Funderburk appear to be the only pitchers locked into opening day bullpen roles, which leaves plenty of room for a veteran like Altavilla to earn a spot.\n\nThe Twins were also linked to right-hander Brad Keller before he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so adding Altavilla helps fill that gap.\n\nAltavilla's best weapon is his fastball, which still sits in the 96-97 MPH range and can overpower hitters when he locates it well.\n\nHe also throws a sinker that generated ground balls at a strong 51.3 percent clip in 2025, along with a slider and a changeup he developed last season with Chicago.\n\nThe Sox may well see plenty of former pitcher Dan Altavilla next year, as the veteran reliever has just signed a minor league contract with the Twins.\n\nHe had a 2.48 ERA in 29 appearances during his one year with the Sox this season. pic.twitter.com/IFmuL1zZtM\n\n— SleeperWhiteSox (@SleeperWhiteSox) December 18, 2025\n\nThe concerns with Altavilla are in his command and strikeout numbers.\n\nHis 17.5% strikeout rate and 12.5 percent walk rate in 2025 were both worse than the league average, and his 5.45 FIP suggests some regression could be coming.\n\nBut for a minor league deal with no guaranteed money, the risk is low and the upside is real if the Twins can help him refine his control.\n\nDan Altavilla, Filthy Sinkers. 😷 pic.twitter.com/9WwyBX526v\n\n— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 10, 2025\n\nThe Pennsylvania native has spent parts of eight seasons in the big leagues with four different teams, including Seattle, San Diego, Kansas City, and Chicago.\n\nHe knows what it takes to pitch in the majors, and his experience could be valuable for a young Twins team looking to rebuild.\n\nFor Minnesota, Altavilla represents exactly the kind of low-cost addition they need to make this offseason. If he earns a roster spot, he could provide solid middle relief innings.\n\nIf not, the Twins lose nothing. Either way, it is a smart gamble for a team looking to get back on track in 2026.",

He’s good on the edge. He’s fast. He’s played inside a little bit. He’s played on the edge.”\n\nGainer recorded 27 tackles and 2.5 sacks in his one season at UNC. He finished his college career with 237 total tackles.\n\n“He played inside at Florida State, if I remember, in college,” Maye said. “He moved to the edge once he got to North Carolina. So, I know he was with Vegas, and it’s good to see him back. I think everybody’s just trying to see what they can do just to help us, whether it’s on game day, throughout practice or whatever he can do.”\n\nGainer appeared in 17 games as a rookie with the Las Vegas Raiders, playing mostly in a special teams capacity. The 25-year-old provides good size to the practice squad and a great motor, according to Maye.\n\n“I know he’s going to work hard, and I know he’s got a good work ethic,” Maye said.\n\nMike Vrabel-Bashing Radio Host Shreds Patriots Coach Amid Josh McDaniels Debate",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will be without wide receiver Davante Adams for the Week 16 game against the Seattle Seahawks, which will have huge playoff implications.\n\nAdams landed on the injury report once again this week with a hamstring issue. He was on the Week 15 injury report with the hamstring, also, but aggravated the issue and was forced to exit last week's game early.\n\nAdams didn't practice at all this week before drawing the doubtful tag and being ruled out on Thursday night ahead of kickoff.\n\nHere's what we know about his return timeline.\n\nAt this point, Adams should be considered week to week.\n\nAdams' injury isn't a season-ending issue, so he will be back at some point. When that is, remains to be seen.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport said earlier on Thursday that the hope is Adams could return next week, but that is far from certain.\n\n\"So, don't expect him to play tonight, but the hope is, next game, if there's enough time to recover, we could see Davante out there.\"\n\nBut, earlier in the week, Rapoport floated the possibility that Adams could miss the rest of the regular season with his hamstring injury.\n\n\"There are only a couple types of injuries this time of year: there's an injury where a guy is fine, there's an injury where he's back for the playoffs, and then he's done,\" Rapoport said. \"The hope is that this is one of those he's back for the playoffs.\"\n\nWhat Adams has going for him next week is the Rams will enjoy a mini-bye thanks to their Thursday night game in Week 16, giving him 11 days with Los Angeles playing on Monday night in Week 17.\n\nAnother positive for Adams was his ability to do at least some work in pre-game warm-ups on Thursday night.\n\nWe should get our next update on Adams at the top of next week, but if not it won't come any later than Thursday, when Los Angeles drops its first injury report of the week.\n\nWhy CeeDee Lamb's 2 missed practices aren't a concern for Week 16\n\nQuinn Ewers can end 21-year drought for Texas quarterbacks\n\nBroncos' NFL record could be shattered by Dolphins in 2026\n\nWhat Patrick Mahomes tearing 2 ligaments means for recovery timeline\n\nJaguars offense in midst of streak not seen in NFL this season",

    "fullText": "Lakers predicted to cut ties with Luka Doncic's former $33 million Mavericks teammate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt’s safe to say the Los Angeles Lakers will look a bit different by the time the Feb. 5 trade deadline passes.\n\nThe franchise has plenty of tradable assets it can use in a midseason deal to upgrade its roster. Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk is under the impression that Luka Doncic’s 6-foot-10 former Dallas Mavericks teammate is among the assets the Lakers will move on from this season.\n\n“The Golden State Warriors proved last season why it can be advantageous to make a move early,” Rovenchuk wrote Friday. “They acquired Dennis Schroder, gave the experiment a shot, and rerouted him in favor of eventually securing Jimmy Butler when the initial venture failed.”\n\n“If the Lakers were going to replicate a similar approach, there is one clear member of the roster who stands out as a part of the outgoing package for Los Angeles. That would be Maxi Kleber.”\n\n“Kleber has been sidelined recently, dealing with a lower back injury. With the Lakers struggling to find defense, athleticism, shooting, and bench scoring, any one of these needs could have him moved before even being given the opportunity to return to the court for Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile it may not be easy to believe, Kleber was once a valuable stretch four who played respectable pick-and-pop basketball alongside Doncic in Los Angeles.\n\nFast forward to the 2025-26 season, and Kleber, who was included in the blockbuster Feb. 2 trade that landed Doncic with the Lakers, is a low-impact contributor for JJ Redick’s crew.\n\nWhile Kleber is shooting 37.5% from three, he’s contributing just 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game in 12.1 minutes, signaling that it may be time to part ways with the 33-year-old big man.\n\nIf one thing’s certain, Kleber is running out of time to prove himself in Los Angeles.\n\nMore NBA: Spurs' Stephon Castle makes basketball history never done ever before in NBA",

Garcia then competed twice more with Russian regional promotion ACA, losing via knockouts at the hands of Ibragim Chuzhigaev in 2019 and Abdul-Rahman Dzhanaev in early 2020.\n\nMichele Laddaga, 49, and Victor Julio Sanchez Medrano, 45, were also arrested alongside Garcia in the raid.

Rivers was already seen on the Colts practice field during Wednesday’s indoor practice, repping his #17.\n\nIt may not mean much, but Rivers likely would’ve looked weird with another jersey number (and we all know #18 was already unavailable!)\n\nIt’s best to have the 44-year-old quarterback most comfortable resuming his pro career, and it also provides Colts fans who bought a Rivers jersey back in 2020 the opportunity to wear a current one again—without any change to a new jersey number for the remainder of this year.",

According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "title": "The Devils Should Target Ryan O’Reilly Before They Target Steven Stamkos",
    "description": "The Devils are interested in a couple veteran Nashville Predators. Here’s why only one of them is worth pursuing.",
    "fullText": "The trade winds are starting to blow in the NHL, and with the New Jersey Devils recent skid, cries have started coming out from all corners of the internet and the Devils fanbase for GM Tom Fitzgerald to do something before these recent struggles derails the season.\n\nElliotte Friedman reported Saturday that Fitzgerald is indeed looking around and gauging what the market looks like. Not only have the Devils been linked to Quinn Hughes, but they’ve also been linked to Ryan O’Reilly and Steven Stamkos of the Nashville Predators.\n\nI don’t really have much more else to add about the Quinn Hughes situation, as I’ve said my piece on that matter last week. Fitzgerald wouldn’t be doing his job if he wasn’t checking in on the availability of one of the best defensemen in the NHL….never mind the fact he’s also the brother of two players already on the Devils. The Devils having interest in Quinn Hughes isn’t some manufactured thing that is just being thrown out there willy nilly for clicks. It’s a very real possibility that it could happen, so of course Fitzgerald is going to check in there.\n\nWith that said, I haven’t said much about the Ryan O’Reilly and/or Steven Stamkos situation, aside from what I wrote about those players last season. But I think if it came down to one or the other, the choice is clear.\n\nThe Devils should prioritize O’Reilly over Stamkos.\n\nThe Devils went into the season with a plan of having Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier, and Cody Glass as their Top 3 centers, with Luke Glendening apparently winning the 4C job over Juho Lammikko after impressing in training camp on a PTO.\n\nAfter free agency came and went, I figured that the Devils plan was to make Dawson Mercer the 3C and have Cody Glass be the 4C, but apparently I was wrong.\n\nAll of this was always a questionable plan at best.\n\nSay what you will about Jack Hughes’s injury history, and say that you will about how fluky this year’s injury was with Hughes getting injured at a team dinner of all settings. Considering Hughes’s history, it would not have been unreasonable for Fitzgerald to come up with a better alternative than “just shift Mercer to center” in case Hughes missed time again. And sure enough, Hughes missed time again. It might be the flukiest of fluky flukes to ever fluke, but its still a failure from an organizational level to properly prepare for this potential scenario that had a realistic chance of happening.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Devils nearly let Cody Glass walk away in free agency before they thought better of it when it was apparent he would be scooped up quickly if he hit the open market. Add in the fact that Glass has his own injury history since coming to the Devils. Add in that Nico Hischier bears the brunt of playing in all situations and playing the toughest minutes of anyone on the roster. And add in the fact that the Devils plan for 4C was taking a flier on the winner of a training camp competition between a player who had been out of the NHL for a few seasons and a PTO signing.\n\nThis might be a bit of a simplistic take on my part, but its not a coincidence or an accident that when the Devils have looked their best this season, it has been when their centers were healthy and available. The top lines worked and all showed cohesion. It’s also not a coincidence or accident that Mercer himself has looked the best he’s looked when playing on Nico Hischier’s wing rather than centering his own line.\n\nNo, there’s no replacing a player like Jack Hughes when he misses time, but you give yourself a better shot of treading water when you have an NHL caliber option who can slide into that spot. Adding a player like O’Reilly would make a huge difference for this group. And what about when you get Hughes back? All of a sudden you have an embarrassment of riches at a critically important position. Where Ryan O’Reilly is an overqualified 3C and Cody Glass is an overqualified 4C.\n\nGo back and look at the center depth on the most recent Stanley Cup champions. Where the Panthers had Anton Lundell as their 3C throughout their run. Where the Golden Knights had some combination of Jack Eichel, Chandler Stephenson, and William Karlsson down the middle. Where the Lightning won their Cups with Yanni Gourde as their 3C, but they were also deep enough to move Anthony Cirelli or Brayden Point there when needed. Where until this season, the Avs weren’t the same after losing Nazem Kadri. I’d keep going on and on but you understand the point I’m trying to make.\n\nYou need to be deep down the middle if you want to be taken seriously as a championship contender. You need to be deep down the middle if you want to maximize the wingers you’ve brought in. The Devils are not.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Ryan O’Reilly is the same two-way player he was when he won a Selke trophy in St. Louis. He turns 35 years old later this season and while he’s still effective, he is approaching the 1200 game milestone.\n\nThat said, with 21 points in 28 games, he’s still more than capable of chipping in offensively. He’s more than capable of playing in all situations and holding his own.\n\nI’m also not suggesting that Nico Hischier isn’t capable of handling everything that he handles in his on-ice role. But wouldn’t Hischier potentially be more valuable to the Devils if the team had another alternative who could take some of those defensive obligations off of his plate? Jack Hughes is better defensively than he gets credit for, but nobody is going to confuse him for Patrice Bergeron in terms of being a Selke-caliber defensive forward. Cody Glass doesn’t contribute much on the penalty kill (he’s only played 2:58 there this year). Luke Glendening does play on the kill, but he’s a fairly limited player at this stage of his career. Anything you get from him offensively is a bonus.\n\nAdding a player like O’Reilly and leaning on him to play those minutes should have a positive impact on the Devils penalty kill, which ranks 17th in the league as of this writing. And it should give the Devils another option at 5v5 as well.\n\nSteven Stamkos was already on the decline when he left the Tampa Bay Lightning, and things haven’t looked better through his first season plus as a member of the Nashville Predators. He’s not really a center anymore, despite Predators coach Andrew Brunette shifting him between center and wing in an attempt to give them a spark. He doesn’t drive play anymore, he’s not shooting as much as he has in the past, he’s no longer an elite level skater, he’s not much of a defensive forward, and he no longer has elite level players alongside him like he did in Tampa.\n\nYes, Stamkos could potentially chip in a little bit offensively on the power play. And yes, he might look better playing with better players than Luke Evangelista on his line. I would guess that the Devils envision him playing alongside Jack Hughes and Jesper Bratt and burying the feeds that he used to get from elite level playmakers like Nikita Kucherov.\n\nBut the Devils don’t really need another overpaid player who barely does anything at 5v5. They already have one of those in Ondrej Palat, and Stamkos’s contract is even worse.\n\nThe 2025-26 Devils need stability down the middle more than they need a scoring winger. They needed this before Jack Hughes got hurt and that need is only exasperated the more we see they don’t have an answer at such a critically important position. And even if one believed the opposite was true, the last thing the Devils need is a soon-to-be 36-year-old Stamkos, who is under contract for $8M AAV for two more seasons after this one. I don’t even know how the Devils would make that contract fit given their current cap situation, but I know I want no part of that.\n\nOn the flip side, O’Reilly is under contract for $4.5M AAV for one more season after this one, which is more than reasonable for a middle six center. I get that with him being a year younger than Stamkos, he’s not exactly a spring chicken either, but I think its clear that O’Reilly has more left in the tank than Stamkos, and its not nearly as onerous a commitment either.\n\nObviously, this is all dependant on asking price, and there might wind up being other options that make themselves available as the season rolls along. But it certainly sounds like the Predators are open for business, and with how tight the NHL standings are, the teams that separate themselves from the pack are likely going to be the ones who are proactive fixing their issues with their rosters rather than being reactive and waiting until the deadline for prices to go down.\n\nWhat gives me pause is sitting by and doing nothing isn’t going to do anything to fix the issue. Not only is it not acceptable for this team and where they are on their timeline, I think we’ve seen enough mediocre to bad hockey to know that its not going to magically fix itself. I pointed out when I broke down every trade Fitzgerald has made that only once did he go out early in the season and make a trade to address a glaring hole. It was a bad one. It was acquiring Jon Gillies.",

    "description": "LPGA winners Ryann O'Toole, Hinako Shibuno and Jodi Ewart Shadoff all re-earn their full playing privileges in Q-Series Final",
    "fullText": "Ryann O’Toole didn’t imagine she would put this on her December itinerary, but there she was playing golf in Alabama this past week trying to salvage her LPGA Tour card. It was a wise decision.\n\nThe 38-year-old O’Toole, a UCLA alum who first gained recognition as a competitor on Golf Channel’s “Big Break,” has won one tournament on tour, and she has the chance to add more titles after shooting a bogey-free 65 with seven birdies on Tuesday in the final round of LPGA Q-Series Final Qualifying in Mobile. In the event shortened from 90 holes to 72 because of a day lost to bad weather, O’Toole finished tied for third at 11 under and was the top American qualifier. The top 25 and ties earned their tour card, with 31 golfers being the final total at Robert Trent Jones Trail Magnolia Grove.\n\nO’Toole has 20 career top-10s, but she made the cut in only half her 16 starts in 2025, with no top-10s, and finished 137th on the CME Points Rankings.\n\n“The last time I was here [at Q-Series] was 2014, and I told myself after that week, I never want to have to be back,” O’Toole said. “But you never know what happens, and here I was back having to re-qualify. It's stressful, it's a grind, it's mentally and emotionally draining. Then this week, with just the weather, I mean it being freezing, the delays, the rain, every single morning was early. … It became a physical grind.\n\n“I just think there's so much emotion that goes into this that it is a tough week. With 15 years on tour, there are mixed emotions going into it. I wasn't sure if I was even going to decide to go back to Q School or if I was just going to start the next chapter of my life. But at the same time it would be really weird to start January 1 and go, ‘What do you mean I don't have full status? What do you mean? I'm not a professional on the LPGA?’ That wasn't OK for me.”\n\nGerman golfer Helen Briem earned her LPGA Tour card in impressive fashion. She shot a four-under 68 to earn medalist honors at 13 under. Briem, 20, moves to the LPGA after having played on the Ladies European Tour.\n\n“Right now, I'm a bit lost for words. I entered this week with not a lot of expectations,” said Brie. “But, overall, I'm really happy that I am able to play LPGA next year, and that’s really cool.”\n\nMajor winner Hinako Shibuno, arguably the most popular Japanese golfer, got her tour card back again, too. The 2019 AIG Women’s British Open champion made it on the number at five under after closing with a 72. Shibuno, 27, struggled on the LPGA this season, making just 10 cuts in 23 starts while notching only one top-10 finish.\n\nAnother veteran to re-earn her card is former European Solheim Cup player Jodi Ewart Shadoff. The 37-year-old, who won her lone LPGA title in 2022 and has top-10 finishes in three of the tour’s five majors, shot 71 and was among the final eight players who tied for 24th.\n\nAmong the notable players who missed getting their cards was 17-year-old Floridian Gianna Clemente, who turned pro this year, advanced through Second Stage and fell three shots off the cut. Kim Kaufman, 34, who battled breast cancer this year and finished chemotherapy in the summer, finished at four over. Among the past college stars who didn’t get their cards were 2023 U.S. Women’s Amateur champion and Auburn alum Megan Schofill (even par), 2024 NCAA individual champion Adela Cernousek of Texas A&M (16 over), USC’s Amari Avery (one under) and Wake Forest’s Rachel Kuehn (eight over).",
