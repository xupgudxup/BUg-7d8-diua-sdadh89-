    "fullText": "Venezuela’s government has ordered its Navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the United States after President Trump ordered a “blockade” aimed at the country’s oil industry.\n\nSeveral ships sailed from the country’s east coast with a naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, according to three people familiar with the matter. The vessels departed just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to blockade sanctioned oil tankers that do business with Venezuela.\n\nThe ships — transporting urea, petroleum coke and other oil-based products — left the Port of José bound for Asian markets, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The Venezuelan government imposed the military escort in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, they said.\n\nVessels traveling with the escort did not appear on a current list of U.S. sanctioned ships, making it unclear whether they could be subject to Mr. Trump’s blockade. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he was focused on oil tankers that have violated U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nThe third person familiar with the matter, a U.S. official, said Washington was aware of escorts and was considering various courses of action, but declined to provide details.\n\nVenezuela’s state oil company, known as PDVSA, said in a statement on Wednesday that ships connected to its operations were continuing to sail “with full security, technical support and operational guarantees in legitimate exercise of their right to free navigation.”\n\nMr. Trump had announced on Tuesday evening that he was imposing a “total and complete blockade” of tankers to and from Venezuela that had violated U.S. trade sanctions. Roughly 40 percent of the tankers that have transported Venezuelan crude in recent years have been placed under U.S. sanctions, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials last week seized an Asia-bound sanctioned tanker carrying nearly two million barrels of Venezuelan crude, a major escalation of Mr. Trump’s standoff with Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government derives the bulk of its revenues from oil exports.\n\nU.S. officials have said in private in recent days that additional tankers carrying Venezuelan oil may be seized, without providing additional details.\n\nMr. Maduro has reacted to the seizure with anger and vowed to keep the oil exports flowing at all cost, said one of the three people.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Rebecca F. Elliott contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "South Korean shipyards are steadily becoming an integral part of US Navy maintenance work. Following in the footsteps of some of the nation's shipbuilding giants, another local shipbuilder just secured a new contract.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction announced on Monday that it won a deal to service a US Navy vessel — the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ship USNS Amelia Earhart — as Washington increasingly turns to South Korea's impressive commercial shipbuilding sector to support strained American yards and keep the fleet afloat.\n\nThe maintenance contract is with the Navy's Naval Supply System Command and Military Sealift Command.\n\nThe work on the Amelia Earhart — which will include an inspection of the ship's hull and systems, follow-up repairs and replacements, and a paint job — will begin in January 2026 at the Yeongdo Shipyard in Busan. The vessel will be delivered to the Navy by the end of March.\n\nThe Amelia Earhart is one of the Navy's supply ships that refuels and resupplies aircraft carriers and warships at sea. Its overhaul adds to a growing list of US Navy work going to South Korean companies.\n\nMajor South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean finished repairs on the USNS Wally Schirra, another Lewis and Clark-class vessel, in March, marking a first for a South Korean shipyard. And then HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, one of the country's largest shipbuilders, received a maintenance contract for another ship in the class, the USNS Alan Shepard.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction said it's the first midsize shipbuilder in South Korea to win a maintenance contract with the US Navy.\n\nWhile smaller voyage repairs to US Navy ships occur regularly at allied yards, the continued contract wins for South Korean shipyards highlight the growing shipbuilding collaboration between Washington and Seoul.\n\nThat partnership, which has included business deals for South Korean companies abroad as well as investments in American yards, is part of a broader willingness by the Trump administration to rely on its Pacific ally amid efforts to fix US shipbuilding issues.\n\nBillions of dollars are being put into modernizing US shipyards and addressing workforce and training issues as South Korea's government calls its investments a plan to \"Make American Shipbuilding Great Again.\" The US is also turning to Japan, another large shipbuilder, for assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are the second and third largest shipbuilders in the world, respectively, and Navy leadership is increasingly recognizing their value in this sector. China, however, dominates the shipbuilding industry, relying heavily on its dual-use yards, workforce, and equipment to make military and commercial vessels at a rapid pace.",

    "fullText": "Is there nothing he can’t do? President Donald Trump has astounded viewers of the 126th Army-Navy football game with his unique approach to flipping a coin.\n\nWhile officiating the customary coin toss at the historic football clash at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, Trump demonstrated a bizarre heaving motion that resulted in almost no actual flipping of the coin itself.\n\nTaking the coin with a pinched left hand, and placing it into the open palm of his right, the president heaved the coin forward, sending it in a feeble, plunging arc. Helpfully, he pointed out where the coin had landed after it hit the ground.\n\nViewers immediately expressed their surprise at this pioneering method of coin-based decision-making.\n\n“Donald Trump may have executed the single worst coin flip in history,” wrote former independent congressional candidate Hal Stewart. “That coin is headed to the hall of shame!”\n\n“President Trump with the unprecedented coin toss that doesn’t appear to flip at all,” wrote author and radio host Clay Travis.\n\n“Donald Trump flips a coin like a pansy,” added political commentator Ed Krassenstein.\n\nHowever, the shock and surprise may be unwarranted as Trump has form in this area. In fact, as he has previously demonstrated, the president appears to believe that this is exactly how coins are flipped.\n\nIn 2018, Trump demonstrated his idiosyncratic style at that year’s Army-Navy Game, drawing critical fire from then-MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\n“Why is everything with this president so weird and so awkward?” Hayes asked. “Flipping a coin is not some great feat of athletics.”\n\n“To flip a coin, you just have to, uh, flip the coin. You use the thumb, you flick it into the air, get a good rotation going, let it land on the ground, see if it’s heads or tails.”\n\nThe All In host described Trump’s efforts as how one might release a baby bird into the air.\n\nThe Army Black Knights correctly called the coin in Saturday’s game tails. That did not, however, help them win, as the Navy Shipmen beat them in a close 17-16 game.",

    "fullText": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.\n\n“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.\n\nHolsey’s shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration’s strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nLong-term replacement for Holsey hasn't yet been named\n\nThe ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey’s replacement.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.\n\n“It’s never been about you, it’s been about people, it’s been about others,” Caine said. “You’ve never said ‘I’ in all the conversations we’ve had. You’ve always said ‘we.’ … The impact you’ve had will last for a long time.”\n\nHolsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHolsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators’ questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.\n\nExperts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n\nThe 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro’s grip on power.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nHolsey’s departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military’s top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.\n\nA native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”\n\nPettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey’s top deputy since late 2024. However, it’s unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.",

    "description": "The US Navy has submitted its recommendations on potential punishments for Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over his participation in a video that reminded US troops they have a duty to refuse illegal orders, a Pentagon official told CNN on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "The US Navy has submitted its recommendations on potential punishments for Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over his participation in a video that reminded US troops they have a duty to refuse illegal orders, a Pentagon official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThose recommendations have been submitted to the Pentagon’s Office of General Counsel “where they are providing a legal review and input,” the official said.\n\nCNN has reached out to Kelly’s office for comment. It was not immediately clear what recommendations were included in the report.\n\nLate last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requested advice from the Navy Secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in for more than two decades, on how to proceed to potentially punish Kelly for participating in the video, which Hegseth has claimed amounted to serious violations of the military’s code of justice.\n\n“I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25.\n\nIn the video that triggered the Trump administration’s calls for consequences, six Democratic lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”\n\nAlthough the video didn’t reference what orders service members might be receiving that would potentially be illegal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns repeatedly about the legality of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the US military’s deployment to cities over the protest of governors.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that by emphasizing service members’ legal duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other Democratic lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. President Donald Trump has called the video “seditious behavior at the highest level.”\n\nKelly’s involvement in the video is under “review” by the Pentagon, rather than subject to a formal investigation, meaning military police are not involved, a source familiar with Hegseth’s thinking previously told CNN.\n\nBehind closed doors, Hegseth has been weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain’s rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, CNN has reported.\n\nIn his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly’s comments violated several statutes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military.\n\nIn Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source familiar with Hegseth’s thinking said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN.\n\nKelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That’s because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator.",

    "fullText": "One of South Korea's top shipbuilders is turning out new warships for the Philippines as Manila accelerates its naval modernization.\n\nThe new frigates mark a major upgrade for the Philippine fleet, offering the country a more credible defense as China turns up the pressure in the South China Sea.\n\nThe historically obsolete Philippine naval force is now modernizing to meet current and future threats. \"The Philippine Navy is professional and getting stronger,\" Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider. He said that \"adding two guided-missile frigates to their very small fleet means that China's no longer running alone in the arms competition in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSouth Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai Heavy Industries has built two HDF-3200 Hybrid frigates for the Philippines. The second vessel, BRP Diego Silang, was commissioned earlier this month, over six months after the first-in-class BRP Miguel Malvar entered service.\n\nBoth vessels bring added firepower to the Philippine Navy. They're the first Philippine warships to have vertical launch systems for missiles, a modern capability that allows the Philippines to carry and fire VL MICA surface-to-air missiles made by MBDA, a European missile company. The frigates also carry eight SSM-700K C-Star anti-ship missiles made by South Korea.\n\nWarship vertical launch systems can be refreshed with new weapons over time. They shoot missiles straight upward before they arc toward their targets, a design that works well in all conditions. Each frigate has 16 cells, allowing the Philippines to tailor its missile loadouts for different missions.\n\nThe $550 million contract for the two frigates dates to 2021 and is the latest in a string of deals between HD Hyundai and Manila. The premier South Korean shipbuilder is also constructing six offshore patrol vessels and has discussed additional projects. In all, it has built 10 ships for the Philippine Navy.\n\n\"As we strengthen our defense industry network with the Philippines and other key Southeast Asian countries, we plan to identify additional potential demand and continuously expand our business competitiveness in the region,\" the company told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nAs Manila races to modernize its military, new warships give its navy much-needed heft in a region where China now fields the world's largest fleet and increasingly throws its weight around.\n\nThe South China Sea has been a hotbed of Chinese aggression, accidents, and close-calls in recent years, with Beijing's navy, coast guard, and maritime militia vessels frequently harassing Philippine fishing boats, spraying them with water cannons, chasing them down, and even ramming into them.\n\nWithin the contested region, the Philippines' new frigates and firepower now pose a potential challenge for China.\n\n\"They would be taking a very big chance of being sunk or knocked out of the sky if they start to push around these frigates,\" Cronin said of China's ships and planes. Strategies on both sides of this long-running dispute will, however, need to be managed carefully to avoid escalation and a shift from gray-zone aggression to conflict.\n\nChina fields a huge coast guard, backed by some of the world’s largest cutters, and typically relies on it for confrontations in the South China Sea while its navy hangs back. In a recent encounter, a Chinese navy destroyer joined in the chase of a Philippine patrol ship. Its unsafe maneuvering at sea led to it slamming into one of China’s own coast guard vessels.\n\n\"It is part of China's standard operating procedure to intentionally engage in unsafe behavior and create risks of collision at sea and in the air,\" Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider at the time.\n\nThe Philippines has been investing in other military might to counter China as well.\n\nManila's Archipelagic Defense Concept, for instance, has included the acquisition of more missile systems and better intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance capabilities to monitor its waters. Additionally, more military exercises and deeper cooperation between the Philippines, US, Australia, and other Pacific parnters is also helping better prepare Manila.\n\nThe Philippines is also planning for a fleet of submarines, with another South Korean shipbuilder, Hanwha Ocean, pitching an offer to build diesel-electric submarines earlier this year, as well as construct a submarine base, with support for local maintenance, repair, overhaul, and training.\n\nNewer submarines would provide the Philippine Navy with additional ways to patrol and monitor activity within its waters and deter foes.",

    "description": ": Meet 'ShipOS'",
    "fullText": "Palantir and the US Navy have signed a two-year deal to test whether its Foundry operational software can streamline the nation’s shipbuilding efforts and steer the Secretary of the Navy's top budget priority into port.\n\nThe $448 million contract will bring Palantir’s technology to work on shipbuilders, shipyards, and critical suppliers, said US Secretary of the Navy John Phelan and Palantir CEO Alex Karp during a presentation Tuesday evening in Washington, D.C. The company is calling this particular program \"ShipOS.\"\n\n“Every ship builder who partners with us will have AI power tools that optimize their work in real time. Every supplier in the network will be connected through intelligent logistics,” Phelan said on stage, according to US Naval Institute News. “Every program manager will have unprecedented visibility into schedule, cost and risk. We’re not just building ships faster. We’re rebuilding American maritime industrial capacity for the AI age.”\n\nPhelan listed strengthening US shipbuilding and the Maritime Industrial Base as the top priority of his $292.2 billion budget request for 2026, which called for 19 new battle force ships. The budget also invests $2.5 billion just for submarine builders to increase their \"health and supply chain enterprise.\"\n\nPalantir’s software will initially be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three shipyards, and 100 suppliers, all of which are part of the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB), a Navy program established in 2024 to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair. Palantir previously announced a deal with MIB to use its Warp Speed manufacturing software in July.\n\nThat early work resulted in leaps in efficiency, according to a press release. At General Dynamics Electric Boat – which designs, builds, repairs and modernizes nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy – submarine schedule planning was reduced from 160 manual hours to under 10 minutes. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard cut material review times from weeks to under one hour.\n\nIn order to win more business, Palantir must deliver “measurable cost savings over time, improved schedules, reduced delays, and increased production efficiency, with productivity gains offsetting the initial investment while establishing a more capable and resilient industrial base,” according to the announcement.\n\nPalantir’s head of defense Mike Gallagher told reporters at Tuesday’s event that it was now up to the software company to deliver the operational gains it has promised, according to Breaking Defense.\n\n“We have to prove the value,” he said. “And then at the end of the two-year program, the companies, if we push ourselves, will take on the sustainment costs.”\n\nOnce it's running, Foundry will aggregate data from enterprise resource planning systems, legacy databases, and operational sources to identify bottlenecks, streamline engineering workflows, and support proactive risk mitigation, the announcement stated.\n\n“This is another watershed deal for Palantir on the Foundry platform,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told El Reg. “Big step forward. We believe Palantir will be able to do this at scale.” ®",

    "description": "The Navy is investing almost half a billion dollars in Palantir artificial intelligence software that promises to speed up shipbuilding processes.",
    "fullText": "The Navy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an artificial intelligence system that it says has sped up key shipbuilding processes.\n\nIn one case, the AI cut painstaking processes of submarine schedule planning — mapping out how the many pieces of construction fit together and making sure people, parts, and yard space are available at the right time — from many hours to only minutes.\n\nThe Navy is launching the new Shipbuilding Operating System, or Ship OS, as it tries to break out of decades-old shipbuilding problems rooted in outdated technologies and work practices. The service announced a $448 million investment Thursday, saying it will accelerate the adoption of AI and autonomy across the industrial base.\n\nThe Ship OS technology is powered by Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform and began in pilot programs at submarine shipyards.\n\nAt General Dynamics Electric Boat, a long-time submarine yard located in Connecticut, submarine schedule planning saw a dramatic reduction from 160 manual hours down to under 10 minutes. And at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, material review times for submarines went from taking weeks to under an hour.\n\nThe $448 million investment will go toward the submarine industrial base and then expand. It'll be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three public yards, and 100 suppliers, Palantir said in a press release.\n\n\"This investment provides the resources our shipbuilders, shipyards, and suppliers need to modernize their operations and succeed in meeting our nation's defense requirements,\" said Navy Secretary John Phelan in a statement.\n\n\"By enabling industry to adopt AI and autonomy tools at scale, we're helping the shipbuilding industry improve schedules, increase capacity, and reduce costs,\" he added, explaining \"this is about doing business smarter and building the industrial capability our Navy and nation require.\"\n\nMaritime Industrial Base Program, a Navy initiative to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair capabilities, and Naval Sea Systems Command are overseeing the implementation of Ship OS. Both are gathering data from multiple sources to identify where the hiccups are in submarine shipbuilding, how the processes, including engineering, can be sped up, and what specific risks can be mitigated through technology.\n\nProblems in the Navy’s submarine industrial base — from shipbuilders to the repair yards — have been building for decades. Submarines are central to any Pacific fight and a top Pentagon priority, yet major programs like the upgraded Virginia-class submarines and new Columbia-class ballistic missile subs have repeatedly run into delays and cost overruns.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, has documented long-standing problems in the Navy's plans for purchasing and constructing submarines, as well as shipyard deficiencies such as worker inexperience, aging facilities and equipment, and inadequate construction space.\n\nThe introduction of the new Ship OS capability aims to address some of these problems facing US submarine shipbuilding. And once the technology has been used for the submarine programs, the Navy said, it'll apply lessons and adapt them to surface ship programs.",
