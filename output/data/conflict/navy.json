    "description": "Pete Hegseth announced administrative action against Sen. Mark Kelly, initiating a process that could strip the retired Navy captain of rank and pension.",
    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced unprecedented administrative action against Sen. Mark Kelly, accusing the Arizona Democrat of “seditious” conduct and initiating a process that could strip the retired Navy captain of rank and reduce his military pension.\n\nIn a statement posted to X on Monday morning, Hegseth said the Department of Defense had begun retirement grade determination proceedings under 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f) against Kelly, citing public comments in which the senator urged service members to refuse illegal orders.\n\nHegseth also said he issued a formal Letter of Censure that will be placed in Kelly’s permanent military personnel file.\n\nSix weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline. As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he…\n\n— Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (@SecWar) January 5, 2026\n\nThe dispute centers on a broader and increasingly heated debate between the Pentagon and Democratic lawmakers over the legality of recent U.S. military operations and the role of members of Congress in questioning them. Kelly and other lawmakers have argued that service members must refuse unlawful orders, while Hegseth and his allies contend such messaging undermines military discipline by casting doubt on the legality of duly authorized operations.\n\nKelly, a former Navy fighter pilot who retired at the rank of captain, is currently serving his second term in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHegseth characterized a video released earlier this year by Kelly and five other members of Congress as “reckless and seditious,” accusing the senator of undermining good order and military discipline. The video reminded service members that they have a legal obligation to refuse illegal orders, a principle embedded in U.S. military law and the laws of armed conflict.\n\nThe confrontation follows mounting scrutiny over the legal justification for U.S. military actions in Latin America, including discussions within the administration about removing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nOn Sunday’s This Week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio struggled to identify clear legal authority for such action, drawing criticism from lawmakers who argue that ambiguous or unsupported justifications heighten the risk of unlawful orders being issued or followed.\n\nHegseth asserted that Kelly remains subject to military justice as a retired officer receiving retired pay and accused him of violating Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, provisions covering conduct unbecoming an officer and general misconduct.\n\nThe move is highly unusual. While retired officers technically remain subject to the UCMJ in limited circumstances, the authority is rarely invoked and has not been used to punish post-retirement political speech, particularly by a sitting member of Congress.\n\nRetirement grade determinations are typically limited to misconduct committed while an officer is on active duty.\n\nHegseth warned that Kelly’s status as a U.S. senator does not exempt him from accountability and suggested further action could follow.\n\nKelly has not yet publicly responded. The announcement is likely to prompt legal challenges and congressional scrutiny, placing the Pentagon at the center of a constitutional dispute over military authority, civilian oversight, and protected political speech.\n\nThe post Pete Hegseth Strips Sen. Mark Kelly of Military Rank Over ‘Illegal Orders’ Video first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday announced that he is issuing a letter of censure to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over the lawmaker’s participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.\n\nHegseth said that the censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain in the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Kelly said he “never expected” what he called an “attack” from Trump and Hegseth, recounting his 25 years of Navy service, as well as combat and space missions. Calling Hegseth's move “outrageous” and “un-American,” Kelly said he would fight the censure “with everything I’ve got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don’t get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.”\n\nThe move comes more than a month after Kelly participated in a video with five other Democratic lawmakers in which they called on troops to defy “illegal orders.” President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hegseth’s action against Kelly “a despicable act of political retribution.”\n\n“Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,” Schumer said on social media. “Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump.”\n\nIn November, Kelly and the other lawmakers — all veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.”\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted from Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.”\n\nThe Pentagon announced that it began an investigation of Kelly late in November while citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures.\n\nWhile all six lawmakers served in the military or the intelligence community, Hegseth made clear in previous remarks that Kelly was the only one facing investigation because he is the only one of the lawmakers who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.\n\nKelly said that the investigation was part of an effort to silence dissent within the military.\n\n“This is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees — do not speak out against this president or there will be consequences,” Kelly told reporters in mid-December.\n\nIn his post Monday, Hegseth charged that Kelly's remarks in the video and afterward violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions against conduct unbecoming an officer and violating good order and discipline.\n\nKelly, along with some of the other Democrats in the initial video, have also sent out fundraising messages based off the Republican president’s reaction to their comments, efforts that have gone toward filling their own campaign coffers and further elevating their national-level profiles.\n\nIn recent months, Kelly — whose name has frequently been mentioned as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender — has made several trips to South Carolina, traditionally an early primary state that kicked off its party’s nominating calendar in 2024. Appearing with his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, at events calling for stricter gun control measures, Kelly met during those trips with local lawmakers, stakeholders whose early support can be critical as national-level hopefuls attempt to make inroads in the critical state.\n\nHegseth said Monday that “Captain Kelly’s status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"\n\nTodd Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate general, said that this is a “novel” situation that raises legal questions.\n\nOne issue, according to Huntley, is whether Kelly’s comments fall under the constitutional protections of the speech or debate clause.\n\nThe clause is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts, and a 1968 Supreme Court decision wrote that the provision’s intent was “to prevent legislative intimidation by and accountability to the other branches of government.”\n\nHuntley also said that while the type of process Hegseth is using here, known as a retirement grade determination, is fairly routine, “as far as I know, they’ve always been based on conduct during the individual’s active duty service, even if it only came to light after retirement.”\n\n“So, I don’t know if conduct totally after retirement would fit the requirement for such a determination,” he added.\n\nAccording to Hegseth, Kelly now has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings that will decide if he is demoted. The decision will be made within 45 days, Hegseth’s post added.\n\nKinnard reported from Columbia, S.C. Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nThere was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",

    "fullText": "With drones always buzzing overhead, ready to dive bomb soldiers or relay targeting data to an artillery gun crew, it can be far too dangerous to send a human being to rescue the wounded, so Ukraine is turning to robots to evacuate injured troops.\n\nA US veteran in Ukraine who saw them in action told Business Insider they're effective — and said Ukraine is right to keep them simple and cheap, given that many may not make it back.\n\nUkraine is using a growing number of ground robots, a kind of drone, to combat Russia's invasion by carrying supplies, acting as bombs, and evacuating injured soldiers.\n\nMany of these systems come from Ukrainian companies and manufacturers located within Ukraine's European partners. It's technology that militaries are increasingly paying attention to, seeing it as a solution that could save lives on the modern battlefield, though across NATO and Western forces, the focus is mainly on doctrine, testing, and prototyping.\n\nEven in Ukraine, uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) only make up a small fraction of the drones in use in battle.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is now helping out a nonprofit in Ukraine. He told Business Insider that using ground robots for casualty evacuation isn't perfect, but it's useful. He said that the West should take note but avoid overengineering or overspending on these kinds of systems.\n\nThe robots are \"not always a success, but at least it's something,\" he said.\n\nThe casualty evacuation robots function like remote-controlled stretchers, but rescuing wounded troops is far from foolproof: with so many drones overhead, they're easy to spot — and just as easy to attack.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have pointed to the limits of ground robots in evacuating the wounded, noting that while they can be a lifeline for a wounded soldier when it is too unsafe for their comrades to come get them, they can be jammed, they break down, and they can be targeted just like anything else moving in battle.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, head of robotic systems for the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that they are a last resort tool because a wounded soldier could wind up in \"an even worse situation.\"\n\nThey are a \"last hope kind of thing,\" Wells explained. \"And that shouldn't cost a lot of money and should be something that's easily developed, replaced, and deployed.\"\n\nWells' work in Ukraine aims to help civilians survive the war. He is there with Task Force Antal, a nonprofit organization run by US veterans that provides medical training, supplies, and evacuation support to civilians, especially in front-line areas.\n\nHe said that the evacuation robots don't need to be flawless technology — the tech is evolving so fast that whatever works today may well be redesigned next week anyway. What matters, he said, is getting something usable into the field now, because saving lives outranks engineering elegance.\n\nWells said the robot he saw in action was \"low tech\" but got the job done, explaining that he would rather have 10 robots worth $1,000 than one that was more advanced and worth $100,000.\n\n\"You kind of just need something that's effective, essentially a stretcher with wheels that gives hope to the person that's injured.\" It doesn't need to be more complicated than that.\n\nIn talks with Business Insider, Ukrainian soldiers, foreign volunteers, and arms makers have emphasized key lessons for the West: prioritize more cheap systems over a few exquisite ones, don’t pour money into technology that may quickly become obsolete, and resist the urge to overengineer and overspend on gear meant for a battlefield that changes every week.\n\nWhen it comes to robots for evacuation, Wells said that the best thing is to keep technology cheap and expendable so troops don't think they \"have to use this because it costs so much money.\"",

    "description": "The US Navy is struggling to compete with China due to a spate of failed ship classes. A new report warns there's no easy fix.",
    "fullText": "The US Navy faces a number of challenges in its goal of growing the fleet. None are easily or quickly solvable.\n\nA new report from naval and defense policy experts assesses that a number of actions are urgently needed across shipbuilders and the government to fix the Navy's delays and cost overruns, especially as China's fleet surpasses the US' in size and adopts new technologies to become a dominant naval power.\n\nMany of the Navy's problems, including retiring more ships than it is building, a slowed and expensive shipbuilding process with only a handful of commercial shipyards, and program mismanagement, trace back to the end of the Cold War. They've gotten worse in the decades since and are reaching a boiling point as the US military attempts to focus on countering China's military rise.\n\n\"Despite the Navy's plans for growing the fleet and bipartisan efforts and funding from Congress, the US shipbuilding enterprise — including the Navy, Department of Defense, Congress, and industry — has failed to consistently produce ships at the scale, speed, and cost demanded,\" authors of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, or CSIS, report wrote.\n\nAmong the failed projects: Two types of littoral combat ships, an advanced stealth destroyer the service will only have three of, and the newly canceled Constellation-class frigate.\n\nNo one entity, incident, or program is solely to blame. Washington's demand signal for building new vessels has been inconsistent, leaving shipbuilders unable to plan long-term projects. And the Navy's requirement process and ship designs have sometimes resulted in vessels not meeting expectations, being delayed by years, and coming in far over budget.\n\nRight now, Navy Secretary John Phelan, officials in DoD, and shipyards are focused on fixing these problems and avoiding the same mistakes in the future. Shipbuilding is a top priority, and it's gotten a lot of attention throughout the first year of the second Trump administration.\n\nBut, per the report, there is no single solution to arrest the decline in American shipbuilding, \"and resolving any one of the underlying issues does not guarantee a drastic improvement of the situation.\" Instead, the Navy, Congress, and shipyards will have to find the right way forward through years of work.\n\nThe Navy's battle force, including surface ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers, peaked during the build-up in the second Reagan administration at 568. After the Cold War, the number dwindled, as the US focused on land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the fleet hit its low point of 271 in 2015. A year later, the Navy released plans of a 355-ship goal, which increased in 2023 under the Biden administration to 381 and 134 large uncrewed surface and underwater vehicles.\n\nThese goals have proven unreachable without an effective small warship whose price tag is well below $13 billion Ford-class aircraft carriers and $2 billion guided-missile destroyers.\n\nCompared to the US, China has amassed a huge fleet over the last 25 years. Thanks to its state-owned shipbuilders and dual-use commercial and military shipyards, equipment, and workforce, China's fleet reached a height of an estimated 370 battle force ships last year. China's naval growth has alarmed officials even if they are not all a match for the US' highly advanced, well-built vessels and weapons.\n\nNavy officials have increasingly looked at uncrewed vessels to rapidly add new capabilities to the fleet. A mix of large, medium, and small drone boats would be useful for a number of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, and could expand the Navy's reach in regions like the Indo-Pacific while keeping sailors out of harm's way. Companies can build these autonomous vessels fast but questions remain on how effective drone ships are; the few operational drone boats today largely act as surveillance vessels. It's still a relatively new field, but it could present short-term answers to fleet problems by reducing the demand for crewed ships.\n\nThe Navy's current fleet has also seen a higher tempo of operations, putting \"greater stress on the fleet and its crews as a smaller number of ships must deploy more regularly to mission demands, thereby increasing the need for greater maintenance and sustainment,\" the CSIS report noted.\n\nEarlier this year, then-acting Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said the Navy was clocking in at a 68% readiness rate for surface ships and 67% for submarines, while aviation stands at 70%. The service aims for 80% by 2027.\n\nPart of the disparity stems from ship maintenance delays. The US's current capacity to keep its fleet running has been strained across shipyards, resulting in repairs often taking 20% to 100% longer than estimated, according to a new Congressional Budget Office analysis. There are many causes for that: the average age of the Navy's ships is older than it used to be and require more work and the scope of maintenance is often larger than anticipated.\n\nKeeping older vessels ready is one challenge but the Navy's goals of building new ones has continued to face hurdles with increased construction times, holdups across major programs, and cost overruns. In a US Government Accountability Office report earlier this year, the government watchdog agency assessed that 37 of the 45 battle force ships under construction were delayed as of fall 2024.\n\nThat's been blamed on several things, including the Navy's focus on price in contracting rather than speed, rising prices for ships due to purchasing fewer hulls, and changes to ship designs and capabilities during construction. The recently cancelled Constellation-class frigate is a prime example of how design changes can doom a program by causing delays and soaring costs. The frigate was originally supposed to have 80% commonality with its Italian navy version but only ended up with 15%.\n\nOn the industry side, the shipbuilding sector has shrunk and largely serves to build ships for the Navy and Coast Guard and a few merchant ships; most commercial shipbuilding has shifted to countries like Japan, South Korea, and China, where they are cheaper to build.\n\nWashington, the Navy, and shipbuilders are pursuing several avenues to address these problems. Billions are being invested in the industrial base, with a major focus on submarines, and broader initiatives are focused on training the next generation of workers. Modernization efforts in shipyards, including automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics, are a priority as well to drive down costs.\n\nGiven the vast lead and advantages of competitors like South Korea and China, it's these could drive down ship production costs. But they are unlikely to revitalize a commercial ship industry that can be converted to war-time use, as occurred in World War II.\n\nBut the issues afflicting American shipbuilding are complex. \"There is no single policy solution to solve the overall problem,\" CSIS authors wrote, \"Moreover, resolving any of the underlying issues does not guarantee a drastic improvement of the situation.\"\n\nIn its conclusion, the report suggests that continuous production of Navy vessels based on multi-year contracting would stabilize projects, budgets, and the workforce.\n\nAnother solution could involve more cooperation with US partners and allies, something Washington is already pursuing. South Korean shipyards, some of the most advanced and busiest in the world, are conducting more maintenance on US Navy vessels and major partnerships between these yards and the US are aimed at modernizing American shipbuilding processes and workflows.",

    "description": "A retired Navy SEAL said he stays strong and healthy with exercises to build muscle and boost longevity even when he's traveling or has a busy schedule.",
    "fullText": "You don't need a fancy gym for peak fitness, according to retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink.\n\nSome of the best workouts to build muscle, burn fat, and live longer involve simple exercises you can do just about anywhere, with minimal equipment.\n\nWillink would know — he wakes up at 4:30 a.m. every day to work out for up to three hours, sometimes in his massive garage gym, sometimes on the road with minimal equipment.\n\n\"There is no more important strategic goal in our lives than staying healthy,\" he told Business Insider. \"There are definitely days that I try to figure out a way to just move. You've got to do some minimum work.\"\n\nWillink said his goal is to prevent any weaknesses in his mental and physical performance, training strength, power, stamina, and focus wherever he goes to stay ready for any challenge life throws at him, from jiu jitsu competitions to running his business.\n\nIn or out of the gym, movements such as pull-ups, squats, sprints, and rucking (carrying weight) can help you put in the work without overcomplicating your workouts. The latest research also suggests that the benefits of these movements — getting stronger, improving your resilience, and boosting heart health — can lead to a longer lifespan too.\n\n\"Going back to the basics and doing things that have been used for decades is a solid way to go,\" Willink said. \"You can never go wrong with those.\"\n\nFor getting stronger and more muscular, it's hard to beat bodyweight movements such as pull-ups, push-ups, and dips, Willink said. If you have a sturdy bar and bench (or can improvise one), these three exercises hit every major muscle in the upper body and core, improving stability and grip strength.\n\nEven beginners can benefit from bodyweight moves by scaling exercises like pull-ups with variations like eccentrics or dead hangs.\n\nFor rock-solid legs and core muscles, squats are king, building your glutes, hamstrings, quads, and abs for better stability and power.\n\nIf you can't find a squat rack and a barbell, variations like goblet squats or single-leg squats offer similar benefits. Regardless of which type of squat you choose, making sure you're hitting a full range of motion, or you're leaving gains on the table, Willink said.\n\n\"When I squat, I'm squatting all the way down,\" he said.\n\nWhen Willink wakes up in a hotel room, he'll hit 100 burpees before doing anything else.\n\n\"It keeps that discipline in my life,\" he said.\n\nBurpees offer a total-body workout for explosiveness and endurance in just a few minutes, and are especially good for raising your heart rate quickly. Higher-intensity exercise helps to strengthen your heart and protect your health even in small doses, research shows.\n\nIf you hate them, lean into it; it pays to put your ego aside and work on your weaknesses, Willink said.\n\n\"One of the key components here is that what we need to do as people is watch out for the things you don't like doing,\" he said.\n\nCardio is a nonnegotiable for Willink to build athleticism and overall health, so he regularly runs, rows, swims, and bikes. Research suggests the sweet spot for fitness is a mix of intensities, including longer, steady cardio sessions with short, explosive efforts.\n\nFor Willink, that means incorporating sprint intervals to keep a versatile skillset; maybe not ideal for running marathons, but perfect to stay fast and powerful for jiu jitsu.\n\n\"It definitely taxes you in a different way,\" he said. \"I want to be able to do a bunch of different things, but at the same time, I don't want to lose a movement or have an area where I'm ridiculously weak.\"\n\nSEAL training is notoriously tough, and Willink retired from the Navy more than a decade ago, but kept many of the military workouts in his routine.\n\nOne of his favorites is rucking, which involves walking, hiking, or running with a weighted pack. It's become a hot fitness trend outside the military for people who want to build muscle, burn fat, and improve their stamina all at once.\n\nHe uses a 75- to 85-pound pack, but you don't need to go that heavy to start a rucking routine. An ordinary backpack with books, water bottles, or a similar weight can work.\n\nWillink said he was glad to see the exercise getting more popular since it taps into a basic human movement and a mindset of tackling challenges.\n\n\"You're going to experience some suffering, and you have to push through it,\" he said. \"It's hard, but it's meditative. You don't have to think about it. It's the simplest movement that humans do.\"",

    "description": "A Texas power developer is proposing to repurpose nuclear reactors from Navy warships to power the United States grid. Read more here",
    "fullText": "A Texas power developer is proposing to repurpose nuclear reactors from Navy warships to power the United States grid as the Trump administration pushes to secure massive amounts of energy for the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nHGP Intelligent Energy LLC filed an application to the Energy Department to redirect two retired reactors to a data centre project proposed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, according to a letter submitted to the agency’s Office of Energy Dominance Financing. The project, filed for the White House’s Genesis Mission, would produce about 450-520 megawatts of around-the-clock electricity, or enough to power roughly 360,000 homes.\n\nIn theory, tapping the reactors could become one of the fastest ways to add baseload power to the grid as the U.S. struggles to meet surging power demand. Building new reactors — traditional big plants or next-generation smaller units — are years away, as are new big natural gas-fired plants. Repurposing military reactors for such civilian use, however, is unchartered territory.\n\nNaval aircraft carriers or submarines are each equipped with two reactors: A4W units made by Westinghouse Electric Co. or S8G-class units made by General Electric. Rewiring two of them would cost about US$1 million to US$4 million per megawatt, a fraction of building new reactor, according to the proposal. HGP’s plan includes a revenue share with the government, and the company would create a decommissioning fund.\n\nThe developer plans to file for a loan guarantee from the Energy Department, according to the letter. The project would require about US$1.8 billion to US$2.1 billion of private capital to build related infrastructure to prepare the reactors for general use, according to the proposal submitted to the DOE and seen by Bloomberg News. The first phase could be completed as soon as 2029, according to the proposal.\n\n“We already know how to do this safely and at scale, and we’re fortunate to have a solid base of investors and partners who share that vision,” HGP chief executive Gregory Forero said in a statement.\n\nWith assistance from Joe Deaux.",

    "fullText": "Air traffic controllers lost communication for about 10 minutes with a small Mexican Navy plane carrying a young medical patient and seven others before it crashed off the Texas coast in thick fog, killing at least six people, Mexico's government said Tuesday.\n\nThe plane was working with a nonprofit group transporting Mexican children with severe burns to a hospital in Galveston, near Houston, when the plane crashed Monday afternoon. Authorities believed the plane had landed, but the flight had lost contact with air controllers, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in her morning briefing.\n\nTeams found the dead bodies of five people and pulled two survivors from the plane's wreckage, then set off on a daylong search in the waters near Galveston for 29-year-old Navy Lieutenant Luis Enrique Castillo. Castillo's family back in their rural town in southern Mexico were left scrambling for answers, hoping for the best for their missing son.\n\n“We don't know what to do,\" his father Eduardo Castillo said Tuesday. “All we can do is wait. We can’t go to the United States, we have no visa.\"\n\nThe search came to an end Tuesday night when search teams found Castillo's body. American authorities are investigating the the cause, but the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it could take a week or more to recover the aircraft.\n\n“What happened is very tragic,” Sheinbaum said in her morning press briefing, noting that sailors were among the dead.\n\nPlane was too low as it descended\n\nAs the twin turboprop Beech King Air 350i approached Sholes International Airport in Galveston, radar shows it was far too low, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration crash investigator.\n\nA navigation system for the runway where the plane was supposed to land had been out of service for about a week, Guzzetti said. The system sends signals to the airplane cockpit that helps pilots navigate in the kind of bad weather that had enveloped the area. The fog was so thick that meteorologists estimated only about a half-mile of visibility.\n\nThe pilot should have aborted the landing if the runway wasn't visible at an altitude of 205 feet (62.5 meters), climbing back up before trying again or looking for another airport entirely, Guzzetti said.\n\nGuzzetti said the reported radar track shows that the pilot was descending rapidly below 200 feet (61 meters), a full 2 miles (3 kilometers) away from the runway.\n\n“Maybe there was some sort of mechanical malfunction,\" he said. “But just looking at the recorded flight track and comparing it with the weather and the airport equipment outage, seems to me that this landing approach should never have occurred.”\n\nThe plane crashed in a bay near the base of the causeway connecting Galveston Island to the mainland. The popular beach destination is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Houston.\n\nSky Decker, a professional yacht captain who lives near the crash site, said he jumped in his boat to see if he could help. He picked up two police officers who guided him through the thick fog to the nearly submerged plane. Decker jumped into the water and found a badly injured woman trapped beneath chairs and other debris.\n\n“She had maybe 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of air gap to breathe in,\" he said. \"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.”\n\nHe said he also pulled out a man seated in front of her who had already died.\n\nEduardo Castillo gathered with the rest of his family and friends Tuesday afternoon in their small community of El Pantano in the sweltering southern Mexican state of Veracruz.\n\nThe father, who worked long hours as a carpenter to give his son the opportunities he never had, was desperately refreshing his phone every few minutes, looking for any news of their missing son. Mexico's Marines, he noted, had provided few other details than a call saying their son was missing.\n\nFramed pictures of Luis Enrique Castillo and his many diplomas coated a wall of their home. He and his wife were expecting a baby due in three months.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Castillo heard his phone ring and answered, hearing the words he had dreaded. His son was dead.\n\n“Now he's never going to meet his unborn child,” Eduard Castillo said as his family hugged and sobbed around him.\n\nInvestigators dig into the cause\n\nA spokesperson for the NTSB said in an email that investigators will review maintenance records, weather forecasts and air traffic control communications. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days.\n\nGuzzetti said the investigation also will likely look into how serious the young patient's medical condition was and how motivated the pilot was to land.\n\n“There have been previous accidents in the air medical community where pilots try to push their luck in order to save the patient,” he said.\n\nThe aircraft had a “very, very proven design,” said aviation safety expert John Cox. He said it’s the latest version of a series that has been in use since the 1960s and would have been outfitted with all the modern electronics, avionics and equipment.\n\nPlane was helping with medical mission\n\nMexico's Navy said the plane was helping with a medical mission in coordination with the Michou and Mau Foundation.\n\nThe charity was founded after a mother died trying to save her kids from a fire. One child died, while another survived after receiving treatment at Shriners Children's Texas in Galveston. Over 23 years, the foundation has helped transfer more than 2,000 patients to that hospital and other medical facilities with burn expertise, according to the charity's website.\n\nIn a social media post, the foundation offered condolences to the families of the crash victims.\n\nShriners Children’s Texas said in a statement that it learned of the crash with “profound sadness” but wasn't able to provide any information about the child's condition.\n\nCrash comes amid focus on aviation safety\n\nThis latest crash comes amid a year of intense scrutiny on aviation safety after a string of high-profile crashes and the flight disruptions during the government shutdown driven by the shortage of air traffic controllers.\n\nThe January midair collision between an Army helicopter and an airliner near Washington, D.C., was followed by the crash of a medical transport plane in Philadelphia. This fall’s fiery UPS plane crash only added to the concerns. Still, the total number of crashes in 2025 was actually down a bit from last year, and experts say flying remains safe overall.\n\nMarquez reported from El Pantano and Janetsky reported from Mexico City.

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump unveiled a new class of so-called “battleships” on Monday, but his plans are already hitting rough waters on social media.\n\nIn remarks from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the president claimed that the two “Trump Class” military vessels would be the “fastest, the biggest and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.”\n\nTrump described himself as a “very aesthetic person” while noting that he, along with the U.S. Navy, would work on the design of the vessels. Trump said the administration aims to make up to 25 of the ships, thus adding to its goal of creating a “Golden Fleet.”\n\nPolitics: Nicki Minaj Uses The Exact Wrong Word Onstage With Erika Kirk\n\nRenderings of the “USS Defiant” showed a vessel firing what appeared to be a laser beam and launching missiles. The vessel featured an illustrated logo of Trump raising his fist, as he did in the moments after the assassination attempt on him in Butler, Penn., last year.\n\nCritics on social media, including author and media pundit Malcolm Nance, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence officer, pilloried Trump over the ship plans.\n\n“WHOEVER DESIGNED THE TRUMP CLASS ‘BATTLESHIP’ GOT THE DESIGN FROM GI JOE,” Nance wrote.\n\nBWAHAHAHA.

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog says the Army and Navy misrepresented recruit test scores, exceeding federal limits on low scorers.",
    "fullText": "A new Pentagon Inspector General report says that the Army and Navy misrepresented the academic qualifications of some recruits, allowing both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring enlistees.\n\nThe report, released earlier this month, is based on a yearlong review of the services' Future Soldier and Future Sailor preparatory courses, which are new \"pre-boot camps\" created in recent years.\n\nThe programs have helped the Army and Navy enlist more recruits amid a national recruiting crisis by taking applicants with low entrance exam scores or fitness shortfalls and aiming to prepare them for service — addressing the deficiencies — in a matter of weeks or months.\n\nThe Defense Department Inspector General found that the Army and Navy miscalculated the number of low-scoring recruits they enlisted by counting test scores earned after applicants completed the preparatory courses, rather than the scores they received before entering those programs.\n\nThat approach allowed both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring recruits without notifying the Secretary of Defense, as required by the rule. The secretary has the authority to raise those limits, but must also inform Congress.\n\nThe Pentagon disputed the report's findings, arguing that the scores that should count are those earned at the end of the preparatory courses, not those taken beforehand.\n\n\"Improving a recruit's academic skills is a primary reason for creating the [Future Soldier and Future Sailor Preparatory Courses],\" William Fitzhugh, the acting assistant secretary of defense for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo to the inspector general. \"Improved academic skills, and the resulting AFQT scores, enable such recruits to pursue a broader range of occupations, which benefits them and the Military Services.\"\n\nFederal law caps the number of recruits who score low on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, known as Category IV applicants, at 4% of the total number of recruits who ship to boot camp each year. Category IV applicants score between the 10th and 30th percentiles on the exam, which assesses subjects such as reading comprehension, math, and mechanics.\n\nSuch recruits \"tend to exhibit below average trainability and on-the-job performance,\" the report said.\n\nThe cap is intended to ensure the services attract enough high-scoring recruits to fill technically demanding roles, such as cyber operations, intelligence, and special operations, as well as many logistics and administrative jobs that also require strong academic performance.\n\nHad the services used applicants' original test scores, the Navy would have classified more than 11% of its 2025 enlistments as Category IV recruits, compared with just over 7% when counting scores earned after the preparatory course. The Army also exceeded 10% of Category IV recruits, though the report did not say by how much.\n\nThe findings come as the Army and Navy begin to emerge from a yearslong recruiting crisis that left both services thousands of recruits short in recent years. Nearly three-quarters of American youth do not meet either the military's fitness or its academic requirements to qualify for service, and fewer than ever are likely to consider military careers, making innovative recruiting efforts critical.\n\nA previous inspector general report raised concerns about \"less restrictive testing standards\" in the Army's preparatory course and found that some participants struggled with English as a second language. The Pentagon also disputed those findings.",

According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "description": "The new class of smaller combatant ships will be a smaller, more agile surface combatant designed to complement the fleet’s larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe.",
    "fullText": "An American company will soon design and build the future small surface combatant (SSC) ship for the U.S. Navy. HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division has been selected to build the vessel.\n\nIngalls shipbuilders will once again engage in construction activities alongside its destroyer and amphibious ship shipbuilding lines where the national security cutters were built, using the same sequence of build.\n\n\"We look forward to supporting the Navy on this critical program,\" said Chris Kastner, HII president and CEO. \n\n\"Speed matters, and the NSC ship design is stable and produceable and will lead to predictable schedules. I have great confidence in the Ingalls team to execute this program, and in our ongoing efforts with our partners to successfully expand the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base to meet the Navy’s needs.\"\n\nThe new class of smaller combatant ships, the FF(X), will be a critical component of the Navy’s fleet of the future. The FF(X) will be a smaller, more agile surface combatant designed to complement the fleet’s larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe.\n\nThe FF(X) is a highly adaptable vessel. While its primary mission will be surface warfare, its ability to carry modular payloads and command unmanned systems enables it to execute a broad spectrum of operations, making it ready for the challenges of the modern maritime environment.\n\n\"To deliver at speed and scale, I’ve directed the acquisition of a new frigate class based on HII’s Legend-Class National Security Cutter design: a proven, American-built ship that has been protecting U.S. interests at home and abroad,\" said John C. Phelan, Secretary of the Navy. \n\n\"President Trump and the Secretary of War have signed off on this as part of the Golden Fleet. Our goal is clear: launch the first hull in the water in 2028. To expand capacity and production across our maritime industrial base, we will acquire these ships using a lead yard, and competitive follow-on strategy for multi-yard construction. Shipyards will be measured against one outcome: delivering combat power to the Fleet as fast as possible.\"\n\nSmall surface combatants have always been essential to the fleet, handling a wide range of missions where a large warship isn't required. The FF(X) will continue this vital role, and will take on more routine operations, enhancing the fleets operational flexibility, adaptability, and mission readiness, according to a press release.\n\n\"Like the Medium Landing Ship, leveraging a complete design and production baseline approach will allow the Navy and shipbuilders to reduce costs, schedule and technical risk,\" said Adm. Daryl Caudle, 34th Chief of Naval Operations. \"We know this Frigate design works, we know it operates with the Fleet, and most importantly, we know how to build it now.\"\n\nFF(X) is engineered for rapid, cost-effective production, enabling this vital capability to the fleet faster. This is made possible by basing the new frigate on HII’s proven Legend-Class National Security Cutter. This approach leverages a mature design to deliver ships to our sailors without delay, as per the release.\n\nCurrently, Ingalls is simultaneously building three classes of ships (DDG 51 Flight III, LHA, and LPD Flight II) and modernizing the Zumwalt-class of guided missile destroyers with technology upgrades including the incorporation of the conventional prompt strike weapons system. Ingalls supported the U.S. Coast Guard for nearly two decades by building and delivering 10 Legend-class national security cutters (NSCs). The final cutter was delivered in October 2023.",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

    "fullText": "I recently moved from Southern California to the more chilly and gloomy Bay Area. In other words, I was in dire need of a good winter coat.\n\nSo, I turned to three trusted Gap Inc. retailers — Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy — to find a one that'll keep me warm throughout this season and beyond.\n\nI compared similar styles based on the design, fabric, price, and overall quality. Here's how it went.\n\nI started my search for a stylish and well-constructed peacoat at Gap.\n\nWhen I walked in, I appreciated that the store was easy to navigate and neatly organized. Plus, I found the coat I was looking for almost immediately.\n\nI tried on the wool-blend wrap coat and could tell right away that it offered a nice shape and structured fit that would fit easily over layers.\n\nI liked the thick-notch lapels, and thought the material (52% recycled wool, 40% recycled polyester, 8% other) felt warm without being overly bulky. However, the wool blend felt a bit itchy, especially around the neck area where it directly touched my skin.\n\nPlus, there were no buttons and the pockets were hidden, making it look somewhat like a bathrobe.\n\nAlthough it was a good, basic option, I wanted something with a little more flair. I also had a hard time justifying the price of $248 for a coat that was 40% polyester.\n\nAfter striking out at Gap, I decided to try Banana Republic for another option. The store was neatly organized, and I was able to locate a black peacoat easily.\n\nWhen I saw the $550 price tag on the Italian-wool cashmere wrap coat, I thought, \"There is absolutely no way I would pay that much for a coat.\" But after trying it on, I reconsidered.\n\nI could immediately tell that the quality of the material (made with 91% wool, 6% cashmere, and 3% other materials) was thick and warm, with no polyester in sight. The inside lining was also silky and smooth, and the overall fabric felt soft and comfortable without itching.\n\nI also loved the overall design of this coat. The pointed collar and large pockets added chic touches that were flattering yet functional.\n\nThis try-on reminded me that it's important to invest in pieces that will actually last a long time. I know this coat is something I would wear every winter for years.\n\nI'm a big fan of Old Navy because it offers both basic and trending styles for an approachable price.\n\nHowever, my local Old Navy was less organized than the other stores I visited, so it took me a bit longer to find a black peacoat. Thankfully, I was able to find one and brought it to the fitting room.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when trying on the oversized twill overcoat is that it didn't have a waist tie, which, to me, feels like a must for adding shape and style to any peacoat.\n\nThe coat was also made of 100% recycled polyester, so I'm not sure how warm it would actually keep me during winter. The fabric also felt less flexible than the others I tried on, leaving less room for layers underneath.\n\nI did like the overall style, though — it had a spread lapel and the buttons featured an eye-catching texture.\n\nThis was my least favorite coat out of the three, but for $90, I think it's a solid option for anyone shopping on a budget.\n\nOverall, the Banana Republic coat impressed me most, thanks to its durable fabric blend, comfortable fit, and elegant design.\n\nThis shopping day reminded me that high-quality staple pieces are worth investing in.",

    "fullText": "Following the cancellation of its last frigate program, the US Navy announced Friday that it is pursuing a new frigate based on an American-made design for President Donald Trump's Golden Fleet plan.\n\nThe decision by Navy Secretary John Phelan comes just weeks after the service canceled all future orders for the Constellation-class frigate, a project which was over-budget and delayed due to volatile design changes.\n\nIn a video message on Friday, Phelan said the new frigate, based on the Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) Legends-class national security cutter design, would be part of Trump's \"Golden Fleet\" and \"built on a proven American design, in American shipyards, with an American supply chain.\" Designs for the Constellation class were based on the Italian FREMM frigate design developed by shipbuilder Fincantieri.\n\nThe first new frigate hull is expected to launch in 2028, the Navy secretary added.\n\nHII will build the vessel. It said its shipbuilders \"will once again engage in construction activities alongside its destroyer and amphibious ship shipbuilding lines where the national security cutters were built, using the same sequence of build.\" The company is also working on the latest version of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the America-class amphibious assault vessels, and the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ships.\n\nHII previously built 10 Legend-class cutters for the Coast Guard, with the final vessel delivered in October 2023.\n\nBasing the new frigate on an already complete design \"will allow the Navy and shipbuilders to reduce cost, schedule, and technical risk,\" Adm. Darryl Caudle, chief of naval operations, said.\n\nIt remains unclear what, if any, design changes have or will be made to the Legend-class cutter design for this new frigate. It is also unknown how many vessels will be built. Phelan said the Navy will build the first vessel using HII as the lead yard. Other yards may build follow-on ships.\n\nLate last month, Phelan said the Navy had a new framework that would put new classes of ships on a faster shipbuilding timeline after the cancellation of the Constellation-class frigate. The Constellation class, based on the Italian navy design, was originally expected to have roughly 80% commonality.\n\nRadical design changes weren't part of the plan, but plans change. That figure dropped to 15%, and the design changes to the Constellation ultimately led to its severe delays and cost overruns.\n\nTwo Constellation-class frigates are still under construction by Wisconsin-based shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine; however, 20 were originally ordered for $22 billion in 2020.",

    "title": "In a first, a US Navy warship in the Middle East just launched a one-way attack drone",
    "description": "A top US commander called the launch a \"significant milestone\" in delivering cheap drones to American forces.",
    "fullText": "A US Navy warship operating in the Middle East launched a one-way attack drone at sea this week, marking a first for the American military as it pushes to deploy this new technology.\n\nThe Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Santa Barbara launched the drone, a Low-cost Unmanned Combat Attack System, or LUCAS, in the Arabian Gulf on Tuesday, 5th Fleet said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nVice Adm. Curt Renshaw, the head of US Naval Forces Central Command, said the \"first successful launch of LUCAS from a naval vessel marks a significant milestone in rapidly delivering affordable and effective\" drones to American military personnel.\n\nThe drone launched from the Santa Barbara belonged to a new squadron based in the Middle East that operates the LUCAS systems, one-way attack drones that resemble the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 widely used by Russia in attacks against Ukraine.\n\nLUCAS, developed by the American engineering firm SpektreWorks, has an \"extensive\" range, can be launched by catapults and from vehicles and mobile ground stations, and has rocket-assisted takeoff capabilities.\n\n\"Bravo Zulu. U.S. Navy forces in the Middle East are advancing warfighting capability in new ways, bringing more striking power from the sea and setting conditions for using innovation as a deterrent.\" - Adm. Brad Cooper, CENTCOM Commander https://t.co/TgQ4WLbph3 pic.twitter.com/WUiAVojTht\n\nThe system's classification as a one-way attack drone, also known as a loitering munition, indicates that LUCAS can remain airborne in a target area for a period before diving down at its target and detonating.\n\n\"This platform will undoubtedly enhance regional maritime security and deterrence,\" said Renshaw, who oversees the American naval presence in the Middle East.\n\nLittoral combat ships, such as the Santa Barbara, are equipped with naval cannons, machine guns, and missiles. The ability to launch attack drones from the flight deck would give the vessels more firepower, though it's unclear whether the LUCAS systems would be used this way during combat operations.\n\nThe launch this week, which took place in waters near Iran, comes as the US seeks to rapidly produce and deploy inexpensive drones amid a rise in robotic and autonomous systems in modern warfare.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it a priority to boost the production of drones to keep pace with Russia and China. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared a plan envisioning a substantial $1 billion investment over two years to make and field hundreds of thousands of cheap attack drones.\n\nUS Central Command, which oversees US operations in the Middle East, announced on December 3 the establishment of a new task force for the military's first one-way attack drone squadron — using LUCAS drones — in the region.\n\nThe delta-wing shape is a popular design for one-way attack drones. Some models, like the LUCAS or Russia's Geran-2, appear to have derived their profiles from the notorious Iranian Shahed.\n\nRussia used Iranian-made Shaheds against Ukraine early in the war, but it has since started manufacturing its own versions. The Gerans carry small warheads and travel much slower than cruise and ballistic missiles, but they are significantly cheaper, allowing Moscow to launch dozens or hundreds in a single night. These weapons augment strike packages and make defense more difficult.\n\nIn May, President Donald Trump praised the Shahed for its low cost — estimated to be roughly $35,000 to $40,000 — and speed. He said the drone has proven extremely deadly in Ukraine.\n\nOne-way attack drones, like the Shahed, have been used in recent years by Iran-backed militants, who have launched them at American forces in the Middle East, as well as Israel and ships sailing off the coast of Yemen.",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s government has ordered its Navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the United States after President Trump ordered a “blockade” aimed at the country’s oil industry.\n\nSeveral ships sailed from the country’s east coast with a naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, according to three people familiar with the matter. The vessels departed just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to blockade sanctioned oil tankers that do business with Venezuela.\n\nThe ships — transporting urea, petroleum coke and other oil-based products — left the Port of José bound for Asian markets, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The Venezuelan government imposed the military escort in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, they said.\n\nVessels traveling with the escort did not appear on a current list of U.S. sanctioned ships, making it unclear whether they could be subject to Mr. Trump’s blockade. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he was focused on oil tankers that have violated U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nThe third person familiar with the matter, a U.S. official, said Washington was aware of escorts and was considering various courses of action, but declined to provide details.\n\nVenezuela’s state oil company, known as PDVSA, said in a statement on Wednesday that ships connected to its operations were continuing to sail “with full security, technical support and operational guarantees in legitimate exercise of their right to free navigation.”\n\nMr. Trump had announced on Tuesday evening that he was imposing a “total and complete blockade” of tankers to and from Venezuela that had violated U.S. trade sanctions. Roughly 40 percent of the tankers that have transported Venezuelan crude in recent years have been placed under U.S. sanctions, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials last week seized an Asia-bound sanctioned tanker carrying nearly two million barrels of Venezuelan crude, a major escalation of Mr. Trump’s standoff with Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government derives the bulk of its revenues from oil exports.\n\nU.S. officials have said in private in recent days that additional tankers carrying Venezuelan oil may be seized, without providing additional details.\n\nMr. Maduro has reacted to the seizure with anger and vowed to keep the oil exports flowing at all cost, said one of the three people.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Rebecca F. Elliott contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "South Korean shipyards are steadily becoming an integral part of US Navy maintenance work. Following in the footsteps of some of the nation's shipbuilding giants, another local shipbuilder just secured a new contract.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction announced on Monday that it won a deal to service a US Navy vessel — the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ship USNS Amelia Earhart — as Washington increasingly turns to South Korea's impressive commercial shipbuilding sector to support strained American yards and keep the fleet afloat.\n\nThe maintenance contract is with the Navy's Naval Supply System Command and Military Sealift Command.\n\nThe work on the Amelia Earhart — which will include an inspection of the ship's hull and systems, follow-up repairs and replacements, and a paint job — will begin in January 2026 at the Yeongdo Shipyard in Busan. The vessel will be delivered to the Navy by the end of March.\n\nThe Amelia Earhart is one of the Navy's supply ships that refuels and resupplies aircraft carriers and warships at sea. Its overhaul adds to a growing list of US Navy work going to South Korean companies.\n\nMajor South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean finished repairs on the USNS Wally Schirra, another Lewis and Clark-class vessel, in March, marking a first for a South Korean shipyard. And then HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, one of the country's largest shipbuilders, received a maintenance contract for another ship in the class, the USNS Alan Shepard.\n\nHJ Shipbuilding and Construction said it's the first midsize shipbuilder in South Korea to win a maintenance contract with the US Navy.\n\nWhile smaller voyage repairs to US Navy ships occur regularly at allied yards, the continued contract wins for South Korean shipyards highlight the growing shipbuilding collaboration between Washington and Seoul.\n\nThat partnership, which has included business deals for South Korean companies abroad as well as investments in American yards, is part of a broader willingness by the Trump administration to rely on its Pacific ally amid efforts to fix US shipbuilding issues.\n\nBillions of dollars are being put into modernizing US shipyards and addressing workforce and training issues as South Korea's government calls its investments a plan to \"Make American Shipbuilding Great Again.\" The US is also turning to Japan, another large shipbuilder, for assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are the second and third largest shipbuilders in the world, respectively, and Navy leadership is increasingly recognizing their value in this sector. China, however, dominates the shipbuilding industry, relying heavily on its dual-use yards, workforce, and equipment to make military and commercial vessels at a rapid pace.",

President Donald Trump has astounded viewers of the 126th Army-Navy football game with his unique approach to flipping a coin.\n\nWhile officiating the customary coin toss at the historic football clash at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, Trump demonstrated a bizarre heaving motion that resulted in almost no actual flipping of the coin itself.\n\nTaking the coin with a pinched left hand, and placing it into the open palm of his right, the president heaved the coin forward, sending it in a feeble, plunging arc. Helpfully, he pointed out where the coin had landed after it hit the ground.\n\nViewers immediately expressed their surprise at this pioneering method of coin-based decision-making.\n\n“Donald Trump may have executed the single worst coin flip in history,” wrote former independent congressional candidate Hal Stewart. “That coin is headed to the hall of shame!”\n\n“President Trump with the unprecedented coin toss that doesn’t appear to flip at all,” wrote author and radio host Clay Travis.\n\n“Donald Trump flips a coin like a pansy,” added political commentator Ed Krassenstein.\n\nHowever, the shock and surprise may be unwarranted as Trump has form in this area. In fact, as he has previously demonstrated, the president appears to believe that this is exactly how coins are flipped.\n\nIn 2018, Trump demonstrated his idiosyncratic style at that year’s Army-Navy Game, drawing critical fire from then-MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\n“Why is everything with this president so weird and so awkward?” Hayes asked. “Flipping a coin is not some great feat of athletics.”\n\n“To flip a coin, you just have to, uh, flip the coin. You use the thumb, you flick it into the air, get a good rotation going, let it land on the ground, see if it’s heads or tails.”\n\nThe All In host described Trump’s efforts as how one might release a baby bird into the air.\n\nThe Army Black Knights correctly called the coin in Saturday’s game tails. That did not, however, help them win, as the Navy Shipmen beat them in a close 17-16 game.",

    "fullText": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.\n\n“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.\n\nHolsey’s shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration’s strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nLong-term replacement for Holsey hasn't yet been named\n\nThe ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey’s replacement.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.\n\n“It’s never been about you, it’s been about people, it’s been about others,” Caine said. “You’ve never said ‘I’ in all the conversations we’ve had. You’ve always said ‘we.’ … The impact you’ve had will last for a long time.”\n\nHolsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHolsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators’ questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.\n\nExperts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n\nThe 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro’s grip on power.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nHolsey’s departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military’s top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.\n\nA native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”\n\nPettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey’s top deputy since late 2024. However, it’s unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.",

    "fullText": "The US Navy has submitted its recommendations on potential punishments for Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over his participation in a video that reminded US troops they have a duty to refuse illegal orders, a Pentagon official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThose recommendations have been submitted to the Pentagon’s Office of General Counsel “where they are providing a legal review and input,” the official said.\n\nCNN has reached out to Kelly’s office for comment. It was not immediately clear what recommendations were included in the report.\n\nLate last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requested advice from the Navy Secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in for more than two decades, on how to proceed to potentially punish Kelly for participating in the video, which Hegseth has claimed amounted to serious violations of the military’s code of justice.\n\n“I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25.\n\nIn the video that triggered the Trump administration’s calls for consequences, six Democratic lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”\n\nAlthough the video didn’t reference what orders service members might be receiving that would potentially be illegal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns repeatedly about the legality of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the US military’s deployment to cities over the protest of governors.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that by emphasizing service members’ legal duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other Democratic lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. President Donald Trump has called the video “seditious behavior at the highest level.”\n\nKelly’s involvement in the video is under “review” by the Pentagon, rather than subject to a formal investigation, meaning military police are not involved, a source familiar with Hegseth’s thinking previously told CNN.\n\nBehind closed doors, Hegseth has been weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain’s rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, CNN has reported.\n\nIn his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly’s comments violated several statutes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military.\n\nIn Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source familiar with Hegseth’s thinking said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN.\n\nKelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That’s because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator.",

    "description": "HD Hyundai built two new guided-missile frigates for the Philippine Navy, giving it a firepower upgrade for South China Sea.",
    "fullText": "One of South Korea's top shipbuilders is turning out new warships for the Philippines as Manila accelerates its naval modernization.\n\nThe new frigates mark a major upgrade for the Philippine fleet, offering the country a more credible defense as China turns up the pressure in the South China Sea.\n\nThe historically obsolete Philippine naval force is now modernizing to meet current and future threats. \"The Philippine Navy is professional and getting stronger,\" Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider. He said that \"adding two guided-missile frigates to their very small fleet means that China's no longer running alone in the arms competition in the South China Sea.\"\n\nSouth Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai Heavy Industries has built two HDF-3200 Hybrid frigates for the Philippines. The second vessel, BRP Diego Silang, was commissioned earlier this month, over six months after the first-in-class BRP Miguel Malvar entered service.\n\nBoth vessels bring added firepower to the Philippine Navy. They're the first Philippine warships to have vertical launch systems for missiles, a modern capability that allows the Philippines to carry and fire VL MICA surface-to-air missiles made by MBDA, a European missile company. The frigates also carry eight SSM-700K C-Star anti-ship missiles made by South Korea.\n\nWarship vertical launch systems can be refreshed with new weapons over time. They shoot missiles straight upward before they arc toward their targets, a design that works well in all conditions. Each frigate has 16 cells, allowing the Philippines to tailor its missile loadouts for different missions.\n\nThe $550 million contract for the two frigates dates to 2021 and is the latest in a string of deals between HD Hyundai and Manila. The premier South Korean shipbuilder is also constructing six offshore patrol vessels and has discussed additional projects. In all, it has built 10 ships for the Philippine Navy.\n\n\"As we strengthen our defense industry network with the Philippines and other key Southeast Asian countries, we plan to identify additional potential demand and continuously expand our business competitiveness in the region,\" the company told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nAs Manila races to modernize its military, new warships give its navy much-needed heft in a region where China now fields the world's largest fleet and increasingly throws its weight around.\n\nThe South China Sea has been a hotbed of Chinese aggression, accidents, and close-calls in recent years, with Beijing's navy, coast guard, and maritime militia vessels frequently harassing Philippine fishing boats, spraying them with water cannons, chasing them down, and even ramming into them.\n\nWithin the contested region, the Philippines' new frigates and firepower now pose a potential challenge for China.\n\n\"They would be taking a very big chance of being sunk or knocked out of the sky if they start to push around these frigates,\" Cronin said of China's ships and planes. Strategies on both sides of this long-running dispute will, however, need to be managed carefully to avoid escalation and a shift from gray-zone aggression to conflict.\n\nChina fields a huge coast guard, backed by some of the world’s largest cutters, and typically relies on it for confrontations in the South China Sea while its navy hangs back. In a recent encounter, a Chinese navy destroyer joined in the chase of a Philippine patrol ship. Its unsafe maneuvering at sea led to it slamming into one of China’s own coast guard vessels.\n\n\"It is part of China's standard operating procedure to intentionally engage in unsafe behavior and create risks of collision at sea and in the air,\" Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider at the time.\n\nThe Philippines has been investing in other military might to counter China as well.\n\nManila's Archipelagic Defense Concept, for instance, has included the acquisition of more missile systems and better intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance capabilities to monitor its waters. Additionally, more military exercises and deeper cooperation between the Philippines, US, Australia, and other Pacific parnters is also helping better prepare Manila.\n\nThe Philippines is also planning for a fleet of submarines, with another South Korean shipbuilder, Hanwha Ocean, pitching an offer to build diesel-electric submarines earlier this year, as well as construct a submarine base, with support for local maintenance, repair, overhaul, and training.\n\nNewer submarines would provide the Philippine Navy with additional ways to patrol and monitor activity within its waters and deter foes.",

    "fullText": "Palantir and the US Navy have signed a two-year deal to test whether its Foundry operational software can streamline the nation’s shipbuilding efforts and steer the Secretary of the Navy's top budget priority into port.\n\nThe $448 million contract will bring Palantir’s technology to work on shipbuilders, shipyards, and critical suppliers, said US Secretary of the Navy John Phelan and Palantir CEO Alex Karp during a presentation Tuesday evening in Washington, D.C. The company is calling this particular program \"ShipOS.\"\n\n“Every ship builder who partners with us will have AI power tools that optimize their work in real time. Every supplier in the network will be connected through intelligent logistics,” Phelan said on stage, according to US Naval Institute News. “Every program manager will have unprecedented visibility into schedule, cost and risk. We’re not just building ships faster. We’re rebuilding American maritime industrial capacity for the AI age.”\n\nPhelan listed strengthening US shipbuilding and the Maritime Industrial Base as the top priority of his $292.2 billion budget request for 2026, which called for 19 new battle force ships. The budget also invests $2.5 billion just for submarine builders to increase their \"health and supply chain enterprise.\"\n\nPalantir’s software will initially be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three shipyards, and 100 suppliers, all of which are part of the Maritime Industrial Base (MIB), a Navy program established in 2024 to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair. Palantir previously announced a deal with MIB to use its Warp Speed manufacturing software in July.\n\nThat early work resulted in leaps in efficiency, according to a press release. At General Dynamics Electric Boat – which designs, builds, repairs and modernizes nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy – submarine schedule planning was reduced from 160 manual hours to under 10 minutes. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard cut material review times from weeks to under one hour.\n\nIn order to win more business, Palantir must deliver “measurable cost savings over time, improved schedules, reduced delays, and increased production efficiency, with productivity gains offsetting the initial investment while establishing a more capable and resilient industrial base,” according to the announcement.\n\nPalantir’s head of defense Mike Gallagher told reporters at Tuesday’s event that it was now up to the software company to deliver the operational gains it has promised, according to Breaking Defense.\n\n“We have to prove the value,” he said. “And then at the end of the two-year program, the companies, if we push ourselves, will take on the sustainment costs.”\n\nOnce it's running, Foundry will aggregate data from enterprise resource planning systems, legacy databases, and operational sources to identify bottlenecks, streamline engineering workflows, and support proactive risk mitigation, the announcement stated.\n\n“This is another watershed deal for Palantir on the Foundry platform,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told El Reg. “Big step forward. We believe Palantir will be able to do this at scale.” ®",

    "description": "The Navy is investing almost half a billion dollars in Palantir artificial intelligence software that promises to speed up shipbuilding processes.",
    "fullText": "The Navy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an artificial intelligence system that it says has sped up key shipbuilding processes.\n\nIn one case, the AI cut painstaking processes of submarine schedule planning — mapping out how the many pieces of construction fit together and making sure people, parts, and yard space are available at the right time — from many hours to only minutes.\n\nThe Navy is launching the new Shipbuilding Operating System, or Ship OS, as it tries to break out of decades-old shipbuilding problems rooted in outdated technologies and work practices. The service announced a $448 million investment Thursday, saying it will accelerate the adoption of AI and autonomy across the industrial base.\n\nThe Ship OS technology is powered by Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform and began in pilot programs at submarine shipyards.\n\nAt General Dynamics Electric Boat, a long-time submarine yard located in Connecticut, submarine schedule planning saw a dramatic reduction from 160 manual hours down to under 10 minutes. And at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, material review times for submarines went from taking weeks to under an hour.\n\nThe $448 million investment will go toward the submarine industrial base and then expand. It'll be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three public yards, and 100 suppliers, Palantir said in a press release.\n\n\"This investment provides the resources our shipbuilders, shipyards, and suppliers need to modernize their operations and succeed in meeting our nation's defense requirements,\" said Navy Secretary John Phelan in a statement.\n\n\"By enabling industry to adopt AI and autonomy tools at scale, we're helping the shipbuilding industry improve schedules, increase capacity, and reduce costs,\" he added, explaining \"this is about doing business smarter and building the industrial capability our Navy and nation require.\"\n\nMaritime Industrial Base Program, a Navy initiative to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair capabilities, and Naval Sea Systems Command are overseeing the implementation of Ship OS. Both are gathering data from multiple sources to identify where the hiccups are in submarine shipbuilding, how the processes, including engineering, can be sped up, and what specific risks can be mitigated through technology.\n\nProblems in the Navy’s submarine industrial base — from shipbuilders to the repair yards — have been building for decades. Submarines are central to any Pacific fight and a top Pentagon priority, yet major programs like the upgraded Virginia-class submarines and new Columbia-class ballistic missile subs have repeatedly run into delays and cost overruns.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, has documented long-standing problems in the Navy's plans for purchasing and constructing submarines, as well as shipyard deficiencies such as worker inexperience, aging facilities and equipment, and inadequate construction space.\n\nThe introduction of the new Ship OS capability aims to address some of these problems facing US submarine shipbuilding. And once the technology has been used for the submarine programs, the Navy said, it'll apply lessons and adapt them to surface ship programs.",
