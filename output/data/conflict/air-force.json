Lindsey Graham seemed eager to please when he told the president aboard Air Force One on Sunday night that “when you first got elected in January, we made the biggest comeback ever.”\n\nBut the 79-year-old MAGA leader was apparently not impressed.\n\n“You think so, really? I didn‘t feel it was a comeback, actually,” Trump shot back, apparently offended by Graham forgetting that the 2020 election, by his account, was “rigged.”\n\nThe South Carolina Republican was quick to move the conversation on.\n\n“The bottom line is, we have a drug caliphate in our backyard,” Graham said.\n\nThe exchange took place as the president traveled back to the White House from his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, where he’s understood to have watched a livestream of Saturday night’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGraham had already sung Trump’s praises over that seizure, decried by critics as an illegal assault on the rules-based international order, during a Fox News appearance late Sunday.\n\n“The military operation in Venezuela showed America at her best, all thanks to our incredible men and women in uniform,” the senator wrote in an X post, sharing a clip from that interview. “Maduro miscalculated our Commander in Chief, and President [Donald Trump] made clear he will not be trifled with.”",

    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "fullText": "Rosen, who led Sega from the 1960s into the 90s and who died on Christmas Day, was a hugely important figure in the history of arcade and home gaming\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "description": "Camp Hero, a former military base, has been plagued by conspiracy theories about the so-called \"Montauk Project,\" which inspired \"Stranger Things.\"",
    "fullText": "As a huge \"Stranger Things\" fan, I'm officially mourning the end of my beloved show.\n\nIf you're like me and need a \"Stranger Things\" fix to help ease the pain, you can pay a visit to the real abandoned base that inspired one of Netflix's biggest franchises.\n\nWhile the interdimensional problems that have befallen our friends in Hawkins, Indiana, are completely fictional, the series is based on a real-life New York town called Montauk and its government Air Force station, which has been at the center of multiple conspiracy theories for decades — Montauk even got a name-check in the series finale.\n\nUnsubstantiated claims include that researchers at the base had repressed the memories of employees who'd been subjected to experiments throughout the '70s and '80s.\n\nToday, it's possible to visit the station, now called Camp Hero, and after checking it out in 2023, I can confidently say it's still one of the creepiest places I've ever visited.\n\nI came away understanding where the Duffer brothers, who created \"Stranger Things,\" got their inspiration for the creepy Hawkins Lab and the psychedelic experiments that go on inside.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" began as the story of a group of pre-teens who, after one of their best friends goes missing, become tangled in a dangerous web of government conspiracies, alternate dimensions, the Cold War, and more.\n\nSince its debut in 2016, the show has become a phenomenon, spawning millions of dollars in merch, tie-in novels and comics, a stage adaptation, mobile games, a tabletop game, at least one animated spinoff, and more.\n\nOne of the show's breakout characters is Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown), a young girl born with telekinesis. Immediately after her birth, she was abducted by a scientist whom she calls Papa (Matthew Modine) and taken to Hawkins Lab, where she and other children were experimented on.\n\nThe show wrapped up its fifth and final season on December 31.\n\nIn 2016, Matt and Ross Duffer confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that \"Stranger Things\" was originally sold as \"Montauk\" before they decided to switch the name and the location to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\n\"We liked Montauk, because we liked the coastal setting,\" Matt Duffer said, adding that Montauk was also the basis for Amity Island, the fictional location of \"Jaws,\" one of their favorite movies.\n\nHowever, the setting changed when they realized \"it was really going to be impossible to shoot in or around Long Island in the wintertime,\" Matt Duffer said.\n\nFilmmaker Charlie Kessler, sued the brothers in 2018, claiming they stole the idea of \"Stranger Things\" from his script \"The Montauk Project,\" Thrillist reported. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the Duffers denied his claims, and Kessler dropped the lawsuit in 2019.\n\nSpoiler for the series finale: Montauk even got referenced by name in the last episode, when Hopper mentioned that a friend mentioned that the town was looking for a new sheriff.\n\nAccording to signs in the park outlining Camp Hero's history, the US Army commissioned Camp Hero in May 1942 — five months after the US joined World War II in December 1941 — to defend against German submarines and boats.\n\nThe Army deactivated the base in 1947 and turned it over to the US Air Force in 1951, which remained there until 1982.\n\nCamp Hero, named for Major General Andrew Hero Jr., who served as the chief of coast artillery from 1926 to 1930, according to Arlington National Cemetery, opened to the public in 2002.\n\nMontauk is commonly known as The End. It's the last town on Long Island, making it the perfect spot for an Army base scanning the oceans for submarines hiding in the depths below.\n\nAs a huge fan of \"Stranger Things\" with a mild interest in secret governmental conspiracy theories, I figured I'd drive out east and laugh with my mom (who made the trek with me) about the wildest things we'd learn about Camp Hero.\n\nInstead, I came away feeling like \"Stranger Things\" got the atmosphere of this place exactly right.\n\nI'm from a town on Long Island 99 miles west of Montauk, so it took me around two hours to drive there.\n\nWhen there's no traffic, it can be a fun drive. You pass through picturesque towns worth a stop, like Amagansett, East Hampton, Southampton, Wainscott, and more.\n\nCurbed reported that celebrities including Julianne Moore, Ralph Lauren, and Robert De Niro have owned real estate in the town.\n\nI grew up on Long Island and have been to Montauk dozens of times, but I'd never explored Camp Hero before.\n\nMontauk Lighthouse, according to the Montauk Historical Society, was the first lighthouse to be built in New York after George Washington commissioned it in 1792. Today, it's a Long Island landmark that is part of the adjacent Montauk Point State Park.\n\nIt's also the fourth-oldest working lighthouse in the US and just one of 12 lighthouses to be named a National Historic Landmark.\n\nOr, if you're a New York resident with an Empire Pass like I am, it's free.\n\nAccording to New York State's Parks Department, the Empire Pass \"permits unlimited vehicle access to most facilities operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\"\n\nEssentially, it gets you into most New York state parks for free. A card costs $80 per year (or $72 a year for a digital card), or you can purchase a lifetime pass for $750 (or $742 for a digital card). Three-season and five-season passes are also available, as shown on the parks' website.\n\nAs my family members are big fans of Jones Beach, another state park, we've had an Empire Pass for as long as I can remember.\n\nI was surprised to learn that a decent chunk of land is off-limits to visitors and is a wildlife and plant sanctuary.\n\nThere are a few parks in the Montauk area that offer a good view of the bluffs, including Shadmoor State Park, Montauk Point State Park, and Ditch Plains Beach.\n\nThis wouldn't be the last warning sign I'd see that day.\n\nErosion is also a huge problem on Long Island's beaches. The Patch reported that the town of East Hampton, which includes Montauk, was given a $350,000 federal grant to address the erosion issues along the coastline in December 2022.\n\nOfficials told The Patch that, according to measurements by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Montauk's shoreline \"eroded more than 44 feet inland between 2000 and 2012.\"\n\nIn the years since, the erosion has only continued, so I heeded the sign's warnings and stayed as far back as possible.\n\nThe radar tower looms over Camp Hero. I knew I needed to make my way over there to get a good look.\n\nMore about those conspiracy theories later.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the Army built batteries throughout the base. Batteries 112 and 113, which are both still standing, contained two 16-inch guns each. The artillery was removed in 1947.\n\nEven from a distance, you can see just how big it is.\n\nBeing up close was somehow even more unsettling.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the \"giant\" radar, specifically an AN/FPS-35, was built in 1960, and it remained operational until 1980.\n\nIts radar dish was built to detect an attack on the US. As The New York Times reported in 2006, it was once \"able to detect airborne objects more than 200 miles from shore.\"\n\nAt the peak of the Cold War, multiple towers were located throughout the eastern US, but now, the Montauk tower is the only one left.\n\nThe radar tower is central to many of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero.\n\nFilmmaker Christopher Garetano, who directed a docudrama about Camp Hero called \"Montauk Chronicles\" in 2014, spoke about the radar dish during a History Channel documentary called \"The Dark Files.\"\n\n\"Every 12 seconds the radar tower would rotate and there would be animals freaking out and people getting headaches and bad dreams,\" says Garetano in \"The Dark Files,\" claiming \"people's electronic equipment would go haywire\" when the dish rotated.\n\n\"I don't want to add fuel to the fire because I don't believe all the zombie stuff,\" one resident of 40 years told The New York Post in 2020. \"But the impact that tower had on the town was real. I don't know if it affected our thoughts like some people say, but it was a force.\"\n\nTicks are frequent carriers of Lyme disease. That was more than enough to keep me away from any heavily wooded areas.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2006 that visitors to Camp Hero were given pamphlets about what to do in case they spotted an undetonated grenade or other unexploded ammunition — it did use to be an active military base, after all.\n\nAt first, I scoffed, but as the day went on, I started to see what she meant.\n\nIt was spookily silent as we walked through the woods, even though we weren't too far from the beach or a busy highway. I felt like we were in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAs you can see, it looks like we were just about to walk into a heavily wooded forest.\n\nIn the first episode of \"Stranger Things,\" Mike, Lucas, and Dustin search the woods for their friend Will after he goes missing while biking home. The trio are searching on a rainy night when they suddenly come across Eleven, who had just escaped Hawkins Lab.\n\nAt the end of season one, Eleven returns to the woods to escape the lab's clutches.\n\nThis rock was helpfully in the perfect place for me to pose for a photo.\n\nFishing is one of Camp Hero's biggest draws, and I saw a few fishermen on the beach casting their lines.\n\nHe was just a friendly pet running back to his owner, but safe to say, we were both on edge.\n\nI didn't even have the presence of mind to take a picture of this dog — that's how you know my mom and I were truly freaked out.\n\nThis building used to be a gymnasium.\n\nThe sign in front explained more about downtown Camp Hero. When the base was built in 1947, 600 men and 37 officers lived in this area, and the structures were disguised as a \"seaside fishing village,\" with artificial wood siding and fake windows.\n\nThe gym was designed to look like a church. It's the only structure left from the original \"downtown\" Camp Hero, though other newer buildings are still standing.\n\nI was half-convinced that someone was just going to pop out of the windows if I got too close.\n\nWe didn't want to scare the deer away, so we kept our distance while exploring the buildings.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive summary of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero written by Thrillist in 2016, the events that conspiracy theorists claim happened in Camp Hero were actually pretty similar to what happens in \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nAuthor Preston Nichols brought the theories into the mainstream when he published 1992's \"The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time,\" which detailed his reported experiences working at Montauk Air Force Station — he claimed he'd recovered repressed memories of his time at the base in the '70s and '80s.\n\nNichols said he worked with another former employee on something called the \"Montauk Chair,\" which used electromagnets to strengthen psychic powers. In season four of \"Stranger Things,\" Eleven uses something similar to recover her powers.\n\nNichols also said scientists at the base used abducted children (like Eleven and her \"siblings\") to perform experiments on, and that some were even sent to an unknown dimension (like the Upside Down).\n\nEventually, these experiments were shut down when one of the children summoned an interdimensional monster, Nichols wrote — just like Eleven bringing the Demogorgon to our world.\n\nJoe Loffreno told the Post in 2020 that he believes he's one of the children who were abducted and experimented on and who were mentioned in \"The Montauk Project.\"\n\n\"I didn't believe it until two years ago,\" Loffreno said. \"I was hypnotized [by a certified hypnotist] for about 40 minutes and all these memories flooded back. They did a very bad thing to us out there. We were just little kids. They had no right to experiment on us. It was a very dark, very evil thing.\"\n\nGaretano, director of \"Montauk Chronicles,\" spoke with Newsday in 2017 about the reported tunnels. He said that when the History Channel was filming for \"The Dark Files,\" they found proof that the tunnels existed.\n\n\"Something extraordinary was found, which goes against all the official statements that there isn't anything there,\" Garetano said. \"We didn't get into them, but we have footage of them that was taken by someone else.\" He added that they saw something on the \"electric resistivity imagery tests\" that were conducted.\n\nAnother local, Paul Fagan, told the New York Post that he believes a nuclear reactor might've secretly been buried at the base in the '50s, and that any conspiracy theories are actually meant to distract from the reactor's existence.\n\nThe New York Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the claims.\n\nThe Army and the Air Force have never appeared to go on the record about the claims either, and they did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider either.\n\nWhen the Army built the base, it was used to surveil the surrounding area for German submarines, and it was also an antiaircraft artillery training station. At the time, according to the sign, all antiaircraft units in New York were sent to Camp Hero for a few weeks to train.\n\nThe sign also said it was home to other surveillance and height-finding radar that \"guarded the New York City area against a surprise attack by Soviet bombers or other missiles.\"\n\nThe base was also used \"extensively\" as a live-fire training range until it was shut down in the '80s.\n\nThere are no lights and very little signage — I could see myself getting hopelessly lost in the woods.\n\nDo I really believe that there were scientists using abducted children to contact a different dimension at Camp Hero?\n\nHowever, I understand the fascination with Camp Hero — the fact that the radar tower and other disguised buildings are still standing decades later, the secluded location, and the idea that there could be secret tunnels underground are all compelling fodder for urban legends.\n\nAnyone interested in military history or conspiracy theories would learn a lot at Camp Hero, and I'd recommend visiting — but only during the day, and not on your own.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in August 2023 and was most recently updated in January 2026.",

    "description": "The US president flies on Air Force One. World leaders in other countries also have their own official aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The Boeing VC-25 is arguably the most famous jetliner in the world, even though most people have never heard of it.\n\nMost do know it, though, by the call sign it's assigned when the president of the United States is on board: Air Force One.\n\nAir Force One is instantly recognizable, both as the president's airplane and as a flying symbol of American military and economic might. With its hand-polished blue, white, and silver livery, Air Force One boldly proclaims the arrival of the leader of the free world.\n\nThe US president is not the only one to have their own presidential jet. A number of prominent international leaders also use some form of executive transport.\n\nThe Boeing 747 jumbo jet is a popular option for many nations, including China, India, and South Korea. The Airbus A330 and A340 are also commonly found in presidential fleets.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the presidents, chancellors, and prime ministers of the world travel.\n\nThe Boeing VC-25A entered service as Air Force One in 1990. At 231 feet long, it can transport 30 crew members and 71 passengers.\n\nThere are two nearly identical Boeing jets that serve as the official transport of the president. Normally, the planes are referred to by their tail numbers: 28000 and 29000. When the commander-in-chief steps on board, they take on the call sign \"Air Force One.\"\n\nNew VC-25B Air Force One planes, based on the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, are now expected to be ready by 2028 after years of delays. Boeing has already lost over $2 billion on the project due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nThe presidential jets are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nThe smaller C-32, measuring 155 feet long, normally serves as the US vice president's plane. It is used by the president for travel to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure for the larger Air Force One jet.\n\nUntil 2015, the UK prime minister chartered commercial jets for state visits.\n\nThe modified Airbus A330 was converted for VIP duties in 2015, but can still serve as a refueling tanker when not on state business. It is outfitted with 58 business-class seats.\n\nIn 2020, its gray Royal Air Force livery was repainted with a new white color and the Union Jack on the tail, a refurbishment that cost £900,000, or around $1.1 million, the BBC reported.\n\nNicknamed \"The Flying Kremlin,\" the Ilyushin Il-96-300 measures over 181 feet long and can hold 262 passengers, The National Interest reported.\n\nThe Russian president has also been known to fly on a fleet of smaller executive aircraft based on the Tupolev Tu-214 airliner. Tupolev TU-214s were designed as the Russian equivalent of Boeing 757s and can hold around 210 passengers.\n\nGerman leaders previously used modified Airbus A340-300 airliners for official travel, but they were withdrawn from service and put up for sale in 2024 after experiencing maintenance issues with German officials on board.\n\nThe German fleet also features several Airbus A320-family-based executive jets.\n\nWhen carrying the president of France, the plane's call sign is COTAM 001.\n\nFrance's presidential fleet also includes several Airbus A310-300s and Airbus A340-200s.\n\nDesignated as B-2479, the plane can fly 14,320 kilometers, or around 8898 miles, without stopping to refuel.\n\nJapan's old Air Force One plane, a Boeing 747-400, was listed for sale on an aviation classifieds site for $28 million in 2019.\n\nThe plane uses the call sign \"Code One\" while carrying the South Korean president. Leased from Korean Air, it began serving as South Korea's presidential aircraft in 2021, AeroTime reported.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil switched from using a luxurious Airbus A319 corporate jet to the more utilitarian KC-30 after the presidential plane experienced a technical issue in 2024 while visiting Mexico, Reuters reported.\n\nBrazil's presidential fleet also features several domestically produced Embraer VIP transports.\n\nThe Canadian government bought the Airbus A-330-200, known as Airbus 02, from Kuwait Airways for $50 million in 2023, CBC reported.\n\nPoland received its first Boeing 737 BBJ2 jet in 2021 featuring the serial number 0111 and nicknamed \"Roman Dmowski\" after the Polish politician, Key.Aero reported.\n\nWhen carrying the prime minister, the plane is known as \"India One.\" It can fly for 13,500 kilometers, or around 8,388 miles, without refueling.\n\nThe fleet includes Airbus A330-200s, Airbus A340-500s, and a Boeing 747-8I private jet reportedly gifted to Turkey by the Qatari government, the BBC reported.\n\nThe plane is nicknamed \"Chammae-1,\" named after North Korea's national bird, AP reported.\n\nIn June, Iran's presidential plane flew to Jordan accompanied by two Airbus A321s, The War Zone reported.\n\nAustralia's KC-30A, a modified Airbus A330, features the gray Royal Australian Air Force livery with a kangaroo design.\n\nThe plane is known as \"Wing of Zion,\" with the registration \"4X-ISR.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published by Benjamin Zhang in April 2019.

    "fullText": "Air Force One is known as the \"flying Oval Office,\" but there's another lesser-known presidential plane that can operate as a \"flying war room\": the E-4B \"Nightwatch.\"\n\nNicknamed the \"doomsday plane\" for its ability to survive a nuclear blast, the E-4B is designed to protect the president and other senior officials and function as a military command center in worst-case scenarios. It also transports the secretary of defense on international trips.\n\nMany of the E-4B's features are classified, but the US Air Force has shared some glimpses into its capabilities. Take a look inside the top-secret aircraft.\n\nThe US Air Force's fleet of four E-4Bs comprises the National Airborne Operations Center at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nEach E-4B costs $223.2 million to build, according to the US Air Force.\n\nIn 2022, the Air Force introduced a $9.5 million E-4B simulator to train pilots, flight engineers, and other crew members to operate the aircraft, according to the US Strategic Command.\n\nThe E-4B can fly for 12 hours straight without refueling.\n\nThe E-4B possesses more communications capabilities than Air Force One, with about 67 satellite dishes and antennas in the radome.\n\nThe plane's exterior also features thermal and nuclear shielding, and its electrical system can withstand electromagnetic pulses.\n\nThe layout includes a command room, conference room, briefing room, operations team work area, communications room, and a rest area. The plane can seat up to 112 people.\n\nThe E-4B isn't just a \"doomsday plane.\" The defense secretary occasionally uses it to travel overseas and hold press briefings.\n\nIn the event of a nuclear attack or other apocalyptic scenario, the president, secretary of defense, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would use the plane as a secure command and control center similar to the Pentagon.\n\nThe secretary's private quarters are furnished with a bunk and a desk with chairs.\n\nAt least one E-4B has been on continuous alert since 1975, ready to deploy at a moment's notice.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has fueled new speculation about his health after an awkward descent on Air Force One’s stairs.\n\nA video of the 79-year-old president exiting the plane at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday morning, posted by MAGA influencer Paul Villarreal, has drawn attention online for Trump’s odd hand movement and slow, careful descent.\n\nIn the video, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs. He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO – During the week head coach Brian Dutcher likened San Diego State’s games with Air Force to ‘a trip to the dentist.’ After gritting their teeth through the first half, the Aztecs earned their lollipop with a 81-58 win over the Falcons on Wednesday night at Viejas Arena.\n\nBJ Davis scored 13 of his 19 points over a 4:10 stretch in the second half to go with a game-high 6 assists, while Miles Heide had 12 points and eight rebounds to go with Taj DeGourville having his best scoring game since the season opener with 9 points on three 3’s.\n\nDefense keyed the second half swing after San Diego State (6-3, 1-0) led by 3 points at the half of their final Mountain West Conference opener. They dished a season-high 27 assists, making just four baskets without a helper, and forced 10 of Air Force’s (3-9, 0-1) 15 turnovers in the second half, getting 14 of their 19 points off turnovers in the final 20 minutes.\n\nThe second half began with a scrambling no-look save by Miles Byrd to Magoon Gwath in the post, who fed it up top for Heide to knock down his first 3-pointer of the season and the third from downtown of his career.\n\nSDSU and the Falcons traded scores until Heide picked up his third personal foul at the 15:13 mark, which brought Pharaoh Compton into the game and raised the temperature for the Aztec defense. After the Falcons turned it over just four times in the opening half, they turned it over five times in the first eight minutes of the second.\n\nHarrington got free for a straight-line drive for a layup and then Compton got fouled on a dunk for an and-1 that gave the Scarlet and Black their first double-digit lead at the 14:13 mark.\n\nDavis then had his ‘hibachi’ moment, knocking down a 3-pointer to start a stretch where he scored 13 of SDSU’s next 15 points. Over that span the Aztec lead grew to 61-44 and then even further when Gwath split a pair of free throws and DeGourville tripled.\n\nSDSU allowed the Falcons to score multiple buckets in a row just once in the second half, a 6-0 stretch just after the nine minute mark, but by then the game was well out of reach.\n\nA final run of 9-0 put a bow on things, with Davis knocking down the final of his four triples and Compton punctuating it with a dunk, as the forward had 11 points in 17 minutes off the bench.\n\nBrandon Pollard - The Sporting Tribune\n\nSan Diego State forward Miles Heide (40) fights for the ball during an NCAA Basketball game between Air Force and San Diego State, Wednesday December 17, 2025 at Viejas Arena in San Diego, Calif.\n\nIt had seemed too easy over the first few possessions for the Aztecs, beginning the game with an and-1 by Gwath and a cutting Heide layup in the first 42 seconds of the game.\n\nBut the Falcons 3-2 zone caused problems when SDSU was forced to work their half-court set, going scoreless over a 5:32 stretch where they missed eight in a row from the field. During that time the Falcons opportunistically converted on a pair of open 3-pointers in an 8-0 spurt that led to an early 3 point lead.\n\nIt grew as large as 4 points when Eli Robinson tripled again from the right wing at 12:49, but a steal and score by Davis led to a transition dunk that woke up the Scarlet and Black offense.\n\nJeremiah Oden splashed a long ball, then Reese Dixon-Waters found Heide left alone in the middle of the zone for an uncontested dunk, which kick-started SDSU’s sixth 10-plus point run of the season. Playing with a quicker tempo helped the Aztecs reel off six makes in a row, pushing the lead out to 23-15 with 8:28 remaining, then after a Falcons make, DeGourville nailed a straight-away 3-pointer to give SDSU their largest lead of the half.\n\nBut the Scarlet and Black struggled shooting down the stretch, making just three shots—all on layups or in the paint— while missing 11 of their final 14 shots from the field. It enabled the Falcons to creep back within 33-30 at the half.\n\nNine of the Aztecs that played in the opening 20 made a field goal, with Gwath and Heide’s 7 points apiece the most on the squad.\n\nAfter notching a win against a team ranked well into the 300’s in most major overall metrics, the Aztecs will face the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats next. Tip off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 20 at PHX Arena in Phoenix, Ariz.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it was acquiring two Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for $400 million to ​establish a training and sustainment program for its future presidential airlift fleet.\n\nThe ‌purchase is part of the service's efforts to accelerate the presidential airlift program as it prepares to ‌transition to the newer and larger 747-8 model from the aging 747-200, the Air Force said in a statement.\n\nThe first aircraft is expected to arrive in early 2026, with the second delivery scheduled before year-end.\n\nThe Air Force said the acquisition was necessary because ⁠the 747-8i was no longer ‌in active production by Boeing and it differed significantly from the 747-200 aircraft currently used in the presidential fleet. The two ‍planes will be used for crew training and as a source of spare parts, officials said.\n\nSeveral published reports suggested the Air Force was buying the planes from Lufthansa, one of the ​few passenger airlines to have bought the 747-8 model, which was more popular ‌with cargo carriers before Boeing ended production in early 2023. A spokesperson for the German airline declined to comment.\n\nThe purchase is separate from two 747-8i aircraft that Boeing is currently modifying under the VC-25B program, which will serve as the next generation of Air Force One. The first of those heavily modified aircraft is expected to ⁠be delivered in mid-2028, the Air Force said.\n\nAn ​Air Force official, speaking on background, said the ​two training aircraft were also distinct from a 747-8i aircraft gifted to the United States by Qatar.\n\nThe Air Force One program has faced ‍delays and cost overruns ⁠since Boeing agreed to a $3.9 billion fixed-price contract in 2018 to deliver two modified 747-8s to replace the current fleet.\n\nThe Air Force said on Friday ⁠the delivery of the first of the two new Air Force One jets from Boeing had ‌been delayed by another year to mid-2028.",

    "fullText": "A JetBlue pilot said he nearly had a midair collision with a US Air Force plane on Friday.\n\nFlight 1112 was flying from Curaçao to New York. The island country, which is part of the Netherlands, is about 40 miles off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after takeoff, the JetBlue pilot contacted Curaçao's air traffic control center.\n\n\"We just had traffic pass directly in front of us, within 5 miles, maybe 2 or 3 miles,\" he said in a recording published by LiveATC.net. He added that it was an Air Force air-to-air refueller.\n\nThe JetBlue Airbus A320 was also only about 600 feet below the military aircraft. The pilot said the latter was at 34,000 feet while the JetBlue plane was passing through 33,400 feet and ascending to 35,000 feet.\n\n\"So we had to stop our climb and actually just descend to avoid hitting them,\" the pilot said.\n\nWhile the distance between the two aircraft gave the plane enough time to maneuver, the pilot was evidently shocked.\n\n\"They don't have their transponder on,\" he said. \"It's outrageous.\"\n\n\"I don't have anything on my scope,\" the controller replied. \"You are totally right, sir.\"\n\nThe pilot then asked the controller to make a note of it, adding: \"We almost had a midair collision up here.\"\n\nTransponders are a vital piece of aircraft equipment, as they send signals to air traffic control centers and to other nearby planes.\n\nThe Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, relies on active nearby transponders to warn both aircraft and, if necessary, provide instructions for them to avoid each other.\n\nHowever, military aircraft may turn off their transponders to remain undetected during sensitive missions.\n\nThe US military has launched air strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea amid escalating tensions with Venezuela. It has also deployed thousands of troops and the USS Gerald R.

    "description": "Tanker maintenance workers spend their days crawling in and out of fuel tanks. New tech might make a hard job a little easier.",
    "fullText": "Inside some of the Air Force's oldest refueling aircraft, technicians are crawling through tight, dirty spaces, painstakingly cleaning sealant on fuel tanks and tightening loose rivets.\n\nThey climb into the dark, cramped tanks with little more than a flashlight, some tools, and shaky comms. It can be hard to breathe, the air smells like jet fuel, the fixes aren't always clear, and the punishing work can be dangerous if done wrong.\n\nIt's a job that hasn't changed much in over 50 years, but new gear, including a live-feed video headset and artificial intelligence-enabled technology, is finally bringing it into the 21st century.\n\nThe Integrated Respirator Information System, known as IRIS and developed by MetroStar and ActionStreamer, is speeding up the maintenance process, company officials and Air Force technicians say, and making it safer and more efficient.\n\nTankers are important logistics assets, what the Air Force calls \"silent enablers,\" that support missions by helping keep fighters and bombers airborne for longer than the onboard fuel tanks can sustain alone. For instance, Operation Midnight Hammer, which saw US stealth bombers strike Iran's nuclear site this year, involved dozens of refueling tankers supporting the strike package.\n\nAlthough fighter aircraft like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter or bombers like the B-2 Spirit get the most attention, tankers like the KC-135 Stratotanker are critical to US and allied airpower. For them to be useful, though, they have to be well-maintained.\n\nIRIS began as an idea from two maintainers who noticed the broader potential of ActionStreamer's live-streaming tech — gear originally built for athletes to capture first-person views during games. The Air Force technicians pursued the concept for years, even as they rotated through new assignments and bases.\n\nThe Air Force had long believed that tools like this could be a major boost for maintainers. There were early forays into video tech in the 2000s, but the \"technology wasn't quite there,\" Master Sgt. Troy French, a former 100th Maintenance Squadron member, told Business Insider. \"An initial phase of this was kind of set up and abandoned because cameras weren't small enough.\"\n\nNow, though, Air Force maintainers based at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, a central refueling base for the US missions in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, have been testing out IRIS.\n\n\"They were, to be honest with you, a little apprehensive to start with,\" ActionStreamer CEO Bob Lento said, noting it was the first significant change to how technicians have done their jobs in years. But by the end of the first week, attitudes had flipped. \"We were taking the cart out of the hangar into a safe area to do some software punch-ups, and they were like, 'Wait a minute, where are you going with that? We need to use that now.'\"\n\nOn a tanker aircraft like the KC-135, there's a hole just big enough for a person to fit through under the wing. It's the access point for the fuel tanks. \"You crawl up there and you contort your body to be able to lie down flat and then put your feet in,\" French said. Inside, it is a tight space with lots of bumps and edges.\n\nThe workers wear heavy protective suits to guard against fuel exposure and keep sweat out of the tanks. They carry a flashlight and breathe through respirators that feed fresh air in from a hose running outside the aircraft.\n\nOutside the aircraft, a support team stands by. One person runs tools to the person inside the tank while another monitors for any hazards or issues.\n\n\"If you need something, sometimes you just have to peel the respirator back, like, 'Hey, I need this extra wrench that I forgot,'\" French said.\n\nThe runner will grab it and bring it to the entry point, screaming into the tank or pulling on the respirator hose to get the technician's attention. \"If you're really deep in the tank, then you have to crawl back to get it from them, and you have to wait there for them to bring it, reducing the amount of time you're actually working.\"\n\nBefore a worker enters the aircraft, they'll know what issues they're looking for. A broken rivet, for instance, along with regular fuel tanker maintenance to keep the aircraft operating. But sometimes they adjust a different part in the wrong area of the refueling aircraft or leave a tool inside the tanker.\n\nThere's a lot of double-checking the work. Steps like removing sealant, cleaning, and putting adhesion in the tank require approval from other team members. It's inherently an hourslong job made even longer by wait times and communication lags.\n\nAnd that's if it all runs smoothly. Sometimes, technicians make mistakes, extending the time. \"A simple sealant job can turn from a couple of hours of scraping and then eventually reapplying to another day because it turned out that you applied it to the wrong spot,\" Tech Sgt. Chris Anderson, with the 100th Air Refueling Wing, said. \"The way that we did things left a lot of room for error.\"\n\nA logical fix, Frank said, was something wearable: \"a camera with two-way audio would be awesome, and if it had lights, that'd be a second bonus.\"\n\nThe IRIS technology sits on top of the face mask tanker maintenance workers wear. It features a high-definition video camera, a two-way comms system that goes inside the mask, and a hands-free light. IRIS shows everything the technician is looking at to those outside the fuel tank and allows them to communicate with their team.\n\nIt connects to a mobile workstation outside the aircraft. On the cart, which can host up to four IRIS units simultaneously, the support team can see what the technician sees, talk them through the work, and record the footage.\n\nVideo records help verify what each shift completed and resolve disputes quickly. For instance, Anderson said that the day shift had cleared a fuel puddle, but the next shift found one and questioned the work. IRIS showed that the first team had done the job, revealing, as French said, \" another problem, something's leaking.\" That prevented unnecessary rework and let them fix the issue.\n\nIn the past, a tricky aircraft issue could halt work while the right Air Force experts traveled in to assess it. Now, IRIS can send video to them instantly or launch a group call so everyone can see exactly what the technician sees.\n\nDevelopers also see AI playing a growing role in streamlining the job. As a technician uses IRIS, an AI agent compiles images and data to make requests, anticipate needed work, and handle forms. That frees technicians from what retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Cedric George called \"shallow work,\" so when their shift ends, \"all he or she has to do is button up, clean up, go home.\"\n\nIRIS is currently in use only at Mildenhall, but early results are promising, as the Air Force considers expanding it to other bases. Technicians using the system haven't had any safety incidents, and inspections are running 60% faster in test environments, according to pilot evaluations and internal logs. Based on KC-135 maintenance baselines, MetroStar estimates IRIS could save 35,000 maintainer hours and add more than 7,000 aircraft availability days.\n\nGeorge attributed the success of IRIS to the technicians who wanted to revamp the decades-old process to make it better for future workers. \"This is not for the faint of heart, it's dirty work,\" he said, saying current technicians who worked on IRIS believe future maintainers \"have to have something better than what we have now.\"",

The Air Force didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration last month issued a warning to U.S. aircraft urging them to “exercise caution” when in Venezuelan airspace, “due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.”\n\nAccording to the air traffic recording, the controller responded to the pilot, “It has been outrageous with the unidentified aircraft within our air.”",
