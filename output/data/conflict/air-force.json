    "description": "The U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it was acquiring two Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for $400 million to ​establish a training and sustainment program for its future presidential airlift fleet.\n\nThe ‌purchase is part of the service's efforts to accelerate the presidential airlift program as it prepares to ‌transition to the newer and larger 747-8 model from the aging 747-200, the Air Force said in a statement.\n\nThe first aircraft is expected to arrive in early 2026, with the second delivery scheduled before year-end.\n\nThe Air Force said the acquisition was necessary because ⁠the 747-8i was no longer ‌in active production by Boeing and it differed significantly from the 747-200 aircraft currently used in the presidential fleet. The two ‍planes will be used for crew training and as a source of spare parts, officials said.\n\nSeveral published reports suggested the Air Force was buying the planes from Lufthansa, one of the ​few passenger airlines to have bought the 747-8 model, which was more popular ‌with cargo carriers before Boeing ended production in early 2023. A spokesperson for the German airline declined to comment.\n\nThe purchase is separate from two 747-8i aircraft that Boeing is currently modifying under the VC-25B program, which will serve as the next generation of Air Force One. The first of those heavily modified aircraft is expected to ⁠be delivered in mid-2028, the Air Force said.\n\nAn ​Air Force official, speaking on background, said the ​two training aircraft were also distinct from a 747-8i aircraft gifted to the United States by Qatar.\n\nThe Air Force One program has faced ‍delays and cost overruns ⁠since Boeing agreed to a $3.9 billion fixed-price contract in 2018 to deliver two modified 747-8s to replace the current fleet.\n\nThe Air Force said on Friday ⁠the delivery of the first of the two new Air Force One jets from Boeing had ‌been delayed by another year to mid-2028.",

    "fullText": "A JetBlue pilot said he nearly had a midair collision with a US Air Force plane on Friday.\n\nFlight 1112 was flying from Curaçao to New York. The island country, which is part of the Netherlands, is about 40 miles off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after takeoff, the JetBlue pilot contacted Curaçao's air traffic control center.\n\n\"We just had traffic pass directly in front of us, within 5 miles, maybe 2 or 3 miles,\" he said in a recording published by LiveATC.net. He added that it was an Air Force air-to-air refueller.\n\nThe JetBlue Airbus A320 was also only about 600 feet below the military aircraft. The pilot said the latter was at 34,000 feet while the JetBlue plane was passing through 33,400 feet and ascending to 35,000 feet.\n\n\"So we had to stop our climb and actually just descend to avoid hitting them,\" the pilot said.\n\nWhile the distance between the two aircraft gave the plane enough time to maneuver, the pilot was evidently shocked.\n\n\"They don't have their transponder on,\" he said. \"It's outrageous.\"\n\n\"I don't have anything on my scope,\" the controller replied. \"You are totally right, sir.\"\n\nThe pilot then asked the controller to make a note of it, adding: \"We almost had a midair collision up here.\"\n\nTransponders are a vital piece of aircraft equipment, as they send signals to air traffic control centers and to other nearby planes.\n\nThe Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, relies on active nearby transponders to warn both aircraft and, if necessary, provide instructions for them to avoid each other.\n\nHowever, military aircraft may turn off their transponders to remain undetected during sensitive missions.\n\nThe US military has launched air strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea amid escalating tensions with Venezuela. It has also deployed thousands of troops and the USS Gerald R.

    "description": "Tanker maintenance workers spend their days crawling in and out of fuel tanks. New tech might make a hard job a little easier.",
    "fullText": "Inside some of the Air Force's oldest refueling aircraft, technicians are crawling through tight, dirty spaces, painstakingly cleaning sealant on fuel tanks and tightening loose rivets.\n\nThey climb into the dark, cramped tanks with little more than a flashlight, some tools, and shaky comms. It can be hard to breathe, the air smells like jet fuel, the fixes aren't always clear, and the punishing work can be dangerous if done wrong.\n\nIt's a job that hasn't changed much in over 50 years, but new gear, including a live-feed video headset and artificial intelligence-enabled technology, is finally bringing it into the 21st century.\n\nThe Integrated Respirator Information System, known as IRIS and developed by MetroStar and ActionStreamer, is speeding up the maintenance process, company officials and Air Force technicians say, and making it safer and more efficient.\n\nTankers are important logistics assets, what the Air Force calls \"silent enablers,\" that support missions by helping keep fighters and bombers airborne for longer than the onboard fuel tanks can sustain alone. For instance, Operation Midnight Hammer, which saw US stealth bombers strike Iran's nuclear site this year, involved dozens of refueling tankers supporting the strike package.\n\nAlthough fighter aircraft like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter or bombers like the B-2 Spirit get the most attention, tankers like the KC-135 Stratotanker are critical to US and allied airpower. For them to be useful, though, they have to be well-maintained.\n\nIRIS began as an idea from two maintainers who noticed the broader potential of ActionStreamer's live-streaming tech — gear originally built for athletes to capture first-person views during games. The Air Force technicians pursued the concept for years, even as they rotated through new assignments and bases.\n\nThe Air Force had long believed that tools like this could be a major boost for maintainers. There were early forays into video tech in the 2000s, but the \"technology wasn't quite there,\" Master Sgt. Troy French, a former 100th Maintenance Squadron member, told Business Insider. \"An initial phase of this was kind of set up and abandoned because cameras weren't small enough.\"\n\nNow, though, Air Force maintainers based at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, a central refueling base for the US missions in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, have been testing out IRIS.\n\n\"They were, to be honest with you, a little apprehensive to start with,\" ActionStreamer CEO Bob Lento said, noting it was the first significant change to how technicians have done their jobs in years. But by the end of the first week, attitudes had flipped. \"We were taking the cart out of the hangar into a safe area to do some software punch-ups, and they were like, 'Wait a minute, where are you going with that? We need to use that now.'\"\n\nOn a tanker aircraft like the KC-135, there's a hole just big enough for a person to fit through under the wing. It's the access point for the fuel tanks. \"You crawl up there and you contort your body to be able to lie down flat and then put your feet in,\" French said. Inside, it is a tight space with lots of bumps and edges.\n\nThe workers wear heavy protective suits to guard against fuel exposure and keep sweat out of the tanks. They carry a flashlight and breathe through respirators that feed fresh air in from a hose running outside the aircraft.\n\nOutside the aircraft, a support team stands by. One person runs tools to the person inside the tank while another monitors for any hazards or issues.\n\n\"If you need something, sometimes you just have to peel the respirator back, like, 'Hey, I need this extra wrench that I forgot,'\" French said.\n\nThe runner will grab it and bring it to the entry point, screaming into the tank or pulling on the respirator hose to get the technician's attention. \"If you're really deep in the tank, then you have to crawl back to get it from them, and you have to wait there for them to bring it, reducing the amount of time you're actually working.\"\n\nBefore a worker enters the aircraft, they'll know what issues they're looking for. A broken rivet, for instance, along with regular fuel tanker maintenance to keep the aircraft operating. But sometimes they adjust a different part in the wrong area of the refueling aircraft or leave a tool inside the tanker.\n\nThere's a lot of double-checking the work. Steps like removing sealant, cleaning, and putting adhesion in the tank require approval from other team members. It's inherently an hourslong job made even longer by wait times and communication lags.\n\nAnd that's if it all runs smoothly. Sometimes, technicians make mistakes, extending the time. \"A simple sealant job can turn from a couple of hours of scraping and then eventually reapplying to another day because it turned out that you applied it to the wrong spot,\" Tech Sgt. Chris Anderson, with the 100th Air Refueling Wing, said. \"The way that we did things left a lot of room for error.\"\n\nA logical fix, Frank said, was something wearable: \"a camera with two-way audio would be awesome, and if it had lights, that'd be a second bonus.\"\n\nThe IRIS technology sits on top of the face mask tanker maintenance workers wear. It features a high-definition video camera, a two-way comms system that goes inside the mask, and a hands-free light. IRIS shows everything the technician is looking at to those outside the fuel tank and allows them to communicate with their team.\n\nIt connects to a mobile workstation outside the aircraft. On the cart, which can host up to four IRIS units simultaneously, the support team can see what the technician sees, talk them through the work, and record the footage.\n\nVideo records help verify what each shift completed and resolve disputes quickly. For instance, Anderson said that the day shift had cleared a fuel puddle, but the next shift found one and questioned the work. IRIS showed that the first team had done the job, revealing, as French said, \" another problem, something's leaking.\" That prevented unnecessary rework and let them fix the issue.\n\nIn the past, a tricky aircraft issue could halt work while the right Air Force experts traveled in to assess it. Now, IRIS can send video to them instantly or launch a group call so everyone can see exactly what the technician sees.\n\nDevelopers also see AI playing a growing role in streamlining the job. As a technician uses IRIS, an AI agent compiles images and data to make requests, anticipate needed work, and handle forms. That frees technicians from what retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Cedric George called \"shallow work,\" so when their shift ends, \"all he or she has to do is button up, clean up, go home.\"\n\nIRIS is currently in use only at Mildenhall, but early results are promising, as the Air Force considers expanding it to other bases. Technicians using the system haven't had any safety incidents, and inspections are running 60% faster in test environments, according to pilot evaluations and internal logs. Based on KC-135 maintenance baselines, MetroStar estimates IRIS could save 35,000 maintainer hours and add more than 7,000 aircraft availability days.\n\nGeorge attributed the success of IRIS to the technicians who wanted to revamp the decades-old process to make it better for future workers. \"This is not for the faint of heart, it's dirty work,\" he said, saying current technicians who worked on IRIS believe future maintainers \"have to have something better than what we have now.\"",

The Air Force didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration last month issued a warning to U.S. aircraft urging them to “exercise caution” when in Venezuelan airspace, “due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.”\n\nAccording to the air traffic recording, the controller responded to the pilot, “It has been outrageous with the unidentified aircraft within our air.”",
