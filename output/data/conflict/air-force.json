    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

    "fullText": "Kessel Run, formally \"Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Detachment 12\", is a United States Air Force software development division, based in Hanscom Air Force Base and Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 2017 by the Defense Innovation Unit in response to the need to modernize legacy Air Force software.\n\nIn October 2016, Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, was leading a group touring the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in his role as inaugural chairman of the Defense Innovation Board.[1] The CAOC at Al Udeid oversees air force operations for over 20 countries, and at the time was engaged in the War in Iraq against the Islamic State.[1]\n\nOne of the Air Operations Center tasks was planning daily aerial refueling operations to support combat missions. This was done off the main CAOC hall, in a windowless room with a whiteboard bearing magnetic pucks and plastic laminated cards, and physically measuring distance on the board to determine how long planes could stay in the air.[1][2] The resulting data was manually entered into an Excel spreadsheet known as \"the Gonkulator\" by a person called \"the Gonker\".[1][2] When a VBScript run on the spreadsheet confirmed the data was correct, another person, called \"the Thumper\", manually typed in the result into a Master Air Attack Planning Toolkit, which helped generate the Air Tasking Order back at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina.[1] Yet another person watched to verify against retyping errors.[2] The process took eight to 12 hours each day for three or eight people.[1][2][3] If there was a change needed, the process needed to restart.[2][3] When Schmidt and the Defense Information Board asked whether the base had access to more modern software to automate this process, the answer was: \"Yes, but it doesn't work.\"[1]\n\nAir Operations Center software had been in use mostly unchanged since the 1990s.[1] From 2006 to 2011, Lockheed Martin worked on the concept of modernizing it, but did not take up the project.[4] A Northrop Grumman project to modernize AOC software was commissioned in 2013 for $374 million for development, and $3.5 billion for lifetime maintenance.[4] By 2016, when the Defense Innovation Board was touring Al Udeid, nothing had been delivered.[2] The development price eventually grew to $745 million, and was three years behind schedule, with an estimated launch date of December 2019, when the project was eventually cancelled in July 2017.[4]\n\nAlso touring the Al Udeid CAOC with Schmidt in October 2016 was Raj Shah, tech entrepreneur and managing partner of DIUx, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental.[1][2] Shah was a former Air Force fighter pilot who had first hand experience of the importance of regular aerial refueling.[2] That same night, he called lieutenant colonel Enrique Oti who was head of Air Force programs for DIUx in Silicon Valley.[1] They arranged an unusual partnership between Air Force developers and Pivotal Software, and got it approved by General Jeffrey Harrigian, commanding United States Air Forces Central Command.[1] Rather than rewrite the entire AOC software suite, they would just do the tanker whiteboard.[clarification needed][1] In December 2016, coders and program managers were visiting Al Udeid to talk to users. By April 2017, the aerial refueling tanker application, named Jigsaw, was in use at the CAOC; four months from start to production, when a more average Defense Department software operation took as much as three to five years.[1][5]\n\nThe speed of development was credited to the Agile development process, an iterative, adaptive approach, that doesn't try to get the entire solution in the first release. The first version of an application is intentionally only about a 60% solution, which is then changed and improved via rapid iterations as users give feedback.[6] Though this agile development is fairly basic in the modern software industry, it was unusual for the Defense Department.[7] The development team would later adopt the hashtag #AgileAF - the AF, they assure, stands for Air Force.[1]\n\nThe total cost of Jigsaw was reported at $1.5 million (Captain Bryon Kroger, Chief Operating Officer of the project),[5] to $2.2 million (Shah),[1] \"chump change\" (Harrigian).[8] With it, tanker planning was not only faster, taking two to three hours for a single person, but was more reliable, so two to three fewer tankers were scrambled each day.[1][3] Each scramble had a cost in fuel and maintenance of about $250,000 each.[1][2] Jigsaw saved 350,000 pounds of fuel a week.[8] Its development costs were recouped in the first week.[1][9]\n\nIn April 2017, after delivering Jigsaw, Oti, Kroger, and others, got approval to form an official Air Force software development team at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center named Project Kessel Run.[2][10][5] The name \"Kessel Run\" came from a line in the 1977 science fiction film Star Wars, spoken by smuggler Han Solo, bragging about the speed of his ship, the Millennium Falcon.[2] It represented the project's intent to \"smuggle\" new software development capability into the Air Force and use it to set new software development speed records.[9]\n\nIn May 7, 2018, the Kessel Run Experimentation Lab set up at a WeWork shared facility in central Boston. It was modeled after Pivotal Labs training locations in Cambridge, San Francisco, and Washington.[11] It was managed from the AFLCMC at Hanscom Air Force Base, which believed the innovation advantages in coworking and creativity would outweigh the hassles of distance and security.[11][12] The Lab initially had space for 90 engineers, but planned for 300 within a year.[9] Many were on temporary assignment from other Air Force bases; yet others would be sent off to Pivotal Labs offices across the country for training in modern software techniques.[11][13][14] The Kessel Run motto on the wall was \"Code. Deploy. Win.\", a play on the Air Force's motto, \"Fly. Fight. Win.\".[12]\n\nOn January 2, 2019, the Kessel Run Experimentation Laboratory moved to a different location in a Boston skyscraper.[15] Kessel Run's budget since mid 2017 had grown to approximately $140 million, including workspace and personnel, and the operational software produced claimed savings of $13 million and 1,100 man-hours per month.[15]\n\nOn May 8, 2019, Kessel Run formally became Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Detachment 12, commanded by Colonel Oti, who had been effectively leading it for just under a year.[16] It had nearly 700 airmen, government civilians, and contractors.[16] Oti was replaced as commander by Colonel Brian Beachkofski on April 15, 2020, with the ceremony held over Zoom teleconference.[17] On June 27, 2022, Beachkofski was replaced as commander by Colonel Richard Lopez, who took the title of senior materiel leader.[18] Lopez had previously been the director of the LevelUP Code Works software factory inspired by Kessel Run.[18][19]\n\nThe March 2019 Defense Innovation Board report on software acquisitions included a chapter on Kessel Run subtitled \"The Future of Defense Acquisitions Is #AgileAF\".[21]\nIn September and October 2019, Kessel Run received multiple awards: the General Larry O. Spencer Innovation award; the Theodore von Kármán award for modernizing software for the F-35; and the inaugural Defense Acquisition Software Innovation Team award.[22][23] A 2019 editorial in Defense One said that Kessel Run was \"widely seen as the gold standard of military tech done right ... also the most hyped military program office in operation today\".[24]\n\nNot all reactions were positive. A 2019 anonymous survey of KREL application users found that some applications did not meet user needs, and that success metrics, documentation, and responsiveness to user feedback could all be lacking.[25] A 2020 Harvard Kennedy School project found and tried to address internal discontent among Kessel Run staff with emerging bureaucracy and increasing technical complexity.[26] The Air Force's Deputy Chief Information Officer, Lauren Knausenberger, acknowledged in 2020 that Kessel Run was having growing pains, but said that was a result of its success.[27]\n\nKessel Run inspired multiple agile software development teams across the Air Force and United States Department of Defense.[28] They were called \"software factories\".[29] The original definition of software factory was a set of software tools to write and automatically build, test, and document applications; the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense slightly redefined that to be a software assembly plant that automated the develop, build, test, release and deliver phases, but in each case to support agile software development practices.[30]\n\nKobayashi Maru, formally Space C2, or Space Command and Control, in California, was the second such software factory, in August 2018.[28] It was named after an impossible test in the Star Trek science fiction universe.[31] Just as Kessel Run came from an effort to replace an outdated system by getting around bureaucratic rules, Kobayashi Maru intended to update the software of the troubled Joint Mission System (jointly run with the United States Space Force) for space command and control and situational awareness.[32][33]\n\nBESPIN - an acronym for Business and Enterprise Systems Product Innovation, but also the name of a planet in the Star Wars universe - was the third Air Force software factory, launched in early 2019 in Montgomery, Alabama, to create apps for maintenance crew chiefs, aircrew readiness, and ammunition crews.[28][31] Space Camp, in Colorado, and Section31, in California, spun off of Kobayashi Maru.[31] LevelUP, in Texas, was a joint cyber operations system for the Unified Platform, connecting the Army, Marines, and United States Cyber Command, debuting in April 2019.[31] By September 2021, there were 17 Air Force software factories across the country.[34]\n\nSoftware factories weren't limited to the Air Force. The Navy was inspired by Kessel Run to stand up its first software factory, The Forge, in Riverdale, Maryland, in March 2021.[35] The Army Software Factory debuted in April 2021 in Austin Community College in Texas, as part of the United States Army Futures Command.[36][37] In February 2022, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks wrote a DOD Software Modernization Strategy memo encouraging increased used of software factories throughout the Defense Department; at the time there were 29.[38] By April 2022 the United States Coast Guard was planning a software factory based on the Air Force model.[39] The Marine Corps Software Factory was co-located with the Army Software Factory as a three year test project in Austin in March 2023.[40]\n\nThe 24th Air Force's Air Force Cyber Proving Ground may be another related activity.\n\nJigsaw, the 2017 aerial refueling planning application that started Kessel Run, was bought and used by NATO in multiple countries in 2020 and 2021.[41][42]\n\nThe team's second and third projects after Jigsaw were Chainsaw and Raven, applications for assembling and communicating target information.[1] Chainsaw was in operation by November 2017, consolidated many programs into one, and cut the process for dynamic targeting from an hour or two to minutes. Raven, for target development management, cut 12 hours of work down to three or four, and was ready in early 2018.[43]\n\nStarting in late 2018, Kessel Run joined the task of fixing the troubled software for the maintenance of the F-35 fighter jet, called ALIS, for Autonomic Logistic Information System.[44] ALIS was a 17 year old proprietary system full of bugs and data gaps.[45] Maintainers had to keep separate databases because they could not rely on ALIS data.[46] The project to fix ALIS, including Kessel Run, Pivotal, and Lockheed Martin, its original creators, was called Mad Hatter, named by the developers.[44] It officially started in October 2018, but took until January 2019 before developers could write code, while the Air Force negotiated with Lockheed Martin as to what parts of the proprietary ALIS system the government could be able to reach.[44] The Mad Hatter suite of eight programs was tested and favorably evaluated by F-35 aircraft maintainers in March 2020.[47] In July 2020, it was renamed to Torque, and adapted for maintenance of the F-22 stealth jet and CV-22 tiltrotor aircraft,[48] then the C-130J turboprop in January 2021.[49] Meanwhile, on the F-35 itself, between 2020 and 2022 ALIS was gradually replaced by ODIN, the Operational Data Integrated Network, \"leveraging\" the software practices of Kessel Run, but built by Lockheed Martin.[50][51]\n\nIn 2021, Kessel Run began deploying the initial version of KRADOS, the Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite meant to replace the Theater Battle Management Core Systems that created air tasking orders throughout AOCs all over the world.[52] The first AOC to use the suite operationally was again the 609th Air Operations Center at Al Udeid, in May 2021, after using the Beta version since December 2020.[53] KRADOS linked together nine applications through cloud-based data, including the latest version of Jigsaw, Kessel Run's first application for tanker planning, and Slapshot, for planning the rest of the air missions and building the Master Air Attack Plan.[54] In 2017, Lockheed Martin had received a $38 million contract to maintain the older TBMCS, but the 609th kept finding problems, so turned to Kessel Run, which delivered the beta version of KRADOS three weeks after receiving the request in November 2020.[55] By August 2022, the 603rd AOC in Ramstein, Germany, employed elements of KRADOS for visualization, though it was not considered mature enough to create air tasking and airspace control orders.[56][57] In January 2023, the 609th replaced the TBMCS with KRADOS entirely.[58]\n\nThe Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA), is a real time Air Force base resource management tool. It used a different development model: the coding was done by software company Leidos, and the program management by Kessel Run.[59] In August 2019, Moody Air Force Base used the software to monitor and prepare for Hurricane Dorian, though it was not originally intended for this purpose.[60] C2IMERA was also used for the August 2021 evacuation of civilians from Afghanistan in Operation Allies Refuge.[61][62] It was ordered deployed across all Air Combat Command installations in September 2021.[59][63] In August 2023, Air Mobility Command joined Air Combat Command in designating C2IMERA as their standard installation command and control tool.[64]\n\nSlapshot, the air mission flow organizer part of KRADOS, was also used for the Operation Allies Refuge Afghan evacuation along with C2IMERA.[65][66] At that time, KRADOS had known issues with scaling; it couldn't handle many simultaneous operations, which was exactly what it was being asked to do. On August 24, 2021, at 2 am Boston time, the Slapshot server crashed. Over the next 12 hours, Kessel Run developers restarted servers, shifted United States Central Command resources to improve performance, fixed database errors, and added new features to improve load times, so the evacuation on the other side of the world could continue.[67]\n\nBowcaster, named after a Star Wars weapon, is a chaos engineering tool and playbook that intentionally creates failures in processes to strengthen them.[68][69]\nKessel Run developed it, and shares it with other government agencies, initially with the Navy Black Pearl software factory in 2021.[70][71] In March 2022 Kessel Run and the General Services Administration's Technology Transformation Services used it to check that the Cloud.gov website could handle 100 million users per hour.[72][73]",

    "fullText": "President Trump is set to scale back international travel to focus on upcoming midterm elections after an Air Force One malfunction curtailed his sleep as he jetted into Davos.\n\nThe decision was relayed to reporters aboard the aircraft heading to Zurich on Wednesday, and news of it came after an electrical issue on board forced the plane to circle back to Washington, D.C. This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "Nicknamed the \"flying Oval Office,\" Air Force One has long functioned as the president's flying command center, office, and private quarters.\n\nSince the mid-20th century, US presidents have flown on special planes designated \"Air Force One\" while carrying out their official duties.\n\nThe modern Air Force One is equipped with everything the president might need, including office spaces, two kitchens, a stateroom with sleeping quarters, and a fully functional operating room.\n\nA new Air Force One jet, a Boeing 747-8 donated by the Qatari royal family and accepted by President Donald Trump in May, could bring a new level of luxury to the presidential plane.\n\nHere's how the design of Air Force One has changed through the years.\n\nNicknamed \"Sacred Cow,\" the aircraft operated from 1944 to 1961, flying Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman.\n\nIt featured an elevator shaft for Roosevelt's wheelchair, an executive conference room with a bulletproof window, and an electric refrigerator, which was a rare luxury for planes built in the 1940s.\n\nEisenhower's Boeing 707 Stratoliner, nicknamed \"Queenie,\" featured a section for telecommunications, room for 40 passengers, a conference area, and a stateroom.\n\nSAM 26000, a customized and modified version of a civilian 707-320B airliner, was known as a Boeing VC-137C. It included a living room, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.\n\nThe plane's design featured an American flag on the tail and presidential seals on the nose.\n\nIt marked the first and only time a presidential swearing-in ceremony took place on an airplane.\n\nThe small alcove was decorated with a globe decal on the wall and curtains lining the windows.\n\nNixon stood behind the plane's bar while meeting with military and civilian leaders en route to Vietnam.\n\nPresidents would occasionally make their way back to the rear cabin to chat with reporters.\n\nFord is pictured with Candice Bergen, the first female photographer to shoot a behind-the-scenes story on an American president.\n\nCarter talked to reporters on his way back from a trip to Europe in 1978.\n\nIn 1983, Reagan met with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the national-security advisor designate Robert McFarlane in a meeting space that featured a magazine rack, teal chair, wood-grain table, and photos of him and the first lady, Nancy Reagan.\n\nThe photos showed Reagan toasting with a champagne glass and waving while boarding Air Force One.\n\nThe meeting room also included a television set.\n\nThe presidential office was updated with a stately desk, gray carpeting, and leather chairs.\n\nThe staff area featured plenty of phones for official business. Air Force One is also known as the \"flying Oval Office.\"\n\nThe annex is pictured in executive configuration, with seating for meetings.\n\nClinton met with a delegation from North and South Dakota in 1997 to address flooding in the area.\n\nClinton met with members of Congress to discuss nuclear-waste management in 1999.\n\nThe plane flew 444 missions and logged over 1 million miles, according to the Bush White House.\n\nBush insisted on returning to Washington, but the Secret Service refused since they were unsure if more attacks were coming.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Politico, Bush's assistant White House press secretary Gordon Johndroe described Air Force One that day as \"the safest and most dangerous place in the world at the exact same time.\"\n\nThe president's suite included a small bed, a couch and carpeting in light pink, and a desk with a brown leather chair.\n\nThe hallway was lined with a beige couch with side tables and lamps on either side.\n\nObama met with his chief of staff, Jack Lew, his senior advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe, and former President Bill Clinton in the senior staff room in 2012.\n\nThe carpeting was updated to a subtle star pattern, which also appeared in the conference room.\n\nThe chairs featured a subtle polka-dot pattern, and the tables folded down to make more space.\n\nJournalists can wander the rear cabin freely, but they aren't allowed to walk forward to speak to the president — the president has to come back to them.\n\nAs part of the Air Force's Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program to update Air Force One planes, Trump proposed a red, white, and navy-blue color scheme for the new models.\n\nInstead, President Joe Biden selected a baby-blue color scheme similar to the current model.\n\nThe new VC-25B Air Force One planes are expected to be ready by 2027, according to the Air Force. The long-delayed project has already cost Boeing over $2 billion due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nTrump signed a proclamation establishing the name change in his Air Force One office in February.\n\nThe luxurious plane previously functioned as a Qatari private business jet. It features a large primary bedroom with loveseats and an en-suite bathroom, guest bedrooms, office space, a dining room, and a salon lounge with plush couches.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a May briefing that the Qatari royal family donated the jumbo jet to the US Air Force and that it was being \"retrofitted to the highest standards\" to serve as Air Force One. Some estimates have put the cost of upgrading the jet for the office of the president at $1 billion, but the US Air Force secretary said in June it will cost less than $400 million to retrofit.\n\nTrump, who has pressured Boeing to deliver its new Air Force One planes sooner and criticized the project's \"failure\" to complete them on time, said he'd be \"stupid\" to turn down the Qatari plane, worth an estimated $400 million. In July, he said the plane could be ready as soon as February 2026.\n\nAfter departing to Davos for the World Economic Forum on Tuesday night, Air Force One returned to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland shortly after takeoff.\n\nLeavitt told reporters that the crew identified \"a minor electrical issue\" after takeoff and returned to the airport out of an abundance of caution.\n\nTrump then boarded a C-32, a militarized Boeing 757 jet often used for flights into smaller airports.\n\nLeavitt also joked about the Qatari Air Force One jet sounding \"much better.\"",

His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

Security guards cleared Congress Hall after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrapped up around noon.\n\nWhile waiting to go back in to hear Trump, attendees, including financier Anthony Scaramucci and University of California chief investment officer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, could be seen sipping coffee and eating saffron risotto Milanese.\n\nA French journalist approached me to ask whether Trump's threats were real. I told her I didn't know.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\n\"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,\" he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nHuang said the US was seeing a \"significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases. \"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" added Huang.\n\n\"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.\"\n\nAir Force Two touched down in Zurich at 12:35 p.m. local time after an eventful journey.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's original airplane departed about 10 hours ago, but it turned around due to a \"minor electrical issue.\" He has instead flown to Switzerland on a Boeing C-32A, which is typically used for the Vice President's Air Force Two.\n\nAir Force Two touched down in Zurich at 12:35 p.m. local time after an eventful journey.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's original airplane departed about 10 hours ago, but it turned around due to a \"minor electrical issue.\" He has instead flown to Switzerland on a Boeing C-32A, which is typically used for the Vice President's Air Force Two.\n\nHis journey has taken over three hours longer than first expected. Now, there's another 75 miles to reach Davos, most likely by helicopter.\n\nCongress Hall is now being cleared ahead of President Donald Trump's speech.\n\nOne security guard told me the speech would be on time despite the electrical problems on AF1, but we still haven't heard official word from WEF.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns. His methods are causing great tension among his allies, but they agree that the Arctic is an area of risk.\n\n\"I think President Trump is right. Other leaders in NATO are right. We need to defend the Arctic,\" as China and Russia increase their presence there, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a Wednesday morning appearance at Davos.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns.

He expects tensions with the US to de-escalate, \"I think at the end of the day, we'll find an off-ramp on this.\"\n\nAfter an electrical issue on Air Force One delayed the president overnight, a replacement plane, a Boeing C-32A, was scrambled into action to bring him to Europe.\n\nAs of around midday Swiss time, the jet, a modified Boeing 757 often used as Air Force Two, was still in the air, flying close to Paris and heading for Zurich airport, where it looks likely to land within the next hour.\n\nIf, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos.\n\nThat could put him in the Swiss Alps just before 1.30 p.m. CET, and he is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. CET.\n\nHowever, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd. It seems highly likely, however, that his desire to make Greenland part of the USA, the diplomatic furore it has ignited, and new tariffs on Western allies, will be front and center.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd.

As Business Insider's Jennifer Sor noted yesterday, stocks tumbled in one of the worst days for the US market since April 2025. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped more than 2%, while the Dow wasn't far behind, losing 1.8%.\n\nThings are looking much calmer so far on Wednesday, with investors seemingly in a classic holding pattern ahead of the president's speech later.

The first: Can the West grow economies fast enough to overcome deficits?\n\n\"That can be one big issue, especially with the rising deficits of the US,\" Fink said.\n\nSecondly, another limiting factor is whether Western economies can make a J-curve of demand happen for AI and other technologies.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" Fink said. \"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail.\"\n\nTax us — that's the message from nearly 400 wealthy people, who've signed an open letter addressed to the leaders gathering at Davos.\n\nThe letter's co-signees called out a \"handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth,\" accusing them of harming society as a whole across governance, tech, innovation, and the environment.\n\nThe solution, per the letter, comes down to one thing — taxing the superrich.\n\nSignatories include the actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno.\n\n\"I believe President Trump is going to be about 3 hours late,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a morning presser. \"I haven't seen the updated schedule.\"\n\nICYMI: Trump had to switch planes after an electrical fault was detected on board Air Force One.\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nRising geopolitical tensions and the siloing of regions can make the environment even trickier. Especially for a company with over $90 billion of assets across 30 countries. Still, Steinbach told me that Hines raised about 50% more discretionary capital year over year in 2025.\n\n\"There's a risk and opportunity, right? The risk is it's now different. And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. You got very directive investments in-country.\"\n\n\"That's creating a lot of demand as well,\" Steinbach added.\n\nOn the schedule for Wednesday: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nTrump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday. He was forced to switch from Air Force One to a backup plane after an electrical fault was detected on board. Flight maps show Air Force One making a U-turn over the waters off Long Island, then landing back in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe president is now back on the road and on his way to Switzerland.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's headed to Davos, but his flight met a hiccup late Tuesday.\n\nAir Force One had to turn around and head back to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Tuesday night after it encountered a \"minor electrical issue,\" per a White House pool report.\n\nFlight tracking data showed the plane turning around over the waters off Long Island, New York, and heading back toward Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump will be switching to a backup plane, per the White House pool report, citing White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"After takeoff, the crew on AF1 identified 'a minor electrical issue' and, out of an abundance of caution, we are turning around, landing at Joint Base Andrews and boarding new aircraft,\" the press pool update said, citing Leavitt.\n\nThe update added that this would delay Trump's arrival in Zurich, where he is scheduled to join business and national leaders at the World Economic Forum's annual Davos conference.\n\nThe current aircraft primarily being used as Air Force One is a Boeing VC-25, a special military version of the Boeing 747 airliner. The plane is set to be replaced in 2028 by two newer, modified 747-8s estimated to cost over $5 billion in total.\n\nAmid frustrations over delays to the new aircraft, Trump has courted the idea of using another 747-8, gifted to him by the Qatari government, as Air Force One instead.\n\nThe president has said that he plans to keep the $400 million luxury aircraft, which the Defense Department accepted as a gift in May 2025.\n\nThe press pool report sent on Tuesday evening said that Leavitt had joked to reporters that the Qatari jet sounded \"much better\" after the recent technical issue. The report added that the lights in the press cabin went out briefly after takeoff, but that the reason was unclear.\n\nTrump's threats to take over Greenland have been a huge talking point at Davos. He has repeatedly said he wants to buy the semi-autonomous territory, which is governed by Denmark, and is not opposed to using military force to take it.\n\nBefore taking off on Tuesday, the president said in a press briefing that he has a \"lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland\" at Davos.\n\n\"I think things are going to work out pretty well,\" he said to reporters.\n\nHe also said on Saturday that he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, if the European countries do not strike a deal with the US to hand over Greenland.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — From toppling Venezuela's leader to ordering mass deportations, from turning once independent government entities into rubber stamps to demolishing the East Wing for a White House ballroom, President Donald Trump spent his first year back in office trampling political norms and testing institutional checks and balances.\n\nSome of his ideas that once seemed implausible, if not outright fanciful, are now reality. But there are other things that Trump could not deliver on.\n\n“I’ve kept all my promises and much more,” Trump insisted during a speech this week in Detroit.\n\nWith his administration nearing the one-year mark, here's a look at where some of his most jaw-dropping promises stand:\n\nIn progress: A new Qatari Air Force One\n\nU.S. defense officials in May accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar for Trump to eventually use as Air Force One, brushing aside ethical and legal questions and even anti-bribery constitutional provisions. The aircraft is being retrofitted in Texas to meet U.S. security and communications standards that are likely to cost about $400 million, the Air Force says. Outside experts estimate costs could approach $1 billion. Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

One of them said Indonesia was also interested in Pakistan's Shahpar drones.\n\nThe sources did not share any discussions about delivery timelines and the number of years a proposed deal would span.\n\nBoth Indonesia's Defence Ministry and ⁠Pakistan's military confirmed the meeting between Indonesian Defence ‌Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and Pakistan's Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu.\n\n\"The meeting focused on discussing general defence cooperation relations, including strategic dialogue, strengthening communication between defence institutions, and opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields in ‍the long term,\" defence ministry spokesperson Brigadier General Rico Ricardo Sirait told Reuters, adding the talks had not yet led to concrete decisions.\n\nThe Pakistani military confirmed the meeting in a statement and also said the defence minister met army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for talks that \"focused on matters of mutual interest, evolving ​regional and global security dynamics, and exploration of avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation\".\n\nINDONESIA REPLACING AGEING AIR FORCE FLEET\n\nOne additional security source with ‌knowledge of military procurement talks said Pakistan was discussing the sale of JF-17 Thunder jets, air defence systems, training for junior, mid-level, and senior Indonesian air force officials, and engineering staff.\n\n\"The Indonesia deal is in the pipeline,\" retired Air Marshal Asim Suleiman, who remains briefed on air force deals, told Reuters, adding that the number of JF-17 jets involved was close to 40.\n\nIndonesia's President Prabowo Subianto was in Pakistan last month for a two-day visit for talks on improving bilateral ties, including defence.\n\nIndonesia has put in a slew of orders for jets in the past few years, ⁠including 42 French Rafale jets worth $8.1 billion in 2022 and 48 KAAN fighter ​jets from Turkey last year to strengthen its air force and replace its ageing ​air force fleet.\n\nJakarta has also considered buying China's J-10 fighter jets and is in talks to purchase U.S.-made F-15EX jets.\n\nPAKISTAN'S RISING DEFENCE INDUSTRY\n\nInterest in the Pakistani military's weapons development programme has surged since its jets were deployed in a ‍short conflict with India last year.\n\nThe JF-17s ⁠have been at the centre of that growing attention, figuring in a deal with Azerbaijan and the $4 billion weapons pact with the Libyan National Army.\n\nPakistan is also eyeing a defence pact with Bangladesh that could include the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, ⁠as ties improve with Dhaka.",

    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pakistan is in the final phases of striking a $1.5-billion deal to supply weapons and jets to Sudan, a former top air force official and three sources said, promising a major boost for Sudan's army, battling the paramilitary Rapid ​Support Forces.\n\nTheir conflict has stoked the world's worst humanitarian crisis for more than 2-1/2 years, drawing in myriad foreign interests, and threatening to fragment the ‌strategic Red Sea country, a major gold producer.\n\nThe deal with Pakistan encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for scouting and kamikaze attacks, and advanced air defence systems, said two of ‌the three sources with knowledge of the matter, who all sought anonymity.\n\nIt was a \"done deal\", said Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters.\n\nBesides the Karakoram-8 jets, it includes Super Mushshak training aircraft, and perhaps some coveted JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China and produced in Pakistan, he added, without giving figures or a delivery schedule.\n\nPakistan's military and its defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA spokesman for Sudan’s army did not immediately respond to a ⁠message requesting comment.\n\nAssistance from Pakistan, especially drones and jets, could ‌help Sudan's army regain the air supremacy it had towards the start of its war with the RSF, which has increasingly used drones to gain territory, eroding the army's position.\n\nSudan's army accuses the RSF of being supplied by the United Arab Emirates, which ‍has denied supplying weapons.\n\nThe sources did not say how the deal was being funded but Masood said it was possible the finances would come from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia may favour and support all the favourable regimes in Gulf for procurement of Pakistani military equipment and training,\" he said.\n\nOne of the sources said the Saudis brokered the deal but added there ​was no indication they were paying for the weapons. Another source said Saudi was not providing funds.\n\nMasood said the weapons for Sudan could be included in such an agreement, without confirming discussions with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEgypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of the U.S.-led quad grouping of nations that has tried to push Sudan's army and the RSF towards peace talks.\n\nOn recent visits, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan requested Saudi assistance in the war, according to Sudanese and Egyptian sources.\n\nRiyadh and Abu Dhabi are embroiled in a major feud sparked by recent events in Yemen.\n\nThe two most powerful countries in the Gulf ⁠have sharp differences on a range of volatile Middle East issues, from geopolitics to oil ​output.\n\nTheir difference burst into the open with an advance of UAE-backed southern Yemeni separatists in early December ​that brought them into conflict with Saudi-backed forces.\n\nThe deal is another feather in the cap for Pakistan's growing defence sector, which has drawn growing interest and investment, particularly since its jets were deployed in a conflict with India last year.\n\nLast month, Islamabad struck ‍a weapons deal worth more than $4 billion ⁠with the Libyan National Army, officials said, for one of the South Asian nation's largest arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.\n\nPakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on a defence deal that could includes the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, as ties improve ties with Dhaka.\n\nThe ⁠government sees Pakistan's burgeoning industry as a catalyst to secure long-term economic stability.\n\nPakistan is now in a $7-billion IMF programme, following a short-term deal to avert a sovereign default in 2023. It won IMF ‌support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has dunked on one of his key allies for not groveling hard enough to praise him in the aftermath of his shock invasion of Venezuela over the weekend.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham seemed eager to please when he told the president aboard Air Force One on Sunday night that “when you first got elected in January, we made the biggest comeback ever.”\n\nBut the 79-year-old MAGA leader was apparently not impressed.\n\n“You think so, really? I didn‘t feel it was a comeback, actually,” Trump shot back, apparently offended by Graham forgetting that the 2020 election, by his account, was “rigged.”\n\nThe South Carolina Republican was quick to move the conversation on.\n\n“The bottom line is, we have a drug caliphate in our backyard,” Graham said.\n\nThe exchange took place as the president traveled back to the White House from his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, where he’s understood to have watched a livestream of Saturday night’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGraham had already sung Trump’s praises over that seizure, decried by critics as an illegal assault on the rules-based international order, during a Fox News appearance late Sunday.\n\n“The military operation in Venezuela showed America at her best, all thanks to our incredible men and women in uniform,” the senator wrote in an X post, sharing a clip from that interview. “Maduro miscalculated our Commander in Chief, and President [Donald Trump] made clear he will not be trifled with.”",

    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "fullText": "Rosen, who led Sega from the 1960s into the 90s and who died on Christmas Day, was a hugely important figure in the history of arcade and home gaming\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "description": "Camp Hero, a former military base, has been plagued by conspiracy theories about the so-called \"Montauk Project,\" which inspired \"Stranger Things.\"",
    "fullText": "As a huge \"Stranger Things\" fan, I'm officially mourning the end of my beloved show.\n\nIf you're like me and need a \"Stranger Things\" fix to help ease the pain, you can pay a visit to the real abandoned base that inspired one of Netflix's biggest franchises.\n\nWhile the interdimensional problems that have befallen our friends in Hawkins, Indiana, are completely fictional, the series is based on a real-life New York town called Montauk and its government Air Force station, which has been at the center of multiple conspiracy theories for decades — Montauk even got a name-check in the series finale.\n\nUnsubstantiated claims include that researchers at the base had repressed the memories of employees who'd been subjected to experiments throughout the '70s and '80s.\n\nToday, it's possible to visit the station, now called Camp Hero, and after checking it out in 2023, I can confidently say it's still one of the creepiest places I've ever visited.\n\nI came away understanding where the Duffer brothers, who created \"Stranger Things,\" got their inspiration for the creepy Hawkins Lab and the psychedelic experiments that go on inside.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" began as the story of a group of pre-teens who, after one of their best friends goes missing, become tangled in a dangerous web of government conspiracies, alternate dimensions, the Cold War, and more.\n\nSince its debut in 2016, the show has become a phenomenon, spawning millions of dollars in merch, tie-in novels and comics, a stage adaptation, mobile games, a tabletop game, at least one animated spinoff, and more.\n\nOne of the show's breakout characters is Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown), a young girl born with telekinesis. Immediately after her birth, she was abducted by a scientist whom she calls Papa (Matthew Modine) and taken to Hawkins Lab, where she and other children were experimented on.\n\nThe show wrapped up its fifth and final season on December 31.\n\nIn 2016, Matt and Ross Duffer confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that \"Stranger Things\" was originally sold as \"Montauk\" before they decided to switch the name and the location to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\n\"We liked Montauk, because we liked the coastal setting,\" Matt Duffer said, adding that Montauk was also the basis for Amity Island, the fictional location of \"Jaws,\" one of their favorite movies.\n\nHowever, the setting changed when they realized \"it was really going to be impossible to shoot in or around Long Island in the wintertime,\" Matt Duffer said.\n\nFilmmaker Charlie Kessler, sued the brothers in 2018, claiming they stole the idea of \"Stranger Things\" from his script \"The Montauk Project,\" Thrillist reported. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the Duffers denied his claims, and Kessler dropped the lawsuit in 2019.\n\nSpoiler for the series finale: Montauk even got referenced by name in the last episode, when Hopper mentioned that a friend mentioned that the town was looking for a new sheriff.\n\nAccording to signs in the park outlining Camp Hero's history, the US Army commissioned Camp Hero in May 1942 — five months after the US joined World War II in December 1941 — to defend against German submarines and boats.\n\nThe Army deactivated the base in 1947 and turned it over to the US Air Force in 1951, which remained there until 1982.\n\nCamp Hero, named for Major General Andrew Hero Jr., who served as the chief of coast artillery from 1926 to 1930, according to Arlington National Cemetery, opened to the public in 2002.\n\nMontauk is commonly known as The End. It's the last town on Long Island, making it the perfect spot for an Army base scanning the oceans for submarines hiding in the depths below.\n\nAs a huge fan of \"Stranger Things\" with a mild interest in secret governmental conspiracy theories, I figured I'd drive out east and laugh with my mom (who made the trek with me) about the wildest things we'd learn about Camp Hero.\n\nInstead, I came away feeling like \"Stranger Things\" got the atmosphere of this place exactly right.\n\nI'm from a town on Long Island 99 miles west of Montauk, so it took me around two hours to drive there.\n\nWhen there's no traffic, it can be a fun drive. You pass through picturesque towns worth a stop, like Amagansett, East Hampton, Southampton, Wainscott, and more.\n\nCurbed reported that celebrities including Julianne Moore, Ralph Lauren, and Robert De Niro have owned real estate in the town.\n\nI grew up on Long Island and have been to Montauk dozens of times, but I'd never explored Camp Hero before.\n\nMontauk Lighthouse, according to the Montauk Historical Society, was the first lighthouse to be built in New York after George Washington commissioned it in 1792. Today, it's a Long Island landmark that is part of the adjacent Montauk Point State Park.\n\nIt's also the fourth-oldest working lighthouse in the US and just one of 12 lighthouses to be named a National Historic Landmark.\n\nOr, if you're a New York resident with an Empire Pass like I am, it's free.\n\nAccording to New York State's Parks Department, the Empire Pass \"permits unlimited vehicle access to most facilities operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\"\n\nEssentially, it gets you into most New York state parks for free. A card costs $80 per year (or $72 a year for a digital card), or you can purchase a lifetime pass for $750 (or $742 for a digital card). Three-season and five-season passes are also available, as shown on the parks' website.\n\nAs my family members are big fans of Jones Beach, another state park, we've had an Empire Pass for as long as I can remember.\n\nI was surprised to learn that a decent chunk of land is off-limits to visitors and is a wildlife and plant sanctuary.\n\nThere are a few parks in the Montauk area that offer a good view of the bluffs, including Shadmoor State Park, Montauk Point State Park, and Ditch Plains Beach.\n\nThis wouldn't be the last warning sign I'd see that day.\n\nErosion is also a huge problem on Long Island's beaches. The Patch reported that the town of East Hampton, which includes Montauk, was given a $350,000 federal grant to address the erosion issues along the coastline in December 2022.\n\nOfficials told The Patch that, according to measurements by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Montauk's shoreline \"eroded more than 44 feet inland between 2000 and 2012.\"\n\nIn the years since, the erosion has only continued, so I heeded the sign's warnings and stayed as far back as possible.\n\nThe radar tower looms over Camp Hero. I knew I needed to make my way over there to get a good look.\n\nMore about those conspiracy theories later.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the Army built batteries throughout the base. Batteries 112 and 113, which are both still standing, contained two 16-inch guns each. The artillery was removed in 1947.\n\nEven from a distance, you can see just how big it is.\n\nBeing up close was somehow even more unsettling.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the \"giant\" radar, specifically an AN/FPS-35, was built in 1960, and it remained operational until 1980.\n\nIts radar dish was built to detect an attack on the US. As The New York Times reported in 2006, it was once \"able to detect airborne objects more than 200 miles from shore.\"\n\nAt the peak of the Cold War, multiple towers were located throughout the eastern US, but now, the Montauk tower is the only one left.\n\nThe radar tower is central to many of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero.\n\nFilmmaker Christopher Garetano, who directed a docudrama about Camp Hero called \"Montauk Chronicles\" in 2014, spoke about the radar dish during a History Channel documentary called \"The Dark Files.\"\n\n\"Every 12 seconds the radar tower would rotate and there would be animals freaking out and people getting headaches and bad dreams,\" says Garetano in \"The Dark Files,\" claiming \"people's electronic equipment would go haywire\" when the dish rotated.\n\n\"I don't want to add fuel to the fire because I don't believe all the zombie stuff,\" one resident of 40 years told The New York Post in 2020. \"But the impact that tower had on the town was real. I don't know if it affected our thoughts like some people say, but it was a force.\"\n\nTicks are frequent carriers of Lyme disease. That was more than enough to keep me away from any heavily wooded areas.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2006 that visitors to Camp Hero were given pamphlets about what to do in case they spotted an undetonated grenade or other unexploded ammunition — it did use to be an active military base, after all.\n\nAt first, I scoffed, but as the day went on, I started to see what she meant.\n\nIt was spookily silent as we walked through the woods, even though we weren't too far from the beach or a busy highway. I felt like we were in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAs you can see, it looks like we were just about to walk into a heavily wooded forest.\n\nIn the first episode of \"Stranger Things,\" Mike, Lucas, and Dustin search the woods for their friend Will after he goes missing while biking home. The trio are searching on a rainy night when they suddenly come across Eleven, who had just escaped Hawkins Lab.\n\nAt the end of season one, Eleven returns to the woods to escape the lab's clutches.\n\nThis rock was helpfully in the perfect place for me to pose for a photo.\n\nFishing is one of Camp Hero's biggest draws, and I saw a few fishermen on the beach casting their lines.\n\nHe was just a friendly pet running back to his owner, but safe to say, we were both on edge.\n\nI didn't even have the presence of mind to take a picture of this dog — that's how you know my mom and I were truly freaked out.\n\nThis building used to be a gymnasium.\n\nThe sign in front explained more about downtown Camp Hero. When the base was built in 1947, 600 men and 37 officers lived in this area, and the structures were disguised as a \"seaside fishing village,\" with artificial wood siding and fake windows.\n\nThe gym was designed to look like a church. It's the only structure left from the original \"downtown\" Camp Hero, though other newer buildings are still standing.\n\nI was half-convinced that someone was just going to pop out of the windows if I got too close.\n\nWe didn't want to scare the deer away, so we kept our distance while exploring the buildings.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive summary of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero written by Thrillist in 2016, the events that conspiracy theorists claim happened in Camp Hero were actually pretty similar to what happens in \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nAuthor Preston Nichols brought the theories into the mainstream when he published 1992's \"The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time,\" which detailed his reported experiences working at Montauk Air Force Station — he claimed he'd recovered repressed memories of his time at the base in the '70s and '80s.\n\nNichols said he worked with another former employee on something called the \"Montauk Chair,\" which used electromagnets to strengthen psychic powers. In season four of \"Stranger Things,\" Eleven uses something similar to recover her powers.\n\nNichols also said scientists at the base used abducted children (like Eleven and her \"siblings\") to perform experiments on, and that some were even sent to an unknown dimension (like the Upside Down).\n\nEventually, these experiments were shut down when one of the children summoned an interdimensional monster, Nichols wrote — just like Eleven bringing the Demogorgon to our world.\n\nJoe Loffreno told the Post in 2020 that he believes he's one of the children who were abducted and experimented on and who were mentioned in \"The Montauk Project.\"\n\n\"I didn't believe it until two years ago,\" Loffreno said. \"I was hypnotized [by a certified hypnotist] for about 40 minutes and all these memories flooded back. They did a very bad thing to us out there. We were just little kids. They had no right to experiment on us. It was a very dark, very evil thing.\"\n\nGaretano, director of \"Montauk Chronicles,\" spoke with Newsday in 2017 about the reported tunnels. He said that when the History Channel was filming for \"The Dark Files,\" they found proof that the tunnels existed.\n\n\"Something extraordinary was found, which goes against all the official statements that there isn't anything there,\" Garetano said. \"We didn't get into them, but we have footage of them that was taken by someone else.\" He added that they saw something on the \"electric resistivity imagery tests\" that were conducted.\n\nAnother local, Paul Fagan, told the New York Post that he believes a nuclear reactor might've secretly been buried at the base in the '50s, and that any conspiracy theories are actually meant to distract from the reactor's existence.\n\nThe New York Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the claims.\n\nThe Army and the Air Force have never appeared to go on the record about the claims either, and they did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider either.\n\nWhen the Army built the base, it was used to surveil the surrounding area for German submarines, and it was also an antiaircraft artillery training station. At the time, according to the sign, all antiaircraft units in New York were sent to Camp Hero for a few weeks to train.\n\nThe sign also said it was home to other surveillance and height-finding radar that \"guarded the New York City area against a surprise attack by Soviet bombers or other missiles.\"\n\nThe base was also used \"extensively\" as a live-fire training range until it was shut down in the '80s.\n\nThere are no lights and very little signage — I could see myself getting hopelessly lost in the woods.\n\nDo I really believe that there were scientists using abducted children to contact a different dimension at Camp Hero?\n\nHowever, I understand the fascination with Camp Hero — the fact that the radar tower and other disguised buildings are still standing decades later, the secluded location, and the idea that there could be secret tunnels underground are all compelling fodder for urban legends.\n\nAnyone interested in military history or conspiracy theories would learn a lot at Camp Hero, and I'd recommend visiting — but only during the day, and not on your own.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in August 2023 and was most recently updated in January 2026.",

    "description": "The US president flies on Air Force One. World leaders in other countries also have their own official aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The Boeing VC-25 is arguably the most famous jetliner in the world, even though most people have never heard of it.\n\nMost do know it, though, by the call sign it's assigned when the president of the United States is on board: Air Force One.\n\nAir Force One is instantly recognizable, both as the president's airplane and as a flying symbol of American military and economic might. With its hand-polished blue, white, and silver livery, Air Force One boldly proclaims the arrival of the leader of the free world.\n\nThe US president is not the only one to have their own presidential jet. A number of prominent international leaders also use some form of executive transport.\n\nThe Boeing 747 jumbo jet is a popular option for many nations, including China, India, and South Korea. The Airbus A330 and A340 are also commonly found in presidential fleets.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the presidents, chancellors, and prime ministers of the world travel.\n\nThe Boeing VC-25A entered service as Air Force One in 1990. At 231 feet long, it can transport 30 crew members and 71 passengers.\n\nThere are two nearly identical Boeing jets that serve as the official transport of the president. Normally, the planes are referred to by their tail numbers: 28000 and 29000. When the commander-in-chief steps on board, they take on the call sign \"Air Force One.\"\n\nNew VC-25B Air Force One planes, based on the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, are now expected to be ready by 2028 after years of delays. Boeing has already lost over $2 billion on the project due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nThe presidential jets are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nThe smaller C-32, measuring 155 feet long, normally serves as the US vice president's plane. It is used by the president for travel to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure for the larger Air Force One jet.\n\nUntil 2015, the UK prime minister chartered commercial jets for state visits.\n\nThe modified Airbus A330 was converted for VIP duties in 2015, but can still serve as a refueling tanker when not on state business. It is outfitted with 58 business-class seats.\n\nIn 2020, its gray Royal Air Force livery was repainted with a new white color and the Union Jack on the tail, a refurbishment that cost £900,000, or around $1.1 million, the BBC reported.\n\nNicknamed \"The Flying Kremlin,\" the Ilyushin Il-96-300 measures over 181 feet long and can hold 262 passengers, The National Interest reported.\n\nThe Russian president has also been known to fly on a fleet of smaller executive aircraft based on the Tupolev Tu-214 airliner. Tupolev TU-214s were designed as the Russian equivalent of Boeing 757s and can hold around 210 passengers.\n\nGerman leaders previously used modified Airbus A340-300 airliners for official travel, but they were withdrawn from service and put up for sale in 2024 after experiencing maintenance issues with German officials on board.\n\nThe German fleet also features several Airbus A320-family-based executive jets.\n\nWhen carrying the president of France, the plane's call sign is COTAM 001.\n\nFrance's presidential fleet also includes several Airbus A310-300s and Airbus A340-200s.\n\nDesignated as B-2479, the plane can fly 14,320 kilometers, or around 8898 miles, without stopping to refuel.\n\nJapan's old Air Force One plane, a Boeing 747-400, was listed for sale on an aviation classifieds site for $28 million in 2019.\n\nThe plane uses the call sign \"Code One\" while carrying the South Korean president. Leased from Korean Air, it began serving as South Korea's presidential aircraft in 2021, AeroTime reported.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil switched from using a luxurious Airbus A319 corporate jet to the more utilitarian KC-30 after the presidential plane experienced a technical issue in 2024 while visiting Mexico, Reuters reported.\n\nBrazil's presidential fleet also features several domestically produced Embraer VIP transports.\n\nThe Canadian government bought the Airbus A-330-200, known as Airbus 02, from Kuwait Airways for $50 million in 2023, CBC reported.\n\nPoland received its first Boeing 737 BBJ2 jet in 2021 featuring the serial number 0111 and nicknamed \"Roman Dmowski\" after the Polish politician, Key.Aero reported.\n\nWhen carrying the prime minister, the plane is known as \"India One.\" It can fly for 13,500 kilometers, or around 8,388 miles, without refueling.\n\nThe fleet includes Airbus A330-200s, Airbus A340-500s, and a Boeing 747-8I private jet reportedly gifted to Turkey by the Qatari government, the BBC reported.\n\nThe plane is nicknamed \"Chammae-1,\" named after North Korea's national bird, AP reported.\n\nIn June, Iran's presidential plane flew to Jordan accompanied by two Airbus A321s, The War Zone reported.\n\nAustralia's KC-30A, a modified Airbus A330, features the gray Royal Australian Air Force livery with a kangaroo design.\n\nThe plane is known as \"Wing of Zion,\" with the registration \"4X-ISR.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published by Benjamin Zhang in April 2019.

    "fullText": "Air Force One is known as the \"flying Oval Office,\" but there's another lesser-known presidential plane that can operate as a \"flying war room\": the E-4B \"Nightwatch.\"\n\nNicknamed the \"doomsday plane\" for its ability to survive a nuclear blast, the E-4B is designed to protect the president and other senior officials and function as a military command center in worst-case scenarios. It also transports the secretary of defense on international trips.\n\nMany of the E-4B's features are classified, but the US Air Force has shared some glimpses into its capabilities. Take a look inside the top-secret aircraft.\n\nThe US Air Force's fleet of four E-4Bs comprises the National Airborne Operations Center at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nEach E-4B costs $223.2 million to build, according to the US Air Force.\n\nIn 2022, the Air Force introduced a $9.5 million E-4B simulator to train pilots, flight engineers, and other crew members to operate the aircraft, according to the US Strategic Command.\n\nThe E-4B can fly for 12 hours straight without refueling.\n\nThe E-4B possesses more communications capabilities than Air Force One, with about 67 satellite dishes and antennas in the radome.\n\nThe plane's exterior also features thermal and nuclear shielding, and its electrical system can withstand electromagnetic pulses.\n\nThe layout includes a command room, conference room, briefing room, operations team work area, communications room, and a rest area. The plane can seat up to 112 people.\n\nThe E-4B isn't just a \"doomsday plane.\" The defense secretary occasionally uses it to travel overseas and hold press briefings.\n\nIn the event of a nuclear attack or other apocalyptic scenario, the president, secretary of defense, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would use the plane as a secure command and control center similar to the Pentagon.\n\nThe secretary's private quarters are furnished with a bunk and a desk with chairs.\n\nAt least one E-4B has been on continuous alert since 1975, ready to deploy at a moment's notice.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has fueled new speculation about his health after an awkward descent on Air Force One’s stairs.\n\nA video of the 79-year-old president exiting the plane at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday morning, posted by MAGA influencer Paul Villarreal, has drawn attention online for Trump’s odd hand movement and slow, careful descent.\n\nIn the video, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs. He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO – During the week head coach Brian Dutcher likened San Diego State’s games with Air Force to ‘a trip to the dentist.’ After gritting their teeth through the first half, the Aztecs earned their lollipop with a 81-58 win over the Falcons on Wednesday night at Viejas Arena.\n\nBJ Davis scored 13 of his 19 points over a 4:10 stretch in the second half to go with a game-high 6 assists, while Miles Heide had 12 points and eight rebounds to go with Taj DeGourville having his best scoring game since the season opener with 9 points on three 3’s.\n\nDefense keyed the second half swing after San Diego State (6-3, 1-0) led by 3 points at the half of their final Mountain West Conference opener. They dished a season-high 27 assists, making just four baskets without a helper, and forced 10 of Air Force’s (3-9, 0-1) 15 turnovers in the second half, getting 14 of their 19 points off turnovers in the final 20 minutes.\n\nThe second half began with a scrambling no-look save by Miles Byrd to Magoon Gwath in the post, who fed it up top for Heide to knock down his first 3-pointer of the season and the third from downtown of his career.\n\nSDSU and the Falcons traded scores until Heide picked up his third personal foul at the 15:13 mark, which brought Pharaoh Compton into the game and raised the temperature for the Aztec defense. After the Falcons turned it over just four times in the opening half, they turned it over five times in the first eight minutes of the second.\n\nHarrington got free for a straight-line drive for a layup and then Compton got fouled on a dunk for an and-1 that gave the Scarlet and Black their first double-digit lead at the 14:13 mark.\n\nDavis then had his ‘hibachi’ moment, knocking down a 3-pointer to start a stretch where he scored 13 of SDSU’s next 15 points. Over that span the Aztec lead grew to 61-44 and then even further when Gwath split a pair of free throws and DeGourville tripled.\n\nSDSU allowed the Falcons to score multiple buckets in a row just once in the second half, a 6-0 stretch just after the nine minute mark, but by then the game was well out of reach.\n\nA final run of 9-0 put a bow on things, with Davis knocking down the final of his four triples and Compton punctuating it with a dunk, as the forward had 11 points in 17 minutes off the bench.\n\nBrandon Pollard - The Sporting Tribune\n\nSan Diego State forward Miles Heide (40) fights for the ball during an NCAA Basketball game between Air Force and San Diego State, Wednesday December 17, 2025 at Viejas Arena in San Diego, Calif.\n\nIt had seemed too easy over the first few possessions for the Aztecs, beginning the game with an and-1 by Gwath and a cutting Heide layup in the first 42 seconds of the game.\n\nBut the Falcons 3-2 zone caused problems when SDSU was forced to work their half-court set, going scoreless over a 5:32 stretch where they missed eight in a row from the field. During that time the Falcons opportunistically converted on a pair of open 3-pointers in an 8-0 spurt that led to an early 3 point lead.\n\nIt grew as large as 4 points when Eli Robinson tripled again from the right wing at 12:49, but a steal and score by Davis led to a transition dunk that woke up the Scarlet and Black offense.\n\nJeremiah Oden splashed a long ball, then Reese Dixon-Waters found Heide left alone in the middle of the zone for an uncontested dunk, which kick-started SDSU’s sixth 10-plus point run of the season. Playing with a quicker tempo helped the Aztecs reel off six makes in a row, pushing the lead out to 23-15 with 8:28 remaining, then after a Falcons make, DeGourville nailed a straight-away 3-pointer to give SDSU their largest lead of the half.\n\nBut the Scarlet and Black struggled shooting down the stretch, making just three shots—all on layups or in the paint— while missing 11 of their final 14 shots from the field. It enabled the Falcons to creep back within 33-30 at the half.\n\nNine of the Aztecs that played in the opening 20 made a field goal, with Gwath and Heide’s 7 points apiece the most on the squad.\n\nAfter notching a win against a team ranked well into the 300’s in most major overall metrics, the Aztecs will face the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats next. Tip off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 20 at PHX Arena in Phoenix, Ariz.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday it was acquiring two Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for $400 million to ​establish a training and sustainment program for its future presidential airlift fleet.\n\nThe ‌purchase is part of the service's efforts to accelerate the presidential airlift program as it prepares to ‌transition to the newer and larger 747-8 model from the aging 747-200, the Air Force said in a statement.\n\nThe first aircraft is expected to arrive in early 2026, with the second delivery scheduled before year-end.\n\nThe Air Force said the acquisition was necessary because ⁠the 747-8i was no longer ‌in active production by Boeing and it differed significantly from the 747-200 aircraft currently used in the presidential fleet. The two ‍planes will be used for crew training and as a source of spare parts, officials said.\n\nSeveral published reports suggested the Air Force was buying the planes from Lufthansa, one of the ​few passenger airlines to have bought the 747-8 model, which was more popular ‌with cargo carriers before Boeing ended production in early 2023. A spokesperson for the German airline declined to comment.\n\nThe purchase is separate from two 747-8i aircraft that Boeing is currently modifying under the VC-25B program, which will serve as the next generation of Air Force One. The first of those heavily modified aircraft is expected to ⁠be delivered in mid-2028, the Air Force said.\n\nAn ​Air Force official, speaking on background, said the ​two training aircraft were also distinct from a 747-8i aircraft gifted to the United States by Qatar.\n\nThe Air Force One program has faced ‍delays and cost overruns ⁠since Boeing agreed to a $3.9 billion fixed-price contract in 2018 to deliver two modified 747-8s to replace the current fleet.\n\nThe Air Force said on Friday ⁠the delivery of the first of the two new Air Force One jets from Boeing had ‌been delayed by another year to mid-2028.",

    "fullText": "A JetBlue pilot said he nearly had a midair collision with a US Air Force plane on Friday.\n\nFlight 1112 was flying from Curaçao to New York. The island country, which is part of the Netherlands, is about 40 miles off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after takeoff, the JetBlue pilot contacted Curaçao's air traffic control center.\n\n\"We just had traffic pass directly in front of us, within 5 miles, maybe 2 or 3 miles,\" he said in a recording published by LiveATC.net. He added that it was an Air Force air-to-air refueller.\n\nThe JetBlue Airbus A320 was also only about 600 feet below the military aircraft. The pilot said the latter was at 34,000 feet while the JetBlue plane was passing through 33,400 feet and ascending to 35,000 feet.\n\n\"So we had to stop our climb and actually just descend to avoid hitting them,\" the pilot said.\n\nWhile the distance between the two aircraft gave the plane enough time to maneuver, the pilot was evidently shocked.\n\n\"They don't have their transponder on,\" he said. \"It's outrageous.\"\n\n\"I don't have anything on my scope,\" the controller replied. \"You are totally right, sir.\"\n\nThe pilot then asked the controller to make a note of it, adding: \"We almost had a midair collision up here.\"\n\nTransponders are a vital piece of aircraft equipment, as they send signals to air traffic control centers and to other nearby planes.\n\nThe Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, relies on active nearby transponders to warn both aircraft and, if necessary, provide instructions for them to avoid each other.\n\nHowever, military aircraft may turn off their transponders to remain undetected during sensitive missions.\n\nThe US military has launched air strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea amid escalating tensions with Venezuela. It has also deployed thousands of troops and the USS Gerald R.

    "description": "Tanker maintenance workers spend their days crawling in and out of fuel tanks. New tech might make a hard job a little easier.",
    "fullText": "Inside some of the Air Force's oldest refueling aircraft, technicians are crawling through tight, dirty spaces, painstakingly cleaning sealant on fuel tanks and tightening loose rivets.\n\nThey climb into the dark, cramped tanks with little more than a flashlight, some tools, and shaky comms. It can be hard to breathe, the air smells like jet fuel, the fixes aren't always clear, and the punishing work can be dangerous if done wrong.\n\nIt's a job that hasn't changed much in over 50 years, but new gear, including a live-feed video headset and artificial intelligence-enabled technology, is finally bringing it into the 21st century.\n\nThe Integrated Respirator Information System, known as IRIS and developed by MetroStar and ActionStreamer, is speeding up the maintenance process, company officials and Air Force technicians say, and making it safer and more efficient.\n\nTankers are important logistics assets, what the Air Force calls \"silent enablers,\" that support missions by helping keep fighters and bombers airborne for longer than the onboard fuel tanks can sustain alone. For instance, Operation Midnight Hammer, which saw US stealth bombers strike Iran's nuclear site this year, involved dozens of refueling tankers supporting the strike package.\n\nAlthough fighter aircraft like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter or bombers like the B-2 Spirit get the most attention, tankers like the KC-135 Stratotanker are critical to US and allied airpower. For them to be useful, though, they have to be well-maintained.\n\nIRIS began as an idea from two maintainers who noticed the broader potential of ActionStreamer's live-streaming tech — gear originally built for athletes to capture first-person views during games. The Air Force technicians pursued the concept for years, even as they rotated through new assignments and bases.\n\nThe Air Force had long believed that tools like this could be a major boost for maintainers. There were early forays into video tech in the 2000s, but the \"technology wasn't quite there,\" Master Sgt. Troy French, a former 100th Maintenance Squadron member, told Business Insider. \"An initial phase of this was kind of set up and abandoned because cameras weren't small enough.\"\n\nNow, though, Air Force maintainers based at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, a central refueling base for the US missions in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, have been testing out IRIS.\n\n\"They were, to be honest with you, a little apprehensive to start with,\" ActionStreamer CEO Bob Lento said, noting it was the first significant change to how technicians have done their jobs in years. But by the end of the first week, attitudes had flipped. \"We were taking the cart out of the hangar into a safe area to do some software punch-ups, and they were like, 'Wait a minute, where are you going with that? We need to use that now.'\"\n\nOn a tanker aircraft like the KC-135, there's a hole just big enough for a person to fit through under the wing. It's the access point for the fuel tanks. \"You crawl up there and you contort your body to be able to lie down flat and then put your feet in,\" French said. Inside, it is a tight space with lots of bumps and edges.\n\nThe workers wear heavy protective suits to guard against fuel exposure and keep sweat out of the tanks. They carry a flashlight and breathe through respirators that feed fresh air in from a hose running outside the aircraft.\n\nOutside the aircraft, a support team stands by. One person runs tools to the person inside the tank while another monitors for any hazards or issues.\n\n\"If you need something, sometimes you just have to peel the respirator back, like, 'Hey, I need this extra wrench that I forgot,'\" French said.\n\nThe runner will grab it and bring it to the entry point, screaming into the tank or pulling on the respirator hose to get the technician's attention. \"If you're really deep in the tank, then you have to crawl back to get it from them, and you have to wait there for them to bring it, reducing the amount of time you're actually working.\"\n\nBefore a worker enters the aircraft, they'll know what issues they're looking for. A broken rivet, for instance, along with regular fuel tanker maintenance to keep the aircraft operating. But sometimes they adjust a different part in the wrong area of the refueling aircraft or leave a tool inside the tanker.\n\nThere's a lot of double-checking the work. Steps like removing sealant, cleaning, and putting adhesion in the tank require approval from other team members. It's inherently an hourslong job made even longer by wait times and communication lags.\n\nAnd that's if it all runs smoothly. Sometimes, technicians make mistakes, extending the time. \"A simple sealant job can turn from a couple of hours of scraping and then eventually reapplying to another day because it turned out that you applied it to the wrong spot,\" Tech Sgt. Chris Anderson, with the 100th Air Refueling Wing, said. \"The way that we did things left a lot of room for error.\"\n\nA logical fix, Frank said, was something wearable: \"a camera with two-way audio would be awesome, and if it had lights, that'd be a second bonus.\"\n\nThe IRIS technology sits on top of the face mask tanker maintenance workers wear. It features a high-definition video camera, a two-way comms system that goes inside the mask, and a hands-free light. IRIS shows everything the technician is looking at to those outside the fuel tank and allows them to communicate with their team.\n\nIt connects to a mobile workstation outside the aircraft. On the cart, which can host up to four IRIS units simultaneously, the support team can see what the technician sees, talk them through the work, and record the footage.\n\nVideo records help verify what each shift completed and resolve disputes quickly. For instance, Anderson said that the day shift had cleared a fuel puddle, but the next shift found one and questioned the work. IRIS showed that the first team had done the job, revealing, as French said, \" another problem, something's leaking.\" That prevented unnecessary rework and let them fix the issue.\n\nIn the past, a tricky aircraft issue could halt work while the right Air Force experts traveled in to assess it. Now, IRIS can send video to them instantly or launch a group call so everyone can see exactly what the technician sees.\n\nDevelopers also see AI playing a growing role in streamlining the job. As a technician uses IRIS, an AI agent compiles images and data to make requests, anticipate needed work, and handle forms. That frees technicians from what retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Cedric George called \"shallow work,\" so when their shift ends, \"all he or she has to do is button up, clean up, go home.\"\n\nIRIS is currently in use only at Mildenhall, but early results are promising, as the Air Force considers expanding it to other bases. Technicians using the system haven't had any safety incidents, and inspections are running 60% faster in test environments, according to pilot evaluations and internal logs. Based on KC-135 maintenance baselines, MetroStar estimates IRIS could save 35,000 maintainer hours and add more than 7,000 aircraft availability days.\n\nGeorge attributed the success of IRIS to the technicians who wanted to revamp the decades-old process to make it better for future workers. \"This is not for the faint of heart, it's dirty work,\" he said, saying current technicians who worked on IRIS believe future maintainers \"have to have something better than what we have now.\"",

The Air Force didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration last month issued a warning to U.S. aircraft urging them to “exercise caution” when in Venezuelan airspace, “due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.”\n\nAccording to the air traffic recording, the controller responded to the pilot, “It has been outrageous with the unidentified aircraft within our air.”",
