    "fullText": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin’s state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "description": "Patria, Finland's biggest defense contractor, is scaling up production as it deals with an order backlog of over 1,000 vehicles from NATO allies.",
    "fullText": "Alarms blare over the factory floors, and work at Patria's Hämeenlinna facility grinds to a halt.\n\nThe soft thrum of an explosion echoes through the campus. Moments later, roughly 700 workers continue making their armored vehicles bound for Japan, Sweden, Slovakia, and other countries. The blast is not a test-firing of its new combat vehicle, but part of the construction for its expanding manufacturing facility.\n\nPatria, Finland's largest defense company, is planning to nearly double production at its main hub just north of Helsinki, clearing rocks with explosives on-site to make way for several new assembly lines.\n\nThe Hämeenlinna factory manufactures Patria's 8×8 armored personnel carrier and a relatively new, up-and-coming vehicle: a wheeled 6×6 troop transport that's receiving surging demand from northern and western Europe.\n\nWork on the 25-foot-long, 17-ton vehicle began in 2020 under a joint program between Finland and Latvia called the Common Armored Vehicles System. Both countries sought a cost-effective, mass-produced armored vehicle that could be used by their militaries for interoperability.\n\nLatvia has since sent at least 42 of these vehicles to Ukraine, armed with heavy machine guns and rolled out in batches over the last year. The vehicle can cross tundra and even rivers while shielding up to 10 troops it carries from land mines and artillery fire to get them to forward positions.\n\nWhen Business Insider visited Patria's factory, representatives for the company — which is majority-owned by the state of Finland — said the firm wasn't authorized to share details about the 6×6's performance in Ukraine.\n\nBut the CAVS 6×6 program has been quickly drawing attention from the rest of Europe: What began as a partnership between two countries has expanded into a consortium of seven member states.\n\nSweden joined the Common Armored Vehicles System program in 2022, followed by Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway in subsequent years.\n\nFinland and Latvia have placed orders for just under 500 of these vehicles, while Sweden has requested 415 of the 6×6s to be delivered over the next five years. Stockholm's latest order for 94 vehicles, announced in early December, priced each one at about $1.75 million.\n\nGermany has become the program's largest buyer, signing contracts in mid-December to acquire 876 of the 6×6 vehicles, valued at $2.3 billion. These vehicles will be split into four variants, including one that features a mortar turret.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark, which joined the program this year, has already placed an order for 129 6×6 vehicles.\n\nThe UK and Norway are still negotiating 6×6 orders with Patria.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 can accommodate roughly 10 troops, along with a typical crew of two or three, and features up to NATO standard level 4 armor designed to withstand direct hits from large-caliber machine gun fire, mine explosions, and nearby artillery blasts.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 competes with other wheeled troop transports, such as Rheinmetall's Boxer and General Dynamics Land Systems' Stryker, the latter of which is extensively fielded by the US Army.\n\nThe Finnish company said it can tweak the vehicle for each customer's needs, but a typical model features climate control that enables the vehicle to operate in temperatures as low as -40°F.\n\n\"Inside, it will be comfortable enough to easily survive. We are talking about temperatures of the plus centigrades,\" Mikko Rantanen, Patria's director for 6×6 vehicle programs, told Business Insider from inside the rear compartment of one of the vehicles.\n\nThe 6×6's rear interior is spartan: Cloth-covered metal-frame seats and headrests for five people on either side, with space behind each seat for equipment and small arms.\n\nThere's just enough room for a soldier to sit with their knees touching the opposite passenger's. A few fire extinguishers inside are connected to an automatic suppression system that can detect a blaze in the rear cabin.\n\nScreens allow troops to see outside the vehicle through exterior cameras, while a rear hatch provides the option of fitting a machine gun or crewed weapon module on top of the 6×6.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the vehicle, a small passageway also lets troops pass between the rear compartment and the driver's cabin, which resembles that of a truck and features an automatic gearbox.\n\nOptional propellers on the 6×6's underside enable it to transition seamlessly from traversing land to crossing small bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes.\n\n\"We can enter the water without needing preparation in this configuration,\" said Rantanen.\n\nHowever, the 6×6's speed in the water is just under 5 mph, and Rantanen added that it's not meant to be a landing craft or amphibious assault vehicle.\n\nOn land, it's designed to drive at speeds of over 60 mph, easily cross trenches that are four feet wide, and surmount obstacles about two feet high.\n\nBuilding weapons and vehicles specifically for arctic terrain is a specialty for contractors in Finland, a country renowned for holding off the Soviet Union for over 100 days in deep snow and dense forest during World War II.\n\nPatria said that while the 6×6 can be outfitted for various terrain types, including the desert, the arctic domain is its forte.\n\nSnow isn't the only challenge in arctic warfare. Few roads are available on Finland's border with Russia — the priority threat for NATO — and its vast hinterland is peppered with thousands of small lakes and marshland that can bog down armored transport.\n\n\"In the wintertime, it's snow,\" said Petri Hepola, Patria's executive vice president for sales and marketing and its chief program officer for the F-35. \"In the summer, lots of wet soil and swampy areas. One of the most important features is how fast you can move your troops and tools through these areas.\"\n\nFinland and Norway are the only two members of Patria's 6×6 program that share Arctic borders with Russia.\n\nHowever, as northern Europe, especially the Baltic and Nordic states, grows increasingly concerned about conflict with Moscow, the Kremlin has been bolstering its military presence in the high north, repopulating key bases and transforming its Arctic fleet into a separate strategic theater.\n\nSince Finland joined NATO in 2023, alliance forces have been rushing to train on the country's terrain and frigid temperatures, making it one of the most active spots for joint exercises in recent years.\n\n\"Our products have been surviving very well in that environment,\" Hepola said.\n\nWith an order backlog of nearly 2,000 6×6 vehicles, Patria hopes its new facility in Hämeenlinna will be ready for production by 2027. The factory campus serves only the tail end of the entire manufacturing cycle, which can take weeks in most cases, or several months for more complicated variants.\n\nInside, hundreds of workers conduct welding, surface treatment, assembly, tests, and other final processes that can each take weeks to complete. Dozens of vehicles line the factory floors, and dozens more sit in parking lots, each marked with a flag to designate the country for which it has been modified.\n\nBefore delivery, each one is supposed to be driven at least 200 km, or 124 miles.\n\nRantanen, director of the 6×6 program, said Patria has been integrating counter-drone systems, such as jammers, on the vehicle.\n\nArmored vehicles in Ukraine have especially struggled against pervasive minefields and small drones with explosive payloads, some of which are controlled via a fiber optic cable connection that can't be jammed. In response, soldiers there have relied more on firearms such as shotguns and machine guns to counter such attacks.\n\nRantanen said Patria hasn't yet officially added any kinetic weapons that can take down drones.\n\n\"The drone threat is currently evolving at such a speed that it's hard to keep track of it closely,\" he said. \"But we are hard at work for the countermeasures against drones as well.\"",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening protests in Iran sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy are putting new pressure on its theocracy.\n\nTehran is still reeling from a 12-day war launched by Israel in June that saw the United States bomb nuclear sites in Iran. Economic pressure, intensified in September by the return of United Nations sanctions on the country over its atomic program, has put Iran's rial currency into a free fall, now trading at some 1.4 million to $1.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” — a coalition of countries and militant groups backed by Tehran — has been decimated in the years since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.\n\nA new threat by U.S. President Donald Trump warning Iran that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the U.S. “will come to their rescue\" has taken on new meaning after American troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran.\n\nHere's what to know about the protests and the challenges facing Iran's government.\n\nHow widespread the protests are\n\nDemonstrations have reached over 170 locations in 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported early Sunday. The death toll had reached at least 15 killed, it added, with more than 580 arrests. The group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.\n\nUnderstanding the scale of the protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in general in Iran also face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities.\n\nBut the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said “rioters must be put in their place.”\n\nThe collapse of the rial has led to a widening economic crisis in Iran. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. The nation has been struggling with an annual inflation rate of some 40%.\n\nIn December, Iran introduced a new pricing tier for its nationally subsidized gasoline, raising the price of some of the world’s cheapest gas and further pressuring the population. Tehran may seek steeper price increases in the future, as the government now will review prices every three months.\n\nThe protests began first with merchants in Tehran before spreading. While initially focused on economic issues, the demonstrations soon saw protesters chanting anti-government statements as well. Anger has been simmering over the years, particularly after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody that triggered nationwide demonstrations.\n\nIran's “Axis of Resistance,\" which grew in prominence in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, is reeling.\n\nIsrael has crushed Hamas in the devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, has seen its top leadership killed by Israel and has been struggling since. A lightning offensive in December 2024 overthrew Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, President Bashar Assad, after years of war there. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels also have been pounded by Israeli and U.S. airstrikes.\n\nChina meanwhile has remained a major buyer of Iranian crude oil, but hasn't provided overt military support. Neither has Russia, which has relied on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe West worries about Iran’s nuclear program\n\nIran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels prior to the U.S. attack in June, making it the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.\n\nTehran also increasingly cut back its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, as tensions increased over its nuclear program in recent years. The IAEA's director-general has warned Iran could build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”\n\nIran recently said it was no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. But there's been no significant talks in the months since the June war.\n\nWhy relations between Iran and the US are so tense\n\nIran decades ago was one of the United States’ top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.\n\nBut in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. Then came the Islamic Revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which created Iran’s theocratic government.\n\nLater that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the U.S. backed Saddam Hussein. During that conflict, the U.S. launched a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea as part of the so-called “Tanker War,” and later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the U.S. military said it mistook for a warplane.\n\nIran and the U.S. have seesawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, and relations peaked with the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Iran greatly limit its program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking tensions in the Mideast that intensified after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",

    "description": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”",
    "fullText": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”\n\nDays later, Trump administration officials privately told members of Congress much the same thing – that they lacked the legal justification to support attacks against any land targets in Venezuela.\n\nJust two months later, though, the Trump administration has done what it previously indicated it couldn’t.\n\nIt launched what Trump called a “large scale strike against Venezuela” and captured its president, Nicolás Maduro, to face charges. And it launched this regime change effort without the approval of Congress.\n\n(Trump in November claimed he didn’t need congressional authorization for land action, but it clearly wasn’t the consensus view in the administration.)\n\nIt appears the mission is, for now, limited to removing Maduro. But as Trump noted, it did involve striking inside the country – the same circumstance some in the administration previously indicated required authorization that it didn’t have. CNN reported back in early November that the administration was seeking a new legal opinion from the Justice Department for such strikes.\n\nAnd Trump in a news conference Saturday spoke repeatedly about not just arresting Maduro, but also running Venezuela and taking over its oil – comments that could certainly be understood to suggest this was about more than arresting Maduro.\n\nLegally dubious strikes inside another country – even ones narrowly tailored at removing a foreign leaders – are hardly unheard of in recent American history. But even in that context, this one is remarkable.\n\nThat’s because the Trump administration has taken remarkably little care to offer a consistent set of justifications or a legal framework for the attack. And it doesn’t even appear to have notified Congress ahead of time, which is generally the bare minimum in such circumstances.\n\nA full explanation of the claimed justification has yet to be issued, but the early signs are characteristically confusing.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said shortly after the strikes that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the attack was needed to, in Lee’s words, “protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant” against Maduro.\n\n“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” said Lee, a frequent critic of unauthorized foreign military action.\n\nHours later, Vice President JD Vance echoed that line.\n\n“And PSA for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism,” Vance said on X. “You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.”\n\nAt a later news conference, Rubio echoed the line that the military had been supporting “a law enforcement function.”\n\nBut there are many people living in other countries that are under indictment in the United States; it is not the US government’s usual course to launch strikes on foreign countries to bring them to justice.\n\nThe administration also hadn’t previously indicated that military force could be legally used for this reason.\n\nInitially, Trump threatened land strikes inside Venezuela to target drug traffickers – this despite Venezuela being an apparently somewhat small player in the drug-trafficking game.\n\nLater, the administration suggested strikes might be needed because Venezuela sent bad people into the United States.\n\nAnd then, after initially downplaying the role of oil in the US pressure campaign against Venezuela and Maduro, Trump said he aimed to reclaim “the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us.”\n\nThe signals were confusing enough that even the hawkish Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in mid-December indicated the administration lacked “clarity” in its messaging.\n\n“I want clarity right here,” Graham said. “President Trump is saying his days are numbered. That seems to me that he’s gotta go. If it’s the goal of taking him out because he’s a threat to our country, then say it. And what happens next? Don’t you think most people want to know that?”\n\nDespite the focus on the law enforcement operation on Saturday, Trump at the news conference said the United States would now participate in running Venezuela, at least temporarily. And he repeatedly spoke about its oil.\n\n“We’re going to rebuild the oil infrastructure,” Trump said, adding at another point: “We’re going to run the country right.”\n\nAnd even if the administration had offered a more consistent justification, that doesn’t mean it would be an appropriate one.\n\nThe most recent major example of using the US military for regime change is, of course, the war in Iraq. That war was authorized by Congress in 2002. The broader war on terror was authorized by Congress in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nSince then, administrations have sought to justify several military actions in the Middle East using those authorizations – sometimes dubiously. But Venezuela is in an entirely different theater.\n\nWhile many have compared the effort in Venezuela to Iraq, the better comparison – and one the administration apparently intends to make – is Panama in 1989.\n\nLike in Venezuela, Panama’s leader at the time, Manuel Noriega, was under US indictment, including for drug-trafficking. And like in Venezuela, the operation was less a large-scale war than a narrowly tailored effort to remove the leader from power.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1980 had concluded that the FBI didn’t have the authority to apprehend and abduct a foreign national to face justice. But George H.W. Bush administration’s OLC quietly reversed that in the summer of 1989.\n\nA memo written by William P. Barr, who would later become attorney general in that Bush administration and Trump’s first administration, said a president had “inherent constitutional authority” to order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries, even if it violated international law to do so.\n\nThat memo was soon used to justify the operation to remove Noriega. (As it happens, Noriega was captured the same day Maduro was: January 3,1990.)\n\nBut that memo remains controversial to this day. It’s also an extraordinarily broad grant of authority, potentially allowing US military force anywhere\n\nAnd the situation in Venezuela could differ in that it’s a larger country that could prove tougher to control with its leader in foreign custody. It also has significant oil wealth, meaning other countries could take an interest in what happens there next. (China has called the attack a “blatant use of force against a sovereign state.”)\n\nIn both the news conference and an interview with Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump invoked the possibility of further military option, reinforcing that this could be about more than just arresting Maduro.\n\nThat also means the questions about Trump’s legal authorities could again be tested – just as he’s already tested them with his legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats and other actions in the region.\n\nWhat’s clear is that Trump is seeking to yet again test the limits of his authority as president – and Americans’ tolerance for it. But this time he’s doing it on one of the biggest stages yet. And the story of his stretching of the law certainly isn’t over.",

    "fullText": "A short video. A few words. And suddenly, the internet is on fire.\n\nA Somali TikToker is facing intense backlash after commenting what many interpreted as a threat against Elon Musk. The remark spread fast, pulled Musk into the conversation, and triggered a wave of reactions that raised serious questions about online speech and real-world consequences.\n\nIn the now-viral clip, the TikToker appeared dismissive when Musk’s name came up. Her response stopped people cold.\n\n“I wouldn’t worry too much about him,” she said. “He about to die.”\n\nThe statement didn’t include context, jokes, or qualifiers. Viewers immediately flagged it as disturbing, especially given Musk’s global profile and the climate around public figures and security concerns. The clip moved across X, TikTok, and Reddit within hours.\n\nBOOM! Elon Musk FIRES BACK at the Somali woman threatening his life\n\nWhen fraud is exposed – it’s always the fraudsters who yell and complain the loudest.\n\nTheir THEFT will come to an end. pic.twitter.com/K0sfl3DFl1\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nElon Musk didn’t ignore it. Instead, he responded directly on X with a blunt message that escalated the situation instantly. “Then it is war.”\n\nThe response fueled speculation. Some saw it as sarcasm. Others read it as a warning. Either way, it ensured the exchange wouldn’t fade quietly.\n\nOnce Musk replied, the clip went from niche content to headline material.\n\nAs the clip circulated, comment sections exploded. Many users expressed shock at how casually the statement was delivered. Others went further, predicting severe consequences for the TikToker.\n\n“She’s about to spend some years behind bars,” one comment read. Another user wrote, “She about to be ‘mysteriously’ missing. I don’t think anyone will care.”\n\nThose comments sparked a second wave of criticism, with users arguing that the backlash itself was becoming dangerous.\n\nSeveral legal-minded users pointed out why the comment raised alarms. Saying that a healthy, relatively young person will die soon can be interpreted as more than opinion.\n\n“When you say that a person who is healthy and not old will die ‘naturally’ soon, this looks like a threat,” one widely shared post argued.\n\nIn many countries, language that implies harm toward a specific individual can trigger investigation, even without explicit details.\n\nThat distinction matters more when the subject is a high-profile figure.\n\nThe situation reopened a familiar debate. Where does free expression end, and where does accountability begin?\n\nSome defended the TikToker, claiming the statement was careless but not criminal. Others argued that public figures face constant danger and that language like this cannot be brushed aside.\n\nPlatforms also came under scrutiny for how quickly content spreads before moderation steps in. Once again, the internet moved faster than clarity.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Musk has become the center of an online firestorm triggered by a single sentence. His presence alone tends to magnify conflicts.\n\nOne comment becomes a movement. One reply becomes a signal. And millions rush to interpret intent. That dynamic keeps repeating, and each time the stakes feel higher.\n\nJUST IN: Somali woman Fardowsa Muhumed is FRANTIC after threatening Elon Musk’s life, to which Elon replied, “then IT IS WAR”\n\nShe’s retracting her threat, and says “[I am] truly in fear for my future!”\n\nCowards.pic.twitter.com/aG1pRqYplt https://t.co/mMkGcIMu7u\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nIn a video released a few hours ago, the Somali woman has apologized for her comments and claimed the video was taken out of context.\n\n“Let me make myself clear, I never intended or aimed to threaten the life of Elon Musk. I am not a person who carries around hate; the media has taken my words out of context, and it’s been deeply hurtful to watch how that’s turned into me being dehumanized and painted as a villain.",

    "title": "Members of Congress Decry Trump’s Act of War on Venezuela as “Illegal”",
    "description": "John...",
    "fullText": "Senators and House members accuse Trump and his aides of disregarding the Constitution and lying to Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Saturday at 3:21 am, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow.”\n\nHours later, during a congratulatory press conference, Trump said that during a period of transition in Venezuela, “we’re going to run the country right.” But he gave only limited details of how the process would proceed, aside from saying, “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.” Trump dwelt more on talk of prosecuting Maduro and his wife in a New York City courtroom.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi had already taken to social media earlier on Saturday morning with a message :“Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States. They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”\n\nBut in a brief predawn call with a New York Times reporter, Trump refused to discuss whether “he had sought congressional authority for the operation or what is next for Venezuela.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio later acknowledged that there had been no pre-attack consultation.\n\nAs it became clear that leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees had not been consulted on the regime-change attack and as confusion mounted about what would happen next in Venezuela, key members of Congress—who have the constitutionally defined authority to declare wars and to oversee major military actions—reacted angrily to what had transpired in the name of the United States but without the consent of the legislative branch.\n\n“A US invasion of Venezuela to depose its president and arrest him is illegal,” Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, told NPR Saturday morning. Kaine promised to seek a Senate vote next week to declare that Trump should not be waging this “unilateral presidentially declared war against Venezuela” without congressional authorization.\n\nKaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement arguing, “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro—however terrible he is—is a return to a day when the United States asserted a right to dominate the internal affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere. The history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to the claim with a straight face to other countries should respect the United States’ sovereignty when we do not do the same.”\n\n“Where will this go next?” asked Kaine. “Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people’s elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.”\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who has been one of the House’s most consistent critics of undeclared wars, warned that Trump has disregarded the Constitution. “President Trump has repeatedly been told he must consult with and get authorization from Congress to go to war, per US law. While we are only seeing early public accounts of what happened, it is clear he acted without doing that,” Pocan said. “Trump not notifying Democratic leadership, much less rank-and-file members, continues the degradation of the rule of law.”\n\nRepresentative James Walkinshaw, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Military and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs, said, “Trump’s regime change war in Venezuela is flat out illegal and yet another betrayal of the commitments he made to the American people. He said he’d lower prices. He’s driving prices up. He said no ‘new stupid wars.’ He’s starting new stupid wars.”\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) initially went on social media and wrote, “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”\n\nLater, after receiving a call from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Lee made feeble excuses for the administration, claiming that the assault “likely” was justified by fears of “an actual or imminent attack.” But Washington Post national security analyst Josh Rogan wrote, “The United States has just kidnapped a foreign head of state and bombed a foreign capital using the justification of protecting U.S. personnel from an ‘actual or imminent attack’ according to Senator Lee. Make no mistake, President Trump just committed an act of war against Venezuela.”\n\nThe New York Times adopted a similar view in an editorial headlined “Trump’s Attack on Venezuela Is Illegal and Unwise.”\n\nAnd Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dismissed claims by the president and the attorney general about the reasons for the regime change. “It’s not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn’t have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world [former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández] last month. It’s about oil and regime change. And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn’t. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie (R-KY) also expressed skepticism. “If this action were constitutionally sound,” Massie wrote on X, “the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law.”\n\nMaduro, according to election observers, almost certainly lost the 2024 presidential election and then refused to step down. Yet he had recently signaled an openness to meeting with Trump to discuss US allegations about drug trafficking and other issues. Trump has now executed a secret plan to remove the Venezuelan leader, even after Trump’s aides had denied regime-change plans.\n\nSenator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a national security adviser under President Barack Obama, accused Trump’s secretaries of state and defense of lying to Congress about the administration’s intensions. “Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn’t about regime change,” Kim said in a statement amid the first reports of US air strikes on Caracas. “I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress. Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”\n\nKim explained, “This strike doesn’t represent strength. It’s not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government. This will further damage our reputation—already hurt by Trump’s policies around the world—and only isolate us in a time when we need our friends and allies more than ever.”\n\nSenator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, “We have no vital national interests in Venezuela to justify war. We should have learned not to stumble into another stupid adventure by now.”\n\nSenator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who served in the US Marines from 2002 to 2006 and was deployed during the war in Iraq, bluntly declared, “This war is illegal.” “There is no justification for the United States to be at war with Venezuela. I lived through the consequences of an illegal war sold to the American people with lies,” explained Gallego. “We swore we would never repeat those mistakes. Yet here we are again. The American people did not ask for this, Congress did not authorize this, and our service members should not be sent into harm’s way for another unnecessary conflict.”",

    "description": "The U.S. made mincemeat of Maduro's Moscow-made missiles.",
    "fullText": "The “Russian Shield” over Caracas, Venezuela’s vaunted air defense, was supposed to be an iron dome, one that would put the United States to shame and sink their ships. But at 0400 EST on January 3, 2026, the U.S. Navy turned it into red-hot scrap metal.\n\nFor a decade, the defense blogs and twittersphere have been doom-posting about the S-300VM “Antey-2500.” They told us the Caribbean was a kill zone. They exclaimed proudly that the Su-30s would sink the American fleet before it could reach operating range. But when the first wave of Tomahawks from the USS Gerald R. Ford crossed that coastline, those Russian radars were already absolutely worthless.\n\nRead Next: 7 Venezuelan bugs that can ruin your day (and maybe your life)\n\nWe didn’t just erase a grid square; we dismantled a talking point. The myth of near-peer air defense in the Western Hemisphere is dead. As we have said here before, you can watch other countries battle and say warfare has changed forever, but this is because you don’t ever see what the American military can actually accomplish.\n\nBut before you start popping champagne and waving your miniature American flag, check your ego. The easy part is over. We just knocked on their proverbial door; if you want to enter another man’s home uninvited, it’s a whole other thing.\n\nHere’s the After-Action Report on how we blinded the bear, and why the next phase is going to be a bloodletting.\n\nOn paper, the S-300VM (NATO: SA-23 Gladiator) is a true nightmare. It’s a tracked, mobile beast designed to swat cruise missiles out to 250km. It was the “FAFO” sign for the U.S. Navy.\n\nSo how did “Operation Southern Spear” crack Venezuela’s air defense in 20 minutes? Physics.\n\nThe S-300 relies on the 9S32ME guidance radar, but the radar has a glitch to exploit: it has to scream to hear. The Ford’s air wing, Growlers, and F-35Cs didn’t just jam those signals; they drowned them out. They forced the Venezuelan operators to crank up their power to see anything through the static.\n\nThat was the bait. The second those radars lit up, they became beacons for our Anti-Radiation Missiles. The S-300 can track 24 targets, but it can’t hit what it can’t see, especially when its brain is having a digital seizure.\n\nRussian-built systems (corruption in their military complex notwithstanding) were designed for the flat open beauty of Eastern Europe, not the jagged teeth of the Venezuelan coast. Tomahawks hug the ground. By the time the batteries at La Carlota even kinda noticed the inbound wave, the missiles were already under the radar horizon, using the very mountains meant to protect the capital as cover. This is how the US military thinks and prepares: your greatest asset becomes a significant, often final, mistake.\n\nThe result? The “Russian Shield” is scrap metal. We own the sky; everyone knows this; we also dominate the oceans.\n\nThe ground sites are smoking, but the Venezuelan Air Force (AMB) isn’t helpless by any means. The real threat to the fleet was never the S-300; it was the Su-30MK2 Flanker carrying the Kh-31 Krypton.\n\nThis is a nasty piece of hardware. The Kh-31 is a Mach 3+ anti-ship missile that skims the waves faster than you would imagine. Venezuela has 24 Flankers capable of launching them. While we were pounding the static sites, those jets likely dispersed to remote jungle strips.\n\nIf they decide to sortie a suicide squad against the Ford, the Standard Missiles will have seconds to react. The air war isn’t over; it’s just moved from “suppression” phase to “hunting.”\n\nAnd now it’s time for the bad stuff. We spent billions perfecting a way of war that relies on three luxuries: seeing everything from space, talking to anyone instantly, and evacuating the wounded immediately.\n\nThe moment we push past the coastline, the jungle devours all.\n\nIn the desert, if it flew, we either owned it, took photos of it, or destroyed it. In the Amazon, the triple-canopy foliage is a literal roof over the battlefield. A Reaper drone at 20,000 feet can’t see through a hundred feet of mahogany and vine. The enemy knows this. They aren’t hiding in bunkers; they are maneuvering freely under that green roof.\n\nWorse, that canopy clears the airspace for the poor man’s air force: drone swarms. Not military-grade Predators, incredibly cheap, commercial quadcopters rigged with mortars. In the open desert, you hear them. In the jungle, the flora absorbs all the sound. You won’t know a suicide drone is there until it breaks through the leaves fifteen feet above and aims for your head.\n\nOur doctrine uses data as a crutch. We assume we can call for fire instantly because we have foooor decades. But the jungle is nature’s Faraday cage. Moisture-dense vegetation sucks up VHF and UHF signals like a sponge.\n\nAny patrols humping into the bush will see their comms range drop by at least half; the Russian (and probably Chinese) advisors turn on their jammers. Squad leaders addicted to combat iPads will find themselves staring at blank screens. We are heading back to the days of map, compass, and a runner, skills we let rust during twenty years of desert warfare.\n\nThis is the grimmest reality check. For a generation, American warfighters have operated with the confidence that a MEDEVAC bird was always en route. In this theater, that timeline is a fantasy and could be devastating for ground troops.\n\nNow Read: How the US military’s ‘Golden Hour’ obsession changed civilian medicine\n\nHelicopters can’t land in a lush jungle. Hoist operations are slow, loud, and leave the bird hovering like a piñata for MANPADS. If a soldier is hit, they aren’t flying out; their mates are carrying them out. Imagine a fifty-million-dollar helicopter just hovering over a canopy for any length of time. There will be a control room filled with 20-year-olds flying plastic FPV drones at them within minutes, like it’s nothing more than a game.\n\nEvacuation becomes a grueling, multi-day hike through mud that rots skin. The “Golden Hour” becomes the “Golden Day” if you’re not being bogged down by constant ambush. Every casualty anchors the unit further, turning a rescue mission into a tactical nightmare where help is a three-day hike away.\n\nOperation Southern Spear was a technical masterpiece. We proved that Russian hardware can’t handle American software. The S-300 is effectively dead, and the Ford is prowling the coast.\n\nBut don’t confuse air superiority with victory. We just kicked down the front door, but the house is a labyrinth, and the lights are out. The enemy isn’t going to fight us in the sky anymore. They are going to wait in the green, where our sensors don’t work, our comms fail, and our drones are blind.\n\nWe bought the airspace for a billion dollars this morning; couch change to the U.S. government. However, if there are any further intentions, the cost could be unbearable.\n\nZhakfar Ahmadi, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty",

Weeks later on January 20, reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 was released.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe two models either surpassed or matched the performance of rival models across a range of industry benchmark tests. They were also built at a fraction of the cost and computing power that major US tech companies invest to build LLMs. The result: a massive sell-off on January 27 wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in tech stocks, including US$600 billion from Nvidia alone.\n\nAnalysts expected the momentum of Chinese AI companies to continue this year, thanks to Beijing's policy support, improved funding prospects, greater adoption of AI systems across industries and a growing number of talent being recruited for innovative projects.\n\nA domestic AI start-up's co-founder, who declined to be identified, predicted that China would overtake the US to become \"the world's leading AI power in 2027\". China's advantage was its deep talent pool, according to the co-founder.\n\nIn his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that the domestic market has \"many large AI models competing in a race to the top\", while new breakthroughs were being achieved in domestic semiconductor development. All of that \"has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest growing innovation capabilities\", Xi said.\n\nDeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng.

    "description": "President Donald Trump's trade war was partially intended to boost US-made goods. Is it working? Take our survey to share your thoughts.",
    "fullText": "2025 was supposed to be a big year for American manufacturing.\n\nIndeed, boosting US-made goods was a key priority of President Donald Trump's trade war, which led to wild swings in tariff rates on imported products.\n\nNearly a year later, the actual changes to consumer behavior aren't entirely clear.\n\nFor starters, many retailers worked quickly to order merchandise ahead of tariff deadlines and found alternate sources of comparable goods to secure lower duties.\n\nA particular challenge for brands that manufacture products in the US is that many still rely on imported materials or equipment, which have seen cost increases related to tariffs.\n\nOne entrepreneur who wanted to make a better grill scrubber discovered firsthand how hard — and expensive — it was to make a product entirely with an exclusively American supply chain.\n\nAnother gave shoppers the choice between otherwise identical shower heads: an imported version and an American-made one that cost nearly twice as much. No one bought the higher-priced product.\n\nOf course, neither industrial nor consumer behaviors change overnight.\n\nWith enough time and investment, some CEOs believe US manufacturing can make a comeback.\n\nAs things stand now, however, tariffs have largely settled at an average rate of around 15%, and consumers appear to be reluctantly accepting the higher prices. There's also the issue of unresolved legal challenges to much of Trump's authority to apply many of the tariffs that he did.\n\nSo, as a new year begins, will shoppers choose more American-made products, and will that be enough to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing?\n\nTake our survey to help us find out.",

    "description": "Drones have turned the front line into a kill zone, and made casualty evacuation extremely difficult and dangerous.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces would likely see heavier losses than Ukraine has in a war with Russia, a senior officer told Business Insider, and that possibility is driving a rethink of battlefield medical care.\n\nDrones are watching much of the front line, making it nearly impossible to get wounded troops access to medical care within the \"golden hour,\" the critical first 60 minutes after a severe injury when access to medical care may determine life or death.\n\nGolden hour is found only in books, said Ukrainian Col. Valerii Vyshnivskyi, the country's senior representative to the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre (JATEC).\n\nNow, there's only a golden day or month, he continued. \"The battlefield is visible 100%. That's why medical evacuation cannot be done in the old way.\"\n\nThe sky above the battlefield is filled with drones of all types executing both reconnaissance and strike missions. That saturation means Ukrainians often have to wait for unfavorable weather conditions and poor visibility to evacuate casualties. Some solutions, such as ground robots, are becoming more popular, but those systems aren't without their problems. They are vulnerable to attack, they break down, and they are susceptible to jamming.\n\nIn a high-intensity conflict against Russia, NATO forces would probably face the same casualty evacuation issues that Ukraine is dealing with, Vyshnivskyi said. However, he believes the military alliance would suffer heavier combat losses, as such a war has the potential to be significantly more destructive.\n\nNow nearly four years into the war, neither Ukraine nor Russia has publicly disclosed how many of their soldiers have been killed or wounded in combat. However, the total losses across both sides are unquestionably high.\n\nUkraine has suffered an estimated 400,000 casualties, including up to 100,000 troops killed, according to figures reported over the summer. Russia's toll is even grimmer: the UK defense ministry said last month that Moscow has likely taken more than 1.1 million casualties since its 2022 invasion and is now losing over 1,000 troops a day.\n\nWestern leaders have warned that the carnage, while presently unfolding on the battlefield and in Ukrainian cities, could expand deeper into Europe.\n\n\"Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech last month, later adding that such a conflict would result in \"extreme losses.\"\n\nNATO is becoming increasingly aware of the threat that drones pose to the treatment and evacuation of wounded troops in armed conflict, and it is preparing to meet that challenge. The alliance is working to source solutions from the medical and defense industries to save lives on a drone-infested battlefield.\n\nCompanies from 20 nations submitted 175 applications to showcase solutions at an \"Innovation Challenge\" hosted by NATO Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and JATEC — a key initiative that uses real-time lessons from the war to inform Western defense planning — in London last month.\n\nTen finalists presented ideas, which included a portable system to treat kidney failure, a jury-rigged stretcher design for evacuation over rough terrain, a secure communications portal for medics, ballistic plates for makeshift shelter, and other innovative solutions.\n\nBritish Army Col. Niall Aye Maung, the medical branch head for NATO's ACT and the medical advisor to the alliance headquarters in Brussels, referred to the ideas as a \"system of systems,\" where there's no single solution for battlefield casualty treatment and medical care. Instead, they'd function together.\n\nACT officials are now examining how to overhaul the NATO medical system to meet the demands of a large-scale war, Maung told Business Insider — and they're turning to Ukraine's experience to find medical solutions, including through events like the innovation challenge.\n\nVyshnivskyi, the Ukrainian officer, said Western leaders and industry are starting to understand the challenges that Ukraine is dealing with on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, one of NATO's biggest problems, he said, is that building new capabilities takes far too long — much slower than the battlefield is changing.\n\nFor medical gear, the research and development process can be lengthy because items must undergo regulatory and legal processes to ensure their safety. Still, Maung said that most solutions NATO is looking for are commercial off-the-shelf products with dual-use applications in both civilian and military settings. This can speed up procurement timelines.\n\nQuicker procurement is something NATO is exploring well beyond medical capabilities, as allies look to keep pace with the evolution of war technology on the battlefield. Drones and other emerging technologies are at the center of these efforts.\n\n\"If we want to react and innovate at speed, we have to accept and respect that the speed of innovation in commercial markets and civilian markets is a lot faster than in traditional military markets, especially if you're looking at non-traditional armaments,\" Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the Ukraine war continues, European militaries continue to buy up weapons and strengthen their defenses — especially nations along NATO's Eastern flank that border Russia — and prepare for the possibility of a larger war.\n\nRutte, NATO's secretary general, said during his speech last month that Europe needs \"to be ready\" because modern wars are \"no longer fought at arm's length.\"\n\n\"Conflict is at our door,\" he warned. \"Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.\"",

    "fullText": "The must-read story in the $5 trillion hedge fund industry used to be about who made the biggest trade or launched the biggest fund. Now it's about who made the biggest hire or got the biggest guaranteed payout.\n\nAs the increasingly institutional space has veered away from star funds run by a single genius to sprawling investment platforms with dozens of investing teams, the industry has grappled with a shortage of talent.\n\nIt's now such a finite resource that top portfolio managers are commanding deals that resemble those of professional athletes, and top managers accustomed to poaching their choice of talent by paying top dollar are now developing more talent in-house to cut expenses.\n\nBusiness Insider has closely covered the evolution of hedge funds. See our stories below on the state of play, how the industry is changing, and who the new stars are as a result.\n\nThe numbers are staggering, with guaranteed nine-figure payouts and yearslong non-compete clauses, but the anecdotes of what it's like inside the biggest funds are just as startling.\n\nBig-name funds churn through underperformers, giving PMs \"moment-by-moment paranoia,\" according to one former investor. Firms dangle potential relocation to tax havens like Puerto Rico and Dubai to entice top traders. Recruiters are being pushed into ethical gray areas to determine the truth about potential hires.\n\nWhenever this much money is flowing, there's bound to be ripple effects. Within hedge funds, this means the introduction of both new industry players and new roles within the largest firms.\n\nAs with any gold rush, people are picking up an ax in the hopes of carving out a little piece for themselves. It's up to the powers-that-be of the industry to decide what's real and what's fool's gold.\n\nOne subset of the industry that has been thrust into the spotlight during the talent is the individuals who find top PMs.\n\nRecruiters and business development professionals at the industry's biggest managers have seen their own worth soar in recent years. With a steady flow of fresh capital into hedge funds, this cohort is likely to remain in demand for years to come.",

    "fullText": "Google was not spared by this year's AI talent wars.\n\nThe Gemini creator lost employees from its AI and cloud business, even though the company also made significant hires from other Big Tech companies.\n\nUnlike Apple, which mostly lost AI talent to Meta, which splurged big on recruitment this year, most significant departures from Google ended up at Microsoft.\n\nGoogle DeepMind's rivalry with Microsoft's AI unit is one between two DeepMind cofounders who parted ways. Mustafa Suleyman, now steering Microsoft's consumer AI push, and Demis Hassabis, the current CEO of Google DeepMind, launched DeepMind alongside researcher Shane Legg in 2010. They built a research lab so influential that Google bought it for more than $500 million in 2014.\n\nBut a decade later, Suleyman departed Google and founded Inflection AI. He and most of his team were subsequently absorbed by Microsoft in a $650 million \"acqui-hire,\" which made him the AI lead of the company.\n\nThe competition for AI recruitment continues to intensify as hiring cools in the Big Tech job market. Here's a running list of the AI talent Google has lost this year and where they've ended up.\n\nIn July, Subramanya left his position as vice president of engineering at Google to join Microsoft as its corporate vice president of AI. He had been with Google for more than 15 years. In December, it was announced that he was joining Apple.\n\nSadovsky was a distinguished software engineer and senior director at Google for nearly 18 years before joining Microsoft as the corporate vice president of its AI division in June.\n\nGupta was a principal engineer at Google DeepMind before leaving for a position as technical staff on Microsoft's AI team. Prior to Google, Gupta also worked for Meta.\n\nThe former head of global customers engineering at Google left the company. Regini is now the senior vice president of the global solutions engineering unit at SentinelOne, which is a cybersecurity company that provides an AI-powered platform for enterprise security.\n\nRothfuss was a research scientist at Google DeepMind before leaving in May to join Microsoft as a member of technical staff on the company's AI team.\n\nLee was the senior director of corporate development for Google Cloud and DeepMind. He is widely credited for assisting with Google's high-profile acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz in March. In December, Lee left for OpenAI as its new vice president of corporate development.\n\nFrank was a senior director of product management at Google, who was responsible for advertiser and customer engagement platforms. He joined Microsoft as the corporate vice president of AI monetization.\n\nPotti was the general manager of Google Cloud's security business for more than five years. He left in June and later joined a venture capitalist firm as a partner with a focus on cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2020, Hall made headlines after Amazon sued him for leaving his role as vice president of product marketing at Amazon to join Google. In September, Hall left his position as vice president of products for an undisclosed role, but wrote in a post on LinkedIn that he will be \"working in AI.\"\n\nCitron, a former senior director of product at Google DeepMind, joined Microsoft in August as corporate vice president of its AI group. In a LinkedIn post announcing his new role, he wrote that he is \"energized by Microsoft AI's pace, principles, and product craft.\"\n\nIn August, Barkley left as the head of product at Google Cloud to become the vice president of product management at Nvidia.",

    "fullText": "Beijing is calling its massive war games around Taiwan this week a stern warning; however, they are also practice, offering insight into how China is thinking about a war for the island.\n\nThe big military exercise, \"Justice Mission-2025,\" that kicked off Monday is the latest large-scale Chinese drill aimed at preparing the People's Liberation Army for action such as bringing combined arms to bear against Taiwan, seizing control of the skies, isolating and assaulting the island, and combating foreign interference.\n\nChina mobilized its army, navy, air, and rocket forces for drills around Taiwan with a focus on combat readiness in the sea and air, blocking off key ports and areas, and what it said was \"all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\nOn the southeast side of the island, China's military has been using bombers and anti-ship missiles against mock maritime targets, clearing the way for the navy's amphibious assault ships. The exercises, China's Eastern Theater Command said, are testing how well air and naval forces operate together. There was also an emphasis on eliminating targets at \"maximum range,\" key to cutting risk and keeping hostile forces at arm's length.\n\nTo the north and southwest of Taiwan, the Chinese military's destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers, and drones, together with the long-range rocket forces, have been practicing coordinated seizure and dominance, pursuing training targets on land, at sea, and in the air, the way it might in a real fight.\n\nIn recent years, China has put greater emphasis on more realistic training.\n\nIn the air, Chinese fighters, airborne early warning aircraft, and electronic warfare planes have been training to effectively secure air superiority, while action at sea has been focused on defeating both surface ships and submarines.\n\n\"With vessels and aircraft approaching Taiwan island in close proximity from different directions,\" a command spokesperson said, \"troops of multiple services engage in joint assaults to test their joint operations capabilities.\"\n\nVideo shared by the Eastern Theater Command showed preparations for the drills, including trucks carrying missiles, fighter jets and other aircraft, and warship activity.\n\n🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🪖China holds large-scale combat exercises east of Taiwan\n\nThe drills held by the People's Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command were aimed at testing joint sea–air coordination, precise target detection, and rapid neutralization capabilities. pic.twitter.com/2veIz926ZJ\n\nThe training isn't entirely simulated and includes live-fire activities against mock targets. The live-fire exercises will take place in five maritime and airspace zones around Taiwan.\n\nChina's coast guard is also on patrol in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The island's defense ministry said on Monday afternoon that it had detected 14 Chinese navy warships and 14 coast guard vessels around Taiwan and outlying islands. Additionally, 89 aircraft, including J-10 and J-16 fighters, JH-7 fighter-bombers, and KJ-500 early warning and control planes, had been detected around Taiwan as well. None of the ships or planes violated Taiwan's territorial airspace or waters.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said that the island has been conducting its own rapid response drills amid the Chinese exercise.\n\nThe drills show how China's military plans to use its current forces in a coordinated attack, but in official releases, there were also indications about its future ambitions. On Monday, China released an artificial intelligence-made short video on a Taiwan fight.\n\nThe video showed various animals, like eagles and bees, transforming into uncrewed aerial vehicles, sea creatures becoming warships, and wolves turning into uncrewed ground robots. The AI-generated video, titled \"Joint Operations to Thwart 'Taiwan Independence' Attempts,\" also featured a pack of humanoid drones carrying rifles and walking through a war-torn city.\n\n🇨🇳 PLA Eastern Theater Command releases AI propaganda video 《联武群戈斩“独”道》(Joint Operations to Thwart ‘Taiwan Independence’ Attempts) https://t.co/gKUa2CanWJ pic.twitter.com/l0fUHtVVVp\n\nThe propaganda video, despite its artistic styling and the featuring of some technology not currently known to exist, suggests China is aiming for an integrated approach using a range of uncrewed systems and advanced capabilities, like submarines and warships and aircraft.\n\nCombining assets has been an important part of the latest military drills. Effectively integrating wide-ranging combat capabilities for combined arms warfare is a challenging feat though.",

    "fullText": "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the Trump administration's trade policy is showing signs of de-escalation after a year in which tariffs unsettled businesses.\n\n\"If you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses and medium-sized businesses,\" Moynihan said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" which aired Sunday.\n\nSince returning to office, President Donald Trump has rolled out a 10% baseline tariff on imports, alongside higher rates for certain countries and product-specific duties such as those on automobiles.\n\nBut what initially disrupted planning and purchasing decisions is now becoming clearer, Moynihan said, with Bank of America's internal outlook pointing toward a broad tariff floor.\n\nAs negotiations progressed, Moynihan said tariffs have begun clustering around roughly 15% for many countries, with higher levels reserved for those that decline to buy US goods or ease non-tariff barriers.\n\n\"To go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact,\" Moynihan said.\n\n\"And that's where our team says it's starting to de-escalate,\" he added.\n\nChina, however, is an exception, Moynihan said.\n\n\"China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case.\"\n\nMoynihan also flagged North American trade as its own track, saying \"the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case\" — a reference to the agreement's scheduled review next year.\n\nFor smaller firms, Moynihan suggested that the current challenge hasn't just been the tariff rate itself, even as interest rates have come down over the past year.\n\n\"So they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing?\" he said, pointing to immigration policies as a source of concern.\n\n\"It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing.

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Requests to relocate abroad by Israelis working at multinational companies operating in Israel rose in the past year in reaction to Israel's ​two-year war against Palestinian militant group Hamas, a report showed on Sunday.\n\nThe Israel Advanced ‌Technology Industries Association (IATI) found that 53% of companies reported an increase in relocation requests from Israeli employees, noting this was \"a ‌trend that may, over time, harm the local innovation engine and Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe tech sector accounts for about 20% of Israel's GDP, 15% of its jobs and more than half of its exports. The hundreds of multinationals in Israel include Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nIn ⁠its annual report, IATI also said ‌some multinational companies are examining the transfer of investments and activities to other countries.\n\n\"In some cases, companies that faced disruptions in supply chains found alternatives ‍outside Israel during the war, and when these proved efficient, there is a risk that activity will not fully return,\" said the report, issued at a meeting led by IATI CEO and President Karin Mayer Rubinstein.\n\nAt the ​same time, it added, there has been an increase in demand for relocation among senior ‌executives and families, with more employees applying for positions outside Israel.\n\nStill, the report noted that multinationals view the Israeli tech ecosystem through a long-term lens and many firms have thrived during the war.\n\nSome 57% of companies maintained stable business activities throughout the fighting, and 21% expanded their operations in Israel, \"a figure that indicates continued confidence in local activity and the Israeli ecosystem even ⁠under conditions of uncertainty,\" IATI said.\n\nAnother 22% of companies ​reported damage to business activity during the war, which began ​on October 7, 2023, triggered by Hamas' raid on Israel, and ended two months ago following a U.S.-led ceasefire deal.\n\n\"Even during the difficult war, the Israeli ‍high-tech industry, including the global ⁠companies operating in Israel, once again proved its resilience and its ability to lead in innovation and creativity,\" said Rubinstein. \"We work tirelessly to ensure that Israel continues to be an ⁠attractive hub for the activity of multinational companies.\"\n\nIATI noted that \"without active steps by the state to create regulatory and ‌geopolitical stability, there is concern about gradual erosion in the stability of the local ‌ecosystem.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

    "fullText": "PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Voters in Kosovo cast ballots on Sunday in an early parliamentary election in hopes of breaking a political deadlock that has gripped the small Balkan nation for much of this year.\n\nThe snap vote was scheduled after Prime Minister Albin Kurti's governing Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination, party failed to form a government despite winning the most votes in a Feb. 9 election.\n\nThe deadlock marked the first time Kosovo could not form a government since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008 following a 1998-99 war that ended in a NATO intervention.\n\nThe prime minister's party is again the favorite in the race, but it is unclear whether it will manage to muster a majority this time in the 120-member parliament, after other mainstream parties refused an alliance.\n\nAfter voting Sunday, Kurti urged Kosovo's 1.9 million voters to turn out in large numbers to grant “more legitimacy for our institutions.”\n\n“Once the election result is known, we will do our best to constitute a new parliament as soon as possible and to proceed with the election of the new government,” he said.\n\nAccording to Kosovo’s election laws, 20 parliamentary seats are automatically assigned to ethnic Serb representatives and other minority parties.\n\nAnother inconclusive vote would further deepen the crisis. Kosovo has not approved a budget for next year, sparking concern over the already poor economy in the country of 2 million people.\n\nLawmakers also are set to elect a new president in March as current President Vjosa Osmani’s mandate expires in early April. If this fails too, another snap election must be held.\n\nThe main opposition parties are the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Democratic Party of Kosovo. They have accused Kurti of authoritarianism and of alienating Kosovo’s U.S. and European Union allies since he came to power in 2021.\n\nLumir Abdixhiku from the Democratic League of Kosovo urged voters to \"move away from the gloom, the deadlock and the division that has accompanied us for these years.”\n\nA former political prisoner during Serbia’s rule in Kosovo, the 50-year-old Kurti has taken a tough stand in talks mediated by the European Union on normalizing relations with Belgrade. In response, the EU and the United States imposed punitive measures.\n\nKurti has promised to buy military equipment to boost security.\n\nNo reliable preelection polls have been published. Kurti's party at the previous election won around 42% of the votes while the two main rival parties had together around 40%. Analysts say that even the slightest changes in numbers on Sunday could prove decisive for the future distribution of power.\n\nIlmi Deliu, a 71-year-old pensioner from the capital, Pristina, said he hoped the election will bring a change or “we will end up in an abyss.”\n\n\"Young people no longer want to live here,” he said.\n\nTensions with restive ethnic Serbs in the north exploded in clashes in 2023 when scores of NATO-led peacekeepers were injured. In a positive step, ethnic Serb mayors this month took power peacefully there after a municipal vote.\n\nKurti has also agreed to accept third-country migrants deported from the United States as part of tough anti-immigration measures by the administration of President Donald Trump. One migrant has arrived so far, authorities have told The Associated Press.\n\nKosovo has one of the poorest economies in Europe. It is one of the six Western Balkan countries striving to eventually join the EU, but both Kosovo and Serbia have been told they must first normalize relations.",

    "fullText": "Russia’s financial system is reportedly coming under more strain as Moscow’s war on Ukraine nears the end of its fourth full year.\n\nThe White House is seeking to revive peace talks this weekend with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky due to meet President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Russian forces stepped up their bombardment of Ukraine ahead of the meeting, but prolonged fighting presents risks for the economy.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post recently on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nRussia’s economy was surprisingly resilient in the face of severe Western sanctions after President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. That’s as China and India were eager to snap up cheap Russian oil, keeping the Kremlin’s coffers full and providing revenue for its military.\n\nBut more recently, energy prices have slumped while Europe and the U.S. have tightened sanctions. Oil and gas revenue has tumbled 22% in the first 11 months of the year, and Reuters estimated that December proceeds are on pace to sink nearly 50%.\n\nTo cover the shortfall in energy revenue, Moscow has tapped its sovereign wealth fund. But that is running out now too, so the government has resorted to raising more revenue via tax hikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a tight labor market and high inflation have forced the central bank to keep interest rates high, and recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, Russian data show unpaid wages nearly tripled in October from a year ago to more than $27 million, with the Post adding that furloughs and shorter workweeks are also becoming more common.\n\nAs a result, more consumers are having trouble servicing their loans. Given the headwinds, the Russian official warning of a banking or nonpayment crisis isn’t the first of its kind.\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to service loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nAnd in September, Sberbank CEO German Gref, one of Russia’s top banking chiefs, said the economy was in “technical stagnation,” following his warnings in July and August that growth was close to zero.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Several key issues remain unresolved in ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and the United States over a potential framework to end Russia’s war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week. Speaking about a 20-point plan under discussion, Zelenskyy outlined the most difficult points, noting that Ukraine has already conveyed its position to Washington, which is expected to communicate it to Moscow.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with U.S. representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev recently met with U.S. envoys in Florida. However, he did not reveal any details, saying only: “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue.”\n\nZelenskyy said talks continue over the nature and scope of security guarantees that would be provided to Ukraine under any agreement. He said several technical issues remain, including how guarantees would be enforced and what monitoring mechanisms would be used to ensure compliance.\n\nZelenskyy said the fate of the territories that Russia claims remain the most difficult issue in the talks. He did not provide details, but has repeatedly said Kyiv will not recognize Russian control over occupied regions, including areas seized since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy has also repeatedly stated Ukraine will not cede territories it currently controls, which Russia has publicly demanded.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\nZelenskyy said the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved. The facility, Europe’s largest, has been under Russian control since early on in the war and has raised repeated international safety concerns due to fighting nearby.\n\nUkraine has been consistent in saying that safe operation of the station requires demilitarization of its territory, where Russia currently has troops stationed. Apart from that, Ukraine has been insisting that Ukrainian workers should be granted full access to the station, which they currently don’t have.\n\nDetails previously released in the course of the current negotiations revealed that the U.S. and Ukrainian teams are in discussion of a joint-access format, potentially between all three sides (the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia).\n\nZelenskyy said further discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. teams are expected, including talks in Florida, and that separate documents on economic recovery and prosperity are also under consideration.",

    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s coverage of the final \"WWE SmackDown\" of 2025, coming to you from the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan this December 26 evening! Heat up your Christmas leftovers, put on your new pair of cozy pajamas, and get ready for an action-packed card to play this spectacular year out.\n\nDrew McIntyre has had a less than jolly season after WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes invaded his home mere days before last week's December 19 episode of \"SmackDown.\" While McIntyre was absent from WWE programming following the home break-in and subsequent brawl, \"The Scottish Psychopath\" is back with a vengeance. With the lines between in-ring competition and out-of-ring animosity now blurred beyond recognition, just what will McIntyre do in order to get his revenge against Rhodes in this rivalry-turned-blood feud?\n\nSpeaking of feuds, The Miz is out to reclaim his honor after receiving a Ten-Knuckle Shuffle at \"Saturday Night's Main Event,\" courtesy of R-Truth and Joe Hendry! Grand Rapids will be chanting the name of the former TNA World Champion as he appears to take on the former WWE world titleholder in singles action. While this is looking to be a typical one-on-one affair, The Miz is notorious for bending the rules in order to come out with a win. Will the new-age Hendry be able to withstand the veteran Miz's underhanded tactics, or will Hendry's viral moments crumble under The Miz's tried-and-true tenacity?\n\nIn the vein of tried-and-true tenacity, United States Champion Ilja Dragunov is set to defend his title in yet another installation of his Open Challenge series. So far, he has defended his title against the likes of Tommaso Ciampa, J.D. McDonagh, both halves of Fraxiom, Carmelo Hayes, and others. Dragunov has mostly been able to steer clear of controversy and repeat challengers during his time as United States Champion, but recently defeated challengers Ciampa, Johnny Gargano, and Candace LeRae may not be done with him just yet. Who can Dragunov rely on to even the numbers, or will \"The Mad Dragon\" be faced with the impossible-to-win numbers game to end 2025?\n\nAll will be revealed when WWE's blue brand comes to life tonight, at 8PM Eastern, 7PM Central!\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

He works in IT and earns about $90,000 a year, while she earns roughly $55,000. He wrote that growing up lower middle class shaped his careful approach to money.\n\nUntil recently, he wrote, their everyday spending had felt manageable.

The OP said his girlfriend suggested a 10-day trip to Italy in late summer, an idea he supported. He created a rough budget covering flights, hotels, trains, food, and tours, estimating the total at about $4,500 for both of them — excluding shopping.\n\nHe suggested that if they started saving immediately, each could set aside about $400 to $450 per month over several months and split the cost evenly.\n\nAfter reviewing the spreadsheet, she laughed and questioned why he was treating the trip \"like a business contract,\" pointing out that he earns significantly more. She added that a serious partner would simply cover the trip and let her contribute in smaller ways.\n\nIn response, he wrote that he did not want to set a pattern where major expenses automatically fell on him, especially before they lived together.\n\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nThe OP explained his financial priorities, including paying down student loans and building an emergency fund. He wrote that covering more than $3,000 himself while she paid around $1,500 felt unbalanced. During that discussion, she compared him to an ex who never asked her to pay for vacations.\n\nSince then, he said, the tension continued. She made sarcastic comments about money during meals, and later compromise proposals were dismissed.\n\nHe suggested splitting costs based on income, such as a 60-40 arrangement or covering flights while she handled her spending money. She rejected those options, saying they showed he was \"keeping score.\"\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "fullText": "ADEN, Yemen (AP) — Separatists in southern Yemen accused Saudi Arabia on Friday of targeting their forces with airstrikes, something not immediately acknowledged by the kingdom after it warned the forces to withdraw from governorates they recently took over.\n\nThe Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates, said the strikes happened in Yemen’s Hadramout governorate. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were any casualties from the strikes that further raise tensions in the war-torn nation and put at risk a fragile Saudi-led coalition that has been battling the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the country’s north for a decade.\n\nAmr Al Bidh, a foreign affairs special representative for the Council, said in a statement to The Associated Press that its fighters had been operating in eastern Hadramout on Friday after facing “multiple ambushes” from gunmen. Those attacks killed two fighters with the Council and wounded 12 others, Al Bidh said.\n\nThe Saudi airstrikes happened after that, he added.\n\nThe Council later described their operations in the area as seeking a wanted man and trying to cut off smuggling through the area.\n\nFaez bin Omar, a leading member in a coalition of tribes in Hadramout, told the AP that he believed the strikes served as a warning to the Council to withdraw its fighters from the area. An eyewitness to the strikes, Ahmed al-Khed, said he saw destroyed military vehicles afterward, believed to belong to forces allied to the Council.\n\nThe Council’s satellite channel AIC aired what appeared to be mobile phone footage it described as showing the strikes. In one video, a man speaking could be heard blaming the strike on Saudi aircraft.\n\nOfficials in Saudi Arabia did not respond to a request for comment from the AP. On Thursday, the kingdom called on the Emirati-backed separatists in southern Yemen to withdraw.\n\nThe Council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra. That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-backed National Shield Forces, another group in the coalition fighting the Houthis.\n\nThose aligned with the Council have increasingly flown the flag of South Yemen, which was a separate country from 1967-1990. Demonstrators rallied on Thursday in the southern port city of Aden to support political forces calling for South Yemen to secede again from Yemen.\n\nSaudis, Emiratis back different Yemen forces\n\nFollowing the capture of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north by the Houthis in 2014, Aden has been the seat of power for the internationally recognized government and forces aligned against the rebels.\n\nThe actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the OPEC oil cartel, but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years.\n\nThe UAE said in a statement Friday that it “welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to support security and stability\" in Yemen.\n\n“The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavors aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen, contributing positively to regional security and prosperity,” it added.\n\nThere has also been an escalation of violence in Sudan, another nation on the Red Sea, where the kingdom and the Emirates support opposing forces in that country’s ongoing war.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sanaa in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile. Iran denies arming the rebels, although Iranian-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen despite a U.N. arms embargo.\n\nA Saudi-led coalition armed with U.S. weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting have pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine.\n\nThe war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the globe’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.\n\nThe Houthis, meanwhile, have launched attacks on hundreds of ships in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war, greatly disrupting regional shipping.\n\nFurther chaos in Yemen could again draw in the United States.\n\nWashington launched an intense bombing campaign targeting the rebels earlier this year that U.S. President Donald Trump halted just before his trip to the Middle East in October. The Biden administration also conducted strikes against the Houthis, including using B-2 bombers to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis.\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "fullText": "The majority of Russians expect the war with Ukraine to end in 2026, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe survey of 1,600 Russians aged 18 and above found that 55% believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" is nearing its end. The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

As players, we know how much of a big deal football can be to our nation,\" Eisa told BBC World Service.\n\n\"There's not a lot of smiles at the minute, so we're trying to use football as a way to get their minds off [the war].\n\n\"Even qualifying for the Afcon and having fans there to cheer us on – the fact that we're there is already bringing hope.\"",

    "fullText": "Conflict is brewing in the Mojave Wasteland.\n\n on December 24, 2025 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead.\n\nWhile last week focused on Lucy (Ella Purnell), Cooper Howard aka The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and their pursuit of Hank (Kyle Maclachlan), this week we caught up with the newly knighted Maximus (Aaron Moten) and his chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. We also got a peek into another faction of the Mojave Wasteland, one that could potentially spell danger for our protagonists and their questline.\n\nThe episode opens up with a flashback to Shady Sands in its prime; A welcoming city that almost resembles life before The Great War. We open up on Maximus' parents in their lovely home where his father is testing the radiation levels in the water and discovers most of the water beneath the city is safe to drink and could provide a long term home for Shady Sands’ residents. Life is good until a traveling nomad muttering to himself arrives with an atomic bomb, putting the city in danger. Acting fast amongst the panic and chaos, Maximus' father attempts to disarm it but accidentally activates the bomb’s failsafe, starting the three minute timer to detonation. With little time to spare, he puts Maximus in the kitchen refrigerator and he along with his mother give a tearful goodbye before they’re killed in the blast.\n\nElsewhere, in Vault 33, we see a young Hank Maclean getting ready to read Lucy a bedtime story. His pip-boy reveals he was the one that remotely activated the bomb.\n\nIn the present day we follow Knight Maximus as he leads a squad of power-armored knights into a ghoul infested facility. After taking them out in bloody fashion, the squad recovers a piece of old world tech that’s important to their cause. Later, Elder Cleric Quintus (Michael Cristofer) informs Maximus that the piece of tech his squad recovered is a vital piece in helping their cause of reclaiming the lost world. Using the piece of tech, the Brotherhood is able to activate windmill turbines that blow away massive sand dunes, revealing the buried Area 51 facility beneath it.\n\nWhen we catch up with Lucy and Cooper’s journey, the pair are discussing how the wasteland will change Lucy more than she knows. After reiterating that she’ll never end up like Cooper, she hears a voice calling for help from an abandoned hospital. In keeping with her “golden rule” of treating others the way she wants to be treated, Lucy sets out to help despite Cooper telling her not to.\n\nInside the hospital, they find an injured man and woman that Cooper refers to as “tunics,” implying they’re from farther east. Cooper walks up to the injured man, shoots him, and then eats a piece of his skin before spitting it out in disgust. He turns over his body and realizes he’s been stung and poisoned. Before they can react, Cooper, Lucy, and the injured woman are attacked by a pack of radscoprions. While dispatching them, both Cooper and the woman are stung. With poison coursing through their veins, Lucy has to make a choice on who to use the last stimpak on. She decides to save the woman and help guide her home, but not before an angry Cooper reminds her of her “golden rule.” She promises to come back for him.\n\nMeanwhile in Vault 31, all the junior Vault-Tec executives begin to wake up after being frozen for 200 years. Amid the confusion, Norm Maclean (Moisés Arias) tells them its Reclamation Day and that Bud Askins is dead (He’s not. He’s just thrown in the trash.) He tells the executives that he’s been chosen to carry on his work and that they need to find a way out of the vault that they’re trapped in. This goes about as well as you would expect and causes the group to panic.\n\nAt the Vault-Tec facility in Vegas, Hank begins his experimentation on the miniaturization of the mind control device using mice, but is repeatedly met with failure. He gets close when a mouse begins to sit upright, but alas that one fails, too.\n\nBack at Area 51, the Brotherhood of Steel enter the facility and uncover a trove of old war relics, weapons, and cars from throughout American history—as well as an icebox. Using the cold fusion that they won in the battle of Griffith Observatory, they make Area 51 fully operational as a homebase. It’s here when Scribe Dane (Xelia Mendes-Jones) begins questioning Knight Maximus and his personality changes upon his promotion. Maximus mentions Lucy and how, now that she’s gone, he needs to focus on his duties to the Brotherhood. However, Dane assures him that Lucy could still be out there.\n\nElder Cleric Quintus sets up a meeting with fellow Brotherhood chapters from the Grand Canyon and Yosemite about banding together against the chapter from The Commonwealth. The other chapters suggest that The Commonwealth won’t give up power without igniting a civil war. Quintus reveals that following them uncovering Area 51, they now have more fusion cores than humanity has ever seen and could use them to power their conflict. The other chapters agree to unite against The Commonwealth.\n\nOn the road, Lucy is guiding the tunic woman home when she begins to act suspiciously. After giving Lucy a vague warning, she disappears. When Lucy looks around, she finds torch bearing soldiers in the hills watching her. When she gets closer to them it’s revealed that they’re all wearing Roman garb. They are Legion.\n\nIn Vault 31, Norm bands together with the junior executives and they brainstorm a way to escape the vault through the ventilation system. Using the open hatch, they all escape to the surface where Norm admires its beauty, seeing the sky for the first time in his life.\n\nHank continues his experimentation on mice when he notices a hall for Vault-Tec Premium Elite Plus customers. After thawing out one of them, he attaches a device to the back of his neck and begins asking him about why he purchased the Premium Elite Plus package for himself and what happened to his family. The man reveals it was expensive and he didn’t buy it for his family. Hank doesn’t take kindly to this and tells him “family is everything.” He then activates the device, exploding the man’s head into a bloody mess. Another failed trial.\n\nWith multiple chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel under one roof, the energy becomes chaotic with drinking, partying, and fighting. In the midst of the commotion, Maximus is challenged to hand-to-hand combat by a fellow brother for being the one to kill Moldaver. Against his desire to do so, Maximus engages in bloody combat that ends with him stabbing the brother in his stomach with his own knife. Dane exchanges looks with him disapprovingly, not recognizing the man Maximus has become.\n\nAs the fight comes to an end, a mysterious Vertibird arrives uninvited. Departing from the ship is Paladin Harkness (Kumail Nanjiani), a liaison from The Commonwealth chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. He makes an announcement that he heard rumblings of a civil war and was wondering where his invite was, signifying The Commonwealth’s knowledge of the approaching conflict.\n\nThis week’s episode was a shakeup to the status quo. Lucy and Cooper ended up separated, Maximus immersed himself in the Brotherhood’s mission, and Norm finally reached the surface with a full party of followers. This episode also showed how fractured the wasteland truly is. From the Brotherhood of Steel, the Legion, and the Great Khans, everyone wants a piece of pie and it can be assured it won’t be without violence. If it’s anything we know about Fallout it's that “war… war never changes.”\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com",

    "title": "Taiwan needs to flood the battlefield with cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons to counter China, former senior military officer says",
    "description": "In a war with China, Taiwan could have an asymmetric advantage with a high volume of cheap and survivable weapons, a retired admiral said.",
    "fullText": "To prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome.",

    "fullText": "Air Force One is known as the \"flying Oval Office,\" but there's another lesser-known presidential plane that can operate as a \"flying war room\": the E-4B \"Nightwatch.\"\n\nNicknamed the \"doomsday plane\" for its ability to survive a nuclear blast, the E-4B is designed to protect the president and other senior officials and function as a military command center in worst-case scenarios. It also transports the secretary of defense on international trips.\n\nMany of the E-4B's features are classified, but the US Air Force has shared some glimpses into its capabilities. Take a look inside the top-secret aircraft.\n\nThe US Air Force's fleet of four E-4Bs comprises the National Airborne Operations Center at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nEach E-4B costs $223.2 million to build, according to the US Air Force.\n\nIn 2022, the Air Force introduced a $9.5 million E-4B simulator to train pilots, flight engineers, and other crew members to operate the aircraft, according to the US Strategic Command.\n\nThe E-4B can fly for 12 hours straight without refueling.\n\nThe E-4B possesses more communications capabilities than Air Force One, with about 67 satellite dishes and antennas in the radome.\n\nThe plane's exterior also features thermal and nuclear shielding, and its electrical system can withstand electromagnetic pulses.\n\nThe layout includes a command room, conference room, briefing room, operations team work area, communications room, and a rest area. The plane can seat up to 112 people.\n\nThe E-4B isn't just a \"doomsday plane.\" The defense secretary occasionally uses it to travel overseas and hold press briefings.\n\nIn the event of a nuclear attack or other apocalyptic scenario, the president, secretary of defense, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would use the plane as a secure command and control center similar to the Pentagon.\n\nThe secretary's private quarters are furnished with a bunk and a desk with chairs.\n\nAt least one E-4B has been on continuous alert since 1975, ready to deploy at a moment's notice.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — A former close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that immediately following the October 2023 Hamas attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza, the Israeli leader instructed him to figure out how the premier could evade responsibility for the security breach.\n\nFormer Netanyahu spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who faces trial for allegedly leaking classified information to the press, made the explosive accusation during an extensive interview with Israel’s Kan news channel Monday night.\n\nCritics have repeatedly accused Netanyahu of refusing to accept blame for the deadliest attack in Israel’s history. But little is known about Netanyahu’s behavior in the days immediately following the attack, while the premier has consistently resisted an independent state inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to Kan, Feldstein said “the first task” he received from Netanyahu after Oct. 7, 2023, was to stifle calls for accountability.\n\n“He asked me, ‘What are they talking about in the news? Are they still talking about responsibility?’” Feldstein said. “He wanted me to think of something that could be said that would offset the media storm surrounding the question of whether the prime minister had taken responsibility or not.”\n\nHe added that Netanyahu looked “panicked” when he made the request. Feldstein said he was later told by people in Netanyahu's close circle to omit the word “responsibility” from all statements.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages back to Gaza. Israel then launched a devastating war in Gaza that has killed nearly 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children.\n\nNetanyahu’s office called the interview a “long series of mendacious and recycled allegations made by a man with clear personal interests who is trying to deflect responsibility from himself,” Hebrew media reported.\n\nFeldstein’s statements come after his indictment in a case where he is accused of leaking classified military information to a German tabloid to improve public perception of the prime minister following the killing of six hostages in Gaza in August of last year.\n\nFeldstein is also a suspect in the “Qatargate” scandal, one of two close aides to Netanyahu accused of accepting money from Qatar while also working for the prime minister.",

According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

    "description": "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a tug-of-war between Netflix and David Ellison’s company, Paramount Skydance.",
    "fullText": "Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is raising the stakes in the battle for Hollywood’s future, personally intervening to salvage his son David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On Monday, David’s company, Paramount Skydance, announced the elder Ellison had provided an “irrevocable personal guarantee” of $40.4 billion to finance the deal, directly countering claims that the company’s funding was unreliable.​\n\nIt’s the latest turn in the high-profile tug-of-war for Warner Bros. Discovery, one of the entertainment industry’s crown jewels. David Ellison, who became CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance in August, has been aggressively pursuing Warner Bros. with a $108 billion all-cash offer, which comes out to about $30 per share. However, WBD’s board rejected that proposal in favor of a rival agreement to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix for roughly $83 billion.​\n\nThe board’s rejection hinged largely on skepticism regarding the Ellison family’s financing. Last week, WBD directors dismissed Paramount’s funding as “illusory,” citing concerns that the capital was tied to a “revocable family trust” that could be altered or withdrawn before the deal closed. Larry Ellison’s Monday filing was designed to silence those doubts.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” the company said in a statement, adding that the tech tycoon has agreed “not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”​\n\nThis massive personal commitment—roughly one-sixth of Larry Ellison’s $247.3 billion estimated net worth—effectively removes the WBD board’s primary defense against the takeover. To further sweeten the pot, Paramount raised its proposed breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching the termination fee included in the rival Netflix offer.​\n\nDavid Ellison argued that his company’s bid remains the only path that preserves Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole entity, rather than selling it off in parts. Netflix’s planned acquisition would exclude WBD’s Global Networks division, which includes CNN and other cable-native brands, and which WBD had previously announced plans to spin off.\n\n“Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on Dec. 4th, and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,” David Ellison said in a statement Monday. “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”​",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.\n\n“Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.\n\n“There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement, but the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives, though Trump was less effusive the following day, saying, “The talks are going along.”\n\n“We are talking. It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Soldiers in Ukraine say that grenades are key for close-quarters trench fighting, and Western forces are paying attention.",
    "fullText": "Grenades — a standard but often unglamorous part of modern infantry combat — have become indispensable in Ukraine's close-quarters and grueling fight against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe war blends advanced technologies like drones and electronic warfare with grinding, World War I-style fighting, where soldiers sometimes battle at arm's length in muddy trenches and bunkers. In those confined spaces, Ukrainian and Russian troops alike rely heavily on grenades.\n\nWestern officials and war veterans in Ukraine told Business Insider about the important role they play in Ukraine's trench warfare. Their use has also evolved, with grenades increasingly getting tactical upgrades, including adaptations for drone drops and components made with 3D printing.\n\nThe experience has highlighted a lesson for Western militaries less accustomed to modern trench fighting, the kind of combat that drives enormous demand for basic infantry munitions like grenades.\n\nUkraine's battlefield is littered with trenches unlike anything the West has seen for decades, with soldiers needing hides and defenses from the attack and surveillance drones that fly overhead, and the brutal fighting involves defending and taking these earthworks from the enemy.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and spoke with Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said that \"when you go through these trenches, hand grenades are your best fucking friends.\"\n\nHe said the fights are so close-quarters that in some engagements with the Russians, \"you could literally touch them with the muzzle of your rifle at times.\"\n\nTrenches are messy, uneven, and difficult to capture. \"You're basically trying to take the home of another individual who's lived there for days, weeks, months at this point,\" the vet said. \"So they know every nook and cranny; they know every turn.\"\n\nA British man who fought for Ukraine previously told Business Insider that he carried grenades for both assault and reconnaissance missions and described the US and UK-made grenades as \"prized\" among Ukrainians.\n\nLt. Col. Davidson, a leader in the UK-led training program for Ukrainian soldiers called Operation Interflex, told Business Insider last year on the condition that only his rank and last name be used that \"Ukrainians have got a heavy use of grenades.\" That usage was worked into the training in response.\n\nThere is a wide range of grenades in use in battle, everything from fragmentation and explosive to flashbang and chemical.\n\nA Ukrainian officer recently told Business Insider that smoke grenades can help to create poor visibility so injured soldiers can be evacuated, though it can also risk drawing unwanted Russian attention.\n\nCombat video footage shared by Ukrainian units often shows grenades in action, including footage of US volunteers using them in an assault on a Russian trench.\n\nUkraine's grenades come from multiple sources, from old Soviet-era stocks to those of partner nations.\n\nA January 2025 Department of Defense update said the US had provided \"more than 50,000 grenade launchers and small arms\" and \"more than 500,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and grenades\" to Ukraine. And the US isn't the only supplier. The volume supplied reflects how central these weapons are to front-line combat. Ukraine also makes its own grenades.\n\nIt's not alone, though. Russia is also heavily using these weapons, including in the booby traps it sets up in trenches and urban environments.\n\nUkraine feels it when it has shortages of grenades. Another US veteran told Business Insider on the condition of anonymity last year that, with US aid stalled and Ukraine suffering weaponry shortages, he was often told to be \"careful practicing with grenades\" so as not to waste too many.\n\nAnd when it was time to swap positions, troops taking over would ask those departing to leave any remaining grenades and ammunition.\n\n\"That's how desperate that situation got to where it's like guys were literally getting ammo and grenades off of dudes leaving the area so that they could keep fighting.\"\n\nGrenades have long been a staple of infantry combat, including in the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Ukraine's conflict has pushed their use to levels more typical of large-scale, attritional warfare, where trench systems stretch for miles and fighting drags on for months and years.\n\nWestern militaries did not anticipate the return of large-scale trench warfare, and in Ukraine that fighting has pushed grenades to the center of daily front-line combat.\n\nLong a standard tool in close-quarters fighting, they have become especially prominent amid widespread trenches, ammunition shortages, and evolving tactics.\n\nWhile they're being used in close-quarters combat, grenades are also being dropped from drones in battles all along the front lines, hitting soldiers, bunkers, hideouts, and even vehicles.\n\nVery recent footage from Novopavlivka front, drone dropping grenade RIGHT INTO RUSSIAN TANK HATCH.\n\nIt falls right into the hatch, destroying the tank from the inside.\n\nHonestly, tanks were so rare this year at the battlefield, and this is just BEAUTIFUL to watch. pic.twitter.com/Ns4NKBH2Qp\n\nA US Army Colonel said doing this has \"proved dramatically effective\" for Ukraine. The Army first tested dropping a live grenade from a drone this year. It's catching up.\n\nUkrainian units and engineers are also 3D-printing parts to make old grenades work better with drones while printing plastic casings to fill with explosives to make custom grenades.\n\nWorried about Russia sparking a wider war with Europe, much of the West is watching to see what lessons it can learn from Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Maguire, a British military officer who led part of the Operation Interflex training and helped document lessons from Ukraine, told Business Insider that the scale and importance of grenade use in trench fighting have stood out. He spoke on the condition that only his rank and last name be used.\n\n\"There's a massive demand for grenades,\" he said.\n\nThe West is looking at trench warfare more, too, and rethinking how messy and dangerous trenches can be and the weapons needed for a fight.\n\nUkraine's war has shown that even on a high-tech battlefield, sustained close combat in trenches still depends on basic infantry weapons and on having enough of them.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

    "description": "Luigi Mangione’s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi’s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer’s parent company.  Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department’s charge to turn Mangione’s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a “profound conflict of interest” that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Luigi Mangione’s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi’s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer’s parent company.\n\nBondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department’s charge to turn Mangione’s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a “profound conflict of interest” that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.\n\nThey argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard — and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group — through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.\n\nThe “very person” empowered to seek Mangione’s death \"has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,” his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest “should have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,” they added.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.\n\nBondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”\n\nThompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.\n\nFriday’s filing put the focus back on Mangione’s federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.\n\nMangione’s defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi’s past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.\n\nIn a September court filing, Mangione’s lawyers argued that Bondi’s announcement that she was ordering prosecutors to seek the death penalty — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.\n\nBondi’s statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration’s flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione’s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said.\n\nIn a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that “pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.”\n\nRather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense’s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione’s rights are respected at trial.\n\n“What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments” rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. “None warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.”\n\nMangione’s lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi’s ties to Ballard and the firm’s relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi’s compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from “all individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.\"",

    "description": "China warns that a massive $11.1 billion U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan could spark war, calling the island a \"powder keg\" amid rising tensions.",
    "fullText": "China denounced the United States for approving an $11.1 billion weapons package for Taiwan, warning that the deal risks turning the island into a \"powder keg\" and driving the region toward \"military confrontation and war.\"\n\nThe unprecedented sale includes 82 HIMARS launchers paired with 420 ATACMS long-range missiles, a combination that would give Taiwan new deep-strike capability across the Taiwan Strait, along with 60 self-propelled howitzers, advanced UAV systems, military software packages and anti-armor weapons.\n\nBeijing accused Taiwan’s leadership of \"seeking independence through force\" and claimed Washington is using the island to \"contain China,\" rhetoric that signals heightened tensions even as the U.S. frames the package as essential to bolstering Taiwan’s self-defense.\n\n\"The ‘Taiwan independence’ forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.\n\nChina’s Missile Surge Puts Every Us Base In The Pacific At Risk — And The Window To Respond Is Closing\n\n\"This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence’ but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.\"\n\nU.S. officials have not yet detailed delivery timelines, but the sale reflects Washington’s push to accelerate Taiwan’s defenses amid growing concern over China’s military pressure campaign. The HIMARS and ATACMS combination is expected to draw particular attention from Beijing because it would allow Taiwan to target PLA staging areas, ships and infrastructure from mobile launchers, a capability China has repeatedly warned against.\n\nIn its notification to Congress, the State Department said the proposed sales would advance \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\nThe department added that the weapons would \"help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region.\"\n\nUnder longstanding U.S. policy, Washington provides Taiwan with arms it deems necessary for the island’s self-defense while maintaining a \"One China\" policy and not supporting a declaration of formal independence. China argues that any enhancement of Taiwan’s defenses encourages separatism, while U.S. officials say the purpose of such sales is to preserve stability and deter conflict.\n\nHigh Stakes On The High Seas As Us, China Test Limits Of Military Power\n\nThe package now enters a 30-day congressional review period, during which lawmakers could file a resolution attempting to block it, a step Congress has never taken for an arms sale to Taiwan. Once the review period ends, contracting and production begin, a process that typically stretches over several years and contributes to a backlog that once reached $20 billion in undelivered U.S. weapons Taiwan has already purchased.\n\nChina has a track record of responding to major Taiwan arms sales with military demonstrations, including large-scale PLA drills, increased air and naval activity near the island and sanctions on U.S. defense firms. Analysts say Beijing’s sharp rhetoric suggests additional military signaling is likely, though China did not immediately announce specific countermeasures.\n\nThe latest sale marks a significant boost to Taiwan’s conventional firepower. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up pressure across the strait with near-daily PLA air and naval patrols, record incursions around the island and high-profile exercises meant to signal its ability to encircle Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the U.S. Wednesday for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key to deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Comment: After the year of his life, the award should go to Rory McIlroy – though it does not make it a scandal if the public decides to crown someone else",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy will be feeling confident when he takes his seat in the audience at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award tonight. We will know that simply because of his presence in the room, and because it is an honour that still carries enough significance and prestige that you want to be there if there’s a good chance you’re going to win.\n\nOthers may disagree. McIlroy, in the past, has been among them. But then, for some, bashing the Sports Personality of the Year contest is as much of an annual ritual as the prize itself, an opportunity to take cheap shots at the BBC, among other things.\n\nMcIlroy has enjoyed an exceptional year, the stuff of dreams, spearheaded by two successes at the Masters and Ryder Cup so astonishing that they may as well have been scripted. There’s no argument against that.\n\nHe won the Masters but did so on an agonising final round that displayed his vulnerabilities and the strength to overcome them, the qualities that make him such an endearing, inspiring champion. Leading Europe to an away Ryder Cup victory, against that American crowd at Bethpage Black, further strengthens his credentials and claim to a season that stands above the rest.\n\nAnd with McIlroy, there is also the sense of if he isn’t crowned SPOTY this year, then when will he ever be? There may be an acknowledgement of legacy and past achievements now that he has completed golf’s career slam. Certainly, given Andy Murray won SPOTY three times and Lewis Hamilton has done so twice, few would argue that McIlroy would not belong in their company in terms of British sporting greats of the past 20 years.\n\nSo, sure, the Northern Irishman should probably win, but this is also a public vote, decided on the night, and the history of this award can tell us it is rarely that straightforward.\n\nAt which point, it is worth considering what may happen should McIlroy lose out, or, rather, what the reaction would be depending on who he could lose out to. The Daily Mail has already declared there would be a “stain” on SPOTY should McIlroy not win the award this year.\n\nWhy? Yes, McIlroy has the strongest case in terms of his achievements. Yes, his victory at Augusta and what Europe achieved at Bethpage Black stirred emotions and created unforgettable drama. But, increasingly, the biggest factor in SPOTY voting can be the divide between sport that is behind a paywall and sport that is open to the largest audience possible, and it is a line that McIlroy, through no fault of his own, falls on the wrong side of.\n\nIt is why Chloe Kelly or Hannah Hampton (unless they split the vote) may stand as the biggest threat to McIlroy after another major tournament victory for the Lionesses. It is why Ellie Kildunne is an excellent outside contender, and why her world champion Red Roses may beat both Europe’s Ryder Cup team and the Lionesses to team of the year.\n\nSport is ultimately at its best when it brings people together. Its power is greatest when it can uplift and inspire. Ultimately, the most-watched moment of 2025 was Hampton saving from Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey and Kelly thumping her penalty into the net as the Lionesses won the Euros again – becoming the first England football team to win a major tournament on foreign land. The victory that had within it the capacity to influence society was the Red Roses lifting the World Cup at a sold-out Twickenham, a dominant, jubilant team celebrating how it had broken down barriers while demonstrating that strength and athleticism come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nAn accusation often levelled at the BBC is that its diminished offering of live sport means it has lost other events that consistently conjured this magic, such as the Masters. But in turn, the decision to platform the Women’s Euros and Women’s Rugby World Cup has seen audiences, particularly female viewership, hit record numbers. The success of a Lionesses or Red Roses team can now become a national event in the same way as men’s football or men’s rugby. It’s almost as if making live sport accessible and these athletes visible, following decades of marginalisation and catering to the male audience, has brought in new fans and levels of interest across a broader range.\n\nThis should be celebrated. But then, this is the BBC. To some, even the all-female presenting line-up of tonight’s event, in Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and Alex Scott, is evidence of an organisation and SPOTY award that has gone overly woke and lost its shine. You can probably imagine, then, what the reaction would be should either Kelly or Hampton follow Beth Mead in 2022 and Mary Earps in 2023 and win, even if more than 16 million people watched the Lionesses’ latest tournament victory.\n\nHow the votes between Kelly and Hampton are split will be another factor as, for the first time, two members of the same team have been named on the final shortlist. Why both? It may be down to England’s bewildering summer of survival and Kelly’s rather curious role within it, the star who delivered on the biggest moments but yet did not start a match. Over the course, Hampton was integral to keeping the Lionesses alive, and the goalkeeper was unlucky not to win player of the Euro 2025 – she was certainly England’s.\n\nThe truth is that any of the six on the final shortlist would deserve to win. That includes the two individual world champions, one crowned at the start of the year and the other less than a fortnight ago, in Luke Littler and Lando Norris, both of whom are immensely popular as well. But, after the year of his life, it should be McIlroy. It does not, though, make it a scandal or bring a “stain” on the award if the public decides to crown someone else.",

    "description": "Russia disclosed several new figures on Wednesday, including how much it's specifically spent on the war and how many soldiers it hired in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Russia's defense ministry broadcast its wide-ranging annual review on Wednesday of the Ukraine war, providing clues about its military goals and performance this year.\n\nAndrei Belousov, the Russian defense minister, presented the official statistics during the Defense Ministry Board's expanded meeting in Moscow.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the defense ministry's claims, which often differ significantly from those of international observers. Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, said at the meeting that the Kremlin's troops were \"crushing\" Ukraine, despite the war dragging on for nearly four years.\n\nThe disclosures also come as Russia has sought to project strength and demanded heavy concessions from Ukraine while negotiating potential peace terms with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, Belousov's presentation offers insight into Russia's ambitions for the war and its official narratives surrounding how it fights and plans to fight next year. Several new official figures were also announced.\n\nHere are 10 highlights from Belousov's end-of-year review.\n\nBelousov said that Russia's war spending is on track to reach about 5.1% of the country's GDP in 2025, out of an overall defense budget that reaches 7.3% of its annual GDP.\n\nThe country's nominal GDP in 2024 was about 201.2 trillion rubles, and is expected to grow 1% this year to about 203 trillion rubles, or $2.52 trillion.\n\nRussian independent media, however, reported that the economic ministry has forecast a GDP of about $2.7 trillion for the year.\n\nA war budget of 5.1% would therefore be somewhere between $128 billion and $137.7 billion.\n\nThis is the first time Russia has publicly disclosed the amount that it spends specifically on the war. Previously, the Kremlin only announced figures for total defense spending.\n\nThe US, by comparison, is planning to spend $901 billion on its military, or about 3.4% of its GDP.\n\nBelousov said that his ministry delivered roughly 38,000 motorcycles, buggies, and all-terrain vehicles to its troops on the front lines in 2025.\n\n\"This is 10 times more than last year,\" he said, adding that Russia plans to reach \"full strength\" in these vehicles next year.\n\nRussian troops have increasingly been using motorcycles, quad bikes, and other small, unarmored vehicles to assault or approach Ukrainian positions, trying to use their speed and small size to avoid drone attacks.\n\nUkrainians have also adopted the tactic, with one regiment even establishing an official motorcycle attack company in May.\n\nBelousov said that Russia hired 409,611 new contract soldiers in 2025, down from 449,243 in 2024.\n\nHowever, that already exceeds the Kremlin's 403,000 person recruitment goal for the year.\n\n\"Nearly two-thirds of them were young men under 40,\" Belousov said of the new recruits. \"More than a third have higher or specialized secondary education.\"\n\nUkraine and Russia have both been hard-pressed to fill their ranks as Moscow pressures Kyiv's forces with a continuous grind of frontal infantry assaults.\n\nTo maintain its flow of troops, Russia often entices recruits with hefty sign-on bonuses or pardons for crimes committed in the country.\n\nBelousov said that about 50% of Ukrainian casualties from Russian attacks come from first-person-view drones, or FPV drones. These are the small quadcopters mounted with explosives that have become a hallmark of the war.\n\nIn the summer, Russia said that it was outproducing Ukraine on FPV drones, though Kyiv's officials have since said their country has caught back up.\n\nUkrainian leaders have said that 70% of all casualties inflicted during the war involved FPV drones.\n\nBelousov said that Russia plans to create a new drone formation called the Unmanned Systems Forces next year, which would train \"tens of thousands\" of people.\n\nRussia has already created an official drone unit called Rubicon, which was formed last August to prioritize fighting with FPV drones and has often been described as fielding its most elite pilots.\n\nNow, Moscow appears to be trying to make such warfare an official pillar of its fighting force.\n\nBelousov said the Kremlin needed to transition FPV drone attacks from individual tasks carried out by each unit to \"integrated joint operations\" among its forces.\n\nUkraine launched its own Unmanned Systems Forces last year, appointing the previous commander of the elite unit, Magyar Birds, as its leader.\n\nRoughly 27,400 Ukrainian long-range drones were intercepted this year over Russian territory, with the bulk appearing after the summer, Belousov said.\n\nBelousov said that Ukraine initially began sending about 1,000 drones a month into Russia, but that the monthly number began hitting 3,700 by May.\n\nThe defense minister claimed that Russia's interception rate \"averages 97%\" for the year.\n\nUkraine has typically used fixed-wing drones to attack deeper into Russia, targeting what it says are oil and gas facilities and military production sites.\n\nUkrainian kamikaze \"drones\" aka converted Ukrainian-produced Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat light aircraft.\n\nThese drones can reportedly deliver 300kg warheads at a range around 2000 - 3000 km.\n\nIt's believed that similar drones were recently used to hit a Shahed drone manufacturing… pic.twitter.com/8xw6BzoZvO\n\nNotably, Belousov mentioned that Russia has also been exploring FPV drones that can serve as high-speed interceptors, a technology that Ukraine has been refining to counter Moscow's Shahed waves.\n\nBelousov said that Russia received two Tu-160Ms, which are modernized, supersonic bombers that can deploy nuclear weapons or powerful stealth missiles.\n\nThat's a clue about the production rate of the bombers, which are part of a small fleet that forms a vital pillar of Russia's nuclear triad. Several of Russia's older bombers were reported severely damaged in Operation Spiderweb, an audacious Ukrainian drone attack in early June that targeted a fleet of about 41 warplanes.\n\nUkrainian sources claimed that several Tu-160s were also hit, although this was not confirmed by independent open-source intelligence at the time.\n\nRussia's military also appears to be modifying its organizational structure.\n\nBelousov said that the Kremlin had created five new divisions, 13 new brigades, and 30 new regiments in 2025. International think tanks estimate that Russian divisions can consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 troops, while regiments within typically have about 2,000 soldiers and are further split into battalions.\n\nBrigades, which typically exist as a separate formation, often have about 3,500 to 4,500 troops.\n\nBelousov said this new structure included a new division, called the Aerospace Forces, which has a regiment \"equipped with the unique S-500 antiaircraft missile system, capable of striking targets in near space.\"\n\nNext year, the Kremlin plans to add four more divisions, 14 brigades, and 39 new regiments, he added.\n\nSome of these figures encompass formations that Russia has transformed, so they aren't necessarily an indicator of how widely Russia is expanding its military organization structure. For example, Belousov said two marine brigades were turned into a single division.\n\nBelousov said that Russia had expanded its use of drones and all-terrain vehicles to deliver gear from a \"one-time operation\" in 2024 to carrying 12,000 tons of cargo this year to the front lines.\n\n\"By 2026, this figure must be at least doubled,\" he said.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have been developing uncrewed ground vehicles, or ground-based drones, that can be remotely operated to deliver supplies to the front line or even conduct assaults.\n\nThe emerging technology is especially useful for dangerous tasks that would otherwise have to be filled by a human soldier.\n\nSome military units have also reported using drones to deliver equipment by air, such as one Ukrainian commander who said his forces used drones to send an e-bike to a stranded soldier.\n\nBelousov's presentation made it clear that Russia has been conducting precision strikes against Ukraine's power facilities.\n\nMore than 70% of Ukraine's thermal power plants and 37% of its hydroelectric plants have been disabled, Belousov said.\n\n\"The effectiveness of Russian precision strikes is about 60%, which is an order of magnitude higher than the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory,\" Belousov said.\n\n\"Ukraine's energy capacity has been reduced by more than half,\" he added.\n\nAttacking energy infrastructure is a war crime if it's found to be intentionally carried out to cause harm to civilians. Ukraine's besieged power grid is especially crucial, as it's essential for keeping its citizens warm during harsh winters.\n\nBelousov said the strikes on energy facilities were targeting the Ukrainian military, and that disabling the grid cut off power to Kyiv's forces.\n\nHowever, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said last September that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid were found to be severely affecting civilians and had \"disproportionately impacted\" vulnerable groups.\n\nUkraine also carries out attacks on Russian oil and gas facilities, though it said its aim is to cripple Moscow's ability to export energy and sustain war production.",

    "fullText": "Tucker Carlson claimed in a Wednesday interview that a member of Congress told him lawmakers were briefed that President Donald Trump is announcing “war is coming” tonight.\n\nCarlson joined Andrew Napolitano on his Judging Freedom podcast on Wednesday where they discussed growing tensions with Venezuela over strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as Trump’s address to the nation, scheduled for tonight.\n\n“Is Trump going to start a war in Venezuela?” Napolitano asked Carlson.\n\nAccording to Carlson, members of Congress were briefed on Trump’s plans, though he added he does not know the actual contents of Trump’s address.\n\n“Here’s what I know so far, which is that members of Congress were briefed yesterday that a war is coming and it’ll be announced in the address to the nation tonight at nine o’clock by the president,” Carlson said. “Who knows, by the way, if that’ll actually happen.”\n\nThe former Fox News host claimed he was told about the briefing by a member of Congress that morning.\n\nNotably, Axios’s Marc Caputo, who is well-sourced inside the Trump White House, reacted to Carlson’s comments, saying, “My sources say this wasn’t briefed & this announcement isn’t happening at 9.”\n\nCarlson is opposed to military action in Venezuela, arguing it would be repeating foreign policy mistakes of the past.\n\n“There’s not been a regime change effort that’s benefitted the United States or the world in 80 years that I’m aware of,” he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of being at the head of a narco terrorist smuggling operation. Maduro’s election victory has long been contested, with U.S. and global officials casting doubt on the results.\n\n“The illegitimate Maduro Regime is using Oil from these stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping. For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump announced this week.\n\nThe president has also set his sights on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, responding to his criticism of recent boat strikes by warning him he could have “big problems” soon.\n\n“He’s gonna have himself some big problems if he doesn’t wise up,” Trump told reporters. “Did he say Colombia’s producing a lot of drugs? They have cocaine factories that they make cocaine, as you know, and they sell it right into the United States. So he better wise up or he’ll be next.”\n\nThe post ‘War is Coming’: Tucker Carlson Says a Member of Congress Told Him What Trump Is Announcing Tonight first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.\n\nArnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.\n\n“Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation — intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,” said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP’s chief correspondent at the United Nations.\n\nAs a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.\n\nWhile almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.\n\n\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.\n\n\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”\n\nIt was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.\n\nIn January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.\n\n\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”\n\nHe would begin the fallen soldier’s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"\n\nArnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia’s economy was in shambles and the country’s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.\n\nAt the AP’s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHe credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.\n\nArnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP’s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau’s papers as coverage of the war wound down.\n\nInstead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they’d have historic value someday. They’re now in the AP’s archives.\n\nArnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.\n\nTen years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn 1995 he published the memoir, “Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.”\n\nArnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.\n\nHe was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military’s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.\n\nAfter his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.\n\nIn 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China’s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.\n\nBorn Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.\n\n\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a — you know — enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.\n\nAfter a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.\n\nSoon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.\n\nArnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.\n\n\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.”\n\nAP journalist Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "title": "The 6 biggest reveals from WBD's filing on why it rejected Paramount",
    "description": "A new filing says Paramount offered pay and a job to WBD CEO David Zaslav, and gives other takeaways from the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery didn't just reject Paramount again on Wednesday. It also pulled back the curtain on what the bidding war was like behind the scenes.\n\nWBD advised shareholders to dismiss Paramount's $30-per-share offer for the company and stick with Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share (for only its studios and streaming business). In a filing, WBD's board called Paramount's latest bid inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on shareholders compared to Netflix's bid, which it said offered superior value and more certainty.\n\nSome of the information in the filing had already been made public, but it revealed some juicy bits that haven't been reported.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways:\n\nRight after WBD rejected one of multiple secret bids in September, David Ellison called Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison. The conventional wisdom was that the Oracle cofounder's billions would prevail. In the end, that didn't happen. WBD expressed concern that the bid relied on a revocable trust, whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.\n\nWe already knew Zaslav stood to make over $500 million from a Paramount deal, based mainly on his shares that would vest immediately after it closed ($567,712,631, to be exact, according to the filing). Zaslav told the WBD board that the Ellisons had \"indicated to him that\" if a deal went through, he would \"receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars,\" per the filing. Zaslav responded that it \"would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time,\" he told the board.\n\nParamount also offered Zaslav the position of co-CEO and co-chairman of the combined company, a role Netflix didn't offer, the filing said.\n\nThat runs contrary to the narrative put forth in a letter Paramount's attorneys at Quinn Emanuel sent to WBD, stating they suspected the process was biased in favor of Netflix due to WBD leadership's expectations that there could be roles for them at the new company. Paramount's legal and financial advisors didn't know about the \"December 3 Quinn Emanuel\" letter and, in their view, the letter should not have been sent, was \"not helpful,\" and was a \"mistake,\" the filing says.\n\nThe filing revealed the presence of a fourth, previously unknown bidder in the process, \"Company C,\" which proposed acquiring WBD's cable channels and 20% of its streaming and studio businesses for $25 billion in cash.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Company C was Starz. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm that. Starz declined to comment.\n\nWBD determined that the Company C bid was \"not actionable\" and continued to work with Netflix, Paramount, and \"Company A\" (clearly Comcast).\n\nSome of Wall Street's marquee names — Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan, and Evercore — are set to make a total of $225 million in connection with WBD's sale to Netflix or Paramount, if a deal goes through, according to the filing.\n\nThe good times are poised to continue: Media and telecoms M&A deal value rose 61% in the past year, excluding the announced WBD sale, and the momentum should keep going in the years ahead, helped by investor appetite for valuable IP, according to PwC.\n\nThe Ellisons wanted to use $24 billion from Middle Eastern sources to fund their bid. That would seem to raise a whole host of concerns, not the least of which is that they'd be buying CNN and some of that money would come from Saudi Arabia's government, which US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka noted, however, that the issues WBD says the foreign money raised were \"presented as technical hurdles\" in the filing and \"not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\"\n\nA big question around the dueling bids was which company would have a better chance of surviving regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoth Paramount and Netflix made their cases, arguing that they'd sail through the process, while the other bidder would encounter issues.\n\nParamount said a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the well-stocked Warner Bros. library. Netflix, for its part, has argued that a combination of Paramount and WBD would actually be larger than its own proposed new entity, as measured by total US TV viewing time.\n\nNone of this seemed to be a chief concern for the WBD board, though.\n\n\"The WBD Board further took into account advice of WBD's regulatory advisors that regulatory risk was not a material differentiating factor between\" the Paramount and Netflix proposals, the filing said.\n\nThe wild card is Trump, though, who has close ties to the Ellisons but hasn't come down firmly on either side publicly.",

But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act, then we act.”\n\nSolovyov’s rant followed him as he traveled to the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk for a propaganda hit last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far been unable to capture the city in its years-long conflict with Ukraine.\n\nSolovyov’s rant also dropped as concerns are growing about Russia possibly targeting another country on top of their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto cautioned this week that tensions are escalating with Russia and Europe would not survive a war.\n\n“Freezing Russian assets was already a serious step, but using those assets goes even further. This is a war provocation of an unprecedented scale,” he said about the EU using frozen Russian assets. “Therefore, at today’s Foreign Affairs Council, I will make it clear that for Hungary, the risk of further escalation is unacceptable. Simply because if a war were to break out between Europe and Russia, Europe would not survive it.”\n\nBrussels wants to send another €210 billion to Ukraine, including around €115 billion for weapons.\n\nThe EU is disregarding its own rules by planning to finance this package through frozen Russian assets.

Mark Rutte, secretary general of the NATO alliance, made a similar warning.\n\n“The shadow of war is knocking on Europe’s door and that war could be bigger and bloodier than what we have experienced in recent times,” Rutte said.\n\nSolovyov has gone on fiery, scorched-Earth rants in the past, openly fantasizing in July about a nuclear attack on the United States.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that we want this. But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act then we act. First, of course, the principle of ‘do no harm’ but then…please don’t blame us,” Solovyov said on Tuesday.\n\nWhile speaking in Moscow this week, Putin denied Russian plans to invade Europe, dismissing warnings to prepare for potential war as “hysteria.”\n\nThe post Putin Ally Names European Countries Russia Will ‘Destroy’ as World War III Fears Loom first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump will deliver a live national address from the White House tonight at 9 p.m. EST.\n\n“I look forward to ‘seeing’ you then,” Trump said on Tuesday in a Truth Social post. “It has been a great year for our Country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”\n\nSpeaking later that day to Fox News’ “America Reports,“ White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump would be discussing “all of his historic accomplishments over the past year, and maybe teasing some policy that will be coming in the new year, as well.”\n\nHere’s what to know about Trump’s unexpected primetime address.\n\nLeavitt said that it’s “going to be a really good speech.”\n\n“He’s going to talk a lot about the accomplishments over the past 11 months,” Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “All that he’s done to bring our country back to greatness and all he continues to plan to do to continue delivering for the American people over the next three years.”\n\nTrump’s primetime address comes as the president faces troubling polling numbers on key issues, including the affordability crisis, rising health care costs and an escalating conflict with Venezuela.\n\nAs the first year of his second term draws to a close, only 36% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.\n\nTrump’s hardline immigration policies have drawn similar opposition from voters. According to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 38% of Americans approved of how he was handling immigration, down from 49% in March.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll also found that 68% of Americans believe the economy is in “poor shape,” including 44% of Republicans.\n\nTrump has delivered conflicting messages on the economy. He has referred to affordability as a “con job” and a “Democrat hoax,” while also blaming the Biden administration for inflation and high prices.\n\nAs the Supreme Court considers whether Trump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs are legal, the president has touted a new “golden age” for Americans driven by his signature economic policy.\n\n“You’re going to see results in six months to a year,” Trump said last Sunday. “I think you’ll see results. We’ve never had anything like it.”\n\n.@PressSec Karoline Leavitt: \"President Trump is going to be giving an address to the nation tomorrow night...it's going to be a really good speech.

    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: This is one of Popular Mechanics’ greatest stories. It was initially published in March 2022.\n\nWe climb in the humid afternoon up a rutted and overgrown logging road, the sky mostly sealed off by a canopy of tree branches, sunlight leaking through dense greenery in elongated shafts. The hike up Dents Run is not quite a half mile long, but the six representatives of Finders Keepers LLC, a Pennsylvania-based treasure-hunting business, string out as climbers on Everest. Co-owner Denny Parada, 69, brings up the rear, hobbling a bit and breathing forcefully. He’s wearing a Finders Keepers polo and a camo baseball cap and shorts and has a handgun strapped to his hip. “Snakes,” he’d explained.\n\nDents Run is an unincorporated community in Benezette Township in rural Elk County, in northwestern Pennsylvania. We’re on a wooded slope, one knobby vertebra among thousands along the spine of the Appalachians. The overgrown road we’re ascending, known locally as Snooks Trail, is a lingering scar from a decades-old logging operation, though most recently it has served as the access point to Parada’s lifelong obsession.\n\nAbout halfway up, Denny’s 37-year-old son and business partner, Kem, hollers and points. An elk is perched on a steep slope above the trail, 50 feet up. It stands unmoving, staring us down, as the group stops to gaze back. A few of us snap photos and turn uphill; the elk stays locked on us as we trudge away.\n\nAnyone who is inclined to anthropomorphize might infer some type of omen in this. Dents Run has an enigmatic history—a lump of new-growth forest that’s unremarkable in every way, except that it birthed a tale of, among other things, a psychic, a cache of buried gold, Confederate sympathizers, an army of FBI agents, and a furtive overnight dig.\n\nOnce we reach our destination, Parada points to the slender cave opening that first propelled his quest, and the location maybe 15 yards away where four years ago the FBI authorized a sizable excavation. Parada is a paunchy nub of a man with a gray mustache and goatee. He uses an early-aughts-style flip phone and chews tobacco. His recitations of his exploits blend boyish wonder with the copious f-bombs of a case-hardened cynic. At the moment, he’s describing the extensive testing he did on this very ground to confirm the presence of gold.\n\n“I just think beyond any other treasure hunters,” he says, “because… I’m not going to claim I’m smart, but I do more experiments than anybody.”\n\nAs he speaks, Dwayne Kelly, a member of Parada’s entourage of full-timers, part-timers, and volunteers, is circling a nearby slope with dowsing rods. Parada describes Kelly as a kind of savant with this ancient if scientifically debunked method of searching for underground metal.\n\n“I need everybody’s opinion here,” Kelly says. The rest of the group clusters around him.\n\n“He’s finding something,” Denny notes, but then continues with his recounting of events from years earlier. Before he gets much further, Warren Getler splits away and joins us. Getler is the group’s default scholar, an expert in geophysics and buried Civil War treasure. “We think there’s something going on,” he says. “Look at the similarity to this up there. And look, the potential tunnel right there. We’re getting a strong signal.”\n\nThey begin scanning the site with a Discovery Treasure-Finder 900, a metal detector capable of locating objects as deep as 12 feet underground. Denny ejects a wad of Skoal-tinted saliva. “Dwayne, what did you do?” he shouts in mock exasperation, holding his arms wide.\n\n“I’m making you rich, buddy,” Kelly calls back.\n\n“He does this constantly to me,” Parada says.\n\nLater, he says, grinning, “You’re actually on a treasure hunt. I didn’t expect this to happen.”\n\nIt’s maybe the most surprising thing he’s said all day. This is Parada’s stock in trade, after all, and his adventures on Dents Run have gained traction in newspapers and on television worldwide. But treasure hunting is the longest of long games, and whether Kelly has actually found anything will not be determined today—or, most likely, anytime soon.\n\nAs with just about everything Parada gets involved with, the answers are tantalizingly close—just a few feet below ground—but just out of reach.\n\nThe drama at Dents Run started, as these stories do, with a fortuitous meeting. It was March 1974. Denny Parada, a native of nearby Philipsburg and a recent graduate of commercial-art school, had taken a job at a W.T. Grant department store, but his passions lay elsewhere. His grandmother was an antiques dealer, and he was fascinated with old objects, including a mysterious river stone he’d found as a child and kept. He thought it might be a Native American artifact. “I always loved this kind of stuff—historical stuff,” he says.\n\nIn his 20s, Parada bought treasure-hunting magazines and, during idle weekend hours, began sleuthing the mysteries they posed. One article in particular caught his attention because it was fascinating, and it was local: the legend of Dents Run gold.\n\nThe story has tentacled off in various ways over generations of retellings, and details have been added or amended over time. But the essence of the saga, as recounted in a 2019 Mt. Zion Historical Society booklet, remains the same. In 1863, the U.S. government’s War Department authorized a shipment of 50-pound gold bars—26 in all—from San Francisco to the Philadelphia Mint to finance the war effort. To avoid Confederate activity, the supply wagons carrying the gold were diverted from a route across southern Pennsylvania into the hilly, forested north. Following the advice of a local guide, the commander, Lt. James Castleton, and his sergeant, Mike O’Rourke, attempted a shortcut over the mountains using an 1842 map titled “Wildcat Country.”\n\nThings quickly went sideways. The logging road they were on led to a trail junction that wasn’t shown on the map. They picked the most promising option, but that petered out, leaving them to navigate a wilderness of tall virgin pines. Eventually they encountered a steep hillside that the wagons couldn’t navigate. The decision was made to send for help, pack out as much gold as possible, and bury the rest.\n\nMost of the men went missing, and the gold never arrived in Philadelphia. Pinkerton detectives who were dispatched to investigate never recovered the cache (although they did find two and a half bars). The National Archives holds no record of the shipment, but the legend of the lost gold “has captivated the attention of thousands of people over the past 150 years,” the historical society reports. And waves of fresh ambition, fortified by the forward march of metal-detecting technology, have continually fueled new searches.\n\nDennis Parada was just another dreaming amateur in 1974 when his employer hired Michael Malley—who performed at the time as the psychic Professor M.G. Malley—to present a “delightfully entertaining ESP presentation.” Parada missed the presentation during his shift in the furniture department. He thought the notion of a psychic was ridiculous anyway.\n\nHe was on his lunch break when Malley wandered by. Parada brandished a copy of Treasure Magazine with the Dents Run story, so one of his colleagues asked Malley whether he could help locate the gold. “What I’m about to tell you next,” Parada says of this encounter, would “change our lives forever.”\n\nMalley ran a finger over the article while Parada stood behind him thinking, What a bunch of bullshit. But Malley then went into a trance and began speaking in voices—Parada believes they were soldiers who’d lost the fateful gold shipment. Malley picked up the atlas Parada had with him, and with eyes looking toward the ceiling, brought a pen down on a spot where he instructed Parada to go. Later, using a soil sample Parada had collected, Malley told him to look for a cave entrance.\n\nParada became a believer, but the search ran aground when he was unable to locate the cave. He became preoccupied with life—opening several businesses, including an antique-furniture store, and raising a family. But he never forgot Dents Run; Kem, born in 1985, grew up hearing bedtime stories about that gold.\n\nFast-forward 30 years. It’s 2004, and Denny is sitting in a bar watching TV with a friend, Scott Farrell. The show is about treasure hunting, and it reminds him of Dents Run. Farrell asks Parada whether he wants to take another look. Soon afterward, they hike up the hill and Parada waves in the direction of the purported cave. Before he gets far looking further uphill, Farrell yells that he found something. “Don’t joke with me, Scott,” Denny calls back.\n\nBut Farrell (who has since died) had found it: a horizontal slit of an entrance on the slope below the logging road, just wide enough for a person to crawl in. Parada surmises that work crews had inadvertently sealed over the entrance when constructing the road, and erosion over subsequent decades had opened it back up. A trickle of water leaked from the opening.\n\nInside the grotto, Parada says, they found a hand-built wall of stacked stones. Their flashlight beams played over scorch marks on the ceiling, apparently from a torch. They later discovered Civil War-era bullets and other artifacts nearby, adding to their suspicion that troops had visited the site during the conflict.\n\nMalley had advised them that the cave was 32 feet deep. The stacked-stone wall was at 15 feet, but later Kem Parada was able to remove enough stones to find a second chamber behind it—and that one was also 15 feet deep. At the back of that chamber they located a shaft, but further excavation posed too much of a cave-in risk, so they backed off. The cave was muddy and damp—a claustrophobe’s nightmare—but the Paradas were exultant, feeling they were close to finding something, possibly the mythical cache of gold. Focusing on the ground above, they investigated further using a metal-detecting device called a GPL 200. (GPL stands for “ground penetrating locator.”) The user embeds stakes connected by wire around a plot of ground. By pulsing electrical current through the stakes, the device gauges the presence of metals and minerals below, based on how strongly the underground elements oppose—or “resist,” in geophysical terms—the charge. Gold, silver, and copper are highly conductive, so the lower the resistivity reading, the higher the odds that they’ve been discovered.\n\nThe Paradas’ GPL revealed a highly conductive metal mass just off to one side of the underground chamber. They also tested the site using ground-penetrating radar. That device emits radio frequencies into the earth’s surface, which then either bounce back or are absorbed, depending on what they encounter. To estimate what lies beneath, the device’s computer calculates the signal strength of the reflected radio waves and the amount of time they took to bounce back.\n\nIn 2010, the Paradas hired Terence Hamill, founder and chief geophysicist of GeoSearches Inc., an Ohio-based firm specializing in subsurface geophysical surveys. Hamill detected “a large metallic anomaly at depth, differentiated from the surrounding geology,” reinforcing Parada’s suspicion that something was there. “We could see that there was something completely different down there, and it could well be precious,” Hamill says.\n\nOver the next nine years, Denny and Kem Parada visited Dents Run about 300 times, capturing more than 100 readings. Kem says the results were unmistakable: “It all screamed gold at this same location.”\n\nWhen they’d first found the cave entrance, the Paradas had been hobbyists—guys out hunting for treasure on weekends and during their spare hours. The site is on state land overseen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and DCNR officials initially seemed unfazed by their activities, signing off on everything they asked to do short of sinking shovels into earth. “They kind of just let us do our thing,” Kem says.\n\nEventually the Paradas became such a regular presence at Dents Run that state officials sent them a letter identifying them as professional treasure hunters. The Paradas embraced the classification by forming Finders Keepers.\n\nBolstered by this veneer of legitimacy, they began to more intensively explore the question of whether they had actually struck gold. They secured permission from the DCNR to drill bore holes from above with non-commercial-grade equipment. “We basically spent years Swiss-cheesing this mountaintop,” Kem says.\n\nAs they drilled their 16th hole, the bit stopped about five and a half feet down. This was odd, because they were typically exploring as far as 12 feet down. They switched out their three-quarter-inch masonry drill bit for a one-inch bit, and Denny switched the machine onto high speed and put all his weight into it. The bit sent up a squealing sound—metal on metal, he says—and stopped dead. He shut the drill down to let it cool, but when he returned after lunch, the bit was so firmly wedged into something that it took two and a half days to extract it.\n\nWhen he finally retrieved the bit, yellowish smears were melted onto the end—a “gold shine,” as he puts it, though there was no way to test for it. At this point anyone would be sorely tempted to just start shoveling earth, but they were committed to doing things by the book. On November 1, 2010, Denny asked the DCNR for permission to drill a two-inch hole into the location and drop a camera inside. This time the answer was no. An official said they needed “to see gold metal on a drill bit in sufficient quantity to convince us” that such invasive procedures were warranted.\n\nThat was when things started to get weird. They’d been leaving their equipment at the site—including a generator and metal detectors—but someone began taking pieces of gear, including trail cameras hanging from trees, GPL stakes, and an extension cord. But the thieves missed one camera, and the images from it stunned Parada: The people removing his equipment were uniformed DCNR personnel. Parada demanded that his gear be returned, and over the course of several heated exchanges, his relationship with the state agency became adversarial. Parada even found evidence that he believes shows that people attached to the agency conducted their own dig on the site, though not in the place he had identified as holding the cache.\n\nThis escalation brought steep consequences. In 2014, the DCNR sent a certified letter demanding that the Paradas cease all activity there. “Once we drove down and hit the gold and had them on site, that’s when things changed,” Denny says. “It’s just big government bureaucratic stuff that pisses me off.”\n\nThat summer, the Paradas took a meeting with a staff member of the Pennsylvania legislature who offered to facilitate a dig permit. The person (whom the Paradas decline to name) claimed to be acting on behalf of individuals in state government—someone who controlled money going to DCNR, and someone working in the governor’s office. But there was a condition: The Paradas had to kick back three gold bars, or 12 percent of the haul, Denny says. He captured the incident on video, and the Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, reported the incident to the FBI, but no one was ever charged.\n\nFrustrated and stymied by the DCNR ban, the Paradas turned to other projects. More than four years passed, and they might have eventually forsaken Dents Run. But then, in November 2017, Denny’s phone rang.\n\nWarren Getler had come across the Paradas’ Dents Run adventure on a treasure-hunting online bulletin board. He was instantly intrigued. Getler had worked as a journalist for the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News, among other outlets, and had coauthored a book, Rebel Gold, about the Knights of the Golden Circle. The KGC, he told Denny, was a quasi-military secret society that took hold in the South and Midwest during the Civil War. Its founders opposed the abolitionist movement and sought to create a new slave-owning nation that encompassed the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean as a counterweight to the North. Operatives looted Union shipments to raise money for the cause, and then stashed plundered gold and silver in various locations around the country. Getler says many of those caches remain intact today—and he told Parada he believed the Dents Run gold was stolen by a KGC-affiliated group in the North called the Copperheads.\n\nGetler opined that while there was likely gold at Dents Run, the fable associated with its presence there is apocryphal. The gold was likely stolen and hidden there, he said, and the story of the lost supply wagons is, in part, a KGC “waybill”—a cryptic, coded message meant to indicate the location of a cache to insiders.\n\nThe Getler-Parada alliance formed with the suddenness and intensity of a thunderclap. They talked nearly every night for the next two months, and came to a powerful realization: Getler’s narrative gave them another avenue for pursuing the treasure. If the gold bars had come from the U.S. Mint, they were federal property. And the Feds could invoke eminent domain in order to dig on state land.\n\nGetler eventually left journalism to join a tech startup that focused on geophysics and subsurface target detection in Washington, D.C. He knew that the electrical-resistivity-sensing equipment Denny was using had certain limitations because the Dents Run soil contained high clay and water content. But the possibilities were compelling—so much so that he offered to arrange a meeting with the FBI to explore a possible gold recovery at the Pennsylvania site.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, the Paradas met Getler in Philadelphia. They ate slices of pizza together, then headed to the U.S. Attorney’s office, where they met two agents from the bureau’s Art Crime Team and an assistant U.S. attorney. The agents spent an hour listening and looking over the Paradas’ stuff. They were initially skeptical, Denny says, “but when I showed them what I had”—including various instrument readings—“they were more convinced.” Getler provided a colloquium on the KGC.\n\nWhen they’d finished, Special Agent Jake Archer told them, “I just want to be clear. If the gold is there, it’s ours. We are going to seize it.”\n\nDenny answered that he would request a finder’s fee, and Archer didn’t object. The agent also indicated that the three men could be on site if the government decided to dig. The next day, Archer called looking for directions, and the Paradas provided detailed GPS coordinates.\n\nOn January 31, the Paradas and Getler met a contingent of seven FBI agents led by Archer at a restaurant near Dents Run. Heading there, Kem noticed an unmarked SUV that appeared to be a law enforcement vehicle following them. He’d been a cop for nine years and knew everyone in the area, and he didn’t recognize it. “It was creepy,” he says.\n\nThe Paradas led the contingent up snow-draped Dents Run, where they generated readings from their GPL 200. They reproduced the test away from the target site, to show the contrast in readings. The agents conducted their own examination using a TF-900 metal detector, and then talked about what kind of earth-moving equipment would be necessary for an excavation.\n\nHicks Run Road, which provides access to the site, is a sparsely populated dirt lane. Garrett Osche lives closest to the site, on a property at the base of the mountain called Pine Valley Camp, which his family has owned for more than 80 years. Osche has tousled gray hair and piercing blue eyes and wore a camouflage shirt with cutoff sleeves. Over the years he’d become friendly with the Paradas, so he allowed the agents to park and change their clothes in his heated garage. When they came down the hill that day, they seemed excited. “They were chirping like a bunch of chickens,” Osche says. Archer, aware of Osche’s presence, shut them down, saying, “We’ll talk about this at the office.”\n\nGetler encouraged Archer to dive deeper into the science of underground detection before planning a dig. He suggested handheld EM-31 and GEM-2 units; these electromagnetic devices have been deployed by the U.S. military in Iraq to locate IEDs and tunnels. The other choice, even more ideal, was a gravimeter—a heavy, boxlike system that calculates the size, weight, and mass of underground objects. It works by comparing an object’s density to the soil in which it sits, and then feeding the data into a software algorithm that spits out analyses in the form of heat maps. The device shows clear contrasts between precious metals and regular soil. Gold, for example, would score a density reading of 18 or 19, whereas sedimentary rock would measure around 2.3. “You can get a pretty accurate depth reading to the center of an object,” Getler says. “It’s very accurate and very sensitive.”\n\nGetler recommended several geophysics companies that could conduct tests, and the bureau chose Enviroscan Inc., a respected firm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with more than 25 years in business, to conduct a gravimeter survey. Enviroscan’s principal geophysicist was Dr. Tim Bechtel, who in 2020 would be awarded the prestigious Public Service Award by the Geological Society of America. Four FBI agents returned on February 23 with an Enviroscan team, and with the Paradas looking on in a bone-cold, heavy downpour, the crew festooned the site with about 60 marker flags and logged more than 50 readings over two-foot increments.\n\nDuring a three-way call with Denny Parada and Getler several days later, Archer delivered Enviroscan’s findings: The gravimeter showed a mass with a density of 18 to 19—a result that indicated gold. And no small amount, either: The estimate was seven to nine tons. This was far more than the 26 gold bars from the Dents Run legend, which combined would have weighed only 1,300 pounds.\n\nParada’s mind reeled. Getler began bellowing. Nine tons of gold would be the largest land-based treasure in U.S. history—a haul worth $400 million to $600 million. The finding reinforced Getler’s theory that the site was an underground Copperhead depository.\n\nArcher said the FBI intended to get a warrant to excavate the site. He asked Denny and Kem to hide more cameras up there, and to check on the site as often as possible. Just over a week later, on March 10, Archer called again with news: The dig would happen in three days.\n\nThe FBI had worked quickly. Citing the Enviroscan findings and Getler’s historical research, the bureau on March 9 had obtained a federal warrant to dig up the hillside. Archer had written an affidavit stating there was “probable cause to believe that, in a cave on the Dents Run Site, approximately one or more tons of gold belonging to, and stolen from, the United States Mint… are secreted.” In signing the warrant, U.S. Magistrate Judge Richard Lloret had asserted the federal government’s power to push aside the state of Pennsylvania in a quest to reclaim gold that had been lost 155 years earlier. Archer wrote that he wanted to dig in secret, because tipping off state officials “could result in unlawful seizure of the stolen United States gold as abandoned property.” The federal government wanted to grab the gold before Pennsylvania could.\n\nThe affidavit is a fascinating 32-page document. Archer consulted experts from the National Archives, U.S. Mint, and other historical sites. He cited the lack of naturally occurring precious metals in the area, and spelled out the scientific rationale for a dig. The affidavit also reports the incident in which a Pennsylvania official dangled a dig permit in exchange for gold bars, and bores deeply into Dents Run mythology, adopting Getler’s theory that the Knights of the Golden Circle left waybills, codes, and symbols such as circles, rising suns, and turtles on rocks and trees to guide people to caches. Getler said the rock formation above the cave entrance looked like a turtle shell—and turtles are among the most important KGC symbols for gold. Citing the purported leaders of the ill-fated supply wagons in the Dents Run legend, Archer wrote, “It is very likely that Castleton and O’Rourke are fake names, and are in fact, code (Castle and Rook), with Castleton clearly being used as a pointer, as ‘castle’ was the key organizing unit of this secret subversive organization and ‘rook’ was a local unit of that organization.” Although this sounds like a passage lifted from a Dan Brown novel, the KGC is a documented part of the historical record of the era.\n\nHistory aside, Dents Run would have remained a sleepy and largely forgotten fold in the Pennsylvania hills without the Paradas, a team of untrained but hell-bent enthusiasts who had stalked the slopes for more than a decade, lugging equipment purchased at hardware stores. Their business name is taken from a childhood taunt, and their logo looks like a 1960s-style Looney Tunes creation. Stranger still? To this day, Denny credits Mike Malley, the ESP performer, with enabling the discovery—and has offered Malley a quarter of any funds he might receive for the gold.\n\nFor his part, Malley, now 82 and living in western Pennsylvania, says the show he performed for 22 years consisted entirely of staged illusions. “I certainly don’t call myself a psychic,” Malley says. “I don’t believe in psychics.”\n\nStill, on “very rare” instances—once every couple of decades—Malley says he’s able to intuit something. “It’s a certain feeling,” he says. “It’s like, somebody [asks] you, ‘Is it rainy outside?’ And you look outside—yeah, it’s raining. And you’re that certain of it. I can’t explain it.”\n\nMalley, who left show business in the 1980s to sell life insurance and annuities, seems genuinely at a loss to make sense of the Dent Run episode. But he says he’s been able to intuit information about the site on multiple occasions with Parada—starting when Denny handed him the magazine and atlas.\n\nOn the hourlong drive from their home base in Clearfield, Denny and Kem had the opportunity to contemplate the remarkable nature of everything that had happened up to that point. They were with Getler in Kem’s Mazda hatchback, because Archer had ordered them to travel incognito—no vehicles bearing the Finders Keepers logo. But when they arrived, Archer told them to stay in the car—the dig site was too crowded, and as a result too hazardous, to have them standing around.\n\nThe three men took in the scene through the Mazda windshield. The previous day, Kem had gone to check on the site and was surprised to see FBI agents already there. Now 25 vehicles sat at the base of the hill, along with four ATVs, a cargo truck, and a satellite van. At least 50 agents ringed the site’s perimeter. A staging area had been erected, including a green tent housing a command center. Portable toilets had been trucked in. They would later learn that the FBI had hired a local archeologist to provide expertise.\n\n“There was FBI all over that mountain,” Kem says. “It blew our minds.”\n\nHours crawled by with the three men pinned inside the Mazda. Archer stopped by occasionally to tell them to sit tight, saying they’d be able to hike up the mountain soon, but they grew increasingly impatient. When a local TV reporter showed up, agents hustled the trio inside the tent so they couldn’t talk.\n\nFinally, around 3 p.m., Archer led them to where the Paradas had spent countless hours over the years, many of them crawling in mud. About 30 agents wearing blue “FBI Evidence Response Team” jackets stood around a Kobelko excavator. Over the next hour, the machine dug down about seven feet before Archer called things to a halt.\n\nAs the Paradas and Getler recount, Archer said everyone was cold and hungry. “We’ve been here all day working; we’re gonna pack it up for the night,” the agent said. Archer instructed them to return at 8 a.m.\n\nThe three men were surprised, because there was plenty of daylight left. When they returned the next morning under a thin snowfall, Archer reported a glitch: The hole had filled with water, and they needed to check with the DCNR about potential environmental impacts. Once again, the Paradas and Getler were confined to their car, and the mood on the site shifted. Agents who’d previously been friendly barked at them, shooing them from the tent they’d taken shelter in the day before.\n\nAfter another five-hour-plus wait, Archer returned to again take them up the hill. The Paradas and Getler hustled from the car, excitement overriding their irritation—at last, they were about to see the results of their years of work. But Archer seemed downcast, as did the phalanx of agents who ringed the site. FBI personnel who had chatted amiably with them the previous day were stone-faced.\n\nThe Paradas and Getler took in the scene. The hole was free of water and mud, and had been dug 12 or 13 feet deep and about 25 feet wide. Archer asked Denny what he saw. The hole was empty. Parada replied, “I don’t see anything.”\n\nArcher announced, “That’s it, people, there’s nothing here, let’s go home,” Parada recalls. “I say, ‘No, wait a second. There’s nothing here now. It doesn’t mean there wasn’t something here yesterday or the day before. You’re the one that told me nine tons.’”\n\nParada was shouting. “You’re the one that wouldn’t let my guys up here while the dig happened,” he said. “You wouldn’t let us bring equipment.”\n\nAfter Denny vented, Archer ushered them downhill. Denny turned and asked him: “Did you or did you not find gold?\"\n\nThe agent refused to answer. Instead, Kem recalls, “Archer looked at the three of us and said, ‘I’m telling you right now, you don’t go to the media. You don’t put anything on Facebook. You put nothing online. You say nothing to nobody.’ He said, ‘If you do, there’ll be serious repercussions.’ And then he pointed at me and said, ‘and you got your law enforcement career to worry about.’”\n\nAnd with that, they were dismissed. Back at the car, Getler says, “I was literally in a state of shock.”\n\nThey couldn’t make sense of it. Their own extensive testing, and tests conducted by two professional outside firms, all showed the presence of a highly conductive and very dense mass—and even if it wasn’t gold, it was something. “I’ve been in this business too long,” Parada says. “You can have a false reading… If they would have pulled out some scrap metal of any kind, I wouldn’t question it. But to tell me nothing was found? No.”\n\nGetler observed: “When you do 50 scans with a very sensitive and precise gravimeter in five-foot increments, it’s a virtual geophysical fingerprint at that point.”\n\nWhen the Paradas returned a couple of days later with their GPL 200, the mass they had detected scores of times no longer turned up in their readings. The machine showed nothing at all.\n\nThat was eerie enough. Then they began to encounter people in nearby Weedville and Benezette, all of whom asked versions of the same question: “Did you see the armored trucks?”\n\nCheryl Elder knows what she heard.\n\nAs a resident who lives below the dig site, Elder had watched as dozens of federal vehicles rolled past and parked adjacent to her property. At 62, she’d never seen anything like it, and she’s lived her whole life in Elk County, the last 30 years in Dents Run. She served as constable for 20-plus years and had heard about the lost gold since she was a girl; her son had searched the hills with a metal detector.\n\nThe first full day they were there, she says, “I walked up, I was like, ‘What’s going on here?’ You know, you have FBI guys everywhere with their vests and guns and everything—they were guarding it. And he said, ‘Oh, nothing to worry about.’ I said, ‘Well, I live right here, I’m not worried. I mean, there’s enough FBI guys around here—why in the hell would I be worried?’”\n\nOn the night of March 13—in the hours after the FBI had sent the Paradas and Getler home—lights flooded the hillside, and Elder heard heavy work on the slope above: the sounds of a backhoe backing up, the rattling of a jackhammer. “They were digging all night up on that hill,” she says, sitting in her living room. “They had it so lit up that it looked like a city.”\n\nIn the middle of the night Elder called her husband, who was out of town. “I can’t sleep,” she told him. She was awake until nearly 3 a.m.\n\nWhen the FBI pulled out the next afternoon, agents blocked the road. A series of black Hummer-type armored vehicles passed, and in contrast to when they’d arrived, agents ordered her inside her house. She defiantly watched from her garage. “I just stood there with my dog watching them,” she says, “like, what are you gonna do, shoot me?”\n\nElder was baffled to hear the FBI’s claim that the search came up empty. “If they didn’t find anything, then why?” she says. “What was the big deal? Why would you have guards there?”\n\n“I know they found that gold,” she says.\n\nOther residents noticed unusual traffic on March 14 as well. Heather Selle of nearby Weedville told the Paradas that she saw armored cars around 8:30 a.m. as she loaded her child off to school. The vehicles looked like Lenco BearCat-type vehicles, capable of carrying more than two tons of cargo. A local cop called Kem to report that he’d watched armored vehicles, supported by two Humvees and a satellite truck, driving west on Route 555 from near Dents Run at about 10 a.m.\n\nAt Valley Farm Market in Weedville, various employees noticed FBI vehicles parked in an adjacent vacant lot for much of the day, and FBI personnel frequented the store. The shop, which features a variety of model trains and mounted deer heads, is the town’s nerve center.\n\nEmployee Mary Hogan says the FBI seemed to be mobilizing several armored vehicles. “It was an absolute circus in the vacant lot,” she says. “Why were they going through all this rigmarole if nothing was found?”\n\nGarrett Osche also noticed that the authorities had blocked roads in and out of Dents Run that day. “You don’t shut this road down… for two to three hours to send five armored trucks out of here that have nothing in ’em,” he says. The agents, he says, were “very sneaky about it, to put it mildly… As far as I’m concerned, this totally ruined my trust in the FBI.”\n\nGetler and the Paradas believe the vehicles’ movements were orchestrated. In the morning, the armored trucks that witnesses spotted came in after the three men had arrived at Dents Run. They think the vehicles circled around behind them to nearby Hicks Run, where the gold had been stored in SUVs overnight. “They were timing us to know when we’d be off the road so that those armored cars would come in behind us,” Getler says.\n\nThe vehicles waiting at Valley Farm Market were brought in to move the rest late in the afternoon, after the trio had been sent home. “This was done with military precision,” Getler asserts.\n\nThe developments left the rural town scandalized. “This is where we live,” Cheryl Elder says. “I mean, I’ve lived here all my life… How dare they?”\n\nThe worst part, she says—beyond how the Paradas were treated—is the lack of closure. “You’re going to take the gold, but give us the story,” Elder says. “Let us have the final version of what happened here. We grew up with this legend—this myth. Maybe it was real. At least tell us.”\n\nThe FBI issued a terse 44-word statement after the dig that stated, in part, “Nothing was found, and the excavation ended on Wednesday, March 14.” The bureau has said nothing further publicly ever since.\n\nAn FBI spokeswoman refused to make Archer available for questions. “Nothing was found in the excavation,” she declared via email. “The FBI unequivocally rejects any claims or speculation to the contrary. We’ll decline further comment.”\n\nBut the question of what happened on that hill has acquired its own gravitational pull. Emotions run high when people are short on facts. The Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, filed a Freedom of Information request in May 2018 seeking records pertaining to the dig. The FBI initially responded that no such records exist, but later—after Cluck enlisted the help of U.S. Senator Pat Toomey—the bureau conceded that it possesses 2,378 pages of records and 17 CDs of videos. The file is so voluminous that the records won’t be processed for release until around March 2024. In January, Anne Weissman, an attorney who specializes in government transparency and accountability, filed a lawsuit on the Paradas’ behalf, seeking to accelerate the process.\n\nCluck also submitted an open-records request to Pennsylvania’s DCNR, and learned that on the day before the dig, Assistant U.S. Attorney K.T. Newton had emailed DCNR counsel to convey details about the dig. “We believe the cache itself is in the neighborhood of 3x5x8 or 5x5x8,” she wrote.\n\nNewton says the FBI was going with the best information it had at the time—that based on the results of all the testing and surveying, “it was believed that this was the size of the cache. The best we could do was use the best scientific evidence available to us at the time for probable cause: ‘This is what we believe to be there.’”\n\nShe says that turned out to be inaccurate. “The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office would have been more than happy and delighted if we had uncovered what we thought was there, but nothing was found.”\n\nFor the Paradas, surreality pervaded the dig’s aftermath. Maybe the most bizarre footnote: The night the FBI packed up and moved out, Michael Malley, the psychic performer, called Parada to say that he’d intuited something. Both Parada and Getler recall Malley telling them, “They’re moving nine tons of gold out of the country.”\n\nThe next day, news broke that part of a shipment of 9.3 tons of gold had fallen from a cargo plane on a runway in Siberia. According to the reports, nearly 200 bars had come from a mine operated by the Canada-based Kinross Gold Corporation—whose initials happen to be KGC. It was almost certainly just a coincidence, Parada says, but it was still indelibly strange.\n\nThe key question the treasure hunters want answered is this: How did several different scientific instruments that are staples in the geophysics industry—most specifically the gravimeter—all produce false readings? Newton was unable to account for the discrepancy. “We hire reputable companies, the testing is done, this is what the results are,” she says. “It’s never guaranteed. It’s always within—I don’t even know what the reasonable probabilities are—but we can only base it on what the testing tells us. As to what the science is and how that’s done, I am not a geologist.”\n\nThe perpetual questions about what happened are troubling, she says. “It is disturbing for us to have this still being put out there, that somehow the FBI is lying about this—that somehow this huge amount of gold was found, and we managed to spirit it out of that location in the middle of the night,” she says. “What better outcome for us than to say, ‘Look what was found,’ right? As opposed to, for some reason, this allegedly is somehow secreted away somewhere. I can’t figure out what possibly anybody would gain from that.”\n\nWhen I suggest that opening the FBI records might resolve the matter, Newton disagrees. “We unsealed the affidavit, we laid out the basis for what we thought was there, and… there was nothing found,” she says. “So I don’t know what else needs to be put out in the public record on this.”\n\nThe Paradas’ lawyers disagree. “I can’t believe (FBI officials) haven’t bothered to issue a report to the federal court,” Bill Cluck says. “They haven’t bothered to get back to the companies whose equipment was used. Because frankly, I practice environmental law, and I’m not going to trust Enviroscan and this equipment now that I know it doesn’t necessarily work.”\n\nEnviroscan, unfortunately, is barred from defending itself or elaborating on its findings. “We are under quite a strict gag order,” founder Timothy Bechtel replied to an email seeking comment. “I am to direct all inquiries to Agent Jake Archer of the FBI.”\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the issue of the Paradas’ unreimbursed years of work on Dents Run. Cluck says Pennsylvania is the only state that lacks a definitive supreme court decision on treasure troves, and his research indicates that by common law, Finders Keepers has a right to petition federal courts “for their fair share [of the gold], if it was found.” Parada wants a 10 percent finder’s fee—$40 million to $60 million—and he believes a confirmed finding of gold would bring book and movie rights to his story.\n\nBut Parada says money is only part of the equation. Despite the business name he chose, Parada isn’t looking to possess any of his discoveries; he wants various finds returned to their rightful owners, if possible. If gold buried at Dents Run bore the markings of the U.S. Mint, he accepts that it’s government property. And when he leans away from the specifics of Dents Run in his mind, he sees something bigger: Malley’s help, along with other unspecified supernatural occurrences he declines to elaborate on, have convinced him that spirits of the departed help guide his efforts. He believes they want “somebody to come around to find these things and make sure they go to the right place. If souls that have crossed over are helping us, that means there’s an afterlife, and that’s a good thing.\n\n“I know it sounds crazy,” he adds after a beat. “But this is my life.”\n\nMalley feels conflicted about his role in what he characterizes as a borderline unhealthy quest. He’s suggested to Parada multiple times that he let Dents Run go. “It became an obsession, in my mind, of him going after (the gold),” Malley says. “I mean, no matter how hard I tried to talk him out of it, he wouldn’t budge… I said, ‘Dennis, this is too consuming for you; it’s not going to go anywhere.’ And he said, ‘I can’t stop now, Mike.’”\n\nThe layers of irony are unfathomably rich: Parada became convinced of psychic powers—and was propelled in his quest—by a performer who doesn’t believe in psychic powers. And he embraced the FBI in order to solve his life’s biggest mystery—and wound up with an even bigger one. Before, Parada was merely looking for the X that marks the spot; now, the answer resides inside a hall of mirrors—the treasure there but not there, seemingly receding further from him the closer he gets.\n\nParada’s unselfconsciousness through it all is both unsettling and disarming. He’s able to stand apart from his narrative, observe how absurdly unlikely it is, and then use that awareness to argue even more convincingly on his own behalf. Most people in his situation would cave in to exasperated uncertainty; his adversity and lived experience has only ripened into deeper conviction. He has no trouble reconciling the life that he’s lived to the one he imagines. His redemption could always be just a few shovelfuls of dirt away.\n\n“All I want is credit for solving these mysteries,” he says. “So many people have died for those treasures to be there. It’s not ours. The last thing we’d ever do is dig something up and put it in our pocket and never tell anybody. More than anything, I want the truth to come out. I wanna know where that gold went to.”\n\nThe good news for the Paradas is that they always have a new mission.\n\nThe day after visiting Dents Run in summer 2021, the Paradas and Getler take me to another site they’re investigating nearby. After the FBI dig, Denny received a call from a man who had grown up in an area known for harboring unidentified mounds and Civil War-era artifacts.\n\nExploring the site, the Finders Keepers team discovered what they believe are bullets, belt buckles from Union uniforms, and parts of a limber wagon, a two-wheeled cart that carried ammunition and artillery. They also found Knights of the Golden Circle symbols, including a circular stone carved in the shape of a Native American headdress similar to what appears on a copperhead penny. One of the team also found a “turtle rock”—a stone with an image of a turtle on it. Unfurling the map beforehand, Getler points to the spot. “That’s a turtle, no question,” he says. “If you read my book, the turtle always points to the treasure.” Getler also located a waybill—a KGC coded map—that matches certain features of the area.\n\nThe group returned with their array of detection equipment and located more underground metal masses and what appeared, on their instruments, to be a tunnel. Measuring off distances, they created a massive hand-drawn map. These efforts yielded an astonishingly far-reaching theory: They believe they’ve located a buried KGC garrison. Fifteen feet underground, they say, is essentially a military base the size of three football fields. Numerous tunnels lead to as many as 21 chambers potentially harboring Civil War cannons, arms, ammunition, and more. “I think every wagon they hijacked for gold or supplies, they brought back to this camp and buried them all,” Denny says.\n\nIf they’re correct about what they call Copperhead Central, they believe the site will rewrite history books. They theorize that it was the secret rendezvous point for General Robert E. Lee and his troops in late spring 1863—to collect looted gold and link up with KGC militia—when they fatefully ran into Union forces at Gettysburg. “If this is right,” Getler says, “you’re on to the biggest story you could ever imagine in terms of how outrageously wild it is.”\n\nBack in Clearfield, in the low-slung, tucked-away home that serves as the Finders Keepers headquarters, the three men unfold their map, several square feet in area, onto which they’ve overlaid a transparency showing the theoretical KGC compound. Items from Denny’s years of exploration, many of them rusty and crumbling, cover nearly every horizontal surface. A New York Times story about Finders Keepers, which includes a photo of Parada, hangs on the wall.\n\nAs with Dents Run, the Paradas are endeavoring to gird their towering theories with a scientific foundation. They’ve hired a New Jersey outfit, American Geophysics Inc., to scan the location using ground-penetrating radar and an EM-31. On the first of two days at the site, two members of the American Geophysics crew walk the site, flagging the ground at locations indicated by Parada and Getler. Then they scan it with their gear, which includes a 12-foot boom.\n\nGetler and the Paradas buzz with anticipation—but they’re also aware that the science may reveal gaps between their ironclad convictions and the reality of what lies underground.\n\nDCNR District Forester Douglas D’Amore, for one, is expecting the team of treasure hunters to leave the site disappointed. D’Amore is on site, watching and taking photographs, to ensure that the activity conforms to approved activities—scanning, but no digging. Parada regales him with earnest, bubbling-over theories about Copperhead Central, but D’Amore no-sells the pitch, standing with his body angled away and avoiding eye contact. Later, D’Amore offers a detailed alternative theory: Whatever lies underground on the site is far more likely the result of logging operations that were based there.\n\nIt’s not hard to channel D’Amore’s skepticism, trudging among the trees. The surroundings feel like one unremarkable patch of woods among hundreds of square miles of them. And the dynamic between the Paradas and Getler could be read as endlessly looping confirmation bias. Then there’s the zealous embrace of the supernatural and the unreconstructed use of dowsing rods. Yet everyone involved—Denny most of all—argues their case with the ferocity of a true believer. And in his contempt for government interference, Denny tends to characterize any bureaucratic speed bump —for example, the DCNR’s environmental permitting requirements—as evidence of persecution and obstruction.\n\nTheir collective quest exists inside the space where the supernatural meets science, ardent belief meets cold reality, and heat maps meet hard earth. They see themselves as an unstoppable force pitted against a movable object—if only they exert enough sweat and resources. It’s a years-long grind that few beyond the Paradas would countenance.\n\nBut: The American Geophysics crew produces a heat map showing four large, anomalous metal shapes underground, including a 10-foot mass. Optimism pulses through the gathering, and the Finders Keepers crew, feeling exultant, convinces D’Amore to try the dowsing rods.\n\nAfter receiving the final results from American Geophysics, the Paradas ask the state of Pennsylvania to excavate the site. When several months pass with no answer, Parada looks into obtaining permits to start digging, in the hope that a remarkable discovery will prompt an official entity—a museum or university—to take over.\n\nFor now, that leaves the Paradas in a kind of treasure-hunter limbo. If the truth emerges that tons of gold bars were on that Pennsylvania hillside, the story of their ardent and tenacious journey will become just as mythical and enduring as the cache of precious metal. Somehow, the scaffolding of belief they built around the site held up across more than a decade of gale-force bureaucratic headwinds.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the point of the bizarre tale of Dents Run. Maybe the truth of the gold—tantalizing though it may be—doesn’t really matter. Maybe what’s important is the manner in which Denny Parada embodies the yearning, the quest—the believing—for objects that transport us, time out of mind, to distant people and times. Who doesn’t yearn to follow the map to the mythical X, to crunch through the woods, staring at the ground, wondering what mysteries it holds?\n\nOf course, the most likely answer is that there’s nothing down there. But what if?\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on five businessmen linked to Russian state-owned oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft and targeted companies accused of circumventing sanctions on Russian oil by running ships for Moscow's shadow fleet of aging oil tankers.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nMember countries, notably France, have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval. That level of support is unprecedented for the start of a Council of Europe treaty.\n\nThe commission will assess claims made to the already operational register of damages, which was launched during a Council of Europe summit in 2023. Some 80,000 claims have already been filed with the register, which is based in The Hague.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told a press conference the bloc would give one million euros ($1.1 million) to finance the commission's operation. An estimated 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) are needed overall.\n\nMany of the same countries have also backed a new international court, also under the umbrella of the Council of Europe, to prosecute senior Russian officials for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

    "description": "The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.",
    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington. Seung Min Kim and Darlene Superville in Washington; Pietro De Cristofaro in Berlin; Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine; and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.\n\nZelenskyy sat down with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Ukrainian leader posted pictures of the negotiating table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sitting next to him facing the U.S. delegation.\n\nResponding to journalists’ questions in audio clips on a WhatsApp group chat before the talks, Zelenskyy said that since the U.S. and some European nations had rejected Ukraine’s push to join NATO, Kyiv expects the West to offer a set of guarantees similar to those offered to the alliance members.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he said. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded tha Ukraine renounce the bid for the alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nZelenskyy emphasized that any security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress, adding that he expected an update from his team following a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. military officials in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nWashington has tried for months to navigate the demands of each side as Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly occupied by Russian forces.\n\nPutin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control among the key conditions for peace, a demand rejected by Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said that the U.S. had floated an idea for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk and create a demilitarized free economic zone there, a proposal he rejected as unworkable.\n\n“I do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?” he said. “If we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact, if we are talking about some economic zone and we believe that only a police mission should be there and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5–10 kilometers, for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?”\n\nZelenskyy described the issue as “very sensitive” and insisted on a freeze along the line of contact, saying that “today a fair possible option is we stand where we stand.”\n\nPutin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of the Donetsk region even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.\n\nUshakov warned that a search for compromise could take a long time, noting that the U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been “worsened” by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.\n\nSpeaking to Russian state TV in remarks broadcast Sunday, Ushakov said that “the contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive,\" warning that Moscow will “have very strong objections.”\n\nUshakov added that the territorial issue was actively discussed in Moscow when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. “The Americans know and understand our position,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday just before the talks with Trump’s envoys, thanking him on X for his support and adding that “we are coordinating closely and working together for the sake of our shared security.”\n\nMacron vowed on X that “France is, and will remain, at Ukraine’s side to build a robust and lasting peace — one that can guarantee Ukraine’s security and sovereignty, and that of Europe, over the long term.”\n\nMerz, who has spearheaded European efforts to support Ukraine alongside Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Saturday that “the decades of the ‘Pax Americana’ are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well.”\n\nHe warned that Putin's aim is “a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders.”\n\n“If Ukraine falls, he won’t stop,” Merz warned on Saturday during a party conference in Munich.\n\nPutin has denied plans to restore the Soviet Union or attack any European allies.\n\nRussia and Ukraine exchange aerial attacks\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia overnight launched ballistic missiles and 138 attack drones at Ukraine. The air force said 110 had been intercepted or downed, but missile and drone hits were recorded at six locations.\n\nZelenskyy said Sunday that hundreds of thousands of families were still without power in the south, east and northeast regions and work was continuing to restore electricity, heat and water to multiple regions following a large-scale attack the previous night.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said that in the past week, Russia had launched over 1,500 strike drones, nearly 900 guided aerial bombs and 46 missiles of various types at Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 235 Ukrainian drones late Saturday and early Sunday.\n\nIn the Belgorod region, a drone injured a man and set his house ablaze in the village of Yasnye Zori, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nUkrainian drones struck an oil depot in Uryupinsk in the Volgograd region, triggering a fire, according to regional Gov. Andrei Bocharov.\n\nIn the Krasnodar region, the Ukrainian drones attacked the town of Afipsky, where an oil refinery is located. Authorities said that explosions shattered windows in residential buildings, but didn’t report any damage to the refinery.\n\nCiobanu reported from Warsaw, Poland.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

According to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 159 countries have recognized Palestine. The vast majority of the international community believes that a two-state solution is the only way to end decades of conflict.\n\nNetanyahu's government has said the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas.\n\nHere are some global reactions to the Australia shooting:\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei condemned the attack: “Terrorism and the killing of people, wherever they occur, are unacceptable and must be condemned.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington strongly condemned the attack and that “Antisemitism has no place in this world.”\n\nKing Charles III said he was “appalled and saddened.” He also leads the Commonwealth, and the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said Herzog had reached out to the king in September warning of an “epidemic of antisemitism” in three Commonwealth countries: Britain, Canada and Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, police in London said they would step up security at Jewish sites.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack “has left me speechless” and added that “this is an attack on our shared values. We must stop this antisemitism, here in Germany and worldwide.”\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified and that “My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hannukah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness.”\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the “ghastly terrorist attack” and said that “we stand in solidarity with the people of Australia in this hour of grief.”\n\nThe organization's president, Ronald Lauder, said that “No community should ever fear ​coming together to celebrate its faith, traditions, or identity,” adding: “Make no mistake, this will not break us.\"\n\n\"I’m surrounded by antisemitic graffiti constantly. I think for our community in the east (of Sydney), and as a Christian, I just want to declare I stand with the people of Israel,” Anglican pastor Matt Graham told Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he had been conducting a service at the nearby Bondi Anglican Church when panicked people began entering to take shelter.",

    "fullText": "DOUANKARA, Mauritania (AP) — The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips. Her chest barely moved. Drops of fevered sweat trickled down her forehead as medical workers hurried around her, attaching an IV drip.\n\nIt was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly. The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.\n\nHer family said the 14-year-old had been raped by Russian fighters who burst into their tent in Mali two weeks earlier. The Russians were members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russia's defense ministry that replaced the Wagner mercenary group six months ago.\n\nMen, women and children have been sexually assaulted by all sides during Mali's decade-long conflict, the U.N. and aid workers say, with reports of gang rape and sexual slavery. But the real toll is hidden by a veil of shame that makes it difficult for women from conservative, patriarchal societies to seek help.\n\nThe silence that nearly killed the 14-year-old also hurts efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe AP learned of the alleged rape and four other alleged cases of sexual violence blamed on Africa Corps fighters, commonly described by Malians as the “white men,” while interviewing dozens of refugees at the border about other abuses such as beheadings and abductions.\n\nOther combatants in Mali have been blamed for sexual assaults. The head of a women’s health clinic in the Mopti area told the AP it had treated 28 women in the last six months who said they had been assaulted by militants with the al-Qaida affiliated JNIM, the most powerful armed group in Mali.\n\nThe silence among Malian refugees has been striking.\n\nIn eastern Congo, which for decades has faced violence from dozens of armed groups, “we didn’t have to look for people,” said Mirjam Molenaar, the medical team leader in the border area for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, who was stationed there last year. The women \"came in huge numbers.”\n\nIt's different here, she said: “People undergo these things and they live with it, and it shows in post-traumatic stress.\"\n\nThe aunt of the 14-year-old girl said the Africa Corps fighters marched everyone outside at gunpoint. The family couldn't understand what they wanted. The men made them watch as they tied up the girl’s uncle and cut off his head.\n\nThen two of the men took the 14-year-old into the tent as she tried to defend herself, and raped her. The family waited outside, unable to move.\n\n“We were so scared that we were not even able to scream anymore,” the aunt recalled, as her mother sobbed quietly next to her. She, like other women, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, and the AP does not name victims of rape unless they agree to be named.\n\nThe girl emerged over a half-hour later, looking terrified. Then she saw her uncle's body and screamed. She fainted. When she woke up, she had the eyes of someone “who was no longer there,” the aunt said.\n\nThe next morning, JNIM militants came and ordered the family to leave. They piled onto a donkey cart and set off toward the border. At any sound, they hid in the bushes, holding their breath.\n\nThe girl's condition deteriorated during the three-day journey. When they arrived in Mauritania, she collapsed.\n\nThe AP came across her lying on the ground in the courtyard of a local family. Her family said they had not taken her to a clinic because they had no money.\n\n“If you have nothing, how can you bring someone to a doctor?” the girl’s grandmother said between sobs. The AP took the family to a free clinic run by MSF. A doctor said the girl had signs of being raped.\n\nThe clinic had been functioning for barely a month and had seen three survivors of sexual violence, manager Elidje said.\n\n“We are convinced that there are many cases like this,\" she said. \"But so far, very few patients come forward to seek treatment because it’s still a taboo subject here. It really takes time and patience for these women to open up and confide in someone so they can receive care. They only come when things have already become complicated, like the case we saw today.”\n\nAs Elidje tried to save the girl's life, she asked the family to describe the incident. She did not speak Arabic and asked the local nurse to find out how many men carried out the assault. But the nurse was too ashamed to ask.\n\nScratch marks are part of story she could not tell\n\nThousands of new refugees from Mali, mostly women and children, have settled just inside Mauritania in recent weeks, in shelters made of fabric and branches. The nearest refugee camp is full, complicating efforts to treat and report sexual assaults.\n\nTwo recently arrived women discreetly pulled AP journalists aside, adjusting scarves over their faces. They said they had arrived a week ago after armed white men came to their village.\n\n“They took everything from us. They burned our houses. They killed our husbands,” one said. “But that’s not all they did. They tried to rape us.”\n\nThe men entered the house where she was by herself and undressed her, she said, adding that she defended herself “by the grace of Allah.”\n\nAs she spoke, the second woman started crying and trembling. She had scratch marks on her neck. She was not capable of telling her story.\n\n“We are still terrified by what we went through,” she said.\n\nSeparately, a third woman said that what the white men did to her in Mali last month when she was alone at home “stays between God and me.”\n\nA fourth said she watched several armed white men drag her 18-year-old daughter into their house. She fled and has not seen her daughter again.\n\nThe women declined the suggestion to speak with aid workers, some of whom are locals. They said they were not ready to talk about it with anyone else.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to questions, but an information agency that the U.S. State Department has called part of the “Kremlin’s disinformation campaign” called the AP’s investigation into Africa Corps fake news.\n\nWagner has a legacy of sexual abuse\n\nAllegations of rapes and other sexual assaults were already occurring before Wagner transformed into Africa Corps.\n\nOne refugee told the AP she witnessed a mass rape in her village in March 2024.\n\n“The Wagner group burned seven men alive in front of us with gasoline.” she said. Then they gathered the women and raped them, she said, including her 70-year-old mother.\n\n“After my mother was raped, she couldn’t bear to live,” she said. Her mother died a month later.\n\nIn the worst-known case of sexual assault involving Russian fighters in Africa, the U.N. in a 2023 report said at least 58 women and girls had been raped or sexually assaulted in an attack on Moura village by Malian troops and others that witnesses described as “armed white men.\"\n\nIn response, Mali’s government expelled the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Since then, gathering accurate data on the ground about conflict-related sexual violence has become nearly impossible.\n\nThe AP interviewed five of the women from Moura, who now stay in a displacement camp. They said they had been blindfolded and raped for hours by several men.\n\nThree of the women said they hadn't spoken about it to anyone apart from aid workers. The other two dared to tell their husbands, months later.\n\n“I kept silent with my family for fear of being rejected or looked at differently. It’s shameful,” one said.\n\nThe 14-year-old whose family fled to Mauritania is recovering. She said she cannot remember anything since the attack. Her family and MSF said she is speaking to a psychiatrist — one of just six working in the country.\n\nAid workers are worried about others who never say a thing.\n\n“It seems that conflict over the years gets worse and worse and worse. There is less regard for human life, whether it’s men, women or children,” said MSF’s Molenaar, and broke into tears. “It’s a battle.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "description": "A fight over words like \"execution,\" \"manifesto\" and \"Faraday\" is the undercard bout at Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence-suppression hearing in NYC.",
    "fullText": "Yes, it's a fight over a backpack — how it was seized, how it was searched, and whether the gun and notebook found inside will be tossed or kept as knockout-blow evidence in a future murder trial.\n\nBut Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence suppression hearing, playing out for two weeks in a Manhattan courtroom, is more than that.\n\nThe serious legal battle features an often amusing undercard bout: repeated sparring over nothing more than the naming of things.\n\nWas UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shot on a Midtown sidewalk last year? Or was he \"executed?\"\n\nIs the red notebook found inside Mangione's backpack a \"manifesto,\" or a \"journal?\"\n\nAnd is the aluminum-lined pouch found in Mangione's backpack a \"Faraday bag,\" meant to block his cellphone from being tracked during a five-day manhunt? Or was the bag simply \"waterproof?\"\n\nIt all depends on who is standing at the courtroom's podium: lead defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo or top prosecutor Joel Seidemann.\n\nThese pretrial rhetorical rumbles foreshadow how intensely these two adversaries — seasoned legal veterans with decadeslong experience — will fight next year, at a yet-scheduled trial in the same state-level courtroom.\n\nThe temperament of the judge is also being previewed. NY Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro has alternated between seeming mildly irked and utterly unfazed as he's refereed these sporadic wars of words over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Move on,\" Carro has said when the prosecutor and defense lawyer complain about each other — like when Friedman Agnifilo stood up on Thursday to say of Seidemann, \"He wants to play the word 'manifesto' over and over and over again!\"\n\nCarro's relative calm has only wavered once, on Monday, after the prosecutor repeatedly referred to Thompson's murder as an \"execution.\"\n\n\"You testified you were aware of the New York City shooting?\" prior to the arrest, Friedman Agnifilo had asked the third Altoona, Pennsylvania, cop to take the stand. (Mangione was arrested in a McDonald's there five days after Thompson's December 4, 2024, shooting, after being spotted by customers.) \"You were aware it did not involve a bomb?\" she asked, scoring a point.\n\n\"Were you aware it involved a premeditated execution?\" Seidemann clapped back minutes later, visibly eager to take that point back.\n\nThe judge's voice was sharp as he sustained Friedman Agnifilo's objection. Soon afterward, she stood to complain about the prosecutor's repeated references to \"manifesto\" and \"the execution of Mr. Thompson.\"\n\n\"He certainly won't do that at trial,\" the judge warned.\n\n\"I'll bear that in mind, your honor,\" the prosecutor answered.\n\nA small \"Faraday bag,\" featuring a protective lining that blocks electronic signals, triggered an extended semantic skirmish on Tuesday.\n\nBoth the lawyer and the prosecutor were asking a lot of questions at the time, about this one little pouch. The size of a business envelope, it held an Apple cellphone, Mangione's passport, and a small wallet with a driver's license and three charge cards inside.\n\nIn questioning the officer who first pulled it out of the backpack, Friedman Agnifilo referred to the pouch as \"a black bag that has Velcro.\"\n\nShe also called it a \"waterproof bag,\" noting that other items in the backpack had been damp that day. (The same cop had testified that inside the backpack she'd found a gun clip filled with nine hollow-point rounds — wrapped in a pair of gray underwear that was \"soaking wet.\")\n\nWeren't electronics and a passport \"items that you'd want to keep dry?\" Friedman Agnifilo asked. \"Yes,\" the officer answered.\n\n\"Is that a Faraday bag or a waterproof bag?\" the prosecutor asked on his next turn at the podium, pointing to an image of the pouch.\n\n\"It's a Faraday bag,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"And how do you distinguish a Faraday bag from a waterproof bag?\" Seidemann pursued.\n\n\"This bag had an aluminum lining,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"If we can continue,\" he then said, turning toward the audience with a slight smile.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to conclude next week. The judge has yet to say when he will rule on the admissibility of the backpack and its contents.\n\nThe Baltimore native is challenging the admissibility of evidence in both his state and federal murder prosecutions. Trial dates have yet to be set in both cases.",

    "title": "The next generation of heirs is rewiring family offices — and triggering a talent war",
    "description": "Wealthy heirs are reshaping family offices around impact and innovation, but the talent to run them is scarce, a new IMD report says.",
    "fullText": "The next generation of leaders wants their family offices to look different from those run by their parents — and that shift is driving fierce competition for a new class of talent.\n\nA new report from IMD's Global Family Business Center and the Family Business Network, based on 186 survey responses and 65 interviews with family principals across six continents in the first two quarters of this year, found that family offices are rapidly evolving as younger heirs step into leadership roles.\n\nThe report said younger family members increasingly prioritize impact investing, sustainability, technological innovation, and diversity and inclusion — particularly in the advisors and specialists they choose to hire.\n\nAs a result, they seek advisors who can navigate these areas — and job listings have surged for individuals with these skills, including alternative investment analysts, ESG specialists, and chief information officers who can modernize systems and streamline operations.\n\nBut the supply of qualified candidates \"has not kept pace,\" the report warned.\n\nFamily offices require a blend of hard technical skills and softer traits — trustworthiness, discretion, emotional intelligence, and the ability to work inside complex family systems — that's rare even in top-tier finance.\n\nThis \"changing of the guard,\" the report said, has created an acute scarcity of talent and a \"highly competitive market for top-tier professionals.\"\n\nFamily offices are multiplying rapidly, with Deloitte estimating a 31% increase from 2019 to late 2024, as founders cash out and heirs prepare for a historic wealth transfer, according to the IMD's report.\n\n\"By and large, we can see that there just isn't enough talent available for the families and their family offices,\" Peter Vogel, one of the report's authors and Director of the IMD Global Family Business Center, told Business Insider.\n\nVogel, also a professor of family business and entrepreneurship, said that the first big hires are usually investment-focused — people with backgrounds in private equity, private debt, real estate, or venture capital.\n\nFamilies that care about sustainability or impact will add ESG (environmental, social, and governance) expertise and impact-metrics skills on top, he added.\n\nBeyond technical chops, Vogel said families increasingly look for candidates who bring emotional intelligence, trustworthiness, and experience handling family dynamics — qualities he described as essential but hard to find.\n\nBut even when families are willing to pay, the pitch isn't always as attractive as it looks.\n\n\"One of the big questions is, what is the value proposition for a top shot to join a family office?\" Vogel said.\n\nVogel said that for senior hires like CIOs or CEOs, family offices offer limited upward mobility: once you reach the top job, there's nowhere else to go except a larger family office.\n\nVogel added that while family-office compensation can be strong, it often falls short of the millions of dollars top performers can earn in big banks, private equity, or hedge funds — especially without co-investment or carried interest.\n\nMichael Kosnitzky, Co-Leader of Pillsbury's Private Client & Family Office practice, previously told Business Insider that family offices are increasingly structuring \"golden handcuffs\" — long-term incentive packages designed to make it costly or unattractive for executives to leave — and carried-interest-style deals to stop their CIOs and dealmakers from being poached by rival funds or other family offices.\n\nOn top of that, Vogel said, the market itself is opaque.\n\nThe term \"family office\" isn't regulated, and titles are vague, he said, which makes it harder to find talent because roles vary widely from one office to another, and there's no standard job description. Many professionals also don't publicly name the families they work for.\n\n\"There's no big, qualified database of people saying, 'hand up, I'm a family office person,'\" Vogel said.\n\nFor now, families are improvising: pulling trusted bankers into newly created offices, experimenting with incentive packages, and relying heavily on headhunters and word of mouth, he said.",

    "title": "US Air Force pilots finally have a training jet built for a modern air war of stealth fighters and bombers",
    "description": "The T-7 Red Hawk will teach pilots to fly fifth-gen aircraft like the F-22 and F-35, as well as the new B-21 stealth bomber and planned F-47.",
    "fullText": "US Air Force pilots have a new training aircraft, the T-7 Red Hawk, promising to prepare them to fly fifth-generation fighters, stealth bombers, and the US' planned sixth-generation fighter.\n\nThe first T-7 Red Hawk trainer, made by Boeing, arrived at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas this month. The new training aircraft will replace Northrop Grumman's T-38 Talon, which pilots have been training on for six decades. The Air Force no longer deems the trainer sufficient for preparing the service's pilots for future warfare. That's why replacing the outdated Talon has been on the Air Force's to-do list for years.\n\n\"The T-38 has been life-extended multiple times,\" said Brig. Gen. Matthew Leard, director of plans, program, requirements, and international Affairs for Air Education and Training Command, in a statement. \"There's an escalating cost of retaining the airplane and keeping it flyable,\" he said, adding that the plane \"is no longer aligned with current or future aircraft.\"\n\nIn 2023, the Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, reported the Air Force was relying on the aging T-38 as a new flight simulator was delayed by a decade and new training aircraft were being developed. The aircraft, the GAO said, \"is increasingly expensive to maintain and is no longer reflective of modern combat aircraft.\"\n\nThe Air Force sees the transition to the new T-7 Red Hawk as a fundamental shift in how pilots are trained for high-stress, modern air combat.\n\n\"From day one, students won't just be learning to fly,\" Maj. Gen. Gregory Kreuder, the 19th Air Force commander, said in a statement. They'll be learning to manage information, interpret data from advanced sensors, and make critical decisions in a complex environment, all from within the trainer.\"\n\n\"This aircraft,\" he said, \"enables us to close the gap between basic pilot training and the realities of fifth generation plus warfare, producing more capable, intuitive warfighters right out of the gate.\"\n\nThe new T-7 Red Hawk will teach pilots how to fly some of the most advanced aircraft the US has, like the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II stealth aircraft.\n\nAnd under the hood of the sleek, red-tailed trainer is a flexible open design that can be updated with new features as they arrive. The trainer will also prepare pilots to fly aircraft still in development and testing, such as the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber and the upcoming sixth-gen F-47, which is being built by Boeing.\n\nAlong with the T-7 Red Hawk, new ground and maintenance training systems will help pilots build skills and keep aircraft mission-ready. A live-virtual-constructive setup — which links real flights and simulators into the same scenarios — will let the Air Force update training with new threats, platforms, and weapons without needing a new aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force still has several steps to take before the T-7 Red Hawk becomes operational.\n\nThe jet is still in development, and both pilots and maintenance personnel will need training on the systems. Instructor pilots will fly it first, with students following after. The T-7 is expected to reach initial operational capability in August 2027, with 14 aircraft expected at the 99th Flying Training Squadron at Randolph Air Force Base later that year. Until then, pilots will train on the T-6 Texan II.\n\nOther Air Force bases, like Columbus in Mississippi, Laughlin in Texas, Vance in Oklahoma, and Sheppard in Texas, will get more T-7 Red Hawks in the following years.\n\n\"The aircraft delivery is the first physical representation of progress within the program,\" Leard said.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.\n\nUsing a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.\n\nEU Council President António Costa said European leaders had committed in October “to keep Russian assets immobilized until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused. Today we delivered on that commitment.”\n\nIt’s a key step that will allow EU leaders to work out at a summit next week how to use the tens of billions of euros in Russian Central Bank assets to underwrite a huge loan to help Ukraine meet its financial and military needs over the next two years.\n\n“Next step: securing Ukraine’s financial needs for 2026–27,” added Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit.\n\nThe move also prevents the assets, estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion), from being used in any negotiations to end the war without European approval.\n\nA 28-point plan drafted by U.S. and Russian envoys stipulated that the EU would release the frozen assets for use by Ukraine, Russia and the United States. That plan, which surfaced last month, was rejected by Ukraine and its backers in Europe.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision means that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds.”\n\nThe vast majority of the funds — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.\n\nThe money was frozen under sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over the war it launched on Feb. 24, 2022, but these sanctions must be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday’s decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe – said on social media that it means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”\n\n“The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote. He said that Hungary “will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”\n\nIn a letter to Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that “would include covering Ukraine’s military expenses for the coming years.”\n\nHe warned “that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardize U.S. peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\n\nBut the commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is opposed to the “reparations loan” plan. It says that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,” and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nRussia’s Central Bank, meanwhile, said on Friday that it has filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it says were caused when Moscow was barred from managing the assets. Euroclear declined to comment.\n\nThe Belgian clearing house has around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in Russia and it’s unclear what would happen to that money if the legal challenge or others like it succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Central Bank also described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”\n\nBut EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is “legally robust,” and that he expects Russia “to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law.”\n\nChris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Consultancy, said that the timing of the court action is “clearly linked” to the EU’s intention to use the frozen assets.\n\n“The Russian Central Bank is making clear that it will respond with legal actions against all countries involved in the decision to take the Russian money,” he said.\n\nFriday's EU decision came hours after Germany summoned the Russian ambassador in Berlin following allegations of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and interference in its elections.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nThe remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there.\n\nKupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.\n\nLess than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.\n\nMoscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant.\n\nHe told Kommersant “it’s entirely possible that there won’t be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”\n\nFor months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.\n\nSince Moscow’s 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.\n\nUkraine says its constitution doesn’t allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.\n\nIn October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.\n\nIn recent months, Russia’s army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.\n\nIts slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.\n\nUkrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard’s Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.\n\nFighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.\n\nZelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.\n\n“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine’s Ground Forces Day.\n\nRussian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.\n\nUkraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.\n\nIts Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.\n\nThe ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.\n\nRussia’s air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.\n\nUkraine’s southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.
