    "description": "A top Norwegian military official identified icebreakers as one of the capability gaps that exist between NATO and Russia and China.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces are falling behind Russia and China in the race to build icebreakers, ships that would be crucial in an Arctic war, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nIn an interview, Vice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, identified icebreakers as one of the key capability gaps that exist between NATO and its rivals in the Arctic.\n\nRussia and China are the only two countries that are building icebreakers at scale. The West has been \"falling behind\" in its ability to operate fully in the Arctic compared to Moscow and Beijing, Andersen said last week.\n\nRussia has dozens of icebreakers — roughly 40 by some estimates, far more than any other country — while China, which has increased its Arctic activity in recent years, fields around five. Moscow and Beijing plan to work together to expand that fleet.\n\nThe US, by contrast, fields just one heavy polar icebreaker along with a number of smaller vessels. The Trump administration said last year that the US Coast Guard's fleet of Arctic-capable vessels is \"insufficient to meet current operations demands and presents a national security risk.\" The president also called for a dramatic boost to the overall size of the fleet.\n\nArctic security has become a growing focal point for NATO in recent years as Russian and Chinese activity expands. Increased competition has spotlighted the icebreaker gap.\n\nThese ships, which are purpose-built to crush ice blocking waterways, are critical in this region because they enable better movement across frozen yet strategic terrain, unlocking access to trade routes and natural resources. In a fight, they allow access to the battlespace, as well as enable logistics and support missions.\n\nCanada, Finland, and other NATO allies add dozens of icebreakers to the Western alliance's ice-breaking arsenal, bringing it closer to parity with Russia, but Arctic experts believe nearly a third of them are past their design life. Russia's fleet is heavier and more specialized, built for heavy-ice operations in ways that many alliance vessels aren't.\n\nA NATO official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military capabilities, told Business Insider that while Russia may have more of certain maritime platforms than the West, the country still faces readiness challenges that affect its ability to put ships to sea.\n\nThis creates \"strategic dilemmas with their force projection,\" the official said.\n\nAndersen said NATO countries have acknowledged the numerical deficit in icebreakers and are making strides to close the gap.\n\nThe Trump administration, for instance, said in October that it plans to order four Arctic Security Cutters, medium icebreaking ships, from Finland and build another seven in American shipyards using Finnish expertise.\n\nThe Coast Guard assesses that it needs at least nine of those ships \"to serve our national security needs year-round in the Arctic,\" the White House said at the time.\n\nFinland is the world leader in icebreaker production. Its companies have designed 80% of the world's icebreakers, and its local shipyards have built 60% of them. Other leading countries include Canada, Russia, and China.\n\nCmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command, told Business Insider that member states \"are making tangible investments in icebreakers.\"\n\n\"Our collective capabilities provide allied navies and coast guards the ability to operate in Arctic conditions,\" he added.\n\nBeyond the icebreakers, NATO allies are investing in other technologies and systems to improve their Arctic foothold, including additional surveillance capabilities, drones, satellites, and vehicles that can withstand cold temperatures.\n\nWestern forces have also increased the scale of their Arctic exercises to familiarize soldiers with the harsh terrain and launched new deterrence operations to strengthen their posture across the region.",

    "fullText": "Mortgage rates dipped below a key threshold this week. That could be a boon for Donald Trump's affordability push, but it's not necessarily for the reason the president wants.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage in the US dropped to 5.99% on Monday, per the Mortgage News Daily Rate Index. That's the lowest borrowing costs have been for prospective home buyers since 2022. The decline has been driven by the latest decrease in Treasury yields.\n\nHowever, rather than pricing in lower rates in the medium-term, which is what Trump wants to see, government bond yields have dropped because investors are freaked out again about the trade war.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury declined in the days since the Supreme Court struck down most of Trump's tariffs, dropping five basis points on Monday alone.\n\nThe president's response to the ruling that he would initiate a new global tariff of 15% has reignited investors' fears about the trade war.\n\nThough most of Trump's tariffs have been struck down, the prospect of a 15% universal tariff, combined with the sell-off in tech driven by AI in recent weeks, has caused investors to flee to safety.\n\nJPMorgan said on Monday that the risk-off move has caused yields to spike. Investors are grasping for safe havens amid a new cocktail of market worries, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, told Business Insider, pointing to the concurrent rise in hedges like gold. The metal is up about 4% in the last five days.\n\nThe 10-year yield has plummeted to its lowest levels so far this year, and now looks \"very close\" to its low in April 2025, around the time Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs sparked investor panic and a historical sell-off, according to Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\n\"We are, in other words, in pretty unusual territory,\" Colas wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "The US has controlled the air in its recent conflicts, but the war in Ukraine shows that may not be the case in the future.",
    "fullText": "Learning from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US Army drone trainers are teaching soldiers to be ready for a threat many US troops haven't faced in decades: a sky they don't control.\n\nThe US has had control of the air in its recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, allowing it to move and strike with relatively little fear of enemy aircraft. For most soldiers, what's overhead has usually been friendly.\n\nBut the war in Ukraine is showing the US and Western allies that this assumption may not hold in future conflicts. That shift has implications for tactics, training, and even mindset.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the Army's new Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course designed to catch the US up on small drone warfare, told Business Insider that \"we are used to air supremacy as an Army.\"\n\n\"Just about every event we've ever been a part of, we own the air.\" Ukraine is demonstrating \"that may not be the case.\"\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine has been able to secure lasting air superiority, as both sides have powerful air defense arsenals. That mutual denial has constrained traditional airpower and contributed to a grinding war in which drones, artillery, and air defenses dominate the fight. Officials across NATO have warned that Western militaries cannot assume that they'll have air superiority in future conflicts.\n\nFor individual soldiers, that reality changes both tactics and psychology. The Army's drone course is trying to prepare them.\n\n\"In an environment where we may not have air supremacy,\" Martin said, \"we need to teach and ingrain in every soldier to be pessimistic or suspicious\" of anything in the air.\n\nIt has to be an almost reflexive judgment — there isn't time to work through it step by step.\n\nAs she put it, \"by the time you make that mental process and decide\" whether a drone is friendly, \"it may have already targeted you.\" In these fights, \"you hear the sounds, and then you're engaged.\"\n\nShe said that Ukrainians, whether they are soldiers or civilians, already have this mindset.\n\n\"When they hear the sound of a drone, they immediately deploy a cover, they jump into a house or hide under a bunker, and they don't even wait around to find out if it's theirs or not,\" she said. \"They just assume that it's there to hurt them.\"\n\nThat mindset shift is \"something that we're trying\" to build into the training, Martin said.\n\nUS veterans with experience in Ukraine have spoken about how different the experience is compared to recent US conflicts, particularly the constant presence of enemy drones and artillery.\n\nCarl Larson, an Iraq veteran who was born in Seattle and served in Ukraine's International Legion, said drones are \"a horrendous detriment to morale\" because they mean soldiers often can't move out of their bunkers or other positions during the day.\n\nThat is \"incredibly corrosive to your ability to conduct combat operations,\" and also causes immense stress, he said.\n\nDrones can inflict sudden, unpredictable losses. He said he lost \"good friends\" in Ukraine who \"died from having a grenade explode next to them out of nowhere, under a blue sky, you couldn't even hear it. Bang, they're dead.\"\n\nA veteran of urban warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq who served in Ukraine with the call sign Jackie previously told Business Insider that, compared to those conflicts, there was nowhere for soldiers to really relax in Ukraine. In those, there was space to breathe for soldiers when they moved back half a mile from the line of contact. \"You could stand outside and have a barbecue, a sandwich, and drink.\"\n\nThat wasn't the case when he fought in the city of Bakhmut, one of the most brutal battles of the war. There were so many drones and artillery that you couldn't even tell where the line of contact was.\n\nThe result was soldiers hiding all day and not moving for hours, in case they were spotted by drones, making the place look like \"a ghost town.\"\n\n\"You would be spotted immediately by a drone because there's hundreds of drones in the air. There's no place that's safe.\" Soldiers couldn't recharge and reequip themselves, as he had been used to with the US Army.\n\nMartin said the Army's drone course is, in response, teaching students that \"we won't be in a battlefield that remains as static as we're used to.\" It's teaching students that \"mobility is survivability\" and that \"you may need to move before you're observed in order to survive.\"",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — The Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel on Sunday, prompting what can only be described as a large-scale, violent reaction from cartel members throughout the state of Jalisco. ABC4 spoke with a Utah woman who is staying in Puerto Vallarta and saw first-hand what is transpiring across the region.\n\nThe woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous for her safety, said she has been visiting Puerto Vallarta every winter for the last seven years. She has been there for three weeks on her own, her husband arriving only a few days ago.\n\n“This morning we got ready to walk to the nearby church,” she told ABC4. “I looked outside and saw a huge billowing dark cloud over the bay and wondered if it was a storm cloud or from a fire. I opened the balcony door and immediately knew it was from a fire.”\n\nShe said as she continued to scan the horizon, she saw smoke coming from the north, as well as the south. She ran to the other side of the house, went outside, and saw seven different clouds of smoke coming from various locations.\n\n“That’s when we knew something very intentional was going on,” she said. “We had no idea the cause, we just knew something was very wrong.”\n\nShe added, ““Standing on the balcony and then seeing these fires in the distance and then all of a sudden seeing them pop up literally right in front of me. And I thought, OK, I’m no longer an observer. I am in this.”\n\nWithin 30 minutes, she and her husband heard a serious of loud pops, “like generators exploding,” she said. They soon realized that each pop was a new car bomb going off.\n\nShe said two went off within three blocks of where they were staying.\n\n“We put on our tennis shoes and packed our passports and laptops into backpacks to prepare to leave in a moment’s notice,” she told ABC4. “But because the bombs and fires were going off everywhere in random places, it seemed too dangerous leave.”\n\nThe couple’s friends in Puerto Vallarta, who live in the same building as where they are staying, told them not to leave and to stay indoors. They all gathered together to watch was happening and try to figure out what to do next.\n\n“For about two hours all we did was watch and listen as the various fires started, and then eventually died down,” she said. “Then videos and images started popping up online and we saw people being stopped on the roads and shoved out of their cars and their cars being bombed and set on fire. Then we started hearing stories of people being shot and cars exploding at Costco and the Costco being set on fire.”\n\nShe added that several small stores in the town were also set on fire.\n\n“Truly, the horizon looked like a war zone,” she told ABC4.\n\nBombers were reportedly riding motorcycles, wearing backpacks, and were the only people out on the streets. Every time the group heard a motorcycle outside, they got nervous, she said.\n\n“We started to hear one motorcycle and then heard a loud crash and looked outside, and there was a motorcyclist who crashed right outside our front door,” she said. “His helmet and shoe were across the street and he was clearly injured, but he was wearing a backpack like all of the car bombers, so we didn’t even dare go outside to help him.”\n\nAs time went on, they learned that all of this was an alleged retaliation for the death of cartel leader Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho.” The U.S. Dept. of State told U.S. citizens in the region to shelter in place, and flights going in and out of Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta were canceled.\n\nThe city was put under curfew and the marina was also closed.\n\n“I can still see a few fires smoldering about a mile or two away, but nothing close by,” she told ABC4. “Two big military ships are patrolling the bay and military helicopters are flying very low, likely looking for potential bombers.”\n\nWhile they didn’t see much police presence during the initial bombing, she said that they began seeing more police cars and hearing more sirens as the day progressed.\n\n“The residents and tourists are all out on their balconies watching from afar,” she told ABC4. “Even those right next to the fires stood on top of their buildings and watched as the cars and buildings burned.”\n\nShe added that because most of the buildings there are made of concrete, cartel members focused their bombings on buses and cars.\n\n“An eerie silence has fallen over the city,” she told ABC4. “Now the worst sound is the occasional motorcycle going by. The best sound is the military helicopters patrolling nonstop.”\n\nShe said that part of today’s devastation is the impact it will have on the city and country. She told ABC4 the cartel violence is going to scare people, halt tourism, and destroy the livelihoods of many living there.\n\n“This is a beautiful city, rich with natural resources and amazing people,” she said. “So many Americans have a perception that it is always dangerous here, but until today, I have never felt the least bit in harm’s way, not in all my trips to Mexico, including Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán, Cabo, Guanajuato, and Mexico City.”\n\nShe added that she is praying that today was an isolated event that will not shut down the country, or destroy its people.\n\nFlights to and from Puerto Vallarta are cancelled at this time. Taxis and ride shares are also suspended in the region. A full list of impacted areas is available here.\n\nMarkkanen returns, but Jazz lose to Rockets 125-105\n\nTemporary boat ramp in the works to maintain access to Cataract Canyon at Lake Powell\n\nUtah 2034: Building the roadmap to another legacy\n\nPolice respond to shots fired on 9000 S in Sandy\n\nBrigham City man sentenced to prison for sexually abusing his child, possessing CSAM",

    "fullText": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago launched Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II, causing immense suffering for civilians and harrowing ordeals for soldiers while rewriting the post-Cold War security order.\n\nThe fighting enters its fifth year on Tuesday, and it shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.\n\nThe U.S. has brokered talks with delegations from Moscow and Kyiv as part of the Trump administration's yearlong push for peace. But reconciling key differences, such as the future of Russian-occupied Ukrainian land and postwar security for Ukraine, has thwarted progress.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of each countries’ troops have died on the battlefield, and Ukrainian civilians have been battered by Russian aerial strikes that have brought years of power outages and water cuts.\n\nHere’s a look at the conflict, by the numbers, since the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe upper end of the estimated number of soldiers killed, wounded or missing on both sides, according to a report last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\nIt estimated that Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025 — what it said was the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nRussia has not released figures on battlefield deaths since January 2023, when it said more than 80 soldiers were killed in a Ukrainian strike, bringing the total military deaths Moscow has confirmed to just over 6,000.\n\nCSIS estimated that Ukraine has seen 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war. Many are missing, he said.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses. Independent verification is not possible.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission’s count for civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia’s all-out invasion, though it says that is likely an underestimate. More than 40,600 civilians were injured over the same period, it said in a December report.\n\nThe war has killed at least 763 children, according to the U.N.\n\nLast year was the deadliest for civilians in Ukraine since 2022. The conflict killed 2,514 civilians and injured 12,142 in the country in 2025 — a 31% increase in civilian casualties over 2024, it said.\n\nThe percentage of Ukrainian land occupied by Russia, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nOver the past year, Russia has gained just 0.79% of Ukraine’s territory in the grinding war of attrition, the Washington-based think tank said in calculations provided earlier this month to The Associated Press, underscoring the little progress Moscow's forces have made despite huge costs in troops and armor.\n\nBefore Russia’s all-out invasion, it controlled nearly 7% of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east, as Moscow-backed separatists fought the Ukrainian army, according to Ukrainian officials and Western analysts.\n\nThe percentage drop in foreign military aid to Kyiv last year compared with the annual average between 2022 and 2024, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute, which tracks assistance to Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump stopped sending American weapons paid for by the U.S. to Ukraine after he took office just over a year ago. European countries, striving to make up the difference, increased their military aid last year by 67% compared with the 2022-2024 period, the institute said in a report this month.\n\nForeign humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine fell by 5% last year in comparison with the average in the previous three years, it said.\n\nThe number of Ukrainian civilians who have left their country.\n\nSome 5.3 million of those people have found refuge in Europe, according to a report this month from the U.N. office in Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, around 3.7 million Ukrainians forced out of their homes have moved elsewhere within the country, the U.N. said in December.\n\nUkraine's prewar population was more than 40 million.\n\nThe number of Russian attacks that affected the provision of medical care in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, according to a report from the World Health Organization on Monday.\n\nThere was a nearly 20% increase in such attacks last year compared with 2024, the U.N. agency said.\n\nA report earlier in the month from the WHO documented at least 2,347 strikes on health care facilities, in addition to others that damaged vehicles and the storage of medical supplies.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Paramount is in a bidding war with Netflix for Warner Bros. and has until March to make its best and final offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance is staring down a key deadline in its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, but it doesn't need to make a move quite yet.\n\nDavid Ellison and company have been able to negotiate directly with WBD's leadership team in recent days for the first time in months — thanks to Netflix, Paramount's rival in the bidding war.\n\nNetflix granted WBD, its deal partner, a weeklong waiver on negotiation exclusivity that expires at midnight on Monday. The company said it hoped these talks between Paramount and WBD would \"fully and finally resolve\" the monthslong saga that it said has been an \"ongoing distraction\" for both Netflix and WBD shareholders.\n\nAs of midday Monday, Paramount hasn't made its \"best and final\" bid for WBD, though it doesn't necessarily have to rush. That's because the seven-day window that Netflix granted Warner Bros. is to talk with Paramount, not the deadline for Paramount to raise its bid.\n\n\"Anyone can make an offer up to the shareholder vote,\" a person familiar with the WBD-Paramount negotiations told Business Insider.\n\nWBD's shareholder vote is on March 20. At that meeting, investors can choose to either approve or reject the Netflix deal, or they can abstain. WBD shareholders who prefer Paramount's offer can tender their shares to Ellison and company. Paramount has set a March 2 deadline for that, though it could be extended. If Paramount gets a majority of shares, it could shift WBD's course toward its own offer over Netflix's.\n\nThat means Paramount's real deadline for submitting its best offer is weeks away, though the company could raise its bid well before that. If Paramount raises its offer, Netflix will have four days to respond.\n\nWBD has said it prefers Netflix's all-cash offer of $27.75 per share for its studio and streaming assets over Paramount's proposal of $30 per share for the entire company, including its cable TV networks.\n\nWBD warned last week that if it went with Paramount, its employees could quit in droves, ahead of what could be a major round of layoffs under Ellison. Paramount has said it plans to create $6 billion in cost savings, which would include layoffs, compared to $2 billion or $3 billion from Netflix.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix is the biggest threat to Hollywood since it has the most streaming subscribers and dominates viewership share among paid streamers. Netflix's counterargument is that it also competes against YouTube and other free streamers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is another variable. Trump said in December that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to its market share, before saying in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the regulatory process.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nThen on Saturday, Trump said Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\" On a podcast, Rice, a former senior White House official under Obama and Biden, criticized the Trump administration and companies that \"take a knee\" under pressure from the president.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos shrugged off the president's remarks on Monday, saying that the streaming titan's bid for Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "The Air Force has been looking into what's possible with autonomous drones and how they can fight alongside advanced crewed aircraft.",
    "fullText": "A crewed US Air Force fighter and an uncrewed jet-powered aircraft flew together recently, communicating and showing how autonomous drones might fight in a future air war alongside human pilots.\n\nUS defense firm General Atomics, a competitor in the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Program aimed at developing and fielding loyal wingman-type drones, said on Monday that its MQ-20 Avenger, long a CCA stand-in, flew with an F-22 Raptor.\n\nDuring the test at Edwards Air Force Base earlier this month, the stealth fighter's pilot commanded the test drone to carry out tactical maneuvers, perform combat air patrols, and execute airborne threat engagement tasks.\n\nThe most recent demonstration is an advancement of a similar test in November 2025, when an F-22 pilot used a tablet to control an MQ-20, a test aircraft being used to demonstrate CCA-style teaming. The tablet allowed the pilot to communicate with the drone and send commands during flight.\n\nThe flight test earlier this month saw the Raptor pilot use government-provided autonomy software on the F-22 and a tactical data link to pass commands in real time to the drone.\n\n\"This demo featured the integration of mission elements and the ability of autonomy to utilize onboard sensors to make independent decisions and execute commands from the F-22,\" David Alexander, the president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., said in a statement.\n\nGeneral Atomics said the latest demonstration showed how CCA-type platforms could increase the combat power available to human pilots in a future war.\n\nThe Collaborative Combat Aircraft program is a priority for the Air Force as a way to bolster American airpower. These drones are meant to fly alongside advanced fighters, including the coming sixth-generation F-47 being developed by Boeing.\n\nAir Force officials say CCAs aren't disposable, but they're cheaper than fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. They are built to be attritable so they can be risked in combat instead of a human-piloted aircraft.\n\nTesting with the MQ-20 is helping inform the Air Force's CCA program, which is focused on General Atomics' YFQ-42, Anduril's YFQ-44, and Northrop Grumman's YFQ-48A. The air service envisions these systems as easily upgradable platforms compatible with high-end crewed aircraft.\n\nCCA-type drones, which include designs beyond those with dedicated Air Force program designations, are designed to carry out missions on their own, from air-to-air combat to strike and intelligence roles, while also boosting the power of a formation by adding more sensors and weapons without another pilot in the cockpit.\n\nThe Air Force says that CCAs are not intended as replacements for its crewed jets but are rather partners that will change how pilots work with artificial intelligence and drones — and expand US airpower in a fight, especially against a near-peer adversary.",

    "description": "New tariffs chaos means investor should focus on AI and sectors of the S&P 500 that have outperformed this year, investing experts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

    "description": "\"The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,\" Prokopenko said.",
    "fullText": "Four years after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy has entered a “death zone,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nIn a recent Economist op-ed, the former Russian central bank adviser drew on a term from mountain climbing when high altitude forces the body to consume itself faster than it can repair itself.\n\nWhat is Russia's economic 'death zone'?\n\nWhat signs indicate Russia may face economic crisis?\n\nHow has the war impacted Russia's economic structure?\n\nWhy can't monetary policy fix Russia's economic problems?\n\n“Russia’s economy is stuck in what might be described as negative equilibrium: holding itself together while steadily destroying its own future capacity,” she wrote.\n\nThe economy isn’t headed for an imminent crash, but GDP has stagnated, oil revenue has been halved amid Western sanctions, and the government’s budget deficit is rapidly draining reserves.\n\nAt the same time, two economic systems have emerged. One is comprised of the military and related industries that receive priority from the Kremlin. And then there’s everything else that’s been “left in the cold,” Prokopenko explained.\n\n“The most dangerous feature of this new structure is the fuel it burns,” she added. “Russia’s economy now runs on what might be called ‘military rent’: budget transfers to defense enterprises that generate wages and economic activity.”\n\nBut the transfers are aimed at assets designed for destruction, Prokopenko pointed out. In other words, the money that keeps Russia’s factories humming pays for tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons that eventually get destroyed or damaged, making them useless for future economic growth.\n\nSimilarly, money spent to attract fresh recruits to Russia’s army doesn’t retrain them to become more productive. Instead, many die or return home permanently wounded. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed.\n\n“The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,” Prokopenko said.\n\nWhile the central bank has cut interest rates to prop up growth and the Kremlin has taken steps to rein in the budget deficit, Russia’s economic predicament can’t be fixed with monetary or fiscal policies, she wrote.\n\nIn fact, interest payments on government debt this year are already set to exceed spending on education and health care combined.\n\nUnlike a cyclical downturn such as a recession, Prokopenko argued that what Russia is suffering from is more akin to altitude sickness—”the longer you stay, the worse it gets, regardless of rest.”",

Security Council resolutions.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian Ambassador to South Korea Georgy Zinoviev praised what he described as North Korean troops' role in fighting ‌in Russia's Kursk region, according to ​media reports.\n\nUnder a mutual defence pact with ​Russia in 2024, North ​Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian ‌troops against Ukraine, where more ​than 6,000 of ​them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Seoul could not immediately be reached for ​comment by phone. ‌An automated voice message stated the embassy was closed due ​to a public holiday on Monday.",

    "description": "While Shield AI is looking into weapons for the V-BAT, the world's best militaries already have a slew of other strike options, Brandon Tseng told BI.",
    "fullText": "Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's cofounder, said there's a common misconception about his company's signature software-powered drone: People say it needs to be armed.\n\nThe more experienced militaries who work with Shield AI, however, know they don't need that capability in modern war, Tseng told Business Insider.\n\n\"Who doesn't ask for that? The US military doesn't ask for that because we understand joint fires. The Ukrainians don't ask for it anymore, either,\" said the former Navy SEAL, who is Shield AI's president.\n\nThe V-BAT, a vertical takeoff and landing drone that uses artificial intelligence to fly in jammed environments, has primarily been used for intelligence and reconnaissance missions in high-profile conflict zones such as Ukraine. Shield AI said the V-BAT flew over 200 missions there in 2025.\n\nThe drone is still meant to be a multi-mission platform, Tseng said, and Shield AI has been exploring ways to mount weapons on it. The firm announced a partnership last month with South Korean arms manufacturer LIG Nex1 to equip the V-BAT with six-pound guided missiles.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, look: I describe V-BAT as a mini predator, reaper drone,\" Tseng said. \"That's the mission it's doing, which is: It's finding targets. And it's hard to find targets, you have to be out there for a long period of time.\"\n\nTo be fair, the MQ-9 Reaper is also commonly equipped with missiles.\n\nHowever, Tseng said sophisticated militaries already have a vast array of other weapons that can turn the V-BAT's intel into a precision strike.\n\n\"If you have been in these combat zones, the US allies who fought closely with us in Afghanistan, they do not ask for organic fires on board the V-Bat,\" Tseng said. \"Because everybody is so used to just saying: 'Okay, I have a targeting package. What fires asset do I have lined up? Is it a one-way attack drone? Is it HIMARS? Is it artillery? Is it an SM-6? SM-3?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. You can find weapons,\" he added. \"The weapons are available. You need, actually, more intelligence.\"\n\nThis was a framework that Ukraine still needed to improve when the V-BAT began spotting targets there in early 2024, Tseng said. The drone is meant to fly for over 13 hours and be easily deployable, requiring a two-person launch crew and no runway.\n\nTseng said that while Ukraine excelled in tactical drone warfare, its troops weren't used to having a long-range asset that could spot targets for regular strategic attacks as the US military did.\n\n\"The strategic effects would happen, but they would be rare,\" he said. \"They'd be very, very deliberately planned operations, very expensive operations, things like what they did to the Russian runways with sending quadcopters deep into Russia via trucks.\"\n\nUkrainian drone teams would use the V-BAT to find important targets, such as Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, only to realize they hadn't linked up with the right teams to strike them, Tseng said.\n\n\"We'd say: 'Why didn't you guys have these weapons lined up?' They'd say: 'Oh, well, we didn't think to coordinate,'\" Tseng said.\n\nSince then, Kyiv's forces have been using intelligence from V-BATs to carry out strikes with systems such as one-way attack drones or US-made HIMARS, Tseng said.\n\n\"There was a lot of learning over the past year for the Ukrainians,\" he added.",

Having been at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur last summer, Eze has haunted Spurs since opting for their arch-rivals.\n\nEze became the first player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick in the first North London Derby of the season, scoring three times as Arsenal thrashed Tottenham 4-1 at the Emirates.\n\nRecalled to the starting side for the reverse fixture at Spurs this afternoon, he opened the scoring at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for his fourth North London Derby goal of the campaign.\n\nIncredibly, Eze’s goal was his first shot on target in the Premier League since netting his hat-trick goal in that win over Spurs on November 23rd.\n\nHowever, the 27-year-old’s joy was short-lived as Spurs struck back just 24 seconds after the restart.

    "fullText": "The Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II, is so large that it couldn't fit into the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's flagship location on the National Mall in Washington, DC.\n\nInstead, it's displayed at the museum's second location, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.\n\nThe Udvar-Hazy Center features over 200 aircraft on display, but the Enola Gay remains one of the most prominent objects in its collection.\n\nTake a closer look at the historic aircraft.\n\nA second \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, by another Boeing B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar, which is on display at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nThe emperor of Japan announced the country's surrender on August 15.\n\nTibbets commanded the Air Force's 509th Composite Group in charge of deploying nuclear weapons. The hand-picked squadron trained at an abandoned airfield in Windover, Utah.\n\nTo make the B-29 aircraft capable of carrying the atomic bomb, all of its protective and defensive armament, except for the 50-caliber tailguns, were removed to get rid of excess weight. It was also left unpainted, which saved the 850 pounds that the paint would have added.\n\nAt least 70,000 people died in the initial blast from the bombing of Hiroshima, and the death toll over five years may have exceeded 200,000 people due to the aftereffects, according to the US Department of Energy's Office of History and Heritage Resources.\n\nJapan and anti-nuclear weapons scientists released an updated higher estimate in the 1970s that counted 140,000 deaths at Hiroshima.\n\nThe Enola Gay was rattled by shockwaves from the explosion, even as it had already flown 11.5 miles away.\n\nIt took museum staff 300,000 hours to reassemble and restore the Enola Gay, with 12 truckloads transporting all of its parts.\n\nIn 1995, the fuselage and other parts of the Enola Gay were displayed at the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location in Washington, DC, in an exhibit tied to the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nThe script of the exhibit was rewritten several times as various interest groups debated how it was presented and how the decision to drop the bomb was framed, according to the Smithsonian Institution Archives.\n\nVeterans' groups pushed for the exhibit to emphasize Japanese aggression and present the narrative that dropping the atomic bomb saved lives by ending the war. Anti-war activists opposed having the exhibit justify the use of the bomb and sought to highlight its victims by protesting with alternative exhibits on the sidewalk outside the museum.\n\nWeighing 137,500 pounds with a wingspan of 141 feet, the fully assembled plane is too large for the National Air and Space Museum's flagship location on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, offers more room with 340,000 square feet of exhibit space.\n\nThe Enola Gay is displayed among other aircraft from World War II, including the Northrop P-61C Black Widow, the first US aircraft designed for combat at night.\n\nOver 80 years after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Enola Gay remains not just a World War II artifact, but a symbol of a turning point that ushered the world into the nuclear age.\n\nAfter years of debate over how to present the aircraft, the permanent exhibition takes a minimalist approach, leaving visitors to decide how to understand its legacy.",

    "fullText": "Celtic interim chairman Brian Wilson has vowed to seek an end to \"this debilitating and unnecessary atmosphere of conflict\" after a fan protest during Thursday's Europa League game left the Scottish champions fearing disciplinary action.\n\nUefa's disciplinary body will review reports from officials at the game against Stuttgart before deciding what, if any, action will be taken after it was held up for more than three minutes when tennis balls were thrown on to the Celtic Park pitch.\n\nIt is the latest in a long line of protests this season as fans expressed disappointment at the club's board.\n\nMartin O'Neill's side lost the first leg of their knockout play-off 4-1.\n\nScotland set to lose second Champions League place\n\nCeltic's O'Neill seeks 'utopia' after Euro setback\n\nCeltic v Hibs, Bartley & Chermiti in focus\n\n\"Last night was deeply disappointing for the club in many respects,\" Wilson said. \"This started with an orchestrated disruption of the game, causing a delay to an important match.\n\n\"Over the past two weeks, I have met with a range of supporters' groups and individual supporters.\n\n\"I have met in good faith with representatives of the Green Brigade and was hopeful that progress could have been made; indeed this remains the case. I also met in good faith with representatives of the Celtic Fans Collective.\n\n\"When I came into this role, I asked for unity inside the stadium to support the team while trying to resolve other issues. I want to see suspensions lifted and differences set aside, but this cannot be unconditional.\"\n\nWilson had taken over as interim chairman after former chief executive Peter Lawwell stood down in December citing \"abuse and threats\".\n\nRelations appeared to be thawing in January when the Celtic Fans Collective praised Wilson's appeal for unity and appealed for common ground while again calling for changes to the club's hierarchy.\n\nThe latest tennis ball protest led to criticism from team boss O'Neill.\n\n\"Last night's disruption and the reasoning behind it illustrate the difficulty we face and have repeatedly had to contend with,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"This is not intended to deflect from other issues that affect the club and are fully recognised. However, the possibility of further disruptions needs to be addressed urgently.\n\n\"Surely the priority must be to give Martin and our players every opportunity to achieve their objectives within the remainder of the season.\n\n\"On that basis, I will continue to seek an end to this debilitating and unnecessary atmosphere of conflict.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "The World War II submarine USS Lionfish was part of America's \"Silent Service.\"\n\nDespite comprising less than 2% of all US Navy vessels during World War II, submarines like the USS Lionfish sank 55% of Japanese vessels in battle.\n\nThis once-fearsome vessel is now a 311-foot-long museum exhibit, allowing the public to learn about its top-secret wartime operations.\n\nTake a look inside the USS Lionfish.\n\nOver the Balao-class submarine's two war patrols, she sank a Japanese submarine, destroyed a schooner, and rescued the crew of a downed American B-29 bomber.\n\nThe USS Lionfish was recommissioned for the Korean War, serving from 1951 to 1953.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1971, the USS Lionfish served as a reserve training submarine, teaching crew members to operate similar vessels.\n\nTickets to Battleship Cove cost $25 per adult. I visited the museum in January to take a closer look at the retired submarine.\n\nThe forward torpedo room featured six torpedo tubes, each storing a torpedo, and 10 reloads. The 16 crew members slept alongside the torpedoes on pull-out bunks, remaining ready to fire at all times.\n\nIn the officers' pantry, meals for the higher-ranking crew members were reheated and plated on Navy china. They ate the same food as the rest of the sailors, but in a fancier setting.\n\nIt could also serve as an operating room in medical emergencies.\n\nOfficers enjoyed more privacy on board than enlisted men.\n\nThe commanding officer's stateroom featured a small desk that functioned as a private workspace.\n\nChief petty officers served as liaisons between the officers and the crew. This room was also colloquially known as the \"goat locker\" since the more experienced officers were affectionately nicknamed \"old goats.\"\n\nPersonnel files, orders of supplies, and other administrative tasks were the yeoman's domain.\n\nThe commanding officer issued orders from the control center or the conning tower located directly above. The USS Lionfish's conning tower wasn't open to the public, but I did get to look inside one while touring another Balao-class submarine, the USS Becuna.\n\nThe USS Lionfish was equipped with sonar, or \"sound navigation and ranging,\" to listen for enemy ships in the surrounding waters.\n\nThe galley prepared four meals a day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight rations known as \"mid-rats.\"\n\nFrozen and refrigerated food was stored in compartments underneath the floor.\n\nOther Balao-class submarines held 35 or 36 bunks in this space.\n\nEach engine room was responsible for half of the ship's electric and propulsion power.\n\nWhile surfaced, the submarine's four diesel engines powered its generators, which in turn powered the ship's motors. While submerged, storage batteries powered the motors.\n\nAround 13 enlisted men worked and slept in the after torpedo room, which featured four torpedo tubes.\n\nOver 50 submarines underwent a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power 1-A, or \"GUPPY,\" modernization after World War II. However, the USS Lionfish remained as it was.\n\nMuseum staff and volunteers are working to restore the USS Lionfish and preserve its original configuration. Even in frigid temperatures, I saw volunteers holding tools and walking carefully around the deck's open panels, revealing the complex mechanics beneath.",

    "title": "War rooms, group chats, and video games: Inside Elon Musk's AI startup",
    "description": "In the wake of cofounder exits, Elon Musk's hands-on management is reshaping the startup.",
    "fullText": "At xAI's Palo Alto headquarters, engineers cheered.\n\nIt was February 2, and they'd just received a memo from Elon Musk, informing them the AI startup would be acquired by his rocket company, SpaceX. In a Slack channel for the team that trains the company's chatbot Grok, memes flowed, and a few changed their profile pictures to depict themselves as astronauts.\n\nThe excitement was quickly overshadowed by the pressure building inside the startup racing to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic, while preparing for an expected IPO.\n\nOver the past six months, Musk has become deeply involved in day-to-day operations. He's run a massive group chat that's active at all hours, directed product changes, reassigned engineers, cut staff on key teams, and launched intensive \"war rooms\" to accelerate development. Several current and former employees said that the level of involvement has altered how the company functions. Leadership roles have narrowed, projects have shifted quickly, and teams have been pushed into what one described as a constant \"fire drill.\"\n\nMusk said that the changes are necessary as the company scales and the team's lean structure will be the secret to its success. Discussing xAI's restructure following the SpaceX acquisition, he posted on X:\n\n\"As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism.\"\n\nMusk's memo about the SpaceX acquisition talked of building a \"sentient sun\" and data centers in space. Separately, the company reassured staff that little would change in their day-to-day work as the company geared up for an initial public offering that could value it at $1.5 trillion.\n\nWithin a week, however, the tone in the office had shifted. Two of the company's cofounders, Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu, announced they'd resigned as Musk restructured the company and narrowed their responsibilities. The leadership departures increase risk at \"a sensitive stage\" ahead of the company's IPO, said Dimitri Zabelin, a senior AI analyst at PitchBook.\n\nOne employee described co-founder Ba's departure as \"incredibly disheartening,\" saying Ba, who studied under \"Godfather of AI\" Geoffrey Hinton, was one of the most respected researchers at the company.\n\nIn the following days, nearly a dozen employees took to Musk's social media site to say they had also left the company. Some had departed weeks earlier. A few left of their own volition. Others were affected by a restructuring following the SpaceX merger, in which Musk cut some members of the teams working on Grok Imagine, the chatbot's image and video generation feature, and the Macrohard team, which was developed last fall to help automate white-collar work, four people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\nEmployees say the structural changes — coupled with an increasingly intense work culture since Musk wound down his involvement in President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and began focusing more on the AI startup — have significantly increased the pace and pressure inside the company.\n\nMusk is a common sight at the office. Though he's heavily involved in the day-to-day, Musk does not use the company's Slack workspace, several people said. Instead, he communicates frequently through X, including in a direct message group of more than 300 engineers. Often, researchers will drop ongoing work to address the concerns that Musk flags.\n\nIn that chat, according to people familiar with it, Musk shares screenshots of his conversations with other tech executives and points out criticisms of Grok's performance he wants addressed. Late last year, Musk told staff that in conversations with his friends, he had been embarrassed by Grok Imagine's performance. As a result, some workers on the project were called to task, two people said.\n\nInternally, Musk has expressed frustration with the pace of Grok's development. XAI released Grok 4.2 this week. Separately, releases of at least two other products were pushed back by several weeks, according to people familiar with the timelines.\n\nIn one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game \"Baldur's Gate,\" according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.\n\nAcross his companies, Musk has long been known for his intensity. He's said he slept on Tesla's factory floor during the \"production hell\" for the Tesla Model 3 in 2017. The company is now the world's most valuable automaker. Now, xAI is getting the same treatment. Several workers told Business Insider that 12- and sometimes 16-hour workdays are common. Two said managers told them they are expected to respond to Slack messages within 30 minutes, regardless of the time of day.\n\n\"Because the company is so small, everything is a fire drill,\" one former worker said.\n\nAt any given time, multiple \"war rooms\" operate out of conference rooms at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, employees said. When researchers are \"war-rooming,\" teams temporarily relocate to a shared space to work side by side on specific problems — sometimes for months. At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people. One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk's favorite video games, \"League of Legends.\"\n\nLast year, Musk made it clear within the company that xAI would prioritize improving Ani, a hyper-sexualized, anime-inspired AI companion, people with knowledge of the issue said. He characterized Ani, a virtual companion who is capable of sexual role-play, as a way to set xAI apart from other AI companies.\n\nSome employees told Business Insider they were unsettled by the company's focus on the product. Today, the character is displayed prominently at the company's headquarters. At a company holiday party, paid actors dressed as Ani and another character hosted a robot fight club-style event, according to videos shared on social media.\n\nROBOT CAGE MATCHES & GROK'S ANI COSPLAY AT xAI HOLIDAY PARTY\n\nThe Dec 21 bash wasn’t your average tech mixer... xAI went full spectacle with dancing bots and live Optimus cage matches.\n\nAnd a cosplayer stole the spotlight dressed as Grok’s goth 3D persona “Ani,” doubling as a… pic.twitter.com/llhKdLPjsA\n\nSeveral employees said they had joined the company hoping to work on systems that would push the boundaries of science and were discouraged to find significant resources devoted to Ani.\n\nGrok's behavior on social media has also been a source of tension inside the company. Musk has characterized xAI and its chatbot as the \"anti-woke\" counterpart to ChatGPT. Public backlash against the chatbot, including for Grok's series of antisemitic rants and instances in which it digitally undressed people on social media without their consent, has put strain on employees, who have expressed concern about how their place of employment is viewed in the AI space.\n\nUntil last year, the company did not have a team of researchers specifically geared toward working on safety concerns associated with its large language model. It hired its first dedicated safety researcher in February of last year, around the same time that the Human Data team — which trains the chatbot — began reporting issues with reviewing large amounts of X user-generated requests for child sexual abuse material. One person with knowledge of the team said it was known within the company that a large portion of Grok usage was adult role-play, and the use case was discussed in several meetings with researchers.\n\nThe safety team grew to roughly half a dozen employees before three people left in December, shortly before users on X began reporting instances of the chatbot creating non-consensual sexual images of people, including some minors.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the team, xAI's safety teams lacked the authority to formally block product launches and were focused primarily on adjusting model outputs after training rather than conducting broad pre-launch risk reviews.\n\nMusk said on X last week that \"everyone's job is safety\" at xAI.\n\n\"It is not some fake department with no power to assuage the concerns of outsiders,\" he said.\n\nXAI still has a handful of workers in safety roles and was hiring for additional safety staff in January, according to posts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSome former workers say the backlash and pace of work prompted their exit. Last summer, xAI shortened its vesting period from the industry standard of one year to six months, making it easier for workers to leave without forfeiting large portions of their equity.\n\nEmployee retention challenges are not unique to xAI; OpenAI and Anthropic have faced waves of departures in recent months. Across the industry, AI companies are competing fiercely for a limited pool of top researchers, some of whom have begun voicing concern about the narrowing space for exploratory work as companies increasingly orient themselves toward product over research in the competition to build ever larger models — a dynamic that poses a particular problem for xAI, which is younger and smaller than its main competitors.\n\nStill, some analysts say the race is far from settled. Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, compared the current AI landscape to the early days of the internet.\n\n\"I don't think Grok is that far behind, and it's still early in this race,\" Rocco told Business Insider.\n\nMusk has publicly signaled confidence. He told staff last week during the all-hands, referencing xAI's moment of transition: \"There's some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\"\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Even now, safely in her new home of Estonia, Inna Vnukova says she can’t purge the terrifying memory of living under Russian occupation in eastern Ukraine early in the war and her family’s harrowing escape.\n\nThey hid in a damp basement for days in their village of Kudriashivka after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In the streets, soldiers waving machine guns bullied residents, set up checkpoints and looted homes. There was constant shelling.\n\n“Everyone was very scared and afraid to go outside,” Vnukova told The Associated Press, with troops seeking out Ukrainian sympathizers and civil servants like her and her husband, Oleksii Vnukov.\n\nIn mid-March, she decided that she and her 16-year-old son, Zhenya, would flee the village with her brother's family, even though it meant leaving her husband behind temporarily. They took a risky trip by car to nearby Starobilsk, waving a white sheet amid mortar fire.\n\n“We had already said our goodbyes to life, cursing this Russian world,” said Vnukova, 42. “I’ve been trying to forget this nightmare for four years, but I can’t.”\n\nMany Ukrainians like Vnukova fled the invading forces. Those who stayed risked being detained — or worse — as Russian forces eventually took control of about 20% of the country and its estimated 3 million to 5 million people.\n\nAfter four years of war, life in shattered cities like Mariupol and villages like Kudriashivka remains difficult, with residents facing problems with housing, water, power, heat and health care. Even President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged they have “many truly pressing, urgent problems.\"\n\nIn the illegally annexed regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Russian citizenship, language and culture is forced on residents, including in school lessons and textbooks. By spring 2025, some 3.5 million people in the four regions had been given Russian passports — a requirement to receive vital services like health care.\n\nSome in the regions say they live in fear of being accused of sympathizing with Ukraine. Many have been imprisoned, beaten and killed, according to human rights activists.\n\nOleksii Vnukov, a court security officer, stayed behind in the village for nearly two weeks. Russian soldiers twice threatened to kill him, including an instance where he and a friend were dragged off the street by soldiers. But he survived and soon also escaped the village.\n\nThe family traveled through Russia before making it to Estonia, where Inna works in a printing house and Oleksii, 43, is an electrician.\n\n“All life is leaving the occupied territories,” Vnukov said. “The people there aren’t living, they’re just surviving.”\n\nMykhailo Savva of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine said the Russian military's practice of wielding “systemic and total control” in the regions continues today.\n\n“Even though a significant number of socially active people have already been detained, Russian special services continue to identify disloyal Ukrainians, extract confessions, and continue to detain people,” Savva said. “Residents face such practices as document checks, mass searches, and denunciations on a daily basis.”\n\nHuman rights groups say Russian authorities used “filtration camps” to identify potentially disloyal individuals, as well as anyone who worked for the government, helped the Ukrainian army or had relatives in the military, along with journalists, teachers, scientists and politicians.\n\nStanislav Shkuta, 25, who lived in occupied Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, said he narrowly escaped arrest several times before reaching Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2023. He recalled being on a bus that was stopped by Russian soldiers.\n\n“It was horrific. Men and women were asked to strip to the waist to see if they had Ukrainian tattoos,” said Shkuta, who now lives in Estonia. “I turned white with fear, wondering if I’d cleared everything on my phone.”\n\nHe said his friends who stayed in Nova Kakhovka say life has worsened, with suspected Ukrainian sympathizers stopped on the street or in surprise door-to-door inspections.\n\n“Today, my friends complain that life there has become impossible,” he said.\n\nRussia established a “vast network of secret and official detention centers where tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians” are held indefinitely without charge, said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties.\n\n“Everyone knows that if you end up in the basement, your life is worth nothing,” she said.\n\nRussian officials have refused to comment on past allegations by U.N. human rights officials that it tortures civilians and prisoners of war.\n\nAbout 16,000 civilians have been detained illegally, but that number could be much higher because many are held incommunicado. said Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets.\n\nA U.N. report released last summer said that between July 2024 and June 2025, it spoke to 57 civilians who were detained in the occupied regions, and that 52 of them told of severe beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence, degradation and threats of violence.\n\nOne particularly famous case is that of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna, 27, who disappeared in 2023 while reporting near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and died in Russian custody. When her body was handed over to Ukraine in 2025, it bore signs of torture, with some of her organs removed, a prosecutor said.\n\n“Russia uses terror in the occupied territories to physically eliminate active people working in certain fields: teachers, children’s writers, musicians, mayors, journalists, environmentalists. It also intimidates the passive majority,” Matviichuk says.\n\nAt the start of the war, Russian forces besieged Mariupol before the port city fell in May 2022. The Russian bombing of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater on March 16 of that year killed close to 600 people in and around the building, an AP investigation found, in the single deadliest known attack against civilians in the war.\n\nMost of the city's population of about a half-million fled but many hid in basements, said a former actor who huddled for months with his parents, saying they were nearly killed by the Russian bombing.\n\nThe former actor, now in Estonia, spoke on condition of anonymity to not endanger his 76-year-old parents, still in Mariupol. They had to take Russian citizenship to get medical care, as well as a one-time payment equivalent to $1,300 per person as compensation for their destroyed home, he said.\n\nAs in other occupied cities, Russification is taking place in Mariupol, changing street names, teaching Moscow-approved curriculum in schools, using Russian phone and TV networks and putting the city in Moscow's time zone.\n\n“But even today, the threat of death has not gone away. Only those who have Russian passports can survive,″ the former actor said, adding that his parents have asked him not to send postcards in Ukrainian because “it could be dangerous.”\n\nPutin \"openly states that there is no Ukrainian language, no Ukrainian culture, no Ukrainian nation. And in the occupied territories, these words are turning into terrible practice,” Matviichuk said.\n\nBut not everyone opposes the Russian takeover in Mariupol. The former actor says half of the members of his old troupe now support the Kremlin and believe Kyiv “provoked the war.”\n\nHousing is a sore point in Mariupol, where the population is about half of what it was before 2022. New apartment blocks rose from the ruins, but rather than going to those who lost their homes, they are sold to Russian newcomers.\n\nSome who lost their homes have made video appeals to Putin. “You said we ‘don’t abandon our own.’ Do we not count as your own?” said one resident at a mass rally.\n\nAt least 12,191 apartments in Mariupol were added to a list of purportedly “ownerless” and abandoned flats to be expropriated in the first half of 2025. Thousands more are being seized elsewhere.\n\nMoscow is encouraging Russian citizens to move to the occupied regions, offering a range of benefits. Teachers, doctors and cultural workers are promised salary supplements if they commit to living there for five years.\n\nYears of war and neglect have saddled many occupied cities in eastern Ukraine with serious problems in supplying heat, electricity and water.\n\nThe northeastern city of Sievierodonetsk suffered significant destruction before falling to Russia in June 2022. Once home to 140,000 people, only 45,000 remain, mostly elderly or disabled.\n\nOnly one ambulance crew serves the whole city, and doctors and other health workers rotate in from Russian regions like Perm to work at its hospital, said a 67-year-old former engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nBut she still supports “the great work Putin is doing,” because she was born and raised in the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn Alchevsk, a city in the Luhansk region, over half the homes have been without heat for two bitterly cold months. Five warming stations have been set up and utility companies said over 60% of municipal heating networks are in poor shape, without funds for repairs.\n\nEven a pro-Moscow politician, Oleg Tsaryov, has accused authorities of freezing “an entire city.” When the heating system failed in 2006, he noted on social media that Ukrainian authorities \"and the entire country stepped in to help and completely replaced the faulty equipment.” But after the Russian takeover, officials had “contrived to repeat this Armageddon scenario all over again,” he added.\n\nIn the Donetsk region, water trucks fill barrels outside apartment blocks — but they freeze solid in winter, said a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions.\n\n“There's constant squabbling over water,” she said, adding that lines to get the precious resource are “insane,” and people who are away at work often miss the trucks' arrival.\n\nDonetsk residents wrote an appeal for Putin to intervene in what has become \"a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe.”\n\nPutin last year acknowledged the plight in the four regions.\n\n“I know how difficult it is now for the residents of the liberated cities and towns. There are many truly pressing, urgent problems,\" he said, marking the third anniversary of incorporating those areas into Russia. He cited the need for reliable water supplies and access to health care, among other issues, and said he has launched a \"large-scale socioeconomic development program” for the regions.\n\nMeanwhile, Inna Vnukova is building a new life in Estonia: She and Oleksii now have a 1-year-old daughter, Alisa. Their son is now 20.\n\nOnly about 150 people — including the couple's parents — remain in the village that once was home to 800, Vnukova said, adding that she would like to show her daughter the family's native Luhansk region someday.\n\n“We’ve been dreaming of returning for four years, but we increasingly wonder — what will we see there?” she asked.\n\nKatie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates fell sharply this week as tensions between the US and Iran stoked the possibility of military conflict. Inflation concerns also lingered, as evidenced in the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell 8 basis points to 6.01% for the week ending Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac. That's the lowest level since September 2022. The 15-year fixed dropped 9 basis points to 5.35%.\n\n“This lower rate environment is not only improving affordability for prospective homebuyers, it’s also strengthening the financial position of homeowners,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. \"Over the past year, refinance application activity has more than doubled, enabling many recent buyers to reduce their annual mortgage payments by thousands of dollars.”\n\nIndeed, refinance applications increased over the past week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Tim Torline, president of investments at Ducenta Squared in Los Angeles, said the rise can be attributed to a small slice of borrowers with higher original loan rates.\n\n“Refinancing activity is likely to be moderate in the near-term, with the market likely on hold until mortgage rates fall below the 6% psychological threshold,” Torline said in a statement.\n\nDiscover the best mortgage refinance lenders\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: things you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate, not just with banks, but also with credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is an amazing mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on your financial goals when refinancing, how long you plan to stay in the same house, and on your break-even point after paying the refinance closing costs.\n\nWhat caused mortgage rates to fall this week?\n\nHow are lower rates affecting refinance activity?\n\nHow do 30-year and 15-year rates compare?\n\nWhat factors determine current mortgage rate levels?\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after.

    "description": "The Carthaginian general famously used elephants during the Punic Wars. But until now, archaeologists had never found skeletal remains linking the animals to the conflict",
    "fullText": "In 2019, archaeologists unearthed a strange bone alongside a trove of ancient catapult projectiles in Córdoba, Spain. According to a study published this month in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, the bone may be from one of Hannibal’s war elephants, which the Carthaginian general used against Romans in the Second Punic War.\n\nThe bone “could prove to be a landmark,” lead author Rafael Martínez Sánchez, an archaeologist at the University of Cordoba, tells Live Science’s Tom Metcalfe. Until now, “there has been no direct archaeological testimony for the use of these animals.”\n\nThe dig was conducted ahead of construction for a medical facility on the Colina de los Quemados archaeological site. Archaeologists documented evidence of occupation at the site across hundreds of years beginning around the Late Bronze Age. However, their most intriguing discoveries date to the late Iron Age.\n\nAlong with stone artillery and coins, researchers unearthed a “short, cube-shaped bone,” measuring nearly four inches long. Eventually, they determined that the bone likely came from the right leg of an African or Asian elephant.\n\n“It could belong to the period of the Punic Wars,” Martínez Sánchez told El Pais’ Vicente G. Olaya in 2023. “It could be the first of Hannibal’s elephants to be discovered. We can’t know for sure, but it was certainly a sizable beast.”\n\nIn the years since, researchers have continued studying the bone. Because it is poorly preserved, DNA and protein analyses have proved inconclusive. The species of elephant also remains unconfirmed. However, after radiocarbon testing, researchers were able to conclude that the elephant died between the fourth and third centuries B.C.E.\n\nThis timeline aligns with the Second Punic War, which occurred in the third century B.C.E. This conflict was part of the series of wars between Rome and Carthage, an ancient city in modern-day Tunisia.\n\nStudy co-author Agustín López Jiménez, an expert at the archaeology company Arqueobética, which excavated the site, told El Pais that researchers found the elephant foot bone beneath some collapsed adobe walls dating to around the third century B.C.E. According to the study, the same area revealed 12 three-pound stone balls, which were “unquestionably artillery projectiles for lithoboloi,” a kind of catapult.\n\nThe Second Punic War began after Hannibal attacked Saguntum, a city on the Iberian Peninsula that had allied with Rome. When Carthage refused to withdraw, Rome declared war in 218 B.C.E.\n\nHannibal led his forces northeast from the Iberian Peninsula, aiming for the Alps. The general planned to enter Italy from the north and attack, forcing the Romans to defend their turf. Hannibal’s army reportedly included some 30,000 soldiers, 15,000 horses and 37 war elephants. The mountain march was brutal, and he lost many of the elephants along the way.\n\nDespite the historical record, archaeologists had never found skeletal remains of elephants connected to the Punic Wars—until the Córdoba bone. The researchers say that this bone didn’t come from “one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps.” However, Martínez Sánchez tells IFLScience’s Russell Moul, the discovery “is the first time an elephant bone remnant linked to that chronology has been found in Iberia and, to our knowledge, in Europe.”",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine's popular ex-military chief has provided new details of a rift with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, threatening to deepen a long-simmering conflict between the ‌two wartime leaders amid new speculation around post-war elections.\n\nGeneral Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, who served as ‌Kyiv's top commander until February 2024 and is now its ambassador to London, told the Associated Press in an ​interview published on Wednesday that he felt threatened by a 2022 raid by security agents and blamed Zelenskiy for a major battlefield failure.\n\nThe remarks provide fresh context to a potential rivalry that has long gripped Kyiv's political class.\n\nOpinion polls have consistently shown Zaluzhnyi to be Zelenskiy's main challenger in any ‌future election, although he has ⁠never voiced any ambition to run for office.\n\nZelenskiy, facing U.S. pressure to quickly secure a peace deal in Russia's four-year war, has signalled his readiness ⁠to hold elections when fighting ends.\n\nHis office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Zaluzhnyi's remarks on the 2022 raid. In his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskiy did not directly ​comment on ​the AP interview but spoke of the importance ​of national unity and working together to ‌ensure Ukraine’s survival.\n\n\"Any other politics in Ukraine is absolutely unnecessary at present… Personal matters (are for) later,\" he said.\n\nSECURITY RAID, MILITARY MISMANAGEMENT\n\nSpeaking in London, Zaluzhnyi described how his office was raided in September 2022 by dozens of agents from Ukraine's SBU security service, which answers to Zelenskiy.\n\nZaluzhnyi said he then called Zelenskiy's chief of staff with a warning that he would deploy troops to ‌protect his command centre, having already called in reinforcements ​to Kyiv.\n\nThe SBU's press service told Reuters an address used ​by Zaluzhnyi as a covert post ​had been listed in an unrelated organised crime case, and that no ‌searches were carried out.\n\nZaluzhnyi also pinned the failure ​of a much-vaunted 2023 ​counteroffensive on Zelenskiy, saying he did not commit the necessary resources to the campaign.\n\nAimed at breaking Russian defences, it ended mostly in an embarrassing string of defeats for Kyiv. ​Zaluzhnyi said his original plan ‌to focus on a single axis had been overridden by Zelenskiy's order to push ​across much of the front line.",

    "description": "Jamal...",
    "fullText": "Using an old playbook with powerful new tools, it may be closer than ever to turning a US–Iran war into reality.\n\nAs President Trump continues assembling an “armada” in the Middle East, decades of political efforts to maneuver the United States into war with Iran may finally be coming to fruition. Yet rather than delivering “help” to Iranians in the form of American bombs—and pulling the US into a potentially open-ended conflict that many experts say would make the invasion of Iraq look like a cakewalk—Trump has, for now, pivoted to negotiations. While the possibility of an agreement remains a long shot, the Iran war industry is pulling out all the stops to ensure its long-sought window for another regime-change war does not close.\n\nUS policy on Iran is one of the most aggressively one-sided political contests in Washington. The sprawling ecosystem pushing for war includes foreign leaders like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rushed to Washington this past week to run interference as US talks with Iran showed signs of promise. It also includes the lobbying power of groups like AIPAC and their affiliated dark-money political operations like Democratic Majority for Israel and United Democracy Project. And it includes think tanks like the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which frequently dominate the roster of expert witnesses invited to testify at Iran-related congressional hearings.\n\nCampaigns for regime-change wars often follow a familiar playbook, and there is no shortage of actors vying to play the role of Ahmad Chalabi, who fed the George W. Bush administration false intelligence and promises that the United States could create democracy on the cheap to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Today, the leading candidate may be the US-based son of the deposed shah, Reza Pahlavi, who has openly aligned with the Netanyahu government, defended Israel’s June war on Iran, and is now appealing to Donald Trump for US military intervention.\n\nIn the social-media age, the ability to promote an agenda, amplify certain voices, and ostracize others has ensured the push for war is not confined to the halls of power in Washington. It is also being fought aggressively in the digital sphere, where influence operations and coordinated harassment are reshaping debate within the Iranian diaspora. Anyone who has waded into Iran discussions online is familiar with the organized harassment—including threats, intimidation, and accusations against anyone seen as too dovish or insufficiently loyal to a particular opposition figure as being an agent of the Islamic Republic. Independent investigations have shown that this phenomenon is far from organic. Reporting by Haaretz and Citizen Lab last year found that Israel’s intelligence minister facilitated cyber operations promoting regime change in Iran and elevating Reza Pahlavi as a viable governing alternative. There is significant evidence that Israel, the United States, and the Islamic Republic itself are artificially shaping online debates and posing as a radical opposition to police allegiances and fuel division.\n\nThese efforts are not isolated—they are part of a broader strategy to eliminate voices that could prevent conflict and sustain diplomacy. The threats and harassment have intimidated many in the Iranian diaspora into silence, particularly those opposed to sanctions that have impoverished ordinary Iranians while enriching corrupt elites and those who reject the notion that liberation can be delivered by American missiles.\n\nIn turn, some mainstream media outlets have been happy to launder online conspiracy theories through more reputable channels. This dynamic was on display in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial published just as renewed US-Iran negotiations were set to begin. The piece, which attacked my organization and separately Human Rights Watch, relied on a clip from Iranian state television featuring a hard-line professor and students discussing whether there should be an “Iranian lobby” in the United States. One student falsely suggests that Iranian reformists—rather than Iranian Americans who favor peace—had created NIAC to serve as Iran’s lobby. Prominent accounts began circulating the clip not as idle speculation by uninformed sources but instead as a smoking gun against us, and eventually the Journal decided to amplify the claim. In so doing, the Journal lent credibility to a conspiracy theory that originated two decades ago among Iranian hard-liners who sought to discredit their domestic opponents who supported engagement with the West as American toadies.\n\nSome may find it ironic that avowed opponents of the Islamic Republic and advocates for bombing Iran are channeling conspiracies from Iranian hard-liners to silence their opponents here. Or that rival governments are both fueling online influence campaigns while claiming to represent authentic voices of the Iranian people. But this dynamic is not new: Hard-liners here and hard-liners there have long formed a feedback loop, each using the other to justify their agendas at home. Now, with social media, their efforts are more connected—and powerful actors are hard at work to manipulate the medium to reshape views of reality.\n\nNow, as the United States and Iran sit on the precipice of all-out military confrontation and a second US aircraft carrier heads to the region, the durability of diplomacy remains uncertain. Forces on all sides determined to derail negotiations will continue working to silence moderate voices that threaten a march toward war. The greatest danger to diplomacy is not simply governments themselves—it is the mutually reinforcing political ecosystems that depend on perpetual confrontation. Using an old playbook with powerful new tools, they may be closer than ever to turning a US–Iran war into reality.",

    "description": "Gurney, Gallacher and Carter are some of the iconic names to feature in part two of this historical series!",
    "fullText": "Following the same criteria as our examination of Sunderland’s homegrown post-war footballers, part two applies the same rules to discover whether we’ve produced any players who scored more than Gary Rowell’s 103 goals for the club.\n\nJust as this meant ruling out anyone the club purchased such as Kevin Phillips, Marco Gabbiadini, Brian Clough and Len Shackleton, there are some big-name pre-war players to be excluded, such as Charlie Buchan (signed from Arsenal), Dave Halliday (signed from Dundee) and Arthur Bridgett (signed from Stoke).\n\nSo, who does that leave to consider from a period when Sunderland won six league titles, an FA Cup, and were considered one of the top clubs in the country?\n\nCarter would be one player who you would put your house on to have come through the ranks at Sunderland and scored a number of goals in excess of Rowell’s total.\n\nWidely heralded as one of Sunderland’s greatest players, Carter was born in Hendon, became a league winner and FA Cup-winning captain, and also played for Sunderland and England schoolboys.\n\nHowever, he didn’t sign for Sunderland straight from school when he left at fourteen years of age. In fact, he actually knocked them back on the advice of his guardian (his uncle, following the death of his father) because he wanted the young Carter to learn a trade.\n\nThus, he became an apprentice electrician while playing for an amateur side. He signed amateur forms for Sunderland in 1931, aged seventeen, while also having a trial for Leicester City who turned him down.  Eventually, he was taken on as a professional for Sunderland.\n\nCan this rule Carter out? It almost feels like sacrilege to do so, so I’ll leave it for others to debate.\n\nAnother of our pre-war legends and club record scorer.\n\nA teammate of Carter, Silksworth-born Gurney was a goalscoring powerhouse of the 1930s. Like Carter, he won the Championship and FA Cup, and was honoured with a mural on the side of a building.\n\nOur record scorer played for his hometown club, living the “Roy of the Rovers” dream forty years before Rowell even made his debut — yet Gurney also didn’t sign for Sunderland straight from school.\n\nHe was spotted playing for Bishop Auckland at seventeen years of age (apparently by Charlie Buchan), and there’s a heated discussion with a beer or five at the kitchen table to be had late into the night here.\n\nThese three fantastic players were recruited by Sunderland — then newly-elected to the Football League — around the age of twenty by then-manager Tom Watson.\n\nThey shouldn’t really qualify under the criteria as they weren’t produced by the club, but we didn’t produce anyone through a youth system at that point.\n\nCampbell arrived in 1889 and Millar came in 1890 — both from Scottish clubs — and Hannah came in 1891 from Sunderland Albion. Campbell and Millar were with Sunderland as a Football League club from the kick of the first ball in 1890, whilst Hannah came just one year later.\n\nThey scored just over 250 goals between them as Sunderland became champions in only their second season in the league. Campbell fired Sunderland to three league titles while Millar won four with the Lads over two spells.\n\nThere are three striking similarities between Holley and Rowell.\n\nThe first is obvious in that they each scored over 100 goals for the club. The second is not so in that they both happened to have been born in Seaham, but do you know the third?\n\nThey both scored a hat trick for Sunderland at St. James’ Park, with Holley hitting three in Sunderland’s record away win — a 9-1 victory at Newcastle on 5 December 1908.\n\nLike Carter and Gurney, Holley played local football with non-league clubs before being spotted by Sunderland’s scouts, signing in 1904 as an eighteen-year-old. He then went on to win the First Division title in 1913 as part of a team that came so close to winning the double.\n\nHe scored eleven hat tricks for Sunderland and hit eight goals in ten appearances for England. He was still in his prime at only twenty eight years old when the First World War brought his career at the top of the game to a halt — and he would’ve been a strong challenger to Gurney’s record total.\n\nScottish-born Gallacher played for Linwood St Coval and Bridge of Weir before moving to Sunderland as an eighteen-year-old in 1928.\n\nNew manager Johnny Cochrane brought the outside left into the Sunderland team alongside Carter and Gurney, as they slowly became a force in English football in the 1930s.\n\nPredominantly a winger, Gallacher would often change positions with Carter and he could also play on the right. He was a key member of the team that won the league title in 1936, the FA Cup in 1937 and also reached the semi-final in 1938 — a game that seems to have been forgotten over time.\n\nLater that year, he was transferred to Stoke City and just one year later, the Second World War effectively brought his career to an end.\n\nI apologise if I’ve missed out any glaring candidates, and I have to say this was very much a step into the unknown for myself in terms of what I would find, especially during the pre-war era.\n\nI also have to credit my fellow Roker Report writers Andy Tomlinson and Kelvin Beattie for helping to point me in the right direction. Andrew Smithson was also a huge help in fact-checking the player stats and the accuracy of the summary.\n\nI certainly expected at least a couple of the huge names from the pre-war era to have at least signed for the club on either amateur or professional terms upon leaving school, but in summary, it seems that prior to World War Two, there was a Sunderland schoolboy side, but this was run by teachers.\n\nSunderland Association Football Club would offer terms to any worthy players — either as amateurs or professionals, as they tried to do with Carter — and they certainly would develop young players in the A team.\n\nHowever, they did put a lot of faith in scouting local talent and as can be seen from some of the names above, this proved to be a pretty fruitful policy. Yet times were different and nowadays, promising schoolboy players are heavily courted by clubs from all areas of the country to sign with their academies from a very young age. Clubs just didn’t have the resources and means to undertake the present day policies in that era.\n\nPost-war, Sunderland had a junior side and completely bought into the benefits of the youth setup from the Alan Brown era onwards.\n\nFrom the 1960s through to the 1990s, there are several names in each decade that became mainstays in the first team. Goalscorers are less common and Gary Rowell remains the only player produced by Sunderland to have scored over one hundred goals for the club since the Second World War — an eighty-year period.\n\nOther than Rowell, only three other players to have scored over one hundred goals in their career have been produced by Sunderland: Dennis Tueart, John O’Hare and Colin West. If you can think of any others, by all means get in touch with us here at Roker Report.\n\nHowever, consider how many other players have achieved the same feat across football — that of scoring more than one hundred goals for the club that produced them. There are players out there that’ve done it, and many are big names.\n\nHarry Kane, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen, Matt Le Tissier, Jimmy Greaves (for Chelsea), George Best, Bobby Charlton, and Gary Lineker for Leicester City (who matched Gary Rowell’s record of 103 goals) spring to mind, and Clough also did it for Middlesborough.\n\nIf you consider the British-born record goalscorers in the Premier League who don’t qualify, such as Frank Lampard, Jermain Defoe, Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney, it puts it in a more enlightening context — and perhaps Gary Rowell was more unique than we all thought.",

    "title": "Ukraine's drone war showed the West it needs to view small drones less like prized gear and more like expendable ammo",
    "description": "Western militaries often view new technology as precious and valuable. Ukraine shows that they can't afford to view small drones that way.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's large-scale drone war is pushing Western militaries to treat small drones less as high-end equipment and more as expendable ammunition that isn't meant to come back.\n\nUS Army and British Army officials, as well as a NATO veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine, told Business Insider that effective drone warfare requires sending large numbers forward — and accepting many will be lost as a routine cost.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the US Army's new drone lethality course, told Business Insider that the conflict shows that \"if you're going to flood the zone with drones,\" especially in a combat situation where electronic warfare is heavy, \"you're going to lose a lot of drones.\"\n\nShe said it's a \"transition from the army of old,\" where a lost drone was \"a significant emotional event\" that was reported to senior leadership. In Ukraine, it's different. \"Drones go down all the time.\" There, losses are typically shrugged off, rather than investigated.\n\nThat shifting mindset is shaping how Western militaries train.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the British Army's 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, told Business Insider that his battalion has changed its training to allow drones to be damaged or even destroyed to reflect battlefield realities. \"I absolutely think they need to be disposable because otherwise you're not training realistically,\" he said.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that if NATO militaries want to start using drones for real missions, they \"need to get used to the fact that they're basically expendable material more akin to ammunition or fuel or gasoline, things like that, rather than specialized high-end pieces of equipment that need to be looked after.\"\n\nHe said when he was serving in the military for his home country, \"drones were very specialized pieces of equipment.\"\n\nThe drones were fairly expensive, he shared, \"and there was always a sort of bureaucratic process\" in using them. Sometimes, only designated individuals were allowed to use the drones.\n\nIf something happened to a drone, \"that would've been a big problem in training. If we had lost a drone, somebody would've been in big trouble for that.\" The war in Ukraine shows how poorly that peacetime mindset fits large-scale combat.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has featured drones on an unprecedented scale. Ukraine says roughly 80% of its strikes are carried out using drones rather than other weapons. Many never reach their targets and are lost along the way, though.\n\nCheap drones worth several hundred dollars have destroyed weaponry worth millions. But many of them don't have any effect. A report last year from the UK's Royal United Services Institute said that \"between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\"\n\nSome drones are jammed or disrupted by electronic warfare, while others are shot down or get their cables cut. Sometimes they're knocked out by soldiers on their own side.\n\nMany of the drones on the battlefield are single-use, designed to explode when they hit their target, but many of them are destroyed, damaged, or disabled before they even reach that point.\n\nJajcay said that even drones designed to be used again and again \"have a lifespan of maybe a few dozen missions at most.\"\n\nHe also said that drones failed \"all the time,\" and those losses were expected.\n\nThe US Army is recognizing and learning from these dynamics in Ukraine, as are other Western militaries, as they incorporate the idea that drones cannot be treated as overly precious assets into their drone warfare training and doctrine.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that out of the thousands of drones used daily, only around 30% of them hit their targets, while many others don't have a significant impact on their targets.\n\nThe Army is learning that lots of drones need to be sent forward.\n\nIrwin-Clark told Business Insider that the way the UK sees drones has also shifted. He said \"every time there's an iterative change in technology in the battlefield, everyone gets very excited about it and the ownership of that asset tends to be far too high.\"\n\nHe said that often when a new and powerful technology emerges, senior leaders will try to tightly control it, arguing that because there are only a handful available, only a select few should have the authority to decide when it's used. The assets are carefully protected, at least initially. Later on, trust is imparted to soldiers to handle technology previously in the charge of higher-ups.\n\nThat pattern, Irwin-Clark said, is \"exactly what's happening with drones.\"\n\nHis battalion wrapped the first drones it received years ago in bubble wrap, \"and we didn't fly them very often,\" he said. \"When we did,\" he continued, \"we made sure we flew in the middle of a field with nothing, no obstacles around.\"\n\nNow, his battalion is deliberately crashing its latest drone delivery into targets, while looking at how to make repairs. \"It really doesn't matter if we break them,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nThe US is coming at it the same way. Martin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said her course takes into account that \"drones crash. I'll say that to the day I die having owned drones as a commander: drones crash.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last year that the defense department needs to view small drones as consumables rather than \"durable property\" — more like ammunition than valuable equipment. It's a change that Jajcay described as \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nWestern armies were using various drones in warfare before Russia's invasion, often using them as surveillance platforms or tools for launching missile strikes. Small drones weren't used the way they're being used in Ukraine, but the US, UK, and others are learning drone lessons from the war.\n\nMartin said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine shows that even when you lose drones, it's ultimately \"still cheaper than employing missiles on specific targets.\" That's an equation the US Army can't totally ignore.\n\n\"They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger\" to carry out the mission, she shared. And the Army knows that \"they're going to crash. It's going to happen.\"",

    "fullText": "The rivalry between xAI and OpenAI is heating up again — this time, over wood-fired pizza.\n\nOver the weekend, Elon Musk and an OpenAI engineer jockeyed on X about wood-fired crusts, dough fermentation, and campus chefs.\n\nOn its face, it was a lighthearted back-and-forth about free pizza for lunch. Underneath, it encapsulates a trend playing out in Silicon Valley: rival AI companies are publicly pitching culture — and perks like free lunch — in the talent war for top engineers.\n\nThe exchange began when Musk reposted a video of an xAI engineer calling his job the \"opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\nJoin @xAI https://t.co/Fo3kjhaTXA\n\nThe post quickly drew a response from xAI's competitor, OpenAI.\n\n\"Or join Codex,\" said Thibault Sottiaux, an engineering lead working on OpenAI's Codex software agent, who is also hiring. OpenAI operates \"with much of the same principles,\" he wrote — before adding an increasingly common recruitment pitch.\n\n\"Join the bright side, we have pizza,\" Sottiaux wrote.\n\nJoin the bright side, we have pizza\n\nMusk fired back: \"But how good is your wood oven pizza?\"\n\nThe pizza posturing then shifted to ingredients — and the corporate chefs preparing them.\n\n\"But how about the dough?\" he wrote back. \"Can't take shortcuts, needs 24 hours at least. And our chef is 🔥.\"\n\nOur chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation 👼\n\n\"Our chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation,\" Musk replied.\n\n\"And after having a bite, he wasn't 100% satisfied and asked our chef to improve upon the SoTA,\" Sottiaux said. \"Our chef delivered, and created a recipe now universally credited to accelerating the AGI timeline.\"\n\nThe tomato pie-based banter was sweet — but the subtext was spicier.\n\nAI labs are locked in a high-stakes dash for elite engineers, with high-end compensation packages stretching into the nine-figure territory.\n\nCompanies including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Musk's xAI are competing for a relatively small pool of researchers capable of building the next generation of models and infrastructure.\n\nAside from money, two key perks have emerged in the AI talent wars, according to professional AI poacher Mark Zuckerberg: access to GPUs and fewer direct reports.\n\n\"People say, 'I want the fewest number of people reporting to me and the most GPUs,'\" Zuckerberg said in 2025 TITV interview.\n\nAt the same time, the broader tech industry has pulled back on many of the pre-pandemic perks amid cost-cutting. Remote work has narrowed, layoffs have gathered steam, and perks like pet care stipends and expansive wellness benefits are becoming less common for new hires.\n\nBut there's one perk that has remained: the fancy lunch spread.\n\nMight as well throw in wood-fired pizza, too.",

    "fullText": "More than 80 current and former participants of the Berlinale have signed an open letter to the festival condemning what it claims has been its “silence” when it comes to the conflict in Gaza and the “censoring” of artists who have spoken out.\n\nActors Tilda Swinton, Javier Bardem, Angeliki Papoulia, Saleh Bakri, Tatiana Maslany, Peter Mullan and Tobias Menzies, as well as directors Mike Leigh, Lukas Dhont, Nan Goldin, Miguel Gomes, Adam McKay and Avi Mograbi are among the signatories of the letter, which says they “expect the institutions in our industry to refuse complicity in the terrible violence that continues to be waged against Palestinians.”\n\n'Wolfram' Review: Tough but Tender-Hearted Colonial-Era Australian Western Tracks a Family's Efforts to Reunite\n\nSeries Creators Push Back as the Industry Gets 'Nervous' About Important Stories and Female Perspective: 'The Content Might Be Different Enough to Actually Make a Difference'\n\nTobias Nölle Returns to Berlinale Panorama With Hybrid Island Portrait 'Tristan Forever'\n\nThe letter lands the middle of the 2026 edition of the Berlinale in which the topics of politics has become a central theme, most notably following comments by jury head Wim Wenders in the opening press conference. When asked about Gaza and the support the German government — which funds much of the festival — has shown for Israel, he said “we should stay out of politics” and claimed that filmmaking was “the opposite of politics.” The uproar that followed prompted festival head Tricia Tuttle to put a statement in which she said: “Artists should not be expected to comment on all broader debates about a festival’s previous or current practices over which they have no control.”\n\nIn the open letter, the signatories assert that they “fervently disagree” with Wenders views on filmmaking and politics. “You cannot separate one from the other,” they say, adding that the “tide is changing across the international film world,” citing the refusal of more than 5,000 film workers, including several major Hollywood names, to work with “complicit Israeli film companies and institutions.”\n\nThe letter notes that the Berlinale has made “clear statements” in the past about “atrocities” carried out against people in Iran and Ukraine.\n\n“We call on the Berlinale to fulfil its moral duty and clearly state its opposition to Israel’s genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes against Palestinians, and completely end its involvement in shielding Israel from criticism and calls for accountability,” it concludes.\n\nSee the full letter and list of signatories below.\n\nOpen Letter to the Berlinale — Feb. 17, 2026\n\nWe write as film workers, all of us past and current Berlinale participants, who expect the institutions in our industry to refuse complicity in the terrible violence that continues to be waged against Palestinians. We are dismayed at the Berlinale’s involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and the German state’s key role in enabling it. As the Palestine Film Institute has stated, the festival has been “policing filmmakers alongside a continued commitment to collaborate with Federal Police on their investigations”.\n\nLast year, filmmakers who spoke out for Palestinian life and liberty from the Berlinale stage reported being aggressively reprimanded by senior festival programmers. One filmmaker was reported ​t​o have been investigated by police, and Berlinale leadership falsely implied that ​t​he filmmaker’s moving speech – rooted in international law and solidarity – was “discriminatory”. As another filmmaker told Film Workers for Palestine​ about last year’s festival: “there was a feeling of paranoia in the air, of not being protected and of being persecuted, which I had never felt before at a film festival”. We stand with our colleagues in rejecting this institutional repression and anti-Palestinian racism.\n\nWe fervently disagree with ​the statement made by Berlinale​ 2026 jury president Wim Wenders​ that filmmaking is “the opposite of politics”​. You cannot separate one from the other. We are deeply concerned that the German state-funded Berlinale is helping put into practice what Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion recently condemned as Germany’s misuse of draconian legislation “to restrict advocacy for Palestinian rights, chilling public participation and shrinking discourse in academia and the arts”​. This is also what Ai Weiwei recently described​ as Germany “doing what they did in the 1930s”​ (agreeing with his interviewer who suggested to him that “it’s the same fascist impulse, just a different target​”). All of this at a time when we are learning horrifying new details about the 2,842 Palestinians “evaporated” by Israeli forces using internationally prohibited, U.S.-made thermal and thermobaric weapons. Despite abundant evidence of Israel’s genocidal intent, systematic atrocity crimes and ethnic cleansing, Germany continues to supply Israel with weapons used to exterminate Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe tide is changing across the international film world. Many international film festivals have endorsed the cultural boycott of apartheid Israel, including the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam, the world’s biggest, as well as BlackStar Film Festival in the U.S., and Film Fest Gent, Belgium’s largest. More than 5,000 film workers, including leading Hollywood and international figures, have also announced their refusal to work with complicit Israeli film companies and institutions.\n\nYet Berlinale has so far not even met the demands of its community to issue a statement that affirms the Palestinian right to life, dignity, and freedom; condemns the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians; and commits to uphold the right of artists to speak without constraint in support of Palestinian human rights. This is the least it can – and should – do.\n\nAs the Palestine Film Institute has said, “we are appalled by Berlinale’s institutional silence on the genocide of Palestinians, and its unwillingness to defend the freedoms of speech and expression of filmmakers”. Just as ​t​he festival has ​m​ade clear statements ​in the past about atrocities ​carried out against​ people in Iran and Ukrain​e, we call on the Berlinale to fulfil its moral duty and clearly state its opposition to Israel’s genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes against Palestinians, and completely end its involvement in shielding Israel from criticism and calls for accountability.\n\n'Goat' Cast Guide: All the Celebrities and NBA Stars Voicing Animals in the Basketball Movie\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026",

    "fullText": "A suspect accused of shooting and killing two people at a Rhode Island ice rink on Monday before killing himself was identified as transgender and had a history of past family conflict over his gender identity, a local news outlet reported, citing court documents.\n\nCourt records show Robert Dorgan had been involved in multiple disputes with relatives in recent years, including allegations that tensions escalated after he underwent gender reassignment surgery, according to Wpri.\n\nDorgan, 56, is accused of opening fire inside the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a hockey game between Coventry and Blackstone Valley Schools in what police described as a \"family dispute,\" Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said at a press conference Monday.\n\nMom Killed Shielding Kids After Husband Erupts In Rage Over Nfl Game: Police\n\nAuthorities said two victims were killed and the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Three others were injured and remain hospitalized.\n\nA federal law enforcement source told Fox News the gunman killed his wife and shot three of his children before turning the gun on himself in what the source described as a domestic violence incident.\n\nIn 2020, Dorgan reported to North Providence police that he had undergone gender-reassignment surgery and said his father-in-law wanted him out of the family home because of it. Police identified the suspect by the birth name Robert Dorgan and said he also went by \"Roberta.\"\n\nArkansas Mom Found Shot To Death With Two Children Wrote Cryptic Facebook Post Months Before Killings\n\nAccording to court documents cited by WPRI, Dorgan alleged his father-in-law used a derogatory term for transgender individuals and threatened retaliation if he did not move out. The father-in-law was charged at the time, though prosecutors later dismissed the case.\n\nCourt filings also show Dorgan’s then-wife initially cited \"gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits\" in divorce paperwork before the grounds were amended to \"irreconcilable differences.\" The divorce was finalized in 2021. Divorce records list Dorgan as living in Jacksonville, Florida, at the time and working as a truck driver.\n\nAlso in 2020, Dorgan accused his mother of assaulting him and acting in a \"violent, threatening or tumultuous manner,\" according to police records cited by WPRI. His mother was charged with simple assault and battery and disorderly conduct, though the case was later dismissed, court records show.\n\nThe dispute was also referenced in Dorgan’s conflict with his father-in-law. According to court documents, Dorgan told police his father-in-law \"told me that if I did not drop the assault charges against my mother that further retaliation could be expected and that was another reason to have me killed.\"\n\nPolice have not said whether those past disputes were connected to Monday's violence, and investigators have not publicly identified a motive. Goncalves said the shooting \"looked like it was a family dispute\" and that detectives are still working to establish a timeline.\n\nFox News' Louis Casiano, Alexis McAdams and Bonny Chu contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Anastasia Kucherova, a Russian living in Milan, voiced her opposition to Russia’s war against Ukraine with a highly symbolic, if anonymous, act: Carrying the Ukraine team placard during the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Winter Games.\n\nKucherova was swathed in a long, hooded silver puffer coat, her eyes covered with dark glasses — like all the other placard bearers for the 92 nations competing in the Olympics. The Ukraine sign was illuminated for the crowd to read.\n\nAt first the country assignments were going to be random, but later the choreographer asked if the volunteers had preferences, and Kucherova chose Ukraine.\n\nKucherova, an architect who has been living in Milan for 14 years, was unrecognizable, and her nationality was not announced to the public when she led the five Ukrainian athletes competing in Milan into San Siro stadium to resounding cheers.\n\nShe first revealed her role to her 879 Instagram followers and then in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\n“When you walk by the side of these people you realize they have every human right to feel hatred towards any Russian,’’ she told the AP on Monday. “Still, I think it’s important to do even a small action to show them that maybe not all the people are thinking the same way.\"\n\nFor Kucherova, speaking about her small act of resistance on the second anniversary of the poisoning death of dissident Alexei Navalny is a way of reminding the world that the war continues, even as life elsewhere goes on.\n\n“Ukrainians don’t have any possibility to avoid these thoughts or to ignore the existence of war. So it is their reality. They keep loving each other, getting married or doing sports, coming to the Olympics. But all of this is happening (against) a devastating background.”\n\nWithout being told that Kucherova was Russian, the athletes immediately recognized her origins and addressed her in Russian. That was a sign for Kucherova of “some profound connection” between Russians and Ukrainians “that obviously could live on if not for the war.”\n\nThe Milan delegation was led by flag bearer Yelyzaveta Sydorko, a short track speedskater, and included figure skater Kyrylo Marsak. Both athletes have fathers who are fighting on the front lines in a war that is nearing its fourth anniversary.\n\n“There is literally no word you can say that can undo the harm that these people have already suffered, and there is no word that can come in close to forgiveness,’’ said Kucherova.\n\nRight before walking into the stadium, “I turned around — I didn’t know what to say to them — but I just said that the entire stadium is going to give them the standing ovation.’’ The Ukrainians appeared skeptical, she said.\n\nWhen the cheers came, Kucherova said it felt like the entire stadium was “recognizing their independence, recognizing their will for freedom, their courage in making it all the way to the Olympics.”\n\nShe cried, silently, behind her glasses.\n\nKucherova hasn't visited Russia since 2018, but understands that she is taking a risk by defying the regime.\n\n“I have to be worried about this, and I’m supposed to be scared about this. And I cannot guarantee that me speaking out will not harm any people I know,’’ she said. “But what I think is that if I, living in a democratic country and enjoying all the freedoms, if I am scared, this means that the regime has won.”\n\nKucherova held the sign for another delegation, Denmark, which also received a rousing ovation for that nation's resistance of U.S. threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.\n\n“Yes, this is a coincidence, but I pondered over it,” Kucherova said.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian drone strike ignited fires at one of Russia’s Black Sea ports, officials said Sunday, ahead of fresh talks aimed at ending the nearly 4-year-old war.\n\nTwo people were wounded in the attack on the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, which damaged an oil storage tank, warehouse and terminals, according to regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev.\n\nMeanwhile, falling debris from Russian drones damaged civilian and transport infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region, officials said, causing disruption to the power and water supply.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nThe attacks came ahead of another round of U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, just before the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested there were still questions remaining over future security guarantees for his country. Zelenskyy also questioned how the concept of a free trade zone — proposed by the U.S. — would work in the Donbas region, which Russia insists Kyiv must give up for peace.\n\nHe said the Americans want peace as quickly as possible and that the U.S. team wants to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time, whereas Ukraine wants guarantees for the country’s future security signed first.\n\nZelenskyy’s concerns were echoed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a ranking member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n“Unless we have real security guarantees on whatever peace agreement is ultimately determined, we are going to be here again, because one of the things we know is that Russia has geared up not just for Ukraine, but to go beyond Ukraine,” she told reporters in Munich on Sunday.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia was hoping to win diplomatically what it had failed to achieve on the battlefield, and was banking on the U.S. to deliver concessions at the negotiating table. But Kallas told the Munich conference Sunday that key Russian demands — including the lifting of sanctions and unfreezing of assets — were decisions for Europe.\n\n“If we want a sustainable peace then we need concessions also from the Russian side,” she said.\n\nPrevious U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honor the war dead.\n\nState media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland.”\n\nIn recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.\n\nKim in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the leaders align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers last week it estimated 6,000 North Korean troops have been killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, but did not provide a breakdown of fatalities. The agency said last year it believed roughly 600 had died.\n\nThe spy agency believes North Korean forces are gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week’s closed-door briefing.\n\nThe construction of the new street comes as North Korea prepares to open a major ruling party congress later this month, where Kim is expected to announce his major goals in domestic and foreign policy over the next five years and take further steps to tighten his control.",

    "fullText": "The pit is believed to have been from a time of conflict “between the Saxon-run kingdom of Mercia and the kingdom of East Anglia, which was conquered by the Vikings in around 870 [CE].\"\n\nA burial pit from the 9th century CE was discovered by Cambridge University archaeologists and students during a training dig, the university announced in an early February statement.\n\nThe dig took place at Wandlebury Country Park on the outskirts of Cambridge, and was led by Dr. Oscar Aldred from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit (CAU).\n\nThe pit is believed to have been from a time of conflict “between the Saxon-run kingdom of Mercia and the kingdom of East Anglia, which was conquered by the Vikings in around 870 [CE],” the statement explained.\n\nArchaeologists surmised that the pit contained the remains of at least 10 people, but only four complete skeletons “in positions suggesting they were tied up.”\n\nIn addition, the remains also included a decapitation, and “a man well over six foot in stature – extremely tall for the time – with a trepanned head.”\n\nTrepanning is an ancient surgical procedure, where medical practitioners would drill a hole through a living human’s skull, to treat intracranial diseases or release pressure.\n\nCurator of the Duckworth Collections at Cambridge University Dr. Trish Biers theorized that the man’s height could have been due to a tumor affecting his “pituitary gland and caused an excess of growth hormones.”\n\nBiers further noted that if that were the case, the individual would have been plagued with headaches “that the trepanning may have been an attempt to alleviate.”\n\nThe remaining bones included “a cluster of skulls without clear accompanying bodies and a ‘stack of legs,’ which researchers will attempt to “refit” in order to confirm the number of remains.\n\nArchaeologists ruled the remains as belonging to young men between the ages of 17-24, who were thrown into the pit “without care,” but noted that there isn’t enough evidence to suggest that the remains were victims of battle.\n\n“Those buried could have been recipients of corporal punishment, and that may be connected to Wandlebury as a sacred or well-known meeting place,” Aldred explained, noting that the assorted body parts may have been “displayed as trophies” before being gathered up into the pit.\n\n“We don’t see much evidence for the deliberate chopping up of some of these body parts, so they may have been in a state of decomposition and literally falling apart when they went into the pit.”\n\n“I would never have expected to find something like this on a student training dig. It was a shocking contrast to the peaceful site of Wandlebury,” Grace Grandfield, a Cambridge undergraduate who took part in the dig, said.\n\n“Several of the individuals we uncovered were a similar age to me, and it was a sobering experience to identify ever more disarticulated bones and realize the extent of the suffering that had taken place.”\n\n“I had never encountered human remains on a dig, and I was struck by how close yet distant these people felt,” third-year archaeology undergraduate Olivia Courtney echoed. “We were separated by only a few years in age, but over a thousand years in time.”",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.",
    "fullText": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.\n\nThe internet of Ukraine, noted for its resilience in the initial months following the Russian invasion, has been profoundly affected by three years of war. One notable change has been the exodus of a vital national commodity: IPv4 addresses.\n\nIn this blog post, we highlight several cases in which large amounts of IPv4 space, formerly originated by prominent Ukrainian ASes, have moved out of the country (often with the help of IPv4 brokers) to dozens of new origins, including major cloud providers, hosting operations, and international telecoms. The result is a dramatic reduction in Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table — a new consequence of a protracted war in the digital age.\n\nUsing the top 100 retail providers in Ukraine listed in Kentik Market Intelligence, we observed an 18.5% decline in the amount of announced IPv4 space between February 2022 and May 2025.\n\nBut before we get into the various examples of Ukrainian providers leasing out their IPv4 resources around the world, we should mention up front that there are many providers that have not participated in this practice and are originating exactly the same (or very nearly the same) routes as they did before the Russian invasion in 2022.\n\nThe top Ukrainian providers that did not change are listed below, ranked in descending order by the equivalent number of /24s of IPv4 they originated in February 2022:\n\nUkrtelecom (Укртелеком) is the incumbent telecommunications company of Ukraine and is represented in the global routing table by the ASNs 6849 and 6877. In the past three years, the amount of IPv4 address space announced by these ASes has dropped dramatically, with much of the lost IP space migrating out of the country, if not the region entirely.\n\nAS6849 is the primary ASN for Ukrtelecom, which has experienced a marked decline in the amount of IPv4 space it originates in the past three years. AS6849 went from originating the equivalent of 4,728 /24s to only 1377 — a decline of 71%.\n\nWhile much of the decline in originated address space is no longer routed at all, a significant portion of the decline is now originated by various companies outside of Eastern Europe. In fact, there are currently over 100 ASNs that originate IPv4 space announced by AS6849 three years ago.\n\nWho is announcing Ukrtelecom IPv4 space? 92 /24s of IPv4 space are now originated by AS174 (example 91.124.96.0/22), 77 /24s are announced by AS16509 (ex: 91.124.133.0/24) and even AT&T (AS7018, example 91.124.2.0/24) announces 29 /24s. Below is a screenshot from the bgp.tools web utility showing the address range originated by AS7018 and registered to Ukrtelecom. Even passive DNS for this prefix echoes a previous life with the Ukrainian incumbent.\n\nIf we do a whois on this range, we can see that it is currently registered as “ATT-CT.” The highlighted fields indicate that IPv4 broker IPXO (AS834) had a hand in leasing this IPv4 space to a new customer, who is now getting the route originated by AS7018.\n\nPictured below, Ukrtelecom’s sister ASN (6877) experienced an even more dramatic decline over the past three years. On Feb 1, 2022, AS6877 originated 38 prefixes equivalent to 616 /24s of IPv4 space. Now, AS6877 has all but disappeared from the global routing table (except as the contents of an AS-SET for a couple of prefixes).\n\nIn November 2024, this IPv4 space began getting originated by numerous ASes outside of Ukraine. At present, there are over 50 unique origins for these IPv4 ranges including familiar ASNs like 7018 (ex: 46.203.225.0/24), 3356 (ex: 46.203.68.0/22), 174 (ex: 46.203.81.0/24), 5511 (ex: 46.203.86.0/24), 6461 (ex: 46.202.84.0/24), 3257 (ex: 46.202.56.0/24), and 7029 (ex: 46.203.6.0/24).\n\nIn response to an inquiry about the leasing of IPv4 space, a representative of Ukrtelecom confirmed to me that this was an action taken to raise funds during an ongoing war.\n\nYes, this was a necessary step taken during wartime to secure financial stability and continue delivering essential services to our customers.\n\nLeasing out a portion of our IPv4 resources allowed us to mitigate some of the extraordinary challenges we have been facing since the full-scale invasion began.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrtelecom remains committed to maintaining and expanding internet infrastructure across Ukraine, especially through fiber rollout, which remains our strategic priority.\n\nWe appreciate the attention to this issue and are open to further dialogue on how Ukrainian telecoms are adapting in these unprecedented times.\n\nOlena Shramko\n\nPR Director\n\nUkrtelecom\n\nAccording to published rates from IPv4 brokers, a /24 (256 addresses) can be leased for $100–$150 per month. Based on the analysis above, Ukrtelecom is leasing the equivalent of 1500 /24’s (~1000 from former AS6849 IPv4 space and another ~500 from AS6877). If we assumed the low end of that price range, that would be US$150,000 (or ₴6,288,00) of additional revenue per month for the country’s national operator.\n\nIn another example, AS43310 began 2022 originating 3 prefixes equivalent to 24 /24s of IPv4: 91.225.224.0/22, 91.197.4.0/22, and 188.191.96.0/20. By November 2022, things had begun to change as this address space began to be parceled out to over a dozen new origins, with AS7018 currently the primary origin for these former Ukrainian IPv4 ranges.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, AS34092 was originating 6 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 58 /24s of IP space until the beginning of March that year, when it disappeared from the routing table. Some routes were shifted to sister AS, 57033, but by June 2022, the address space was being farmed out to numerous ASes.\n\nAS57033, for its part, began 2022 by announcing 21 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 48 /24s of IP space (some overlapping with AS34092). But by December 2024, AS57033 disappeared as well and now all of IPv4 space originated by these two ASNs in 2022 is now originated by 37 ASNs including AS8075 (ex: 81.22.128.0/24), AS7018 (ex: 81.22.129.0/24), AS3320 (ex: 109.72.116.0/24), and AS16509 (ex: 31.43.161.0/24).\n\nIn my blog post from February 2023 about the Russification of IP registrations, I highlighted a route (151.0.0.0/20) originated by AS45025, which had its country field updated from “UA” to “RU” in July of 2022 as part of a larger effort to assimilate newly Russian-held territories.\n\nIn fact, the RIPE database has been altered as well. Below is the output of a whois command I ran in 2023 that was featured in the blog post.\n\nIf you were to run the same command today, you would get a message saying that the object was deleted on April 4, 2024. The evidence of the prior existence as a prefix of Ukraine has been purged from the records.\n\nWell, AS45025 no longer exists in the global routing table. The IPv4 space it was originating in 2022 has been divvied up among providers in the Russian-held region of Donetsk, as well as a few global telecoms such as AS7018 (ex: 93.89.216.0/24), AS5511 (ex: 91.193.252.0/24), and AS2914 (ex: 93.89.218.0/24).\n\nDepicted below, AS42430 was a service provider based in the Lugansk region of Ukraine, along the front lines of battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The ASN disappeared from the global routing table in March 2022, and with it, the seven prefixes equivalent to 37 /24s of IPv4. In September 2022, parts of these ranges began to be originated by new origins, including Bursabil Teknoloji (AS60721), a Turkish IPv4 broker.\n\nIn 2023, IPv4 broker IPXO, and US telecom icons Sprint and AT&T were among the origins for the former Lugansk IPv4 space. Still, the primary origin that emerged for these IPs was Paltel (AS12975) of the Palestinian Territories, which currently originates nearly all of it. According to RIPE NCC’s published transfer statistics, 188.0.112.0/20 and 188.0.96.0/20 were transferred from Byte-SD to Paltel on January 6, 2023.\n\nAS43554 was a service provider operating in Mariupol, originating the equivalent of 259 /24s of IPv4 at the beginning of 2022. Trinity went offline in early March of 2022 during the bloody siege of the city.\n\nJust like with the previous example, IPv4 space previously originated by AS43554 started to be originated by as many as 54 ASes outside of Ukraine. This phenomenon continued until the beginning of 2024, when a large portion of the address space was consolidated into Ukrainian content provider Sweet (AS204384).\n\nDuring the summer of 2023, I noticed some of Trinity’s IPv4 space being originated by AT&T (screenshot below).\n\nIn fact, one of the address ranges had been registered as “AT&T Services, Inc.” in a likely attempt to use it for a residential proxy.\n\nCyberintelligence firm Spur summarizes the problems posed by proxy services this way:\n\nResidential proxies have long been used for illicit activity on the internet, including web scraping, scalping tickets to your favorite concerts, pushing spam to forums and social media, new account fraud and account takeovers. It involves hijacking what otherwise is legitimate infrastructure, allowing bad actors to mask their actual IP addresses with those associated with genuine customers your business would otherwise welcome.\n\n“Residential proxies” are so named because they utilize IP addresses that an Internet Service Provider has assigned to a household, as opposed to a business or datacenter. This makes them appear more legitimate and allows them to evade detection by legacy geolocation and fraud services or IP quality score providers like MaxMind or Transunion (formerly Neustar).\n\nI brought this to a contact at AT&T and within a few weeks it was gone.\n\nAlso based in Mariupol, AS24881 was originating six prefixes equivalent to 76 /24s of IPv4 back in 2022. As illustrated below, AS24881 and the IPv4 space it originated disappeared from the global routing table in March of that year.\n\nAS24881’s IPv4 space wouldn’t be seen again until February 2023 when it was originated by Linknet (AS57460), a service provider based in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in the Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. During 2023, this address space was originated by as many as 20 different origins, as is illustrated below.\n\nIn May 2022, Russian forces rerouted internet service to the occupied southern city of Kherson through Miranda-Media (AS201776) in Russian-occupied Crimea. I detailed the switchover in a blog post and in a collaboration with The New York Times that landed on the front page of the newspaper.\n\nThe first provider in Kherson to make the switch to Russian transit was SkyNet (aka KhersonTelecom, AS47598), whose owner took to Facebook to explain his rationale for reconnecting his service through Russia. “On April 30, EVERYTHING fell!” he said, adding that he had no choice but to “turn on the circuit of the Crimean operator Miranda.” While some local residents thanked him, others accused him of using “enemy internet”, a decision he defended in the post.\n\nIn November 2022, Ukrainian forces retook Kherson Oblast above the Dnieper River, and most providers switched back to using Ukrainian transit to connect to the global internet. It was at that time that AS47598 disappeared from the global routing table. In April 2024, the one prefix (91.206.110.0/23) that had been originated by AS47598 in 2022 reappeared as originated by NTT (AS2914), where it continues to be announced today.\n\nIn April 2025, KhersonTelecom transferred its three IPv4 ranges (including 91.206.110.0/23) to a new owner. All three are hosting proxy services according to cyberintelligence firm Spur.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, I published the first analysis of the emerging private market for IPv4. The analysis was the basis for our talk at RIPE 70 in Amsterdam that year. Following years of debate on the matter, the RIPE NCC created a process for facilitating the sale of IPv4 space, creating a new player in the internet ecosystem: the IPv4 broker.\n\nOne of the first IPv4 brokers to emerge was a Romanian outfit so prolific that roughly half of the transfers recorded by RIPE that year were from that country alone. In fact, the footprint of the Romanian internet in the global routing table shrank by a quarter in 2015 as every bit of the country’s IPv4 space that wasn’t being actively used was sold off — mainly to Saudi Arabia and Iran, which was the subject of my collaboration with the Washington Post later that year.\n\nSomething similar has been happening to Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table, but for different reasons. Weary from years of missile strikes and aerial bombardment, conditions are tough in many parts of the country. If leasing out parts of their IP resources keeps the business afloat and employees paid, who can blame these providers?\n\nBut questions arise. Are IPv4 brokers taking advantage of the situation by leasing out so much of Ukraine’s IPv4 space? Or are the brokers vital “to secure financial stability” for Ukrainian ISPs? Who is responsible when these ranges are used for various proxy services that cause problems on the internet?\n\nAt APRICOT in 2024, APNIC Chief Scientist Geoff Huston asked whether we have reached peak IPv4, citing a recent decline in the amount of routed IPv4. In another talk (slide 6), he cited the decline in the market price for IPv4, theorizing that perhaps demand was waning as IPv6 was utilized more (or NAT was becoming more acceptable). But another reason could be that the market is being flooded with supply from Ukraine.",

    "title": "Combat has changed since Finland's bloody Winter War with Russia, but this classic tactic endures",
    "description": "Lessons from the conflict are still important to the Finnish Army, especially the Jaeger Brigade, which specializes in Arctic warfare.",
    "fullText": "Combat has changed in the decades since Finland's Winter War with Russia, but one key lesson still shapes how it thinks about fighting in the Arctic.\n\nDense forests and deep snow force armies onto narrow roads, and disrupting those roadways can shape the battle.\n\nIn northern Finland today, soldiers are still training for that reality as they prepare for a potential future fight in the Arctic.\n\nBusiness Insider recently traveled to the snow-blanketed Lapland region and observed the Finnish Army's elite Jaeger Brigade in action as it led roughly 20 NATO soldiers through an annual Arctic warfare and cold-weather survival course.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic section leader who oversees the course, said in an interview that in the frozen Arctic and heavily forested terrain, vehicles quickly become restricted to plowed roads and narrow supply routes, potential bottlenecks for an invading force if leveraged strategically.\n\nThat constraint, which is known in warfare as canalization, means large formations can be slowed, isolated, and destroyed if an enemy seizes, targets, or disrupts key stretches of roadway.\n\nAfter World War II broke out and Finland refused Soviet demands to cede border territory near Leningrad, the Red Army invaded on November 30, 1939, in what many expected would be a swift victory.\n\nThe Soviet Union entered the war with overwhelming numerical superiority, while Finland relied on a much smaller, lightly equipped force. Yet the Red Army paid a far higher price. In just over three months of fighting, Soviet casualties reached into the hundreds of thousands, far exceeding Finland's losses.\n\nThe Finns forced enemy troops into narrow, defenseless, or difficult terrain and then employed their \"motti\" strategy to split Soviet columns like firewood. The Finns were able to harass isolated troops cut off from support with snipers and raids by ski troops, inflicting heavy casualties and crushing morale.\n\nOne prominent battle unfolded along the Raate Road in Suomussalmi, a narrow forest supply route where Soviet columns were forced into a long, vulnerable line. Finnish forces cut the road at multiple points and destroyed the trapped units. The Red Army suffered substantial losses.\n\nThe Soviets ultimately won the war, but they paid an extremely heavy price for the victory.\n\nIn the 86 years since the end of the Winter War, weapons technology has changed dramatically. Vehicles are more capable, sensors are more advanced, and long-range fires are much more precise.\n\nHowever, Aikio, the Finnish major, stressed that the terrain in northern Finland has not changed.\n\n\"The weapons are different, and you have different technologies that you have now that you didn't back then, but the terrain is pretty much the same,\" Aikio said. And that still limits where soldiers and vehicles can move.\n\nDuring the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic warfare course, dismounted soldiers learn to use skis and snowmobiles to maneuver on the battlefield. Heavy tracked vehicles and trucks mostly have to stick to the roads, though; it doesn't matter if it's a tank from the late 1930s or a massive supply truck today — the same problems that existed during World War II persist.\n\nEven modern armored vehicles would be heavily influenced by the harsh terrain, forcing large formations and their logistics onto limited maneuver corridors. A single Russian tank, for instance, might be able to get creative and drive through the heavy snow, but this becomes less reliable at scale.\n\nGiven those constraints, Finland's thinking is not about replicating 1939 but rather forcing an attacker into predictable corridors, attriting supplies, breaking force cohesion, and straining logistics to weaken an adversary. That would be backed by modern combat capabilities, such as aircraft and significant artillery, as well as allied assets.\n\nThe effectiveness of these tactics has been seen in modern warfighting.\n\nIn Ukraine, large Russian formations have struggled when constrained to limited road networks, particularly when logistics faltered, and the Ukrainians were able to disrupt supply routes. The comparison with the Winter War isn't exact, but it underscores how terrain and sustainment still shape how armies move.",

    "description": "Russia still has many air defenses, and experience it gained against Ukraine actually makes them a bigger threat to NATO aircraft than before 2022.",
    "fullText": "Russia's air defenses may pose a more significant threat to NATO air forces than they would have before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a top air defense analyst warned in a recent report.\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has been able to destroy numerous Russian air defense systems.\n\nJustin Bronk, an air power expert at the UK's Royal United Services Institute, warned that not only does Russia still maintain a large arsenal, but it is also still producing its most powerful systems. And its ability to use these weapons has improved through combat experience.\n\nSystems have been upgraded, crews have more experience, and Russia has become better at coordinating their use with surveillance aircraft to accurately extend their reach.\n\nRussia's surface-to-air missile systems, Bronk wrote, \"not only remain numerous, but are also likely to perform better against NATO aircraft and munitions in a hypothetical direct conflict than they would have before 2022.\"\n\nFacing this challenge, NATO could struggle to sweep aside Russian air defenses in a European war to achieve air superiority — a cornerstone of Western airpower doctrine.\n\nHe told Business Insider in an interview about the report that Russia's forces are \"much more experienced\" and have \"learned quite a lot through trial and experimentation.\"\n\nA strictly air-to-air clash pitting Russian air forces against NATO aircraft likely wouldn't go well for Moscow, Bronk predicted, but a war wouldn't only take place in the air.\n\nBefore Western jets could operate freely, European air forces would likely need to suppress or destroy Russia's dense network of ground-based air defenses. Their volume and improved coordination could pose a serious challenge.\n\nUkraine has been able to achieve a \"steady drumbeat\" of strikes against Russian defense systems with weaponry like drones, artillery, and missiles, Bronk said, but there are still \"several hundred batteries\" in service, with more modern variants continuing to roll off production lines.\n\nBronk's analysis is based on interviews with Western air forces and ministries, data from Ukraine's armed forces, and open-source information.\n\nHe said his findings indicate that Russia's array of ground-based integrated air defence systems \"remains a highly potent threat to NATO air capabilities in a European context.\"\n\nThe sheer volume is a problem for NATO in Europe. \"The primary threat to NATO air power\" is Russia's extensive ground-based surface-to-missile coverage, he said.\n\nNATO notably doesn't have a similar arsenal.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has underscored how decisive ground-based air defenses can be. Russia began the war with the largest such arsenal in Europe, followed by Ukraine, and that scale has helped prevent either side from establishing air superiority.\n\nNATO has committed to increasing its arsenal of ground-based air defenses in response, with alliance defense spending soaring, but it's not a problem that can be quickly solved.\n\nBoth Russia's combat aircraft crews and surface-to-air missile system operators are \"significantly more combat-experienced and more capable overall than they were prior to the start of the full-scale invasion,\" Bronk said.\n\nThe increase in operator experience alongside hardware and software upgrades \"a least partially offsets\" some of the significant attrition that Russian SAM systems have suffered during the war against Ukraine.\n\nImprovements to the force include new tactics and procedures, software updates to improve the performance of radars, better resistance to electronic warfare, and bringing new pieces of hardware into service.\n\nNew hardware includes the S-350 Vityaz, a medium-range surface-to-air missile system that first entered service in 2020.\n\nRussia's forces are also getting better at working together, Bronk said.\n\nHe said that in a direct conflict with NATO forces in Europe, the threat to NATO aircraft \"would be far better coordinated today than they were prior to 2022.\"\n\nUkraine has reported that since mid-2023, Russia's long-range surface-to-air missiles have more frequently coordinated engagements with fighter jets near the front lines and A-50U airborne early warning and control aircraft, allowing them to fire at Ukrainian aircraft \"at ranges that the surface-to-air systems could not have been able to directly observe by themselves.\"\n\nRussia could use similar strategies in a conflict with NATO, \"to engage Western aircraft flying at low altitudes at longer ranges,\" Bronk said.\n\nIn Ukraine, he said, the probability of scoring a kill with one of these shots \"almost certainly remains low,\" as they require the missile seeker to find the target without mid-course guidance.\n\nBut the evolved tactic points to how much more skilled Russia's air force and air defense crews have become, compared to their less coordinated tactics in the early months of the war.\n\nAt the same time, NATO's air forces have \"access to significantly more detailed and accurate data on the strengths, weaknesses, tactics and technical characteristics of Russian SAM systems than they had before 2022,\" Bronk said. That can't be understated.\n\nThey understand the threat of Russia's ground-based air defenses better. And the weaponry and tactics to counter them do exist, Bronk said, \"albeit not in sufficient numbers in Europe yet.\"\n\nUltimately, Bronk said, \"Russian air defence capabilities have been boosted by combat lessons over almost four years of operations,\" and that could require more from NATO to break through in a fight.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian Vladyslav Heraskevych remain banned from 2026 Winter Olympics skeleton competition after his appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday.\n\nThe slider was banned by ruling body IBSF based on International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour athletes killed in the war with Russia.\n\nThe court said in a statement following an emergency ruling that the sole arbitrator appointed for this matter \"whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevyc's commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines.\"\n\nThe arbitrator considers that these guidelines \"provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.\"\n\nHeraskevych had argued that \"the exclusion is disproportionate, unsupported by any technical or safety violation and causes irreparable sporting harm to him.\"\n\nThe CAS arbitrator said that she was sympathetic with Heraskevych's attempt to \"raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nBut she added that the limitations imposed by the IOC to express views during competitions on the field of play are \"reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness (in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs).\"\n\nHeraskevych had already ruled out racing\n\nEarlier, Heraskevych appeared to have ruled out racing at the Olympics even if he won his appeal against the exclusion.\n\n\"It looks like this train has left,\" the 27-year-old, draped in the Ukrainan flag, told reporters after emerging from a two-and-a-half-hour hearing. \"I cannot do another race so it is done.\"\n\nHis CAS hearing began at a hotel in Milan on Friday and he said he was \"positive\" that his appeal would be upheld.\n\nThe court has set up an ad hoc division to deal with Olympic appeals quickly.\n\nThe first two runs of the Olympic skeleton competition in Cortina took place without Heraskevych, despite him finishing among the top six in all five training runs. The medal runs are scheduled for later on Friday.\n\nA reinstatement would be complicated and the athlete said racing in a symbolic one run was unlikely given the sport is dangerous.\n\n\"From a competitive perspective this makes no sense,\" he said, as he slammed the IOC's \"mockery\" for removing his Games accreditation and then giving it him back despite his racing ban.\n\nHeraskevych had refused repeated warnings from the IOC to give up wearing his helmet.\n\nThe IOC does not allow any kind of political statements in competition. He says this is different as it is a commemoration and not political, something he believes other athletes have been allowed to do.\n\nBut IOC president Kirsty Coventry told a news conference: \"The rules are the rules and I believe in the rules.\n\n\"We have to allow for athletes to express themselves but also to keep athletes safe.\"\n\nShe said political messaging is permitted away from actual competition, in press conferences for example, but that athletes themselves had agreed that the actual events should be neutral.\n\n\"I think he in some ways understood (the rules), but was very committed to his beliefs, but sadly it doesn't change the rules,\" Coventry said.\n\nHeraskevych was excluded shortly before the start of the first run in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Thursday.\n\nIn his appeal, he requested the annulment of the decision and \"that CAS reinstates him in the 2026 [Olympic Winter Games] with immediate effect, or in the alternative, that the athlete performs a CAS supervised official run pending the final decision.\"\n\nAround 40 members of the European Parliament have backed the slider and have written to the IOC, calling the ban wrong.\n\nPress reaction in Europe has also been largely against the IOC, while some Russian media in contrast have said the body has been too soft in giving his accreditation back.\n\nRussia as a nation is not allowed at the Games because of the war, but some individual Russian athletes are competing as neutrals after proving they have not actively supported the conflict.",

    "description": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family.",
    "fullText": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family. The decision likely ends a bitter, yearslong legal battle over the girl's fate.\n\nIn 2020, a judge in Fluvanna County, Virginia, granted Joshua and Stephanie Mast an adoption of the child, who was then 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan living with a family the Afghan government decided were her relatives.\n\nFour justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing two lower courts’ rulings that found the adoption was so flawed it was void from the moment it was issued.\n\nThe justices wrote that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child’s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.\n\nThree justices issued a scathing dissent, calling what happened in this court “wrong,” “cancerous” and “like a house built on a rotten foundation.”\n\nAn attorney for the Masts declined to comment, citing an order from the circuit court not to discuss the details of the case publicly. Lawyers representing the Afghan family said they were not yet prepared to comment.\n\nThe child was injured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in September 2019 when U.S. soldiers raided a rural compound. The child’s parents and siblings were killed. Soldiers brought her to a hospital at an American military base.\n\nThe raid was targeting terrorists who had come into Afghanistan from a neighboring country; some believed she was not Afghan and tried to make a case for bringing her to the U.S. But the State Department, under President Donald Trump’s first administration, insisted the U.S. was obligated under international law to work with the Afghan government and the International Committee of the Red Cross to unite the child with her closest surviving relatives.\n\nThe Afghan government determined she was Afghan and vetted a man who claimed to be her uncle. The U.S. government agreed and brought her to the family. The uncle chose to give her to his son and his new wife, who raised her for 18 months in Afghanistan.\n\nMeanwhile, Mast and his wife convinced courts in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia, to grant them custody and then a series of adoption orders, continuing to claim she was the “stateless” daughter of foreign fighters.\n\nJudge Richard Moore granted them a final adoption in December 2020. When the six-month statute of limitations ran out, the child was still in Afghanistan living with her relatives, who testified they had no idea a judge was giving the girl to another family. Mast contacted them through intermediaries and tried to get them to send the girl to the U.S. for medical treatment but they refused to let her go alone.\n\nWhen the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, the family agreed to leave and Mast worked his military contacts to get them on an evacuation flight. Mast then took the baby from them at a refugee resettlement center in Virginia, and they haven’t seen her since.\n\nThe AP agreed not to name the Afghan couple because they fear their families in Afghanistan might face retaliation from the Taliban. The circuit court issued a protective order shielding their identities.\n\nThe Afghans challenged the adoption, claiming the court had no authority over a foreign child and the adoption orders were based on Mast repeatedly misleading the judge.\n\nThe Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday wrote that the law prohibiting challenges to an adoption after six months is designed to create permanency, so a child is not bounced from one home to another. The only way to undercut it is to argue that a parent’s constitutional rights were violated.\n\nThe lower courts had found that the Afghan couple had a right to challenge the adoption because they were the girl’s “de facto” parents when they came to the United States.\n\nFour of the Supreme Court judges — D. Arthur Kelsey, Stephen R. McCullough, Teresa M. Chafin, Wesley G. Russell Jr. — disagreed.\n\n“We find no legal merit” in the argument that “that they were ‘de facto’ parents of the child and that no American court could constitutionally sever that relationship,” they wrote. They pointed to Fluvanna County Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore’s findings that the Afghan couple “are not and never were parents” of the child, because they had no order from an Afghan court and had not proven any biological relationship to her.\n\nThe Afghans had refused DNA testing, saying it could not reliably prove a familial connection between opposite-gender half-cousins. They insisted that it didn't matter, because Afghanistan claimed the girl as its citizen and got to determine her next-of-kin.\n\nThe Supreme Court leaned heavily on a 38-page document written by Judge Moore, who granted the adoption, then presided over a dozen hearings after the Afghans challenged it. He wrote that he trusted the Masts more than the Afghans, and believed that the Masts’ motivations were noble while the Afghans were misrepresenting their relationship to the child.\n\nThe Supreme Court also dismissed the federal government’s long insistence that Trump’s first administration had made a foreign policy decision to unite her with her Afghan relatives, and a court in Virginia has no authority to undo it. The government submitted filings in court predicting dire outcomes if the baby was allowed to remain with the Marine: it could be viewed as “endorsing an act of international child abduction,” threaten international security pacts and be used as propaganda by Islamic extremists — potentially endangering U.S soldiers overseas.\n\nBut the Justice Department in Trump’s second administration abruptly changed course.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted in its opinion that the Justice Department had been granted permission to make arguments in the case, but withdrew its request to do so on the morning of oral arguments last year, saying it “has now had an opportunity to reevaluate its position in this case.”\n\nThe Supreme Court returned repeatedly to Moore’s finding that giving the girl to the family “was not a decision the United States initiated, but rather consented to or acquiesced in.”\n\nThe three judges who dissented were unsparing in their criticism of both the Masts and the circuit court that granted him the adoption.\n\n“A dispassionate review of this case reveals a scenario suffused with arrogance and privilege. Worse, it appears to have worked,” begins the dissent, written by Justice Thomas P. Mann, and signed by Chief Justice Cleo E. Powell and LeRoy F. Millette, Jr.\n\nA Virginia court never had the right to give the child to the Masts, the dissent said.\n\nThey castigated the Masts for “brazenly” misleading the courts during their quest to adopt the girl.\n\n“We must recognize what an adoption really is: the severance and termination of the rights naturally flowing to an otherwise legitimate claimant to parental authority. Of course, the process must be impeccable. An evolved society could not sanction anything less than that. And here, it was less,” Mann wrote. “If this process was represented by a straight line, (the Masts) went above it, under it, around it, and then blasted right through it until there was no line at all — just fragments collapsing into a cavity.”",

This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe IOC added that Heraskevych, who was considered to have an outside chance of a medal based on his training times, had been banned for contravening athlete guidelines, rather than because of displaying political propaganda.\n\nResponding on social media after being banned, Heraskevych wrote:, external \"This is [the] price of our dignity.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, he added: \"I could be among the medallists in this event, but suddenly because of some interpretation of the rules which I do not agree with, I am not able to compete while other athletes in the same situation were able to compete, and they didn't face any sanctions.\"\n\n'Shocking' or correct - why Ukraine skeleton slider was banned\n\nThe IOC said he was banned for contravening the 'athlete expression' guidelines, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law.\n\nThey state that: \"The focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances, sport and the harmony that the Games seek to advance.\n\n\"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference.\n\n\"Specifically, the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes' performances.\"\n\nHeraskevych, who said he felt \"emptiness\" at not being allowed to compete, said the ban was not consistent with other decisions taken at the Games.\n\n\"'Expression guidelines', I believe it's a very big term. What do you consider as 'expression'? Many athletes here have helmets with different paints [colours] and I believe it's also a kind of expression,\" he said.\n\n\"Some athletes have national symbols, it's also an expression but for some reason their helmets were not checked. They are allowed to compete, but I am not.\"\n\nHeraskevych insists his tribute is no different to those that other athletes have displayed, such as figure skater Maxim Naumov.\n\nThe American held up a photo of his parents, who were among 67 people killed in a plane crash in Washington DC just over a year ago, while waiting for his score to be announced on Tuesday.\n\nHeraskevych's accreditation for the Games was initially withdrawn by the IOC but, following a \"very respectful\" conversation with the committee's president Coventry, that decision was overturned and he will be allowed to remain at the event but not compete.\n\nAsked how strongly he felt about commemorating those who have been killed during the Russian invasion, Heraskevych said: \"I believe they deserve to be here because of their sacrifice. I want to honour them and I want to honour their families.\"\n\nHe explained that many of those pictured on his helmet were athletes, including teenage weightlifter Alina Peregudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko and ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, and some of them were his friends.\n\nThe IOC said earlier this week that Heraskevych could pay tribute to the fallen athletes by wearing a black armband during competition and could show his helmet in mixed zones, news conferences and on social media, but that \"the field of play is sacrosanct\".\n\nIt added that IOC officials would \"beg\" him not to wear it as they wanted him to compete.\n\nOn Thursday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that if the committee allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games up to exploitation.\n\n\"There are according to the Red Cross, 130 conflicts going on at any one time. We can't have them all in competition [with each other at the Games],\" he said.\n\n\"The field of play could become a field of expression, you could see it would lead to chaos. We cannot have athletes put on them by political masters to make expressions during competition.\n\n\"We do our best to create a level playing field, I make no apologies for that.\"\n\nAdams said IOC president Coventry had left the meeting with Heraskevych in tears as she felt \"very emotional\" about the matter, adding that \"the meeting was good, personal and respectful\".\n\nHe also denied that the IOC had been pressured by either the Russian Olympic Committee or the Russian government to ban Heraskevych, and said the Ukrainian would have access to a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) commission should he wish to appeal.\n\nThe IOC said athletes are able to \"express grief with dignity and respect\" at multi-faith centres in the Olympic villages.\n\nIt added that Heraskevych has been \"supported by the IOC for the last three editions of the Games\" and that he is an Olympic scholarship athlete.\n\n\"Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the IOC also set up a solidarity fund for Ukrainian sport to support the athletes' preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" it said.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "For Ukrainian infantry and drone teams, the extreme cold brings new challenges to modern war in the trenches.",
    "fullText": "For Ukrainian infantry, surviving the dead of winter requires a delicate balance.\n\n\"It's really, really cold in Ukraine,\" said Nefor, the chief sergeant of an infantry company in Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps. \"I think, the first winter in some time with such cold weather.\"\n\nA cold snap whipped through much of Ukraine last week, delivering frigid temperatures that sank to -6°F on some nights in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where Nefor's corps is fighting.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to him and another Ukrainian commander, who oversees a drone company on the front lines, to discuss what it takes to hold a trench position in such weather. Trench warfare, largely glossed over in the last few decades, has seen a resurgence in interest from militaries around the world, especially those in Europe, watching Russia's plodding invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNefor, who spoke on the condition that he only be identified by his callsign, is in charge of assigning infantry rotations to their frontline positions.\n\nWhile holding a position, a key item each soldier needs is chemical body warmers, which can be slipped under their uniforms, said Nefor.\n\n\"You put this warmer against your body, and your blood circulating is warm. It works, not bad,\" Nefor said. \"If you want to rest a little bit, you take a chemical warmer, a sleeping bag, and it's faster.\"\n\nAt such temperatures, frostbite can easily set in within 30 minutes, so troops constantly need the warmers, he said. One typically lasts six to eight hours, meaning a soldier needs at least three warmers per day, Nefor added.\n\nHis company experimented with electrically powered warmers. But they come with a risk — anyone who gets too warm would be more easily spotted by thermal optics, especially since their surroundings are much colder than usual.\n\nChemical warmers, conversely, emit such small heat signatures that light drones won't be able to spot them, Nefor said.\n\n\"It's possible to see if the Russian guy has a 'teplevizor' on his weapon, but it's a very small signature,\" the sergeant said, referring to thermal imagery attachments for small arms.\n\nSerhii Andrieiev, a senior lieutenant who is second-in-command of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, said his pilots prioritize camouflage for their nests during the winter. In the colder seasons, there is less forest foliage to provide visual cover.\n\nThe heat signature from the motors on their drones is easier to spot, and only \"very happy drone operators\" have the luxury of stationing in a building along the Kharkiv frontline, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"In most cases, it's a big foxhole, or a cellar in a destroyed building,\" the deputy commander said.\n\nAppliances such as electric warmers also soak up significant energy and require a power source in the trenches.\n\nNefor said his company deploys roughly 20 EcoFlow portable batteries, but there aren't enough to cover all its frontline positions. The batteries are also needed to power screens and radios, he added.\n\nAlmost all soldiers instead carry personal power banks to keep their devices charged. \"It's the power bank you buy at the shop,\" Nefor said. \"Power banks with Type-C or USB ports.\"\n\nCold temperatures can grow even more dangerous when they alternate between above and below freezing. Clothes, especially in humid areas, can absorb thawed water that can then freeze again, increasing the risk of hypothermia.\n\n\"If you are not dry, you die,\" Nefor said. \"We have this saying.\"\n\nClothing that gets wet in the winter stays wet, so troops who need dry layers have to request new ones from their commanders.\n\nUncrewed ground vehicles have recently been a major boon for Nefor's company in this regard, freeing up human soldiers by carrying weeks' worth of ammunition, clothing, and other supplies such as food, water, and chemical warmers to the trenches.\n\nFirearms and ammunition can become waterlogged as well. Nefor said that his troops, worried that their weapons would freeze up, apply a lubricating concoction to their rifles that mostly includes vehicle oil and sometimes a small amount of antifreeze.\n\n\"You need to make one, two shots with your weapon to make it warmer, then you add it,\" Nefor said.\n\nBoth commanders said the deep winter adds to the mental toll on Ukraine's already-beset troops, who are often short on reinforcements and the grinding nature of the war.\n\nNefor's company sends smaller groups of two or three soldiers — no more than four — to each position to avoid detection from Russian drones. Each soldier takes turns for several hours in the trenches between watch positions, which are typically colder, and warmer resting locations.\n\nAndrieiev said that if he had more drone pilots, he could rotate them out of the front lines every four or five days. His teams instead spend two to three weeks at a time in the forests.\n\n\"It's exhausting to spend all that time in freezing temperatures. Even if you have heaters with you,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nTroops need more fuel and more clothes to perform their duties, he said. A task as simple as using an improvised bathroom in the trenches is stressful, with the soldier under threat from Russian drones while wearing multiple layers, body armor, and carrying their military gear.\n\nThe Russian assaults they have to fight off, meanwhile, stay just as frequent and intense during cold weeks, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what the weather is. They come at us like zombies, two or three guys at a time in the middle of the frozen field,\" he said.",

    "description": "The war in Ukraine showed the US Army just how effective small drones can be. They can be more than scouts. They can be offensive weapons.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine showed the US Army just how effective small drones can be, not just as scouts, but as offensive weapons, officials told Business Insider.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider the service had a capability “gap\" due to having long viewed small drones primarily as tools for surveillance and reconnaissance.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine unlocked a world of new realizations with regard to drone warfare.\n\nFacing an existential crisis, the Ukrainians had to develop a way to counter hostile forces cheaply yet with mass. That meant figuring out how to turn inexpensive drones into weaponry, a step that quickly and fundamentally changed how the war was being fought. Now, drones carry out 80% of all battlefield hits and are responsible for most combat casualties.\n\nDrones had been used in warfare prior to Russia's invasion, but this is different. The dramatic shift in warfare has inspired Ukraine's partners, including the US, to up their training on drone warfare and production of small drones.\n\n\"We're still a very capable force as a US Army,\" Amacker said; however, \"there is a new capability that we just don't have fielded across the force yet.\"\n\nThat's changing though. The Army has been increasingly prioritizing small drone operations, using them the way that the Ukrainians do, to direct fire and drop grenades, among other actions. Drones are also an important part of the Army's major transformation initiative.\n\nCritical skills are now being taught at the Aviation Center of Excellence's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course in Fort Rucker, which began last year and aims to train soldiers to lethally employ small drones in combat. This includes learning to pilot and attack, as well as use drones to support traditional fire missions with artillery.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the course's director, said that Ukraine has shown the US what it needs to learn.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are on the Russo-Ukrainian war and the tactics and equipment that are being utilized in that type of warfare,\" she said, explaining that \"in America, that is not a style of warfare that we're accustomed to, where we're heavily using robotics and unmanned systems in order to target in the near fight.\"\n\nShe said it's \"a doctrinal and tactical thing that we weren't prepared for a year ago, but we're rapidly getting better at it as we go through.\"\n\nUkraine uses small aerial drones, like first-person-view quadcopters, to gather intelligence on Russian troops and equipment positions, but also to directly attack soldiers and equipment. Those drones have killed troops, exposed defensive positions, and destroyed high-value systems such as tanks.\n\nUS military drones have long been mostly large, fixed-wing aircraft deployed for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering or armed strike. Those drones, systems like the MQ-9 Reaper or RQ-4 Global Hawk, are typically operated by the Air Force, rather than the Army, and they are expensive, millions of dollars each.\n\nMartin said Ukraine's battlefield experience showed the Army that inexpensive drones can destroy weapon systems worth millions of dollars. It's a capability the Army couldn't afford to ignore.\n\nThe Army is looking into restructuring combat units to prioritize drones as weapons, including creating new specialized, drone-led strike units.\n\nCol. Nick Ryan, who oversees US Army drone integration, explained to CNN in September that he wants soldiers to look at their drone \"as if it was their personal weapon,\" or their radio, their night-vision goggles, or a grenade.\n\nMartin said that the Army test units struggled early on simply learning to fly small drones. First-person-view drones, she said, \"require a high skill level,\" and many units weren't resourced for that initially.\n\n\"What we want is not just flying,\" she said, \"but employing those systems lethally.\"\n\nThat presents additional challenges. \"The lethal part is very complicated,\" Martin said, requiring risk management, approvals, and handling munitions that most soldiers don't regularly train with. \"So this course was created here.\"\n\nShe described lethal drone use as something infantry training has only begun to incorporate recently.\n\nPart of the training course emphasizes limits as well as capabilities. Martin said students are taught that drones are a tool, not a universal solution.\n\n\"Ultimately, drones are a tool,\" she said, \"but there are other tools available.\"\n\nUkraine turned heavily to drones in part because it lacks the substantial volume of traditional weapons needed to fight a larger military and has faced repeated shortages and delays in promised aid. Cheap, adaptable drones helped fill those gaps.\n\nThe US is not in the same position. With advanced airpower and other high-end systems supporting operations, the Army approaches drone warfare differently, integrating drones rather than relying on them as substitutes for other capabilities.\n\nThat said, the Army sees the potential and plans to buy at least one million drones within the next two to three years.\n\nIt also intends to grow the training program, which had its inaugural session in August, to teach more advanced tactics and complex scenarios and have graduates take their lessons back to their respective units and become trainers themselves.\n\nAmacker said that the goal is to teach drone warfare skills such that \"when we combine it with our full force of effects, it just complements everything we're doing. It makes us even more efficient and effective on the battlefield.\"",

    "description": "\"Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail.\"",
    "fullText": "The Kremlin’s financial situation is becoming increasingly dire and could come to a head in a matter of months as oil revenue shrinks while President Vladimir Putin shows no intention of ending his war on Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have been warning Putin with growing alarm that a financial crisis could hit by the summer, sources told the Washington Post. They pointed to weak oil revenue, which crashed by 50% in January from a year earlier, and a budget deficit that continues to widen, even after Putin hiked taxes on consumers.\n\nA Moscow business executive also told the Post that the crisis could arrive in “three or four months” amid spiraling inflation, adding that restaurants have been closing and thousands of workers are getting laid off.\n\nThe economic strains go back to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago. As sanctions took hold and Putin mobilized the economy for a prolonged war, a tight labor market and high inflation forced the central bank to keep interest rates high. Recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, more workers not being paid, getting furloughed, or seeing their hours cut. As a result, consumers are having trouble servicing their loans, raising concerns of a crash in the financial sector.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post in December on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to pay off loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nThe Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, a state-backed Russian think tank, said in December the country could face a banking crisis by October if loan troubles worsen and depositors pull out their funds, according to the Post.\n\n“The situation in the Russian economy has deteriorated markedly,” wrote Dmitry Belousov, head of the think tank, in a note seen by the Financial Times. “The economy has entered the brink of stagflation for the first time since early 2023.”\n\nRussia’s financial woes could become even more serious as Europe weighs additional sanctions on so-called shadow fleet tankers used to ship Moscow’s oil. That would add to recent U.S. penalties on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nThe West’s tighter sanctions regime has forced Russia to offer steeper discounts on its crude exports, while the recent slide in global oil prices has already hurt its top revenue generator.\n\nDespite the worsening fiscal outlook, Moscow is still spending heavily on weapons and incentives to lure fresh recruits to the army. To cover revenue shortfalls, Russia has tapped its sovereign wealth fund, but that is running out now too.\n\nRussia has also suffered staggering losses on the battlefield, with an estimated 1.2 million killed or wounded since the war began. Last month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said more than 30,000 Russian troops died in December alone—an average of 1,000 each day—to gain only minimal territory.\n\nAt the same time, European officials have pointed out that Russia is losing strategically, with Ukraine likely headed for EU membership, NATO growing larger after adding new member states, and Europe ramping up defense spending significantly.\n\n“So people are saying that Russia wants to continue the war because they want more territory—that’s rubbish,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month at the World Economic Forum. “Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail. When you add on to that the Russian economy is in shambles, which means they’re not going to be able to pay their soldiers which means zero growth, end of reserves, interest rates and inflation in double digits. So Putin cannot afford to end this war. This is my big worry.”\n\nIndeed, while Russia has engaged in on-again, off-again talks to end the war, it continues to bombard Ukraine with missiles and drones, targeting its energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials just ended two days of talks in Abu Dhabi with little progress reported. In comments released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. wants the war to end by June and plans a fresh round of negotiations.\n\n“America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams—Ukraine and Russia—meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week.

    "fullText": "New Anthropic campaign suggests other AI platforms will incorporate targeted ads in their chatbot conversations\n\nThe Seahawks and the Patriots aren’t the only ones gearing up for a fight.\n\nAI rivals Anthropic and OpenAI have launched a war of ads trying to court corporate America during one of the biggest entertainment nights of the year.\n\nAhead of the Super Bowl, Anthropic has launched a series of ads going hard at its rival.\n\nFor the scrawny 23-year-old who wants a six-pack, a ripped older man who is supposed to depict a chatbot suggests insoles that “help short kings stand tall” because “confidence isn’t just built in the gym”. And for the man trying to improve communication with his mom: his therapist prescribes “a mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars” in case he can’t fix that relationship.\n\nAll four ads end with the same tagline: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.” There’s no explicit mention of ChatGPT, but the subtext is clear.\n\nEven Sam Altman laughed. But he also called the ads “so clearly dishonest” before diving into a lengthy critique on X.\n\n“Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them,” Altman wrote. “We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.”\n\nAltman stressed that OpenAI’s decision to include ads, announced last month, makes the product more accessible. “We believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access,” he wrote. And Altman didn’t shy away from taking some shots of his own. “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” he wrote. (Claude has a free subscription version, too.)\n\nChatGPT’s ad policy is not live yet, but OpenAI maintains on its website that ads will be “separate and clearly labeled” and won’t influence the answers users see. The company also states that it will not share conversations with ChatGPT with advertisers, and is focused on prioritising trust, claiming it will give users the option to turn off personalization or opt for an ad-free paid plan. The company said the chatbot would initially have ads show up at the bottom of answers “when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation”.\n\nAltman wasn’t always sold on including ads in ChatGPT’s business model. In October 2024, he dismissed the idea as a “last resort”. But in recent years, as OpenAI invests even more heavily in AI infrastructure, the company’s growth in new subscribers has dwindled.\n\nAnthropic’s critique of OpenAI didn’t come out of nowhere: Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI researchers who left based on concerns about the company’s direction on AI safety. Anthropic wrote in a 4 February blogpost that Claude would remain ad-free because doing otherwise would prevent the chatbot from being a “genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking”. The company likened open-ended conversations with AI assistants, which are often deeply personal or complex, to those with a trusted adviser. “The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous – and, in many cases, inappropriate,” the company wrote.\n\nEven if OpenAI says it won’t share user data directly with advertisers, targeted advertising more broadly has been criticized for exploiting users’ vulnerabilities. In this case, that concern could extend to users asking ChatGPT questions about their mental and physical health, similar to the issues shown in Anthropic’s ads. But there’s also a chance targeted advertising could help with reining in AI’s most toxic attributes. Big corporations that buy in may pull out in response to hateful or egregious content. Many websites and apps, from Google to Instagram, already have ads, so it may not be a huge adjustment for users.\n\nIt is unclear whether Altman’s attempts to deliver more revenue with ads will drive users to ad-free competitors. But Anthropic is betting on it.",

    "description": "The U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal to end the nearly four‑year war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters, as Russian strikes on energy infrastructure forced ...",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal to end the nearly four‑year war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters, as Russian strikes on energy infrastructure forced nuclear power plants to cut output on Saturday.\n\nIf the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to meet it, he added.\n\n“The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer and will probably put pressure on the parties precisely according to this schedule,” Zelenskyy said, speaking to reporters on Friday. Zelenskyy’s comments were embargoed until Saturday morning.\n\n“And they say that they want to do everything by June. And they will do everything to end the war. And they want a clear schedule of all events,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. proposed holding the next round of trilateral talks next week in their country for the first time, likely in Miami, Zelenskyy said. “We confirmed our participation,” he added.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia presented the U.S. with a $12 trillion economic proposal — which he dubbed the “Dmitriev package” after Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Bilateral economic deals with the U.S. form part of the broader negotiating process.\n\nRussian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure continued with over 400 drones and about 40 missiles launched overnight Saturday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Targets included the energy grid, generation facilities and distribution networks.\n\nUkrenergo, the state energy transmission operator, said the attack was the second mass strike on energy infrastructure since the start of the year, forcing nuclear power plants to reduce output. Eight facilities in eight regions came under attack, it said in a statement.\n\n“As a result of missile strikes on key high-voltage substations that ensured the output of nuclear power units, all nuclear power plants in the territories under control were forced to reduce their load,” the statement said.\n\nIt said the power deficit in the country has increased “significantly” as a result of the attacks forcing an extension of hourly power outages in all regions of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest deadline follows U.S.-brokered trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi that produced no breakthrough as the warring parties cling to mutually exclusive demands. Russia is pressing Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas, where fighting remains intense — a condition Kyiv says it will never accept.\n\n“Difficult issues remained difficult. Ukraine once again confirmed its positions on the Donbas issue. ‘We stand where we stand’ is the fairest and most reliable model for a ceasefire today, in our opinion,” Zelenskyy said. He reiterated that the most challenging topics would be reserved for a trilateral meeting between leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said no common ground was reached on managing the Russian‑held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and expressed skepticism about a U.S. proposal to turn the Donbas region, coveted by Russia, into a free economic zone as a compromise.\n\n“I do not know whether this can be implemented, because when we talked about a free economic zone, we had different views on it,” he said.\n\nHe said in the last round of talks the negotiators discussed how a ceasefire would be technically monitored. He added that the U.S. has reaffirmed it would play a role in that process.\n\nRepeated Russian aerial assaults have in recent months focused on Ukraine’s power grid, causing blackouts and disrupting the heating and water supply for families during a bitterly cold winter, putting more pressure on Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. again proposed a ceasefire banning strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine is ready to observe such a pause if Russia commits; but he added that when Moscow previously agreed to a one-week pause suggested by the U.S., it was violated after just four days.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "GAZA CITY (AP) — On a rare day off from covering the war in Gaza, Associated Press photographer Jehad Alshrafi made sure to take his camera before heading out.\n\nSo when the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of people living near a Gaza City intersection Friday afternoon and warned of an impending airstrike, Alshrafi was ready.\n\nHis photos capture the staggering impact of an Israeli bomb in split-second detail.\n\nIn a post on social media, an Israeli military spokesman identified the target as a building used by Hamas militants. Warned to keep back at least 300 meters (about 980 feet), Alshrafi headed for a cemetery with a view of the site.\n\n“I saw the evacuation order on the internet and went directly to the place,” Alshrafi said.\n\nIt’s common for people in Gaza to visit cemeteries on Friday to pay respect to lost family members. With space between the headstones busy with mourners, Alshrafi set up at the far end of the cemetery, “because I know that sometimes the explosions are very strong, so we need to always stay vigilant.”\n\nHis images reinforce that very real danger. In the first, an Israeli bomb is frozen in midair, just a few feet from striking its target, as cemetery visitors turn to flee.\n\nIn the frames that follow, an immense plume of flames and smoke erupts from the structure. Debris sprays skyward. The building staggers before collapsing on itself.\n\nThe experience of bearing witness and the images it produced are searing. “The explosion was loud and strong beyond imagination,” Alshrafi said. “It was incredibly violent.”\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "description": "The fighter, built for war with Russia, is set to be one of the three main pillars of Ukraine's future air force.",
    "fullText": "Swedish defense prime Saab is exploring the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System as a cheaper armament option for its JAS 39 Gripen fighters, firm executives told Business Insider this week.\n\n\"The APKWS is in interest because other platforms are now integrating 70mm guided rockets. So we are, of course, eyeing that capability now,\" Jussi Halmetoja, operations advisor for Saab's air domain, said at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nHalmetoja said the company was looking at ways to integrate the weapons system, which uses a guided version of the Hydra 70mm rocket, onto its older Gripen C and latest Gripen E models.\n\nHe made the comments as he and Mikael Franzên, chief marketing officer for the Gripen program, discussed the company's observation from the Ukraine war that it needs more inexpensive weapons to counter uncrewed aerial systems.\n\n\"I mean, right now we are using very expensive weapons to kill very cheap drones,\" Franzén said of traditional Western air combat.\n\nHe added that Saab is hoping to potentially equip the Gripen with systems that can fit multiple munitions onto a single hardpoint.\n\n\"If you can have four or 10 on each hardpoint, then you can kill a lot more drones,\" Franzên said. The APWKS is typically mounted on aircraft with multilaunch pods.\n\nKyiv has signed a letter of intent with Sweden to potentially acquire up to 150 Gripen E fighters in the coming years. Ukraine's air force has yet to fly the jet, which is touted as an ideal fighter for battling Russia because it's built to operate from dispersed, rugged airfields and in the Arctic domain.\n\nKyiv is now flying much of its small fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons from such small airfields, often moving the aircraft to increase their survivability.\n\nBut Franzén and Halmetoja said the Gripen can turn around much faster from dispersed airfields and be ready for a new mission within 10 minutes of landing.\n\nSweden, South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, Czechia, and Hungary are among the countries that fly the Gripen.\n\nThe APWKS, meanwhile, is already being deployed across various systems in Ukraine.\n\nFor example, the VAMPIRE counter-UAS systems feature a four-barrel launcher for the guided Hydra rockets that can be mounted on a pickup truck.\n\nThe cost of using one APKWS round is estimated at $20,000 to $35,000, compared to weapons more typically associated with modern fighters, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, which costs roughly $450,000, and the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which costs roughly $1 million.\n\nConcerns about missile costs against cheaper drones have risen steadily since the war began, and as Russia has continuously grown its loitering munitions mass manufacturing.\n\nOutside Ukraine, the US military has also been using the APWKS to recently fight drone attacks in the Middle East. The weapons system, loaded on American F-16s and F-15s, was responsible for roughly 40% of the drone kills scored by US forces against Houthi drones during last year's Operation Rough Rider.",

    "fullText": "The USS Massachusetts fired America's first 16-inch shell of World War II. It also fired the last.\n\nIn 1942, the 680-foot battleship fired the first US 16-inch projectile of the war in combat with French forces off the coast of Casablanca, Morocco, as part of Operation Torch. Three years later, the USS Massachusetts fired the last 16-inch projectile of World War II against Japanese forces in the final naval bombardment in Kamaishi, Honshu, Japan.\n\nAfter the war, the decorated battleship was decommissioned and destined to become scrap metal until its former crew members stepped in to raise the funds to save it.\n\nIn 1965, the USS Massachusetts opened to the public as a museum and war memorial in the very state it was named for.\n\n\"The most important function here is that we serve to honor veterans and active duty personnel,\" Christopher Nardi, Battleship Cove's chief operating officer, told Business Insider.\n\nTake a look inside the USS Massachusetts.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts was one of four battleships built as part of the South Dakota class, which was designed to be more compact than previous battleship classes.\n\nI visited Battleship Cove in January, when the museum operates with limited winter hours due to the frigid temperatures on board the ships. The full list of hours of operation can be found on Battleship Cove's website.\n\nGeneral admission costs $25 per adult.\n\nThe ship weighed 44,519 tons when fully loaded for combat.\n\nThe Below Deck tour takes visitors through the inner workings of the ship's technology, including the engine room, the gun plotting and handling rooms, and the radio room.\n\nThe World War II-focused tour features historical exhibits about the war as a whole and spotlights some of the battle damage the ship endured.\n\nThe Crew tour brings visitors through spaces that were part of the sailors' daily life on board, such as their bunks, galley, and laundry room.\n\nThe Topside tour explores the deck of the ship, including its many guns.\n\nColor-coded arrows direct visitors along each of the routes.\n\nThe ship has a total of nine 16-inch, 45-caliber Mark 6 guns: two three-gun turrets at the front of the ship (\"forward\") and one three-gun turret at the back (\"aft\"). They could hit targets up to 23 miles away.\n\nThe 16-inch measurement refers to the bore diameter, or the size of the hole that the shell is fired through. The cannons themselves are over 60 feet long.\n\nThe Bofors 40-millimeter guns featured a range of 6.25 miles and could fire between 120 and 160 rounds per minute.\n\nAt the height of World War II, the USS Massachusetts was outfitted with 72 40-millimeter guns.\n\nThe 20-millimeter Oerlikon autocannons featured a range of 2.75 miles.\n\nSome of the ship's 5-inch guns still work and are used for ceremonial gun salutes.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the seagull that decided to perch on one of the guns when I visited.\n\nEach nautical flag represents a letter or signal. For example, the flag representing the letter \"O\" can also mean \"man overboard.\"\n\nCrew members opened and closed the light's shutter to send messages in Morse code.\n\nWhen the ship was deployed, officers would have eaten their meals here off fine china.\n\nThe wardroom still features tables and seating for large groups.\n\nIn addition to functioning as a museum, Battleship Cove is the official World War II memorial for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nDuring World War II, the crew of the USS Massachusetts grew from its normal number of 1,793 enlisted men to 2,500. When the berthing rooms were full, the ship set up hammocks in other areas.\n\nOfficers were in charge of censoring crew members' letters to their loved ones, blacking out information like their location or even the weather.\n\nDuring the war, maintenance had to be performed while the ship was in the middle of the ocean.\n\nToday, museum volunteers use 3D printers to create replacement parts.\n\nThe galley prepared four meals per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight rations known as \"mid-rats.\"\n\nSailors labeled every item of their clothing, but some items still ended up in the lost-and-found, known as the \"lucky bag.\"\n\nIn the brig, sailors received only bread and water for meals.\n\nDuring the Battle of Casablanca in 1942, an 8-inch projectile hit the main deck and exploded in a bunk room. No one was injured since all of the sailors were at their battle stations, but the ship sustained damage from the shrapnel.\n\nThe holes have since been repaired, but red outlines on the walls show where they once were.\n\nThe sick bay treated battle wounds as well as everyday ailments such as ear infections or athlete's foot.\n\nOn Iowa-class battleships like the USS New Jersey, Broadway is the longest, straightest passageway on the ship. On South Dakota-class battleships like the USS Massachusetts, Broadway is thinner and not built in a straight line since the class was designed to be more compact.\n\nGunner's mates loaded shells and powder cases into the hoists, which moved them up to the upper handling room and then up to the gun mounts.\n\nSix powder bags were required to fire one 16-inch projectile.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts could hold over 1,200 projectiles.\n\nA device called a Mark 8 Rangekeeper computed where to aim the 16-inch guns based on factors such as the ship's course and speed and the direction of the wind.\n\nIn order to work in the distribution room, an electrician had to pass a test showing that he could get from his bunk to the distribution room and identify any circuit while blindfolded.\n\nRadiomen were responsible for typing messages and passing them to supervisors.\n\nNardi told Business Insider that the equipment in radio central is still operational thanks to the work of volunteers who continue to maintain it.\n\nCanvas bags with lead bottoms were kept in the code room just in case any top-secret information had to be thrown overboard if the ship was compromised.\n\nEven with a map of the ship and color-coded arrows pointing the way, touring the USS Massachusetts was a dizzying experience full of ladders, hatches, and tight corners. On a battleship that big, there's an endless amount of history to learn.\n\nNardi told me that touring historic battleships like the USS Massachusetts can provide insight into how modern Navy ships operate.\n\nBasic navigational equipment looks and works largely the same as it did on World War II battleships, Nardi said. Some communication devices, such as sound-powered telephones that harness the electricity generated by the user's voice, are also still widely used.\n\n\"I hear Navy personnel come on board and say, 'Oh, that hasn't changed much,'\" Nardi said.\n\nIn December, Trump announced a new \"Trump-class\" of ships, referring to them as \"battleships,\" as part of his plan for the US Navy's new \"Golden Fleet\" to reinvigorate American shipbuilding. White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly previously told Business Insider that Trump is \"prioritizing this vital industry to strengthen our country's economic and national security.\"\n\nHowever, the Trump-class ships would not technically qualify as battleships. To earn that title, they would have to be the largest, most heavily armored ships with the largest guns relative to other ships.\n\n\"The word 'battleship' can be used very generically, which is not accurate. We don't have them anymore, and President Trump's not going to build battleships. He's calling them that, but a battleship is what we have over here,\" Nardi said, gesturing at the USS Massachusetts floating in the Taunton River. \"That's a real battleship.\"",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes pounded Gaza on Wednesday, killing at least 21 Palestinians, including two infants, and further rocking a fragile ceasefire deal, hospital officials said. Israel said it was responding to a militant attack on Israeli soldiers that seriously wounded one.\n\nDeadly Israeli strikes have repeatedly punctuated the truce since it came into effect on Oct. 10, and the escalating Palestinian toll has made many in Gaza say it feels like the war is continuing unabated. Among the Palestinians killed Wednesday were five children, seven women and an on-duty paramedic, according to hospital officials.\n\n“The genocidal war against our people in the Gaza Strip continues,” said Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, director of Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital, in a Facebook post. “Where is the ceasefire? Where are the mediators?”\n\nIsrael strongly denies accusations that it is committing genocide in Gaza. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led militants poured into southern Israel after a surprise barrage of rockets, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and abducting 251.\n\nDeadly strikes have continued despite ceasefire deal\n\nThe deal attempted to halt the more than 2-year-old war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, it has been marred by repeated flareups of violence.\n\nA total of 556 Palestinians have been killed by Israel and 1,500 wounded since the ceasefire went into effect, according to Gaza health officials, while Israel's military says four Israeli soldiers have been killed.\n\nIsrael’s military has said its continuing strikes are responses to Hamas violations or militant attacks on its soldiers, but dozens of civilians have died. Eight Arab and Muslim countries, including mediators Egypt and Qatar, recently condemned what they called Israel’s “repeated violations” of the deal.\n\nAn Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with military policy, told The Associated Press that Israel's latest attacks were in response to militant gunfire that badly wounded a reservist soldier Wednesday morning.\n\nEarly morning strike kills 11, including two children\n\nIsraeli troops fired on a building in the Tuffah neighborhood in north Gaza, killing at least 11 people, most from the same family, said Shifa Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included two parents, their 10-day-old girl Wateen Khabbaz, her 5-month-old cousin, Mira Khabbaz, and the children's grandmother.\n\nMourners gathered in the courtyard of Shifa hospital Wednesday morning for funeral prayers.\n\n“What did this child do? …. Why are they killing the children?\" asked a relative of the family, Mohammad Jaser.\n\n“We don’t understand why this is happening to us. What do we do? Where do we go? This isn’t life,” he said.\n\nTwo young children were seen kneeling at the body of their father as a woman told them to bid him farewell. A young girl kissed her father's cheeks.\n\nStrikes on Gaza continue into Wednesday afternoon\n\nLater, an Israeli strike on a family’s tent in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people including a 12-year-old boy, said Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies.\n\nA strike on a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis killed at least two people and wounded five others, according to a field hospital run by the Palestinian Red Crescent in the area. The dead included Hussein Hassan Hussein al-Semieri, a paramedic who was on duty at the time, said the hospital.\n\nThirty-eight Palestinians were wounded in total by the strikes Wednesday, the Gaza health ministry said.\n\nPassage through Rafah border is minimal\n\nThe Rafah border crossing’s opening Monday was hailed as a step forward for the fragile ceasefire. But since then, Palestinian passage through the crossing has been marred by delays, interrogations and uncertainty over who would be allowed to cross.\n\nIt took the entire day Tuesday for 40 Palestinians to enter Gaza. Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, they finally arrived at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where their families welcomed them. By midday Wednesday, no one else had passed through the crossing.\n\nDespite no traffic, a European Union official said the Rafah border crossing was open. An EU mission and Palestinian workers were present at the crossing. The official, tasked with communicating for the EU, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be named.\n\nThree women who crossed into Gaza on Monday told The Associated Press a day later that Israeli troops blindfolded and handcuffed them, then interrogated and threatened them, holding them for several hours before they were released.\n\nThe EU official said that the border mission had no knowledge of luggage confiscation or mistreatment by Israeli soldiers or Palestinians in the border areas.\n\nAsked about the reports, the Israeli military said that “no incidents of inappropriate conduct, mistreatment, apprehensions, or confiscation of property by the Israeli security establishment are known.”\n\nWhile all fighting has not stopped, some parts of the ceasefire deal have moved forward.\n\nHamas has released all of the hostages it was holding, and in return Israel has released several thousand Palestinians and is beginning to reopen Rafah. Increased amounts of humanitarian aid have flowed into Gaza and a new technocratic committee has been appointed to administer the territory's daily affairs.\n\nBut other key elements of the ceasefire appear to have stalled, including the deployment of an international security force, the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza. The U.S. has given no timeline on when these parts of the deal will wrap up.\n\nOver 71,800 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo and Frankel from Jerusalem.

    "description": "BBC Sport finds evidence raising questions over the neutral eligibility of four Russian athletes.",
    "fullText": "Several Russian athletes approved to compete as neutrals at the Winter Olympics have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has cleared 13 competitors, external from Russia to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Milan-Cortina.\n\nTheir eligibility was assessed by a three-person IOC panel, external, with athletes deemed ineligible if they were found to have actively supported the war, including through social media activity or participation in pro-war events.\n\nHowever, material shared with the BBC by the Molfar Intelligence Institute, external and investigative journalist Artem Khudolieiev raises questions over whether some of those approved meet the IOC's broadly-framed criteria.\n\nMeanwhile, one member of the panel - Morinari Watanabe - was filmed embracing a Russian gymnast sanctioned for his involvement with Russia's war effort during a visit to Moscow in March, prompting further questions about the vetting process.\n\nUkraine's flag-bearer for the opening ceremony believes the IOC should review its neutral eligibility framework.\n\n\"Getting ready for competition in occupied territories, or supporting the war on social media, it is definitely not right to call them neutral because they're not,\" said skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nRussians and Belarusians cleared for Winter Olympics\n\n'Russians & Belarusians should compete in qualifiers'\n\nBBC Sport has verified the following evidence relating to four individuals cleared to compete as neutrals:\n\nPetr Gumennik (figure skating) - Gumennik has recently worked with and been coached by Ilya Averbukh, who has been sanctioned by Ukraine, external. Averbukh has held the role of 'Crimea's ambassador for sport', taken part in events in numerous occupied territories and staged performances for families of Russian soldiers.\n\nSavelii Korostelev (cross-country skiing) - Korostelev liked pro-Putin and pro-military content posted on Instagram by fellow skier Veronika Stepanova. He was also described as a \"private\" and an \"army skier\" in a 2023 article published by his club, CSKA, which is affiliated with the Russian armed forces.\n\nKseniia Korzhova (speed skating) - Korzhova liked pro-war content on Instagram from gymnast Nikita Nagorny, who has been sanctioned by the UK, external and European Union, external for his prominent role with the Russian army.\n\nDariya Nepryaeva (cross-country skiing) - Nepryaeva attended a ski team training camp in Crimea in 2022, months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The camp was filmed and broadcast by a state-backed television channel.\n\nUkraine's Olympic Committee has written to the IOC to raise concerns about Gumennik and Korzhova.\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussia's Sports Minister, Mikhail Degtyarev, has previously said that \"athletes are not responsible for relations between countries or for governmental decisions and according to the Olympic Charter they should have the right to compete\".\n\nSeparate reporting, external has suggested that Korostelev may have been completing compulsory military service, rather than voluntarily joining the army.\n\nThe final decision on whether the four athletes could compete in Milan-Cortina was taken by the IOC's Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel.\n\nWatanabe sits on the panel as the representative of international sports federations, by virtue of his role as president of World Gymnastics. He was also a candidate in last year's IOC presidential election.\n\nIn March 2025, Watanabe was filmed embracing Nagorny during a visit to Moscow.\n\nNagorny, an Olympic gold medallist at the Tokyo Games, has been a prominent supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nHe served as head of Yunarmiya, Russia's youth military organisation, between 2020 and 2024 and has been sanctioned by the UK, European Union and United States, external.\n\nThe UK sanctions notice accuses Nagorny of involvement in the forced deportation and re-education of Ukrainian children.\n\n\"It’s crazy,\" said Heraskevych, who held up a ‘No War’ sign at the Beijing Games.\n\n\"He's still hugging this person and still friendly with him. And then he decides whether these Russians are guilty or not guilty, whether they are engaged in the war or not.\"\n\nWorld Gymnastics, responding on behalf of Watanabe, said it would not comment on the IOC panel or its decisions.\n\nIt said Watanabe's visit to Russia \"took place a few days after he visited Ukraine\" and that its purpose \"was to show support to athletes affected by the war, on both sides\".\n\n\"Mr Nagorny has not been allowed to participate in World Gymnastics competitions since the beginning of the conflict,\" it added.\n\nDuring Watanabe's tenure as head of World Gymnastics, Russian athletes have also been allowed to return to international competition under neutral status in his sport.\n\nThat includes Angelina Melnikova, who was controversially cleared to compete last year despite previously posing with the pro-war 'Z' symbol and standing in local elections for Vladimir Putin's United Russia party.\n\nWorld Gymnastics said decisions regarding its Individual Neutral Athlete status are made \"by an independent ad hoc committee, following background checks conducted by an external company\".\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began just four days after the end of the last Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAt those Games, 209 Russians competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) because of sanctions linked to a state-sponsored doping scandal. They finished second in the medal table, winning 32 medals including five gold.\n\nSince the invasion, athletes holding Russian or Belarusian passports have been barred from many international sports competitions.\n\nBut the IOC has created a pathway for individuals to compete as neutrals, provided they meet strict criteria.\n\nThat framework was first applied at Paris 2024, where 32 competitors from Russia and Belarus took part as AINs.\n\nTo be eligible, they had to show they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military. They competed without national flags or anthems.\n\nThe same conditions apply in Milan-Cortina. Thirteen Russians and seven Belarusians have been approved across eight sports. Team events such as ice hockey and curling remain off limits.\n\nThe IOC says every neutral competitor must also be cleared by their international federation.\n\nSome bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), attempted to exclude neutrals altogether but that position was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in December, a ruling that came too late for many athletes to qualify.",

    "description": "Anthropic explains why Claude will remain ad-free—how advertising incentives conflict with building a genuinely helpful AI assistant users can trust.",
    "fullText": "There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.\n\nAdvertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.\n\nBut including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\n\nWe want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.\n\nWhen people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.\n\nConversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.\n\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\nWe still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.\n\nBeing genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.\n\nConsider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\n\nEven ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.\n\nWe recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.\n\nAnthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.\n\nExpanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.\n\nAI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.\n\nWe’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.\n\nAll third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.\n\nWe want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.\n\nOur experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.\n\nWe think Claude should work the same way.",

    "description": "Are LLMs the final blow in the war against Wirth's law?",
    "fullText": "In 1995, Turing laureate Niklaus Wirth wrote an essay called A Plea for Lean Software in which he mostly gripes about the state of software at the time. Among these gripes is this claim which Wirth attributes to his colleague Martin Reiser1, though it's become to be known as Wirth's Law:\n\nSoftware is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.\n\nDoing his best grandpa Simpson impersonation, Wirth complains:\n\nAbout 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as\nlittle as 8,000 bytes ofstorage. (Modern program editors request 100 times\nthat much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a\ncompiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants\nrequire megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On\nthe contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern\nsoftware would be utterly unusable.\n\nAside from the numbers involved here, which must sound utterly preposterous to the average modern reader, there's a lot to relate to. My 25 year career in software, all of which happened after 1995, was in many ways a story in two parts about Wirth's Law, an action and a reaction.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Wirth's conclusion that nothing of value had been gained for the loss in efficiency. When he laments \"the advent of windows, cut-and-paste strategies, and pop-up menus,\n[..] the replacement of meaningful command words by pretty icons\", he is not properly appreciating the value these features had in making computing accessible to more people, and is focusing too much on their runtime cost. Programmers are often too quick to judge software on its technical merits rather than it's social ones.\n\nWirth passed away 2 years ago, but he was a giant in the field of Computer Science and a huge inspiration to me and to many of my other inspirations. In many ways, my focus on simplicity and my own system design sensibilities find their genesis with him.\n\nWirth's law is so self evidently true that it's been a topic of continuous investigation and rediscovery.\n\nA notable example of this was Dan Luu's great post on input lag back in 2017. He felt that input latency was getting worse over time, so he got a high speed camera and measured the delay between pressing a key and the letter appearing on screen across a lot of different hardware. The lowest latency computer was the Apple 2e from 1983.\n\nInput latency has gone up since 1983 because there is a lot more software involved in the pipeline for handling input. The kind of hardware interrupt based input handling the Apple 2e had is not flexible enough to meet modern requirements, so this additional complexity buys us a lot of value... but it's certainly not free, and if you're not careful, one of the costs is latency.\n\nLuu goes on to write a lot about complexity and simplicity, and makes an interesting observation: the modern systems that fix the latency issue mostly do so not through removing complexity but by adding it. There was a lot of talk about complexity and simplicity at the time, because a huge number of software developers were working on another great tradeoff that had been made, this time in the datacenter: the widespread adoption of cloud computing.\n\nIn 1995, when Wirth wrote his essay, if you wanted to run a new internet company, you could just get a computer and run with it. Amazon didn't launch until July of that year, but it was famously started out of Jeff Bezos' garage.\n\nThe requirements for an internet company were simpler back then. The web wasn't some ubiquitous technology with total population penetration. There were only about 16 million people using it at the time; more people had an SNES than used the internet. Slashdot didn't exist. There was no real expectation of 5 9's 24/7/365 availability, and no opportunity to \"go viral.\"\n\nTo run your company's software, you could build your own datacenter, but this is a complicated task requiring a lot of expertise; you need land, permits, contractors, etc. I wouldn't even know where to start.\n\nYou could buy an existing datacenter, but you'd still need to manage power, backup generators/batteries, air conditioning, fire suppression, racks, maintenance, networking. Again, decades in the software industry, and I can barely build a competent list of requirements. It's a big investment, and there's a lot of opex.\n\nYou could rent a rack in a colo and focus on your compute needs, but those needs could change in an instant. If you plan out costs for 100,000 users and you never gain traction, you've overspent and are burning cash on pointless hardware you could be using to develop your product. If you get hit with a tidal wave of interest, you could be showing people the fail whale for years or miss your opportunity for success entirely.\n\nCloud computing was the era's answer. By 2010, Amazon was out of Jeff's basement and running its own massive datacenters for their online operations. As Steve Yegge wrote in 2010, Bezos had distributed an influential API mandate in 2002 requiring all internal teams to make their services available via an API. By 2006, they had already built a platform that they felt they could release to paying customers in the form of EC2 and S3. AWS let you rent capacity in Amazon's datacenter through a web interface or via direct API calls, billed on granular timescales.\n\nEach step in this pipeline imparts additional cost, but they're all pretty valuable, especially the last step. There are even more steps in that pipeline today, with fully managed services like RDS and IAM which abstract the management of software and Lambda which even further abstract your hardware requirements and allow you to scale (and pay) purely on utilization.\n\nEven though the cost to run software had gone up, the improved accessibility of cloud platforms and the reduction of risky capex led to an explosion in web software. All the while, hardware was racing ahead, making the rented capacity more powerful per unit cost and reducing the per-user cost.\n\nUnfortunately, not every \"Wirth tradeoff\" is sound engineering.\n\nEarly in my career, I was working at a newspaper publisher owned by Condé Nast. I was the lead engineer on one of the company's more forward looking development projects, a Django application that managed local sports results data across dozens of regional newspapers. The application provided a single source of truth for very different users and use cases:\n\nThe print syndication system involved writing some pretty gnarly templates in order to generate feeds that could be understood by their newspaper printing systems. After a while, we noticed a problem. These templates were taking minutes to render and setting the database on fire every night.\n\nIf you've been around the block in software, you might already know the issue. The templates were using an ORM which dynamically loaded foreign key fields on attribute access, so innocent looking loops were doing one database query per iteration. These were complex templates with many nested loops: they were sending hundreds of thousands of database queries per render, many of them just the same query over and over again from a different loop in a different part of the template.\n\nWe could fix some of the terrible performance by pre-loading those fields with a join, but we had a lot of templates, and they were complex enough and the database large enough that this wasn't a realistic path to success. As Dan Luu concludes in his study on latency, the solution that worked required adding more complexity in the form of a smart caching layer.\n\nAlthough we didn't know we were making it when we started the template project, this was a \"bad\" Wirth tradeoff. It still had utility: instead of having to manage what data might be needed in what template carefully, we could grab a list of top level objects and let the ORM fetch the rest of the data we needed on the fly.\n\nThe project started up quickly, but even at a pretty low scale of complexity, it became impossible to execute successfully. Before we realized what the problem was, we were using the convenience of these auto-loaded fields without understanding their true cost, and the software we built was a wasteful monstrosity as a result.\n\nI see the same thing happening now but at broader scale with LLMs, and I feel myself sympathizing more and more with Wirth's cane shaking wrath.\n\nProgramming is the act of getting a computer to do something for you. Many people are discovering that for the first time, thanks to LLMs, they can ask a computer to do something for them, and it will actually go and do it. However, limiting yourself to programming only through this approach poses some problems.\n\nWhile they might not be the unbound ecological disaster that many of their detractors claim they are, LLMs are still intensely computationally expensive. You can ask an AI what 2 * 3 is and for the low price of several seconds of waiting, a few milliliters of water and enough power to watch 5% of a TikTok video on a television, it will tell you. But the computer you have in front of you can perform this calculation a billion times per second.\n\nIf the problem of my accidental database denial of service syndication feed was down to ignorance over the costs of ORM usage, it's pretty obvious that a similar kind of ignorance can lead to enormous unintended costs once we start integrating LLMs into our automation.\n\nI've seen a few instances of this out in the wild that lead me to believe that this trap might be particularly tricky to avoid. Despite the capacity for LLMs to educate, or simulate education, or at least point you towards related materials some of which may be real, that's not how laypeople use them.\n\nThey present the LLM with a problem and ask it solve that problem.\n\nOne example of this is from myself, as this is how I used LLMs in my first go, too. I had a dump of recipes from a great but sadly unmaintained recipe site that I wanted to import into a self-hosted recipe management app.\n\nI thought \"Well, this sounds tedious, let me ask an LLM to do this.\" So I pointed a local LLM to the specification for the destination format, and asked it to convert the files. It converted one file every 10 minutes, inaccurately and without proper formatting. It was slow and it produced trash.\n\nWhen you see engineers heap praise on programming agents, this isn't how they are using them. You don't ask the LLM to perform a repetitive and precise task, you ask it to build a script that performs that task. Except in rare cases, this script does not itself use LLMs.\n\nIronically, if you have the foresight to describe this problem to a major AI model and ask it how you should use an AI to solve it, this is exactly what it will tell you to do.\n\nThis approach subtly different from the way you might use LLMs for many other tasks, but it's crucial to getting results that reliably get a computer to do something for you. LLMs don't do reliable, they don't do repeatable. Building a program allows you to iterate on a deterministic solution with a stable source of truth, and you come away with an artifact that may or not be useless, but which actually works, and in my case converts 70 files/sec.\n\nAnother example I came across was this twitter thread by BenjaminDEKR, which I saw being ridiculed on bsky. He asked his personal agent to remind him to get milk, and this led the agent to repeatedly ask Opus if it was daytime yet. Along with the context from his heartbeat file, this resulted in a $0.75 charge for each heartbeat, costing him almost $20 during a single night's sleep.\n\nMaybe you decide that for your purposes 00:00 is night and 08:00 is day and use a basic local gettimeofday call to determine which span you're in. Maybe you're unsatisfied with anything other than astronomical day/night and can generate a sunrise/sunset table for the year using NOAA's unmaintained solar calculator to dynamically produce your day/night spans?\n\nYou could do these things, but not if asking the LLM to solve problems is your problem solving approach. If asking an LLM is the only way you know how to solve problems, then you optimize the question asking by reducing heartbeat frequency and running on a cheaper model. Problem solved!\n\nThe overall concern is that having a magic box that gives you the answers ends up being a thought terminating solution to any problem.\n\nWhen I wrote about the ecological impacts of AI, one of the non-ecological impacts I cited was the possibility that \"AI erodes human skill.\" A recent release by research fellows at Anthropic, \"How AI Impacts Skill Formation\", suggests this fear isn't unfounded:\n\nWe find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was at a family gathering watching some of the kids go through a huge backlog of red envelopes that their grandparents had saved for them over various missed holidays. They were pulling out all of the cash, at which point they were going to tally it all up and split it evenly.\n\nWhen the adults challenged them to come up with better counting strategies, one of them suggested they could throw all of the money on the floor, take a picture, and ask ChatGPT to tally it all.\n\nThe instincts are for people to get the AI to do work for them, not to learn from the AI how to do the work themselves.\n\nWirth's law posits that software can erase gains faster than hardware can make them, but I'm afraid the reality is much worse than that.\n\nIf you've studied computer science, you might have heard of a function called Busy Beaver. The name is unfortunately silly, but it's a fairly important thought experiment in computability. BB(N) is defined as the maximum number of steps a terminating turing machine with N states can run.\n\nThis function is known to be noncomputable, because any algorithm that could compute it would be able to solve the halting problem, which is known to be undecidable. BB(1..3) were known in the 1960s to be 1, 6, and 21. In a pleasant bit of symmetry with Dan Luu's experiments, BB(4) was discovered to be 107 in 1983, the same year his Apple 2e was built. In 2024, BB(5) was proven to be 47,176,870.\n\nAs N grows, BB is known to eventually outgrow any computable sequence, including famous fast-growing sequences like TREE(). BB(6) has a lower bound that is so large that it is impossible to explain how large it is to someone without a significant background in mathematics.\n\nSoftware has an unprecedented capability to produce a correct answer in the most resource consuming way possible. Of course, producing incorrect answers or no answer at all is also an option.\n\nDespite the apparent truth of Wirth's law, engineers have been actively battling against it for decades, but I worry that with LLMs we might have lost the war.\n\nAm I just the latest in a long line of engineers who can't appreciate the newfound democratization of programming, or have we crossed into a \"bad\" Wirth tradeoff, where the growth curve of runtime complexity is something that hardware advancements cannot possibly dig us back out of?",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Historians and observers accused the Trump administration of trying to rewrite American history to justify its own foreign policy decisions toward Latin America by posting a “historically inaccurate” version of the Mexican-American war.\n\nThe Monday statement from the White House commemorating the anniversary of the war described the conflict as a “legendary victory that secured the American Southwest, reasserted American sovereignty, and expanded the promise of American independence across our majestic continent.” The statement drew parallels between the period in U.S. history and its own increasingly aggressive policies toward Latin America, which it said would “ensure the Hemisphere remains safe.”\n\n“Guided by our victory on the fields of Mexico 178 years ago, I have spared no effort in defending our southern border against invasion, upholding the rule of law, and protecting our homeland from forces of evil, violence, and destruction,” the statement said, though it was unsigned.\n\nIn the post, the White House makes no mention of the key role slavery played in the war and glorifies the wider “Manifest Destiny” period, which resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Native Americans from their land.\n\nAlexander Aviña, Latin American history professor at Arizona State University, said the White House statement “underplays the massive amounts of violence that it took to expand” the U.S. to the Pacific shore at a time when the Trump administration has stuck its hand in Latin American affairs in a way not seen in decades, deposing Venezuela's president, meddling in elections and threatening military action in Mexico and other countries.\n\n“U.S. political leaders since then have seen this as an ugly aspect of U.S. history, this is a pretty clear instance of U.S. imperialism against its southern neighbor,” Aviña said. “The Trump administration is actually embracing this as a positive in U.S. history and framing it – inaccurately historically – as some sort of defensive measure to prevent the Mexico from invading them.”\n\nOn Tuesday, criticisms of the White House statement quickly rippled across social media.\n\nAsked about the statement in her morning news briefing, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum guffawed, quipping and noting “we have to defend sovereignty.” Sheinbaum, who has walked a tight rope with the Trump administration, has responded to Trump with a balanced tone and occasionally with sarcasm, like when Trump changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nThe Mexican-American war (1846–1848) was triggered by long-running border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico and the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845. For years leading up to the war, Americans had gradually moved into the then-Mexican territory. Mexico had banned slavery and U.S. abolitionists feared the U.S. land grab was in part an attempt to add slave states.\n\nAfter fighting broke out and successive U.S. victories, Mexico ceded more than 525,000 square miles of territory — including what now comprises Arizona, California, western Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah — to the U.S.\n\nThe moment turned Texas into a key chess piece during the U.S. Civil War and led former President Ulysses S. Grant to write later that the conflict with Mexico was “one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was formed when five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War — as it is sometimes known in the U.S. — north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it.\n\nThe war continues to be a historical sticking point between the two countries, particularly as Sheinbaum repeatedly reminds Trump that her country is a sovereign nation whenever Trump openly weighs taking military action against Mexican cartels and pressures Mexico to bend to its will.\n\nThe White House statement falls in line with wider actions taken by the Trump administration to mold the federal government's language around its own creed, said Albert Camarillo, history professor at Stanford University, who described the statement as a “distorted, ahistorical, imperialist version\" of the war.\n\nAviña said the statement serves \"to assert rhetorically that the U.S. is justified in establishing its so-called ‘America First’ policy throughout the Americas,” regardless of the historical accuracy.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered the rewriting of history on display at the Smithsonian Institution, saying it was “restoring truth and sanity to American history.”\n\nThe administration has scrubbed government websites of history, legal records and data it finds disagreeable. Trump also ordered the government to remove any signs that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living,\" including those making reference to slavery, destruction of Native American cultures and climate change.\n\n“This statement is consistent with so many others that attempt to whitewash and reframe U.S. history and erase generations of historical scholarship,” Camarillo said.",

    "fullText": "PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russia's investment in its Northern Fleet is undiminished despite more years of conflict in Ukraine, the British ​navy's top naval commander said on Tuesday, adding that responding to ‌Moscow's aggressive posture was testing for Western powers.\n\n\"Russian investment in their Northern Fleet, and in particular, ‌in their subsurface capabilities, is undiminished,\" General Gwyn Jenkins, First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, told French think tank IFRI's naval conference in Paris.\n\n\"Despite the horrendous cost in terms of national resource and blood to Russia, of their egregious invasion ⁠of Ukraine, they have continued ‌to pump resource into their Northern Fleet and their subsurface capabilities,\" he said.\n\nJenkins, who was speaking alongside top navy chiefs ‍from the United States, France, Italy and the Netherlands, said Russia's activity was testing Western capabilities, given how long it took to upgrade, build and develop new vessels in a ​fast-changing technological environment.\n\n\"It doesn't take many assets to fix us as allies, ‌because we have a very low risk tolerance of allowing a aggressive actor operating in our backyard, and that does take a lot of resource to respond to,\" Jenkins said.\n\nVice-Admiral Harold Liebregs, commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy echoed Jenkins' comments saying Russia was being increasingly emboldened in the North Sea and loitering ⁠over vital infrastructure, possibly preparing further actions.\n\n\"We ​see ships operating drones that fly over our ​territory, and we see the shadow fleet, or Dark Fleet, that's fueling the Russian war economy, using ships that are ill maintained, ‍not insured, and posing ⁠all kinds of liability issues in our precious North Sea,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the main point here is that we should not accept this ⁠as the new normal, because it pushes us back in a position where we have ‌less freedom to manoeuvre, and that creates a less suitable strategic ‌position.\"",

    "description": "Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.",
    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.\n\nA minor earthquake hit San Ramon, Calif., on Monday morning, but additional soil shifted hours later south in the Bay Area when Patriots and Seahawks players kicked off Super Bowl week at opening night in San Jose.\n\nPlayers from both teams fielded questions, which flew at them with the unpredictability of bouncing footballs. Fans flocked to the San Jose Convention Center just to catch glimpses of the NFL stars. Hundreds of reporters shouted questions, with content spanning from the mundane to bizarre.\n\nBut one thing was clear: the explicitly expressed identities of Vrabel's Patriots and coach Mike Macdonald's Seahawks. And neither coach is willing to budge ahead of their quest for a Lombardi Trophy.\n\n\"This will be a great identity matchup for us,\" Vrabel said. \"This will be an identity war on the biggest stage. They play hard. Their defense runs to the football. They cause a lot of turnovers.\n\n\"They are committed to running the football. It's a physical football team. ... This will be a huge challenge.\"\n\nVrabel's Patriots share similar characteristics. The Patriots and Seahawks each rank inside the Top 4 in points scored and points allowed. They also ranked inside the Top 8 in yards gained and yards allowed in 2025.\n\nMVP candidate Drake Maye propelled the Patriots, who totaled the fourth-most passing yards in the NFL. The Patriots also ranked 6th in rushing.\n\nVeteran quarterback Sam Darnold and the Seahawks ranked No. 8 in passing yards and No. 10 in rushing.\n\nThe Seahawks defense ranked No. 3 against the run and No. 10 against the pass. The Patriots ranked No. 6 against the run and No. 9 against the pass.\n\nA key difference between the teams this season was the Seahawks' strength in special teams, specifically returns. They ranked third in both kick and punt return average. That element, which aids field position, could be crucial in a game played between two tough defenses.\n\nThe team to establish dominance in their valued areas is likely to win Super Bowl LX.\n\n\"We are going to do everything we can to go out there and play a good football game,\" Darnold said. \"Execute the way we know how to execute.\"\n\nNeither coach would disclose specifics within their game plans, but Macdonald also plans to implement the Seahawks' previously successful strategies.\n\n\"We are going to stick to our process,\" Macdonald said. \"The way we wanna play is we always want to be within our wheelhouse, but every game we are going to tailor things to our opponents.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we have to do the things we are really good at. Right now, that's our plan.\"\n\nVrabel's mere presence could be an advantage for the Patriots. The coach, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker, took plenty of lessons from those runs. He expects that knowledge to pay off this week in the Bay Area, when players will be confronted with potential distractions.\n\n\"I think that all builds up to the end of the week, on things we can focus on that may be a little different with this football game; the warm-up time before the game, the length of halftime,\" Vrabel said. \"All of these things that are going to be a little bit different. We can try to draw on everybody's experiences.\"\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots will practice this week at respective facilities at San Jose State and Stanford, which sit about 22 miles apart.\n\n\"It's just another challenge,\" Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said. \"We are playing the other best team in the NFL. We're excited for it. Just ready to go out there and have one more with the guys on Sunday.\"\n\nThe Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. The least expensive price for a ticket for Super Bowl LX, as of Monday night, was listed for about $5,000 on the secondary market.",

    "fullText": "The once-lauded director of Black Swan and The Wrestler has drowned himself in AI slop with an embarrassing new online series\n\nIf you happen to find yourself stumbling through Time magazine’s YouTube account, perhaps because you are a time traveller from the 1970s who doesn’t fully understand how the present works yet – then you will be presented with something that many believe represents the vanguard of entertainment as we know it.\n\nOn This Day … 1776 is a series of short videos depicting America’s revolutionary war. What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.\n\nThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.\n\nIt is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.\n\nBecause, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.\n\nIt’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.\n\nOn This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.\n\nBut surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.\n\nLess than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.\n\nBut this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new round of U.S.-brokered talks on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine is set to go ahead this week after a brief postponement, a senior Kremlin official said Monday, with negotiations taking place against a backdrop of continued front-line fighting and deadly long-range attacks on rear areas.\n\nThe trilateral talks will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi, where a previous meeting was held last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that he would be sending a delegation to the meeting, which initially was to be held at the weekend but was delayed by what Peskov said were scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe Trump administration has over the past year pushed the two sides to find compromises. But breaking the deadlock on key issues appears no closer as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor approaches later this month.\n\nPeskov described the talks as “very complex.”\n\n“On some issues, we have certainly come closer because there have been discussions, conversations, and on some issues it is easier to find common ground,” he told reporters. “There are issues where it’s more difficult to find common ground.”\n\nRussian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev was in Miami, Florida, at the weekend for talks with American officials, but Peskov refused to provide any details of the meeting.\n\nA key sticking point is whether Russia gets to keep the Ukrainian territory its army has occupied, especially in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Moscow is also demanding possession of other Ukrainian land there that it hasn’t been able to capture.\n\nRussian drones and missiles have continued to bombard civilian areas , killing 12 miners in a bus on Sunday in the most recent mass aerial attack. The barrages have also wrecked the Ukrainian power grid, leaving people without heating, light and running water in bitter winter cold.\n\nDefense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Monday that authorities are taking steps to prevent Russia using Starlink satellite services to steer its drones toward their targets.\n\nFedorov asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine. Starlink is a global internet network that relies on around 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth.\n\nUkraine is requiring civilian and military Starlink users to register their terminals on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals would be disabled inside Ukraine, Fedorov said.\n\n“Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked,” Musk said Sunday on X. “Let us know if more needs to be done.”\n\nLitvinova contributed from Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "\"During World War II, the British dressed a dead body in a Royal Marines uniform and planted letters saying the Allies were going to invade Greece, and that Sicily was just a decoy. It was called Operation Mincemeat.\"",
    "fullText": "Context: The body used in Operation Mincemeat was that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh man who died after ingesting rat poison. He was dressed as \"Captain (Acting Major) William Martin\" of the Royal Marines and planted with fake letters, supposedly written by General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander. The letters claimed that Greece and Sardinia were the real invasion targets, with Sicily presented as a decoy.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, the submarine HMS Seraph released the body off the coast of Huelva, Spain, a country closely aligned with Germany. Intercepted German communications later confirmed that the deception worked. In response, Hitler transferred the 1st Panzer Division to Greece, doubled the Sardinian garrison to 10,000 troops, and moved seven infantry divisions away from Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky, began on July 9, 1943, and succeeded in part because German defenses had been deliberately thinned as a result of the ruse.\n\nContext: In April 1942, soldiers of the Polish 2nd Transport Company (later 22nd Artillery Supply Company) encountered an Iranian boy near Hamadan with an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. They traded items — reportedly a Swiss Army knife, coins, and rations — for the cub. To circumvent British regulations forbidding mascots on military transport ships, Wojtek was officially enlisted as a private, receiving a serial number and paybook. He was later promoted to corporal. At the Battle of Monte Cassino (May 1944), eyewitnesses reported seeing Wojtek help move crates of artillery ammunition, though debate exists about whether these were live shells or empties. After the war, Wojtek lived at Edinburgh Zoo from 1947 until his death in December 1963.\n\nContext: According to the US Census Bureau's 2007 analysis, Washington ranked #138 among American surnames, with 89.9% of bearers being Non-Hispanic Black (146,520 of 163,036 total). A 2016 Census update showed the percentage remained above 87%. Genealogist Tony Burroughs is widely cited for the 82–94% figure for earlier censuses (1880–1930). However, historians caution that the reasons freedpeople chose this surname varied — some chose it to honor George Washington, while others took the surnames of their former enslavers (white families named Washington). As Burroughs noted: \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George... As far as I'm concerned, it's a coincidence.\"\n\nContext: Melbourne was never officially named \"Batmania\" by any government authority. However, the earliest documented use of \"Batmania\" appears in a satirical letter to the Launceston Cornwall Chronicle (June 13, 1835), explicitly mocking John Batman's contested land claims with Aboriginal peoples. The term also appeared on some private maps of the Port Phillip Association, but Police Magistrate George Stewart's 1836 official report called the settlement \"Bearbrass.\" Governor Richard Bourke voided Batman's private treaty (August 1835) and officially named the town \"Melbourne\" on April 10, 1837, after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at the time.\n\nContext: During major events, Versailles could accommodate up to 10,000 people, with inadequate sanitation infrastructure for such crowds. Primary sources confirm the problem. Princess Elizabeth Charlotte (Liselotte), Duchess of Orléans, wrote in 1702: \"The people stationed in the galleries in front of our room piss in all the corners. It is impossible to leave one's apartments without seeing somebody pissing.\" However, historian Tony Spawforth notes that Versailles was not entirely devoid of facilities — it had public latrines, private cabinets d'aisance in noble apartments, and received its first flush toilet in 1738. The palace's sanitation problems were real but sometimes exaggerated in popular accounts.\n\nContext: When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died on November 9, 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion instructed Ambassador Abba Eban to offer the presidency to Einstein. The formal letter arrived on November 17, 1952. Einstein's written response read: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\" Ben-Gurion reportedly told an aide: \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\nContext: The Soviet anti-tank dog program operated from approximately 1930 to 1946. Dogs carried 10–12 kg explosive mines with a wooden lever trigger that would detonate when the dog crawled beneath a tank. Training involved placing food beneath stationary vehicles to condition the dogs. However, training occurred on Soviet diesel-engine tanks, while German tanks used gasoline engines with distinctly different sounds and exhaust smells. During the disastrous first combat deployment in summer 1941, dogs frequently ran toward familiar-smelling Soviet tanks or retreated to trenches — forcing handlers to shoot their own returning animals. The program claimed 300 German tank kills, though historians consider approximately 50 more realistic. Combat use largely ended by 1943, with training schools shifting focus to mine-detection work.\n\nContext: Eight German saboteurs landed by U-boat on US shores in June 1942 — four on Long Island, four in Florida. Two of them, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, had no intention of completing the mission: Dasch considered America his adopted country, and Burger had spent 17 months in a Nazi concentration camp. Shortly after landing, Dasch contacted the FBI, though they were skeptical until he dumped $84,000 in mission funds on an agent's desk. His information led to the capture of all eight within two weeks.\n\nA military tribunal convicted them all. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942: Richard Quirin, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Werner Thiel, Herbert Haupt, and Hermann Neubauer. Dasch and Burger received prison sentences instead — 30 years and life, respectively — for their cooperation.\n\nThis was the largest federal execution by electric chair, but not the US record overall. Kentucky executed seven men on July 13, 1928, and New York executed seven at Sing Sing on August 12, 1912.\n\nSources: Naval History and Heritage Command, The Times\n\nContext: The scientific evidence for ancient polychromy (painted sculpture) is now overwhelming. Using ultraviolet light, X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, researchers have identified traces of Egyptian blue, cinnabar red, ochre yellow, and malachite green on ancient sculptures. Vinzenz Brinkmann at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung in Frankfurt has been studying this since the 1980s, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color\" exhibition (2022–2023) displayed vivid scientific reconstructions. As the Met's chief scientist Marco Leona put it: \"A completely white statue, to a Greek observer, would have looked like some shoddy effort.\"\n\nContext: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank the USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, about four miles offshore from Charleston Harbor — the first successful submarine attack in naval history. The hand-cranked, 40-foot vessel used a spar torpedo: a copper cylinder packed with gunpowder mounted on a 22-foot pole. The Housatonic sank in about five minutes, killing five Union sailors. But the Hunley never signaled its return, and all eight crew members perished with it.\n\nWhen the wreck was raised in 2000, it was remarkably intact — no major hull damage, hatches still closed, bilge pumps unused. The crew's skeletons were found still seated at their stations, with no broken bones or signs they'd tried to escape. The mystery lingered for years until Duke researcher Rachel Lance (2017) concluded that the shockwave from their own torpedo — detonated just 16 feet from the bow — transmitted through the hull and caused fatal lung trauma, killing them instantly.\n\nContext: Three major earthquakes struck the New Madrid Seismic Zone between 1811 and 1812: December 16, 1811 (M7.5), January 23, 1812 (M7.3), and February 7, 1812 (M7.5). These destroyed the town of New Madrid, Missouri, toppled chimneys as far as Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Kentucky, and were felt over approximately 1 million square miles. Eyewitness Eliza Bryan wrote of \"the screams of the affrighted inhabitants... the roaring of the Mississippi.\" The February 1812 quake even created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee when the ground sank by as much as 6 meters.\n\nAs for the 1990 panic, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning predicted a 50% probability of a major earthquake for December 2–3, 1990. Schools across four states closed, businesses shuttered, and the St. Louis Red Cross distributed 230,000 earthquake preparedness kits. Nothing happened. Northwestern geologist Seth Stein called it \"the greatest non-event since 'The War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nContext: The Haitian Revolution was crucial to Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana. Napoleon sent over 20,000 troops under General Charles Leclerc to reconquer Saint-Domingue, with reinforcements eventually bringing the total to more than 30,000. The vast majority perished — primarily from yellow fever — with fewer than 8,000 surviving. Saint-Domingue had been France's most valuable colony, generating approximately 300 million livres annually. Louisiana was intended as a supply base for Caribbean sugar operations. So without Saint-Domingue, it became strategically worthless. War with Britain was also imminent (it resumed in May 1803), meaning France couldn't defend Louisiana anyway. The $15 million sale (roughly $380 million today) was a strategic reallocation of an indefensible asset, not simple bankruptcy.\n\nContext: The 369th Infantry Regiment was composed of African American soldiers, segregated from the US Army and assigned to the French 16th Division (4th French Army). They spent 191 days under fire — the longest of any American unit — and their record states they \"never lost a foot of ground.\"\n\nThe soldier referenced is Private Henry Johnson. On May 15, 1918, Johnson and fellow soldier Needham Roberts were manning an observation post when a German raiding party of at least 12 attacked. Despite sustaining 21 wounds, Johnson fought them off, primarily with his bolo knife, killing four and wounding others. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre, but wouldn't receive the US Medal of Honor until 2015, posthumously.\n\nThe regiment suffered approximately 1,500 casualties during the war. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, they became the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine River, arriving on November 20 as occupation forces.\n\nContext: Truman learned about the Manhattan Project shortly after becoming president upon Roosevelt's sudden death in April 1945. He was briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and received detailed information about the bomb's development and potential.\n\nThe more nuanced historical argument, advanced by nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein, is that Truman may have misunderstood Hiroshima's nature — believing it was primarily a military installation rather than a city with a military base. In his July 25, 1945, diary entry, Truman wrote he had ordered the bomb used \"so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.\" On August 9, he stated publicly that \"the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.\"\n\nWellerstein subsequently argues that Truman likely learned the full extent of civilian casualties only on August 8, the day before Nagasaki. On August 10, 1945, Truman ordered that no further atomic bombs be dropped without his express authorization, asserting presidential control over nuclear weapons for the first time. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), signed August 1, 1946, transferred nuclear weapons from military to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission, institutionalizing civilian/presidential authority over nuclear weapons.\n\nContext: Much of what we know comes from two key sources. On the Mediterranean side, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid-first century CE) was written by a Greek-speaking Egyptian merchant living under Roman rule. While the author himself traveled only as far as India, the text refers to lands farther east, including a place called \"Thinae,\" generally understood to mean China, based on reports circulating through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nOn the Chinese side, the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han) records that in 166 CE, envoys claiming to represent \"Andun, king of Daqin\" — likely the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus — arrived at the court of Emperor Huan. They came by sea via Rinan (in modern-day Vietnam), bearing luxury goods such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Most historians believe these were not official diplomats but Greco-Roman merchants operating out of Roman Egypt or Syria, traveling through Southeast Asian maritime routes.\n\nAlso in Nifty: These 14 DIY Fails Are Just So, Sooooo Bad (And I'm Laughing So, Sooooo Hard)\n\nAlso in Nifty: People Are Sharing Things You See In Someone Else's Home That Immediately Signal They're Middle Class",

    "description": "Top 10: The Second World War Fighters Souped-Up for Extreme Air Racing",
    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "fullText": "Former Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely nuts on President Donald Trump in a new interview, branding his Make America Great Again movement a “big lie” and accusing the president of ignoring U.S. citizens so that he can focus on waging “war on behalf of Israel.”\n\nThe ex-lawmaker shared her eyebrow-raising thoughts in an interview with political commentator Kim Iversen on YouTube on Thursday.\n\n“MAGA is — I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people,” Greene said.\n\nShe said Trump has completely turned on his base and is more worried about serving the “big big donors” who send money to his PACs and have pitched in for his new ballroom.\n\n“Those are the people that get the special favors, the government contracts, they get the pardons,” Greene said. “And it’s the foreign countries that are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.”\n\nGreene then accused the president of caring more about Iran than what’s going on in the USA.\n\n“I’m sorry, we’ve got civil war practically breaking out in Minnesota, can we not care about that?” she said.\n\nGreene then moved to bashing Israel, which she said Trump is fixated on. She accused him of overlooking “murdered” Gazans so that he can eventually build a new Trump hotel.\n\n“We’re seeing war on behalf of Israel,” Greene fumed. “We’re seeing the people in Gaza — innocent people in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of them completely murdered, so that they can build some new real estate development and money can pour in and everyone can get rich there in New Gaza.”\n\nHer comments come a few weeks after Greene resigned from Congress. She announced she was leaving public office last fall amid her feud with Trump, which largely stemmed from her accusing the president of not moving fast enough to release files on dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump in return gave her the nickname Marjorie “Traitor” Greene and said his former ally had “some sort of act going on.”\n\nWatch via The Kim Iversen Show.\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Bluntly Declares MAGA ‘Was All a Lie’ in Scalding Take on Trump’s GOP first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Europe fears it can't beat Russia's style of war — creating a golden opportunity for defense founders.",
    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

    "fullText": "(refiles to fix hyperlinks in paragraph 8, 14)\n\nDUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's leadership warned of a regional conflict on Sunday if the U.S. were to attack it, stoking the tension between Washington and Tehran, and it ​designated EU armies as \"terrorist groups\" in a retaliatory move.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its naval presence in the ‌Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.\n\nDespite the ‌standoff between Iran's clerical rulers and the Trump administration, both sides have signalled they are ready to resume talks, and regional allies such as Turkey have sought de-escalation.\n\nAn Iranian official denied an earlier report by state-run Press TV that the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces would carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and Monday, telling Reuters they have no such plan and the media ⁠reports are wrong.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‌was quoted on state media as saying that although Trump says he has sent ships to the region, \"the Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred ‍by these threats\".\n\n\"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in ​the region, raising the risk of war after Iran's deadly crackdown in January on nationwide protests against Iranian leadership.\n\nTrump was weighing ‌options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces, Reuters has reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday Trump told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.\n\nTrump also said: \"I hope they negotiate something acceptable. You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

    "title": "Infantry will still be fighting in muddy holes even as drones change war, British officer says",
    "description": "Ukraine is showing how much drones can change the battle. But a British unit going all-in on them said much about war remains unchanged.",
    "fullText": "A British military unit that is leaning heavily into drones says that even though the technology may be the future of war, it probably won't fundamentally change most of infantry life as it is now, at least not anytime soon.\n\nThe Irish Guards, an elite infantry regiment within the British Army, have been preparing intensively to operate with drones after watching the heavy drone use in Ukraine and receiving advice from Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nBut Lt. Col Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of its 1st Battalion, told Business Insider that he believes most of an infantryman's job likely won't change even as drone technology proliferates.\n\n\"To me, it feels like 80% of the job of an infantryman is exactly the same and probably exactly the same as it was in a Napoleonic era,\" he said. \"You need to be fit. You need to be strong and robust. You need to be able to survive in the field. You need to be able to dig a hole.\"\n\n\"That hasn't changed,\" he said. \"I doubt it's going to change for a while longer.\"\n\nHe said that land warfare and infantry combat tend to be \"regressive,\" which is to say \"it doesn't matter how much technology you throw into the field, it doesn't matter how supremely trained your troops are. Sooner or later it ends up as two blokes in a muddy hole, slugging it out with a billhook or a spade.\"\n\n\"Once the tank's gone, you just regress to the next type of technology,\" he said — and eventually to soldiers on foot. \"So I don't think a huge majority of the job has changed.\"\n\nThat continuity, Irwin-Clark said, is reassuring rather than limiting. It means new technology can be layered onto an existing foundation rather than replacing it.\n\nStill, his unit is heavily embracing drones, driven by lessons from Ukraine and direct Ukrainian input.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. It has also created a \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones using tech like 3D printing, a technology it adopted on Ukrainian advice. It now uses drones in its exercises and has created a drone obstacle course for soldiers to train on.\n\nThe British officer isn't alone in his thinking on the impact of drones on war and the infantry.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, director of the US Army's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course designed to help the service catch up on drone warfare, told Business Insider that \"yes, warfare, the tools of warfare are changing, but the fundamentals of warfare have not changed.\"\n\nDrones, she said, are \"just another tool with which to combat specific types of missions, but not necessarily all missions,\" and other weaponry that the US Army has had for much longer may still be able to accomplish missions better than drones can.\n\nShe said she wants soldiers to view drones \"as a tool with which to accomplish a mission, but it may not be the tool given a certain mission set.\"\n\nGen. James Rainey, the former head of Army Futures Command, said in 2024 that technology like drones was having a majorly disruptive effect on land warfare and was something the US needed to get ahead of, but he also said that war will \"always be a human endeavor.\"\n\nDrones may not dominate future Western wars as they do in Ukraine — where shortages forced heavy reliance on them — but NATO militaries are still investing in drones and training to ensure they're ready to use them where they make sense.\n\nEven though he doesn't see much of infantry life changing, Irwin-Clark still described drones as being part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nHe said that what surprised him most was how quickly his battalion's members picked up the technology.\n\n\"Everything else that you learned in the army is a sort of quite laborious process of fixed lessons, right?\" he said. He said that things are done by the book, because those styles of warfare have been around for so long that \"there is literally a book.\"\n\nAfter 20 years in the army, he was used to a more formulaic approach to training. But with drone warfare, \"you can't do that because the text's changing all the time and the types of drones are changing all the time.\" He was fearful as a result that it would take quite a while for the battalion to get it. Instead, he was \"pretty blown away\" by how quickly soldiers were confidently flying using drones.\n\nHe said that the men and women in the battalion \"are incredible and can pick that up really quickly. They're really adaptable, and they are really tech savvy.\"",

    "fullText": "Hamburger chains dominated the fast-food sector in the 1980s and '90s after the \"burger wars\" launched among McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.\n\nThe burger wars transitioned into an original chicken sandwich war, also in the 1980s, among the same three rivals. It was revived in the new millennium with Popeyes' launch of its chicken sandwich in August 2019.\n\nRival Chick-fil-A countered Popeyes' new sandwich with a statement on Twitter that its sandwich was the original, introduced in 1964, and fast-food chains everywhere began introducing or reintroducing chicken sandwiches.\n\nWith all of these chicken sandwiches launching, fried chicken restaurants became the most popular concept in fast food.\n\nFried chicken dining chains are likely to remain the most popular subsector of the fast-food industry in 2026, if the concept continues the trend it set over the last year.\n\nTraffic to chicken concepts rose 3% in the year ending September 2025, while all concepts dropped 1% compared to the previous year, according to market research firm Circana, as reported by Fast Company.\n\nThe variety of chicken options offered, such as chicken pieces, chicken fingers, or chicken sandwiches, and how consumers enjoy their choices, may contribute to the continued popularity of the concept, an expert says.\n\n“This is due to the experiences the brands are creating as well as the variety of chicken and how you can enjoy it,” industry expert Reilly Newman of Motif Brands told The Food Institute. “This comes to no surprise, as the experience economy has been taking root across the globe.\n\n“Chicken allows for (ample) customization, sauces, and forms, depending on the buyer’s preferences,” Newman said.\n\nNot every fast-food chicken restaurant benefited from increased traffic in 2025, as some operators suffered financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy filings.\n\nA bankrupt operator of more than 130 Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen franchise restaurants has closed 17 underperforming locations in Florida and Georgia and filed a motion to reject all of the stores' leases.\n\nThe franchisee, Sailormen Inc., which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami to reject the leases after closing eight locations on Jan. 19, five locations on Jan. 20, and four locations on Jan. 22, according to court papers.\n\nThe debtor asserts that the leases should be rejected as of the petition date, since the restaurants were closed within one week of the petition date and before the hearing on the debtor's first-day motions.",

    "title": "Russia's Oil Revenue, the Lifeblood of Its War Machine, Is Plummeting",
    "description": "The new reality has forced the Kremlin to raise taxes and increase debt, and hovers over peace talks with Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "As Russia holds direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, the Kremlin’s most potent fuel for the war, oil revenue, is under mounting strain.\n\nThe price of Russian oil, the country’s primary export, has declined under the weight of surging global supplies and Western sanctions related to the war. Last year, Russia’s oil and gas revenue fell by almost a quarter, according to the Finance Ministry. The Kremlin is resorting to tax increases and deficit spending to bridge the gap.\n\nSo far, there is little sign that the economic strains, and any discontent they generate among business leaders and the public, will be enough to change President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculations on the war. Trilateral negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States are set to continue on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut with the economy stagnating and the Kremlin reaching the limit of what it can squeeze from it, the Russian people will have to bear more of the burden of a war whose costs exceed about $170 billion a year.\n\n“This situation is manageable,” said Yevgeny Nadorshin, an economist in Moscow who advises companies and banks. “But no one is comfortable with that.”\n\nThroughout his decades-long rule, Mr. Putin has taken pride in the stability he has brought to a Russian economy that was in free fall after the demise of the Soviet Union — slashing debt, streamlining taxes and taming inflation.\n\nA strong oil economy allowed the Russian state to deliver an improved standard of living. That, the Kremlin hoped, would keep the public content even as the government eroded personal freedoms.\n\nNow, the carefully cultivated economic stability is fracturing. The steep drop in oil revenue has sent Russia into a new era defined by sustained budget deficits, higher taxes and stubborn inflation.\n\nRussia’s oil trade has been battered by two forces. Oil prices have declined since April, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to gradually increase production after years of cuts. The Russian oil industry has also been hit in recent months by new Western sanctions and the heavier enforcement of existing ones.\n\nIn October, President Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft, which is state-owned, and Lukoil, which is private. Those penalties significantly undercut the companies’ ability to sell crude. Since then, Russia has also faced stepped-up enforcement of restrictions against the illicit “shadow fleet” of tankers it uses to ship oil.\n\nThis month, the U.S. military seized a Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic that had been used to carry Venezuelan oil. The French Navy also intercepted a tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of using a false flag and belonging to a Russia-linked fleet.\n\nBecause of the current global oversupply, buyers now have more alternatives to Russian crude. This allows them to either walk away entirely or demand significantly higher discounts to compensate for the risk of handling goods hit with sanctions, said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“Had it not been for this noticeable decrease in oil prices,” he said, “all these measures would have been far less effective.”\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil have grown drastically. The economy ministry said this month that the average price of Russian oil was $39 per barrel in December, down from more than $57 in August.\n\nAdding to Moscow’s problems, Ukraine has been using drones since November to strike Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Ukrainian military has also been attacking Russian refineries. That has contributed to fuel crises in several regions, forcing the government to temporarily ban the export of oil products.\n\n“The only factor that can change the situation is economic pressure on Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday. “Russia must run out of money for the war to start coming to an end.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Putin has dealt with a drop in oil prices. But in previous years, the Russian state had more options. It could cut expenditures or allow the currency to weaken to replenish the budget. But the costs of the war, which amount to about 30 percent of Russia’s $580 billion annual budget, make it hard to reduce expenses. And the currency, the ruble, has remained strong.\n\nPropped up by restrictions on imports and high interest rates, the ruble surged by about 45 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2025. A strong ruble means that the government receives less money for each barrel of crude that is sold.\n\nWith options dwindling, the Kremlin had little choice but to increase state debt as well as personal and corporate taxes. The Russian government also increased taxes on smaller enterprises like bakeries and shops, causing a rare uproar among owners.\n\nRussia’s budget deficit reached $72 billion in 2025, nominally the highest since 2009. Mr. Nadorshin, the economist, said he expected it to increase further this year.\n\n“The situation is becoming more complicated,” he said, “and it’s clear that the pace of this complication is, naturally, worrying.”",

    "fullText": "Paul Krugman warns that Trump's trade policies are a threat to the US economy.\n\nTrump's tactics are leading to strained relations with trade partners, Krugman says.\n\nHe predicts a \"divorce\" between the US and major trading partners.\n\nPaul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "description": "Find out more about King Charles' reaction to Prince Harry calling out Donald Trump following his claims about NATO allies on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump recently made claims that British soldiers stayed “off the front lines” during the war in Afghanistan, and his comments struck a chord, especially with Prince Harry, who served for over a decade in the British Army. The 41-year-old didn’t waste any time calling out the United States president, but his father, King Charles, reportedly wishes his son reacted differently. Keep reading \n\nAccording to Royal reporter Rob Shuter, Harry's very public reaction to Donald Trump's claims has put King Charles in a \"deeply uncomfortable\" position, especially ahead of King Charles and Queen Camilla's upcoming trip to the United States. Shuter reported that Charles \"understands the emotion, but he's horrified by the timing.\"\n\n\"This is diplomacy—not podcast politics,\" an insider told Shuter. \"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier. The King can't clap back—even if he agrees.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Donald Trump questioned if the NATO allies would \"be there\" if the United States \"ever needed them.\"\n\n\"I've always said, 'Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?\" he questioned.\n\n\"We've never needed them,\" he continued. \"We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nThese claims from Donald Trump angered many members of the NATO alliance, including England. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's claims \"insulting and frankly appalling,\" and even Prince Harry had more than a few words to say about it.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Prince Harry released a statement on the topic. \"In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first—and only—time in history,\" he said, referencing the mutual defense clause that was activated following the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call.\"\n\n\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" he continued. \"The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.\"\n\n\"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,\" he finished. Prince Harry has long since been a supporter and defender of British veterans, having founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international, Paralympic-style event for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel and veterans.",

    "description": "Economist Paul Krugman criticized Trump's trade tactics, highlighting risks of economic isolation as trade partners gravitate more toward the EU.",
    "fullText": "Paul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "title": "Darren Aronofsky's New AI Series About the Revolutionary War Looks Like Dogshit",
    "description": "\"Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he'd just employ Jared Leto.\"",
    "fullText": "Darren Aronofsky used to be a director who made interesting, if sometimes polarizing, films like Black Swan, Mother!, Noah, and The Wrestler. But it seems like a safe bet that people won’t need to debate whether Aronofsky’s new project is any good. Because anyone with eyes can see that it looks like low-effort AI slop. To put it another way, it looks like absolute dogshit.\n\nAronofsky is producing a new short-form series with his AI production company Primordial Soup titled “On This Day… 1776,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. The series uses tech from Google DeepMind to create short videos about the Revolutionary War, published on the YouTube channel for Time magazine. In 2018, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time, and the cloud software giant is sponsoring this monstrosity of a series.\n\nThe series uses human voice actors who belong to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is clearly an attempt to tamp down on the inevitable backlash from both inside and outside Hollywood. Folks inside the movie and TV industry have fiercely pushed back against the use of AI to replace the skilled artists and actors who create the media we watch. That concern obviously comes from a place of self-interest because nobody wants to be pushed out of a job. But they also care about the quality of the work being produced. And there’s also been a revolt among the average consumer, people who’ve been inundated with the lowest-grade AI garbage imaginable. It’s really everywhere now.\n\nThe first episode, titled “The Flag,” is three-and-a-half minutes long and attempts to tell the story of George Washington raising the Continental Union Flag in Somerville, Massachusetts. It offers nothing compelling in the way of narrative. It’s the kind of thing that you’d skip over as a cut-scene in a particularly bad video game.\n\nEverything has a dead and creepy quality, as the actors’ audio is poorly synced with the lips of the AI concoctions.\n\nHave you ever seen a Spaghetti Western from the 1960s where the audio just doesn’t seem to match, even though it was clearly shot with actors speaking English, and the “dub” is in English? That happened because the audio was added in post-production, a result of direct sound recording being expensive in Italy during the post-war era. You get the same effect here, though there’s no good reason. Well, no good reason outside of presumably saving a ton of money on hiring human actors.\n\nThe second episode, titled “Common Sense,” tries to tell the story of Thomas Paine writing Common Sense. Benjamin Franklin makes an appearance, though it proves that the most recognizable of the founding fathers in this series are the weirdest to look at.\n\nThe episode jumps around incoherently, much like the first episode, without grounding the viewer in anything we should care about. It’s truly an ugly mess. And if you bother to pause the scenes, you can spot the kind of telltale anomalies that plague other AI-generated video projects, like strangely deformed hands in the background characters. Hands are always giving this stuff away.\n\nThen there are the words that appear on screen in the trailer, like the pamphlet that’s supposed to include the word “America” but instead reads something closer to “Λamereedd.”\n\nHappy to see that there is no need to worry about the historical accuracy of new 1776 AI slop because it happens in the mystical land of Λamereedd.\n\n— Mateusz Fafinski (@calthalas.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 1:33 PM\n\nThe series is specifically made for this sestercentennial year of America’s founding, and each episode will reportedly drop on the 250th anniversary of the day it happened, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And that’s certainly a fun concept if the final product were something worth watching. But it’s not. It’s garbage. The people who are making and distributing it obviously don’t think so.\n\n“This project is a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like — not replacing craft, but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before,” Ben Bitonti, president of Time Studios, told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe reaction on social media hasn’t been so kind. “I know my expectations were low but holy fuck Darren Aronofsky producing AI slop wasn’t on my bingo card,” one X user wrote. Over on Bluesky another joked, “Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he’d just employ Jared Leto.”\n\nAnd other users have been picking apart all the anomalies, with one Bluesky critic writing: “Love the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat.”\n\nLove the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat\n Masterful artsistic choice\n\n— Matt Baume 🏳️‍🌈 (@mattbaume.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 10:35 AM\n\n“Nothing represents The End of America after a 250-year run quite like using AI slop to depict the creation of the Declaration of Independence,” another user quipped.\n\nThe videos have been up at Time’s YouTube channel for over 7 hours as of the time of this writing, but they’re not gaining much attention in their original format. The first episode has just 5,000 views. The second episode has a little over 2,000. Social media posts ridiculing the production seem to be faring better, simply because people are making fun of them. One video on Bluesky has over 2,500 quote posts, with almost all seemingly making jokes about how awful it looks.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Ken Burns for comment, but didn’t immediately receive a reply.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "title": "Ukrainian drone schools say there's little the West can teach them about fighting a drone war",
    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are closely following the fast-developing drone battle and say their expertise only comes from Ukrainians, not Western allies.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian drone schools say that Western militaries have little to offer them when it comes to training drone operators to fight Russia. Western armies know war, tactics, and combat power, but Ukraine has significant experience in novel elements of modern drone warfare learned over years of hard fighting.\n\nDrones of all kinds are used \n\nWhile drones are not new to Western militaries, they have never been used or adapted at this scale or speed. Facing an existential adapt-or-die situation, Ukraine is writing its own lessons.\n\nUkraine has a host of drone schools that have designed curricula to make the country's operators as effective as possible. And officials at three of them told Business Insider that their lessons are only informed by Ukrainian experiences.\n\n\"As of today, we do not receive any particularly useful information from our allies regarding the use of drones,\" other than training on any equipment that allies provide, one said.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that said 100% of his school's teachings come from feedback or information from soldiers who are in the field.\n\nOne example he gave was in stopping enemy drones: \"All experience in striking down drones is based only on the experience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.\"\n\nHe said there isn't time for theoretical tactics that may not work when needed most. \"We are in a situation where we need to respond quickly to new drones and the tactics of their use by the enemy,\" he said. \"Accordingly, techniques are being tested in practice, and only those techniques that really work are being retained.\"\n\nAnother drone school, Dronarium, said the school's training \"is based on existing combat experience, which changes very rapidly.\"\n\nBecause of that pace, instructors said Ukraine is often better positioned to share lessons than to receive them. \"In this sense, at the moment it is rather us who can share valuable information with them, rather than our foreign partners sharing it with us,\" Anastasia Sobova, Dronarium Academy's chief business development officer, told BI.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have been receiving Western training throughout the war, with mixed feedback. Some has been well received, while other elements have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of fighting Ukraine faces now.\n\nUkraine's troops say combat tactics can become out of date in a matter of only weeks; the drone war is no different.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of DroneShield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that the speed of battlefield changes has shifted weapon development cycles from months and years to weeks.\n\nThings change so fast on the battlefield that the schools need to frequently rewrite their lessons, sometimes as fast as every other week.\n\nThese drone schools stay on top of changes by sending their instructors to the front, maintaining constant contact with program graduates and other soldiers who send updates from the battlefield, and testing new technology.\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that his school's graduates exchange messages with the school to share new information about what's happening on the battlefield or get advice from teachers.\n\n\"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\" The information they get from those on the front line goes into the teaching for the next groups.\n\nPervak said in his school, \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge. Some instructors occasionally visit combat units of the UAV to see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nMany Western militaries, including the US, acknowledge they are behind on drone warfare and that their tactics need updating. It is an area where Ukraine is helping partner nations that have assisted it in its defense.\n\nWestern and NATO militaries are closely watching the war, concerned that Russia could threaten Europe and that drones would play a major role in any wider conflict. That worry has intensified efforts to learn from Ukraine's experience, particularly in drone operations and counter-drone tactics. The Ukrainians are attempting to meet that demand for expertise.\n\nUkraine agreed to help Poland with drone warfare training and has helped train Norway's drone operators.\n\nUkrainian military specialists traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises. Copenhagen said in April it intended to send unarmed soldiers to Ukraine for drone warfare training, though it is unclear if that has taken place.\n\nThe UK says Ukraine has influenced its drone doctrine as well. Britain leads an international effort to train Ukrainian troops, known as Operation Interflex, and those Ukrainian soldiers often arrive with more real-world drone experience than their trainers.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards, told Business Insider that one surprise from the training was \"how much we would learn.\" His unit now trains in drone warfare and 3D printing drone parts based on Ukrainian lessons.\n\nPervak described sharing expertise as a way to repay allies for their support. \"Not forgetting the fact that we are truly grateful for the remarkable support from our allies, it is time now to share our latest battlefield experience.\"\n\nDrones might not dominate a NATO war against Russia to the same extent they do in Ukraine — in part because Western militaries possess capabilities Ukraine lacks — but they are no longer viewed as a niche tool. Ukraine's experience has led to a realization that this tech may very well be the future of warfare.",

In that situation, ​there may be cases where we take joint action.\n\n\"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, ‌come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nJAPAN'S CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS DIRECT MILITARY ACTION\n\nWith an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the ⁠remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with ​Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of ​her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to \"earnestly reflect and correct its mistakes, and to stop its manipulation and reckless actions on ‍the Taiwan issue.\"\n\nJapan's pacifist constitution ⁠prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces ⁠a \"threat to its survival.\"\n\nTakaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election ‌on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - American composer Philip Glass withdrew the world premiere of his symphony \"Lincoln\" from the Kennedy Center on Monday, ​saying the work's values conflict with those of the performing ‌arts venue that was taken over by President Donald Trump.\n\nGlass is the latest musical luminary ‌to withdraw from the Kennedy Center since Trump named himself chairman and filled its board with his allies last year. The Washington National Opera said earlier this month it planned to leave its home of 50 years.\n\n\"After thoughtful ⁠consideration, I have decided to ‌withdraw my Symphony No. 15 'Lincoln' from the John F.

Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, or Trump Kennedy Center for short.\n\nSince then, many groups and artists have withdrawn from scheduled performances, citing ⁠the Republican leader's takeover.\n\nDemocrats, noting that the ​center's name was established by Congress, have ​said Trump's rebranding has no force of law. John F. Kennedy's family denounced the renaming move as undermining the slain president's ‍legacy.\n\nGlass' Symphony No. ⁠15 \"Lincoln\" was commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra and the Kennedy Center, the Washington Post reported.\n\nIts premiere, already delayed, was due to ⁠be the centerpiece of the center's \"250 Years of Us\" program to mark 250 years since the ‌signing of the Declaration of Independence, the newspaper said.",

    "fullText": "For average wage earners in Russia, it's a big payday. For criminals seeking to escape the harsh conditions and abuse in prison, it's a chance at freedom. For immigrants hoping for a better life, it's a simplified path to citizenship.\n\nAll they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.\n\nAs Russia seeks to replenish its forces in nearly four years of war — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it's pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.\n\nSome come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia defend its Kursk region from a Ukrainian incursion.\n\nMen from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.\n\nStill hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.\n\nIndependent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.\n\nWhen a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.\n\nSince then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.\n\nThe flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.\n\nActivists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.\n\nThe government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.\n\nThere also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.\n\nDespite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.\n\nRecruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.\n\nForeigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.\n\nLaws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.\n\nIn November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.\n\nSome reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia.\n\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.\n\nAlso in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some \"grievously injured,” the agency said.\n\nWhen Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.\n\nIraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.\n\nForeigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.\n\nThis month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.\n\nIf true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUsing foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.\n\nBut recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.",

(AP) — As a deadly storm that brought crippling ice to the South and deep snow to the Northeast finally began to swirl out to sea Monday, it represented light at the end of the tunnel for some.\n\nBut thousands of Americans were still without power or heat, and temperatures were forecast to plunge well below freezing by early Tuesday in areas where the ice storm did its worst damage.\n\nMore than 800,000 power outages were reported nationwide Monday morning, with more than 150,000 of them in the Nashville, Tennessee, area, according to poweroutage.com.

    "fullText": "MAGA podcaster Tim Pool has called out President Donald Trump in the fallout of the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by Department of Homeland Security federal officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in less than three weeks.\n\nThe Culture War podcast host and longtime Trump suck-up has questioned the Trump administration’s narrative surrounding the killing of ICU nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, arguing that Trump is “weak” in the face of the ensuing chaos that is gripping the Twin Cities.\n\n“Empty hand, then gun in hand,” Pool wrote, commenting on slowed footage in the seconds surrounding Pretti’s shooting. “Appears the man may have been disarmed before being shot.”\n\n“This is a chain of events in a greater conflict. Neither side cares at this point what justifies it or doesn’t.\n\n“I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool concluded.\n\nPool, 39, heads his own independent media group, Timcast, and has some 2.5 million followers on X. His podcast covers right-wing talking points and conspiracy theories, and has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nDHS has said that the agents involved in the shooting acted in self-defence after the “armed suspect violently resisted.”\n\n“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” the department wrote in an official statement.\n\n“The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\"\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference that she agrees with the White House’s statement that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.”\n\n“This individual... committed an act of domestic terrorism. That’s the facts,” Noem argued.\n\nSimilar statements have been made by Trump’s closest political allies—including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who branded Pretti an “assassin”—as the administration closes ranks to unify on its messaging.\n\nPool appears not to be buying any of it, although he has not entirely flipped sides. In a separate tweet, the commentator argued that those impeding the work of “federal agents dispatched by a duly elected government” are “fascists.”\n\n“Trump should personally go to Minneapolis and force the whole thing to shut down, no more fighting, no more partisan conflict,” Pool argued.\n\n“Trump isn’t Lincoln, he’s Buchanan.”\n\nPresident James Buchanan is frequently cited as the worst leader in U.S. history. The 15th president, serving from 1857 to 1861, failed to stop the country from tearing itself apart, leading to the Civil War.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also spurned the official White House narrative surrounding the events in his state’s capital, branding them “nonsense” and “lies.”\n\nPretti’s own parents have said that the Trump administration is spreading “sickening lies” about their deceased son that are “reprehensible and disgusting.”\n\nVideo analysis from news networks, including CNN and Bellingcat, has concluded that federal officers took the gun from the licensed firearm holder Pretti before shooting him at least 10 times while he was on the ground.\n\nProtests have engulfed Minnesota since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mother of three, Renee Good, who was also killed by federal agents, not far from where today’s shooting took place.\n\nThe National Guard of Minnesota has been activated in Minneapolis as authorities work to ensure the ongoing protests remain peaceful.",
