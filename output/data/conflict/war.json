Revealed during this past summer and showcased heavily at Gamescom, the expansion signals a dramatic escalation in the war between Light and Void.\nSet in a fully rebuilt and reimagined Quel'Thalas, Midnight centers on a massive Void invasion led by Xal'atath, whose manipulations during The War Within left Azeroth vulnerable to the voidlord Dimensius. The Void now seeks to claim the Sunwell--a source of potent magical energy--and plunge the world into terror.",
