    "description": "Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.  “Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S.",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.\n\n“Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.\n\n“There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement, but the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives, though Trump was less effusive the following day, saying, “The talks are going along.”\n\n“We are talking. It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Soldiers in Ukraine say that grenades are key for close-quarters trench fighting, and Western forces are paying attention.",
    "fullText": "Grenades — a standard but often unglamorous part of modern infantry combat — have become indispensable in Ukraine's close-quarters and grueling fight against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe war blends advanced technologies like drones and electronic warfare with grinding, World War I-style fighting, where soldiers sometimes battle at arm's length in muddy trenches and bunkers. In those confined spaces, Ukrainian and Russian troops alike rely heavily on grenades.\n\nWestern officials and war veterans in Ukraine told Business Insider about the important role they play in Ukraine's trench warfare. Their use has also evolved, with grenades increasingly getting tactical upgrades, including adaptations for drone drops and components made with 3D printing.\n\nThe experience has highlighted a lesson for Western militaries less accustomed to modern trench fighting, the kind of combat that drives enormous demand for basic infantry munitions like grenades.\n\nUkraine's battlefield is littered with trenches unlike anything the West has seen for decades, with soldiers needing hides and defenses from the attack and surveillance drones that fly overhead, and the brutal fighting involves defending and taking these earthworks from the enemy.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and spoke with Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said that \"when you go through these trenches, hand grenades are your best fucking friends.\"\n\nHe said the fights are so close-quarters that in some engagements with the Russians, \"you could literally touch them with the muzzle of your rifle at times.\"\n\nTrenches are messy, uneven, and difficult to capture. \"You're basically trying to take the home of another individual who's lived there for days, weeks, months at this point,\" the vet said. \"So they know every nook and cranny; they know every turn.\"\n\nA British man who fought for Ukraine previously told Business Insider that he carried grenades for both assault and reconnaissance missions and described the US and UK-made grenades as \"prized\" among Ukrainians.\n\nLt. Col. Davidson, a leader in the UK-led training program for Ukrainian soldiers called Operation Interflex, told Business Insider last year on the condition that only his rank and last name be used that \"Ukrainians have got a heavy use of grenades.\" That usage was worked into the training in response.\n\nThere is a wide range of grenades in use in battle, everything from fragmentation and explosive to flashbang and chemical.\n\nA Ukrainian officer recently told Business Insider that smoke grenades can help to create poor visibility so injured soldiers can be evacuated, though it can also risk drawing unwanted Russian attention.\n\nCombat video footage shared by Ukrainian units often shows grenades in action, including footage of US volunteers using them in an assault on a Russian trench.\n\nUkraine's grenades come from multiple sources, from old Soviet-era stocks to those of partner nations.\n\nA January 2025 Department of Defense update said the US had provided \"more than 50,000 grenade launchers and small arms\" and \"more than 500,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and grenades\" to Ukraine. And the US isn't the only supplier. The volume supplied reflects how central these weapons are to front-line combat. Ukraine also makes its own grenades.\n\nIt's not alone, though. Russia is also heavily using these weapons, including in the booby traps it sets up in trenches and urban environments.\n\nUkraine feels it when it has shortages of grenades. Another US veteran told Business Insider on the condition of anonymity last year that, with US aid stalled and Ukraine suffering weaponry shortages, he was often told to be \"careful practicing with grenades\" so as not to waste too many.\n\nAnd when it was time to swap positions, troops taking over would ask those departing to leave any remaining grenades and ammunition.\n\n\"That's how desperate that situation got to where it's like guys were literally getting ammo and grenades off of dudes leaving the area so that they could keep fighting.\"\n\nGrenades have long been a staple of infantry combat, including in the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Ukraine's conflict has pushed their use to levels more typical of large-scale, attritional warfare, where trench systems stretch for miles and fighting drags on for months and years.\n\nWestern militaries did not anticipate the return of large-scale trench warfare, and in Ukraine that fighting has pushed grenades to the center of daily front-line combat.\n\nLong a standard tool in close-quarters fighting, they have become especially prominent amid widespread trenches, ammunition shortages, and evolving tactics.\n\nWhile they're being used in close-quarters combat, grenades are also being dropped from drones in battles all along the front lines, hitting soldiers, bunkers, hideouts, and even vehicles.\n\nVery recent footage from Novopavlivka front, drone dropping grenade RIGHT INTO RUSSIAN TANK HATCH.\n\nIt falls right into the hatch, destroying the tank from the inside.\n\nHonestly, tanks were so rare this year at the battlefield, and this is just BEAUTIFUL to watch. pic.twitter.com/Ns4NKBH2Qp\n\nA US Army Colonel said doing this has \"proved dramatically effective\" for Ukraine. The Army first tested dropping a live grenade from a drone this year. It's catching up.\n\nUkrainian units and engineers are also 3D-printing parts to make old grenades work better with drones while printing plastic casings to fill with explosives to make custom grenades.\n\nWorried about Russia sparking a wider war with Europe, much of the West is watching to see what lessons it can learn from Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Maguire, a British military officer who led part of the Operation Interflex training and helped document lessons from Ukraine, told Business Insider that the scale and importance of grenade use in trench fighting have stood out. He spoke on the condition that only his rank and last name be used.\n\n\"There's a massive demand for grenades,\" he said.\n\nThe West is looking at trench warfare more, too, and rethinking how messy and dangerous trenches can be and the weapons needed for a fight.\n\nUkraine's war has shown that even on a high-tech battlefield, sustained close combat in trenches still depends on basic infantry weapons and on having enough of them.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "World War II Navy veteran Ira “Ike” Schab, one of the dwindling number of survivors of the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 105.\n\nDaughter Kimberlee Heinrichs told The Associated Press that Schab died at home early Saturday in the presence of her and her husband.\n\nWith his passing, there remain only about a dozen survivors of the surprise attack, which killed just over 2,400 troops and propelled the United States into the war.\n\nSchab was a sailor of just 21 at the time of the attack, and for decades he rarely spoke about the experience.\n\nBut in recent years, aware that the corps of survivors was dwindling, the centenarian made a point of traveling from his home in Beaverton, Oregon, to the annual observance at the Hawaii military base.\n\n“To pay honor to the guys that didn’t make it,” he said in 2023.\n\nFor last year's commemoration, Schab spent weeks building up the strength to be able to stand and salute.\n\nBut this year he did not feel well enough to attend, and less than three weeks later, he passed away.\n\nBorn on Independence Day in 1920 in Chicago, Schab was the eldest of three brothers.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 18, following in the footsteps of his father, he said in a February interview for Pacific Historic Parks.\n\nOn what began as a peaceful Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, Schab, who played the tuba in the USS Dobbin’s band, was expecting a visit from his brother, a fellow service member assigned to a nearby naval radio station. Schab had just showered and donned a clean uniform when he heard a call for fire rescue.\n\nHe went topside and saw another ship, the USS Utah, capsizing. Japanese planes roared through the air.\n\n“We were pretty startled. Startled and scared to death,” Schab recalled in 2023. “We didn’t know what to expect, and we knew that if anything happened to us, that would be it.”\n\nHe scurried back below deck to grab boxes of ammunition and joined a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun above.\n\nHis ship lost three sailors, according to Navy records. One was killed in action, and two died later of fragment wounds from a bomb that struck the stern. All had been manning an anti-aircraft gun.\n\nSchab spent most of the war with the Navy in the Pacific, going to the New Hebrides, now known as Vanuatu, and then the Mariana Islands and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nAfter the war he studied aerospace engineering and worked on the Apollo spaceflight program as an electrical engineer for General Dynamics, helping send astronauts to the moon.\n\nSchab's son also joined the Navy and is a retired commander.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 ceremony, Schab asked people to honor those who served at Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Remember what they’re here for. Remember and honor those that are left. They did a hell of a job,” he said. “Those who are still here, dead or alive.”",

    "description": "Luigi Mangione’s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi’s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer’s parent company.  Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department’s charge to turn Mangione’s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a “profound conflict of interest” that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Luigi Mangione’s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi’s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer’s parent company.\n\nBondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department’s charge to turn Mangione’s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a “profound conflict of interest” that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.\n\nThey argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard — and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group — through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.\n\nThe “very person” empowered to seek Mangione’s death \"has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,” his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest “should have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,” they added.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.\n\nBondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”\n\nThompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group’s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.\n\nFriday’s filing put the focus back on Mangione’s federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.\n\nMangione’s defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi’s past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.\n\nIn a September court filing, Mangione’s lawyers argued that Bondi’s announcement that she was ordering prosecutors to seek the death penalty — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.\n\nBondi’s statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration’s flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione’s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said.\n\nIn a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that “pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.”\n\nRather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense’s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione’s rights are respected at trial.\n\n“What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments” rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. “None warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.”\n\nMangione’s lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi’s ties to Ballard and the firm’s relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi’s compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from “all individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.\"",

    "fullText": "Callum Simpson said Troy Williamson \"will have a war if he wants it\" as both fighters made weight before Saturday's British, European and Commonwealth super-middleweight showdown in Leeds.\n\nSimpson, 29, tipped the scales at 11st 13lb 11oz (75.9kg) while Williamson came in slightly lighter at 11st 13lb 6oz (75.8kg).\n\nSimpson, undefeated after 18 fights, is putting his super-middleweight titles on the line at the First Direct Arena against Williamson, who has 21 wins, four losses and one draw on his record.\n\n\"[Williamson] can have it any way he wants,\" said Simpson, who turned professional in 2019.\n\n\"He's been wearing a hat all week saying 'war' on it. If he wants a war, we will have a war. Whatever he wants, he can get it.\n\n\"But I am going to be winning no matter what. I'm not coming just to defend but to dominate. I want to show that I'm above this level.\"\n\nSimpson climbed off the canvas twice to secure a stunning stoppage win over Ivan Zucco in his hometown of Barnsley in June.\n\nAsked what he saw in Simpson's eyes when they faced off, Darlington fighter Williamson said: \"Just a guy that's in my way that I need to take care of.\"\n\nSimpson is expected to bring a large following across Yorkshire from Barnsley for the fight, but Williamson said he is unfazed by the support for his opponent.\n\n\"The fans can't win the fight,\" the 34-year-old added.\n\n\"They can make as much noise as they want. But it's only me, him and the referee in the ring. That's all that matters.\"\n\nSaturday's card will be broadcast live on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer.",

    "description": "China warns that a massive $11.1 billion U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan could spark war, calling the island a \"powder keg\" amid rising tensions.",
    "fullText": "China denounced the United States for approving an $11.1 billion weapons package for Taiwan, warning that the deal risks turning the island into a \"powder keg\" and driving the region toward \"military confrontation and war.\"\n\nThe unprecedented sale includes 82 HIMARS launchers paired with 420 ATACMS long-range missiles, a combination that would give Taiwan new deep-strike capability across the Taiwan Strait, along with 60 self-propelled howitzers, advanced UAV systems, military software packages and anti-armor weapons.\n\nBeijing accused Taiwan’s leadership of \"seeking independence through force\" and claimed Washington is using the island to \"contain China,\" rhetoric that signals heightened tensions even as the U.S. frames the package as essential to bolstering Taiwan’s self-defense.\n\n\"The ‘Taiwan independence’ forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.\n\nChina’s Missile Surge Puts Every Us Base In The Pacific At Risk — And The Window To Respond Is Closing\n\n\"This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence’ but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed.\"\n\nU.S. officials have not yet detailed delivery timelines, but the sale reflects Washington’s push to accelerate Taiwan’s defenses amid growing concern over China’s military pressure campaign. The HIMARS and ATACMS combination is expected to draw particular attention from Beijing because it would allow Taiwan to target PLA staging areas, ships and infrastructure from mobile launchers, a capability China has repeatedly warned against.\n\nIn its notification to Congress, the State Department said the proposed sales would advance \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\nThe department added that the weapons would \"help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region.\"\n\nUnder longstanding U.S. policy, Washington provides Taiwan with arms it deems necessary for the island’s self-defense while maintaining a \"One China\" policy and not supporting a declaration of formal independence. China argues that any enhancement of Taiwan’s defenses encourages separatism, while U.S. officials say the purpose of such sales is to preserve stability and deter conflict.\n\nHigh Stakes On The High Seas As Us, China Test Limits Of Military Power\n\nThe package now enters a 30-day congressional review period, during which lawmakers could file a resolution attempting to block it, a step Congress has never taken for an arms sale to Taiwan. Once the review period ends, contracting and production begin, a process that typically stretches over several years and contributes to a backlog that once reached $20 billion in undelivered U.S. weapons Taiwan has already purchased.\n\nChina has a track record of responding to major Taiwan arms sales with military demonstrations, including large-scale PLA drills, increased air and naval activity near the island and sanctions on U.S. defense firms. Analysts say Beijing’s sharp rhetoric suggests additional military signaling is likely, though China did not immediately announce specific countermeasures.\n\nThe latest sale marks a significant boost to Taiwan’s conventional firepower. In recent months, Beijing has stepped up pressure across the strait with near-daily PLA air and naval patrols, record incursions around the island and high-profile exercises meant to signal its ability to encircle Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung thanked the U.S. Wednesday for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key to deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Comment: After the year of his life, the award should go to Rory McIlroy – though it does not make it a scandal if the public decides to crown someone else",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy will be feeling confident when he takes his seat in the audience at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award tonight. We will know that simply because of his presence in the room, and because it is an honour that still carries enough significance and prestige that you want to be there if there’s a good chance you’re going to win.\n\nOthers may disagree. McIlroy, in the past, has been among them. But then, for some, bashing the Sports Personality of the Year contest is as much of an annual ritual as the prize itself, an opportunity to take cheap shots at the BBC, among other things.\n\nMcIlroy has enjoyed an exceptional year, the stuff of dreams, spearheaded by two successes at the Masters and Ryder Cup so astonishing that they may as well have been scripted. There’s no argument against that.\n\nHe won the Masters but did so on an agonising final round that displayed his vulnerabilities and the strength to overcome them, the qualities that make him such an endearing, inspiring champion. Leading Europe to an away Ryder Cup victory, against that American crowd at Bethpage Black, further strengthens his credentials and claim to a season that stands above the rest.\n\nAnd with McIlroy, there is also the sense of if he isn’t crowned SPOTY this year, then when will he ever be? There may be an acknowledgement of legacy and past achievements now that he has completed golf’s career slam. Certainly, given Andy Murray won SPOTY three times and Lewis Hamilton has done so twice, few would argue that McIlroy would not belong in their company in terms of British sporting greats of the past 20 years.\n\nSo, sure, the Northern Irishman should probably win, but this is also a public vote, decided on the night, and the history of this award can tell us it is rarely that straightforward.\n\nAt which point, it is worth considering what may happen should McIlroy lose out, or, rather, what the reaction would be depending on who he could lose out to. The Daily Mail has already declared there would be a “stain” on SPOTY should McIlroy not win the award this year.\n\nWhy? Yes, McIlroy has the strongest case in terms of his achievements. Yes, his victory at Augusta and what Europe achieved at Bethpage Black stirred emotions and created unforgettable drama. But, increasingly, the biggest factor in SPOTY voting can be the divide between sport that is behind a paywall and sport that is open to the largest audience possible, and it is a line that McIlroy, through no fault of his own, falls on the wrong side of.\n\nIt is why Chloe Kelly or Hannah Hampton (unless they split the vote) may stand as the biggest threat to McIlroy after another major tournament victory for the Lionesses. It is why Ellie Kildunne is an excellent outside contender, and why her world champion Red Roses may beat both Europe’s Ryder Cup team and the Lionesses to team of the year.\n\nSport is ultimately at its best when it brings people together. Its power is greatest when it can uplift and inspire. Ultimately, the most-watched moment of 2025 was Hampton saving from Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey and Kelly thumping her penalty into the net as the Lionesses won the Euros again – becoming the first England football team to win a major tournament on foreign land. The victory that had within it the capacity to influence society was the Red Roses lifting the World Cup at a sold-out Twickenham, a dominant, jubilant team celebrating how it had broken down barriers while demonstrating that strength and athleticism come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nAn accusation often levelled at the BBC is that its diminished offering of live sport means it has lost other events that consistently conjured this magic, such as the Masters. But in turn, the decision to platform the Women’s Euros and Women’s Rugby World Cup has seen audiences, particularly female viewership, hit record numbers. The success of a Lionesses or Red Roses team can now become a national event in the same way as men’s football or men’s rugby. It’s almost as if making live sport accessible and these athletes visible, following decades of marginalisation and catering to the male audience, has brought in new fans and levels of interest across a broader range.\n\nThis should be celebrated. But then, this is the BBC. To some, even the all-female presenting line-up of tonight’s event, in Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and Alex Scott, is evidence of an organisation and SPOTY award that has gone overly woke and lost its shine. You can probably imagine, then, what the reaction would be should either Kelly or Hampton follow Beth Mead in 2022 and Mary Earps in 2023 and win, even if more than 16 million people watched the Lionesses’ latest tournament victory.\n\nHow the votes between Kelly and Hampton are split will be another factor as, for the first time, two members of the same team have been named on the final shortlist. Why both? It may be down to England’s bewildering summer of survival and Kelly’s rather curious role within it, the star who delivered on the biggest moments but yet did not start a match. Over the course, Hampton was integral to keeping the Lionesses alive, and the goalkeeper was unlucky not to win player of the Euro 2025 – she was certainly England’s.\n\nThe truth is that any of the six on the final shortlist would deserve to win. That includes the two individual world champions, one crowned at the start of the year and the other less than a fortnight ago, in Luke Littler and Lando Norris, both of whom are immensely popular as well. But, after the year of his life, it should be McIlroy. It does not, though, make it a scandal or bring a “stain” on the award if the public decides to crown someone else.",

    "title": "10 highlights from Russia's annual review of its war in Ukraine",
    "description": "Russia disclosed several new figures on Wednesday, including how much it's specifically spent on the war and how many soldiers it hired in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Russia's defense ministry broadcast its wide-ranging annual review on Wednesday of the Ukraine war, providing clues about its military goals and performance this year.\n\nAndrei Belousov, the Russian defense minister, presented the official statistics during the Defense Ministry Board's expanded meeting in Moscow.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the defense ministry's claims, which often differ significantly from those of international observers. Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, said at the meeting that the Kremlin's troops were \"crushing\" Ukraine, despite the war dragging on for nearly four years.\n\nThe disclosures also come as Russia has sought to project strength and demanded heavy concessions from Ukraine while negotiating potential peace terms with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, Belousov's presentation offers insight into Russia's ambitions for the war and its official narratives surrounding how it fights and plans to fight next year. Several new official figures were also announced.\n\nHere are 10 highlights from Belousov's end-of-year review.\n\nBelousov said that Russia's war spending is on track to reach about 5.1% of the country's GDP in 2025, out of an overall defense budget that reaches 7.3% of its annual GDP.\n\nThe country's nominal GDP in 2024 was about 201.2 trillion rubles, and is expected to grow 1% this year to about 203 trillion rubles, or $2.52 trillion.\n\nRussian independent media, however, reported that the economic ministry has forecast a GDP of about $2.7 trillion for the year.\n\nA war budget of 5.1% would therefore be somewhere between $128 billion and $137.7 billion.\n\nThis is the first time Russia has publicly disclosed the amount that it spends specifically on the war. Previously, the Kremlin only announced figures for total defense spending.\n\nThe US, by comparison, is planning to spend $901 billion on its military, or about 3.4% of its GDP.\n\nBelousov said that his ministry delivered roughly 38,000 motorcycles, buggies, and all-terrain vehicles to its troops on the front lines in 2025.\n\n\"This is 10 times more than last year,\" he said, adding that Russia plans to reach \"full strength\" in these vehicles next year.\n\nRussian troops have increasingly been using motorcycles, quad bikes, and other small, unarmored vehicles to assault or approach Ukrainian positions, trying to use their speed and small size to avoid drone attacks.\n\nUkrainians have also adopted the tactic, with one regiment even establishing an official motorcycle attack company in May.\n\nBelousov said that Russia hired 409,611 new contract soldiers in 2025, down from 449,243 in 2024.\n\nHowever, that already exceeds the Kremlin's 403,000 person recruitment goal for the year.\n\n\"Nearly two-thirds of them were young men under 40,\" Belousov said of the new recruits. \"More than a third have higher or specialized secondary education.\"\n\nUkraine and Russia have both been hard-pressed to fill their ranks as Moscow pressures Kyiv's forces with a continuous grind of frontal infantry assaults.\n\nTo maintain its flow of troops, Russia often entices recruits with hefty sign-on bonuses or pardons for crimes committed in the country.\n\nBelousov said that about 50% of Ukrainian casualties from Russian attacks come from first-person-view drones, or FPV drones. These are the small quadcopters mounted with explosives that have become a hallmark of the war.\n\nIn the summer, Russia said that it was outproducing Ukraine on FPV drones, though Kyiv's officials have since said their country has caught back up.\n\nUkrainian leaders have said that 70% of all casualties inflicted during the war involved FPV drones.\n\nBelousov said that Russia plans to create a new drone formation called the Unmanned Systems Forces next year, which would train \"tens of thousands\" of people.\n\nRussia has already created an official drone unit called Rubicon, which was formed last August to prioritize fighting with FPV drones and has often been described as fielding its most elite pilots.\n\nNow, Moscow appears to be trying to make such warfare an official pillar of its fighting force.\n\nBelousov said the Kremlin needed to transition FPV drone attacks from individual tasks carried out by each unit to \"integrated joint operations\" among its forces.\n\nUkraine launched its own Unmanned Systems Forces last year, appointing the previous commander of the elite unit, Magyar Birds, as its leader.\n\nRoughly 27,400 Ukrainian long-range drones were intercepted this year over Russian territory, with the bulk appearing after the summer, Belousov said.\n\nBelousov said that Ukraine initially began sending about 1,000 drones a month into Russia, but that the monthly number began hitting 3,700 by May.\n\nThe defense minister claimed that Russia's interception rate \"averages 97%\" for the year.\n\nUkraine has typically used fixed-wing drones to attack deeper into Russia, targeting what it says are oil and gas facilities and military production sites.\n\nUkrainian kamikaze \"drones\" aka converted Ukrainian-produced Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat light aircraft.\n\nThese drones can reportedly deliver 300kg warheads at a range around 2000 - 3000 km.\n\nIt's believed that similar drones were recently used to hit a Shahed drone manufacturing… pic.twitter.com/8xw6BzoZvO\n\nNotably, Belousov mentioned that Russia has also been exploring FPV drones that can serve as high-speed interceptors, a technology that Ukraine has been refining to counter Moscow's Shahed waves.\n\nBelousov said that Russia received two Tu-160Ms, which are modernized, supersonic bombers that can deploy nuclear weapons or powerful stealth missiles.\n\nThat's a clue about the production rate of the bombers, which are part of a small fleet that forms a vital pillar of Russia's nuclear triad. Several of Russia's older bombers were reported severely damaged in Operation Spiderweb, an audacious Ukrainian drone attack in early June that targeted a fleet of about 41 warplanes.\n\nUkrainian sources claimed that several Tu-160s were also hit, although this was not confirmed by independent open-source intelligence at the time.\n\nRussia's military also appears to be modifying its organizational structure.\n\nBelousov said that the Kremlin had created five new divisions, 13 new brigades, and 30 new regiments in 2025. International think tanks estimate that Russian divisions can consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 troops, while regiments within typically have about 2,000 soldiers and are further split into battalions.\n\nBrigades, which typically exist as a separate formation, often have about 3,500 to 4,500 troops.\n\nBelousov said this new structure included a new division, called the Aerospace Forces, which has a regiment \"equipped with the unique S-500 antiaircraft missile system, capable of striking targets in near space.\"\n\nNext year, the Kremlin plans to add four more divisions, 14 brigades, and 39 new regiments, he added.\n\nSome of these figures encompass formations that Russia has transformed, so they aren't necessarily an indicator of how widely Russia is expanding its military organization structure. For example, Belousov said two marine brigades were turned into a single division.\n\nBelousov said that Russia had expanded its use of drones and all-terrain vehicles to deliver gear from a \"one-time operation\" in 2024 to carrying 12,000 tons of cargo this year to the front lines.\n\n\"By 2026, this figure must be at least doubled,\" he said.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have been developing uncrewed ground vehicles, or ground-based drones, that can be remotely operated to deliver supplies to the front line or even conduct assaults.\n\nThe emerging technology is especially useful for dangerous tasks that would otherwise have to be filled by a human soldier.\n\nSome military units have also reported using drones to deliver equipment by air, such as one Ukrainian commander who said his forces used drones to send an e-bike to a stranded soldier.\n\nBelousov's presentation made it clear that Russia has been conducting precision strikes against Ukraine's power facilities.\n\nMore than 70% of Ukraine's thermal power plants and 37% of its hydroelectric plants have been disabled, Belousov said.\n\n\"The effectiveness of Russian precision strikes is about 60%, which is an order of magnitude higher than the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory,\" Belousov said.\n\n\"Ukraine's energy capacity has been reduced by more than half,\" he added.\n\nAttacking energy infrastructure is a war crime if it's found to be intentionally carried out to cause harm to civilians. Ukraine's besieged power grid is especially crucial, as it's essential for keeping its citizens warm during harsh winters.\n\nBelousov said the strikes on energy facilities were targeting the Ukrainian military, and that disabling the grid cut off power to Kyiv's forces.\n\nHowever, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said last September that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid were found to be severely affecting civilians and had \"disproportionately impacted\" vulnerable groups.\n\nUkraine also carries out attacks on Russian oil and gas facilities, though it said its aim is to cripple Moscow's ability to export energy and sustain war production.",

    "fullText": "Tucker Carlson claimed in a Wednesday interview that a member of Congress told him lawmakers were briefed that President Donald Trump is announcing “war is coming” tonight.\n\nCarlson joined Andrew Napolitano on his Judging Freedom podcast on Wednesday where they discussed growing tensions with Venezuela over strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as Trump’s address to the nation, scheduled for tonight.\n\n“Is Trump going to start a war in Venezuela?” Napolitano asked Carlson.\n\nAccording to Carlson, members of Congress were briefed on Trump’s plans, though he added he does not know the actual contents of Trump’s address.\n\n“Here’s what I know so far, which is that members of Congress were briefed yesterday that a war is coming and it’ll be announced in the address to the nation tonight at nine o’clock by the president,” Carlson said. “Who knows, by the way, if that’ll actually happen.”\n\nThe former Fox News host claimed he was told about the briefing by a member of Congress that morning.\n\nNotably, Axios’s Marc Caputo, who is well-sourced inside the Trump White House, reacted to Carlson’s comments, saying, “My sources say this wasn’t briefed & this announcement isn’t happening at 9.”\n\nCarlson is opposed to military action in Venezuela, arguing it would be repeating foreign policy mistakes of the past.\n\n“There’s not been a regime change effort that’s benefitted the United States or the world in 80 years that I’m aware of,” he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of being at the head of a narco terrorist smuggling operation. Maduro’s election victory has long been contested, with U.S. and global officials casting doubt on the results.\n\n“The illegitimate Maduro Regime is using Oil from these stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping. For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump announced this week.\n\nThe president has also set his sights on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, responding to his criticism of recent boat strikes by warning him he could have “big problems” soon.\n\n“He’s gonna have himself some big problems if he doesn’t wise up,” Trump told reporters. “Did he say Colombia’s producing a lot of drugs? They have cocaine factories that they make cocaine, as you know, and they sell it right into the United States. So he better wise up or he’ll be next.”\n\nThe post ‘War is Coming’: Tucker Carlson Says a Member of Congress Told Him What Trump Is Announcing Tonight first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.\n\nArnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.\n\n“Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation — intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,” said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP’s chief correspondent at the United Nations.\n\nAs a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.\n\nWhile almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.\n\n\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.\n\n\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”\n\nIt was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.\n\nIn January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.\n\n\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”\n\nHe would begin the fallen soldier’s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"\n\nArnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia’s economy was in shambles and the country’s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.\n\nAt the AP’s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHe credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.\n\nArnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP’s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau’s papers as coverage of the war wound down.\n\nInstead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they’d have historic value someday. They’re now in the AP’s archives.\n\nArnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.\n\nTen years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn 1995 he published the memoir, “Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.”\n\nArnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.\n\nHe was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military’s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.\n\nAfter his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.\n\nIn 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China’s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.\n\nBorn Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.\n\n\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a — you know — enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.\n\nAfter a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.\n\nSoon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.\n\nArnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.\n\n\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.”\n\nAP journalist Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "title": "The 6 biggest reveals from WBD's filing on why it rejected Paramount",
    "description": "A new filing says Paramount offered pay and a job to WBD CEO David Zaslav, and gives other takeaways from the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery didn't just reject Paramount again on Wednesday. It also pulled back the curtain on what the bidding war was like behind the scenes.\n\nWBD advised shareholders to dismiss Paramount's $30-per-share offer for the company and stick with Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share (for only its studios and streaming business). In a filing, WBD's board called Paramount's latest bid inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on shareholders compared to Netflix's bid, which it said offered superior value and more certainty.\n\nSome of the information in the filing had already been made public, but it revealed some juicy bits that haven't been reported.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways:\n\nRight after WBD rejected one of multiple secret bids in September, David Ellison called Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison. The conventional wisdom was that the Oracle cofounder's billions would prevail. In the end, that didn't happen. WBD expressed concern that the bid relied on a revocable trust, whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.\n\nWe already knew Zaslav stood to make over $500 million from a Paramount deal, based mainly on his shares that would vest immediately after it closed ($567,712,631, to be exact, according to the filing). Zaslav told the WBD board that the Ellisons had \"indicated to him that\" if a deal went through, he would \"receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars,\" per the filing. Zaslav responded that it \"would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time,\" he told the board.\n\nParamount also offered Zaslav the position of co-CEO and co-chairman of the combined company, a role Netflix didn't offer, the filing said.\n\nThat runs contrary to the narrative put forth in a letter Paramount's attorneys at Quinn Emanuel sent to WBD, stating they suspected the process was biased in favor of Netflix due to WBD leadership's expectations that there could be roles for them at the new company. Paramount's legal and financial advisors didn't know about the \"December 3 Quinn Emanuel\" letter and, in their view, the letter should not have been sent, was \"not helpful,\" and was a \"mistake,\" the filing says.\n\nThe filing revealed the presence of a fourth, previously unknown bidder in the process, \"Company C,\" which proposed acquiring WBD's cable channels and 20% of its streaming and studio businesses for $25 billion in cash.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Company C was Starz. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm that. Starz declined to comment.\n\nWBD determined that the Company C bid was \"not actionable\" and continued to work with Netflix, Paramount, and \"Company A\" (clearly Comcast).\n\nSome of Wall Street's marquee names — Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan, and Evercore — are set to make a total of $225 million in connection with WBD's sale to Netflix or Paramount, if a deal goes through, according to the filing.\n\nThe good times are poised to continue: Media and telecoms M&A deal value rose 61% in the past year, excluding the announced WBD sale, and the momentum should keep going in the years ahead, helped by investor appetite for valuable IP, according to PwC.\n\nThe Ellisons wanted to use $24 billion from Middle Eastern sources to fund their bid. That would seem to raise a whole host of concerns, not the least of which is that they'd be buying CNN and some of that money would come from Saudi Arabia's government, which US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka noted, however, that the issues WBD says the foreign money raised were \"presented as technical hurdles\" in the filing and \"not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\"\n\nA big question around the dueling bids was which company would have a better chance of surviving regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoth Paramount and Netflix made their cases, arguing that they'd sail through the process, while the other bidder would encounter issues.\n\nParamount said a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the well-stocked Warner Bros. library. Netflix, for its part, has argued that a combination of Paramount and WBD would actually be larger than its own proposed new entity, as measured by total US TV viewing time.\n\nNone of this seemed to be a chief concern for the WBD board, though.\n\n\"The WBD Board further took into account advice of WBD's regulatory advisors that regulatory risk was not a material differentiating factor between\" the Paramount and Netflix proposals, the filing said.\n\nThe wild card is Trump, though, who has close ties to the Ellisons but hasn't come down firmly on either side publicly.",

But one of the principles postulated by our supreme commander-in-chief is when we are forced to act, then we act.”\n\nSolovyov’s rant followed him as he traveled to the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk for a propaganda hit last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far been unable to capture the city in its years-long conflict with Ukraine.\n\nSolovyov’s rant also dropped as concerns are growing about Russia possibly targeting another country on top of their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto cautioned this week that tensions are escalating with Russia and Europe would not survive a war.\n\n“Freezing Russian assets was already a serious step, but using those assets goes even further. This is a war provocation of an unprecedented scale,” he said about the EU using frozen Russian assets. “Therefore, at today’s Foreign Affairs Council, I will make it clear that for Hungary, the risk of further escalation is unacceptable. Simply because if a war were to break out between Europe and Russia, Europe would not survive it.”\n\nBrussels wants to send another €210 billion to Ukraine, including around €115 billion for weapons.\n\nThe EU is disregarding its own rules by planning to finance this package through frozen Russian assets.

    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: This is one of Popular Mechanics’ greatest stories. It was initially published in March 2022.\n\nWe climb in the humid afternoon up a rutted and overgrown logging road, the sky mostly sealed off by a canopy of tree branches, sunlight leaking through dense greenery in elongated shafts. The hike up Dents Run is not quite a half mile long, but the six representatives of Finders Keepers LLC, a Pennsylvania-based treasure-hunting business, string out as climbers on Everest. Co-owner Denny Parada, 69, brings up the rear, hobbling a bit and breathing forcefully. He’s wearing a Finders Keepers polo and a camo baseball cap and shorts and has a handgun strapped to his hip. “Snakes,” he’d explained.\n\nDents Run is an unincorporated community in Benezette Township in rural Elk County, in northwestern Pennsylvania. We’re on a wooded slope, one knobby vertebra among thousands along the spine of the Appalachians. The overgrown road we’re ascending, known locally as Snooks Trail, is a lingering scar from a decades-old logging operation, though most recently it has served as the access point to Parada’s lifelong obsession.\n\nAbout halfway up, Denny’s 37-year-old son and business partner, Kem, hollers and points. An elk is perched on a steep slope above the trail, 50 feet up. It stands unmoving, staring us down, as the group stops to gaze back. A few of us snap photos and turn uphill; the elk stays locked on us as we trudge away.\n\nAnyone who is inclined to anthropomorphize might infer some type of omen in this. Dents Run has an enigmatic history—a lump of new-growth forest that’s unremarkable in every way, except that it birthed a tale of, among other things, a psychic, a cache of buried gold, Confederate sympathizers, an army of FBI agents, and a furtive overnight dig.\n\nOnce we reach our destination, Parada points to the slender cave opening that first propelled his quest, and the location maybe 15 yards away where four years ago the FBI authorized a sizable excavation. Parada is a paunchy nub of a man with a gray mustache and goatee. He uses an early-aughts-style flip phone and chews tobacco. His recitations of his exploits blend boyish wonder with the copious f-bombs of a case-hardened cynic. At the moment, he’s describing the extensive testing he did on this very ground to confirm the presence of gold.\n\n“I just think beyond any other treasure hunters,” he says, “because… I’m not going to claim I’m smart, but I do more experiments than anybody.”\n\nAs he speaks, Dwayne Kelly, a member of Parada’s entourage of full-timers, part-timers, and volunteers, is circling a nearby slope with dowsing rods. Parada describes Kelly as a kind of savant with this ancient if scientifically debunked method of searching for underground metal.\n\n“I need everybody’s opinion here,” Kelly says. The rest of the group clusters around him.\n\n“He’s finding something,” Denny notes, but then continues with his recounting of events from years earlier. Before he gets much further, Warren Getler splits away and joins us. Getler is the group’s default scholar, an expert in geophysics and buried Civil War treasure. “We think there’s something going on,” he says. “Look at the similarity to this up there. And look, the potential tunnel right there. We’re getting a strong signal.”\n\nThey begin scanning the site with a Discovery Treasure-Finder 900, a metal detector capable of locating objects as deep as 12 feet underground. Denny ejects a wad of Skoal-tinted saliva. “Dwayne, what did you do?” he shouts in mock exasperation, holding his arms wide.\n\n“I’m making you rich, buddy,” Kelly calls back.\n\n“He does this constantly to me,” Parada says.\n\nLater, he says, grinning, “You’re actually on a treasure hunt. I didn’t expect this to happen.”\n\nIt’s maybe the most surprising thing he’s said all day. This is Parada’s stock in trade, after all, and his adventures on Dents Run have gained traction in newspapers and on television worldwide. But treasure hunting is the longest of long games, and whether Kelly has actually found anything will not be determined today—or, most likely, anytime soon.\n\nAs with just about everything Parada gets involved with, the answers are tantalizingly close—just a few feet below ground—but just out of reach.\n\nThe drama at Dents Run started, as these stories do, with a fortuitous meeting. It was March 1974. Denny Parada, a native of nearby Philipsburg and a recent graduate of commercial-art school, had taken a job at a W.T. Grant department store, but his passions lay elsewhere. His grandmother was an antiques dealer, and he was fascinated with old objects, including a mysterious river stone he’d found as a child and kept. He thought it might be a Native American artifact. “I always loved this kind of stuff—historical stuff,” he says.\n\nIn his 20s, Parada bought treasure-hunting magazines and, during idle weekend hours, began sleuthing the mysteries they posed. One article in particular caught his attention because it was fascinating, and it was local: the legend of Dents Run gold.\n\nThe story has tentacled off in various ways over generations of retellings, and details have been added or amended over time. But the essence of the saga, as recounted in a 2019 Mt. Zion Historical Society booklet, remains the same. In 1863, the U.S. government’s War Department authorized a shipment of 50-pound gold bars—26 in all—from San Francisco to the Philadelphia Mint to finance the war effort. To avoid Confederate activity, the supply wagons carrying the gold were diverted from a route across southern Pennsylvania into the hilly, forested north. Following the advice of a local guide, the commander, Lt. James Castleton, and his sergeant, Mike O’Rourke, attempted a shortcut over the mountains using an 1842 map titled “Wildcat Country.”\n\nThings quickly went sideways. The logging road they were on led to a trail junction that wasn’t shown on the map. They picked the most promising option, but that petered out, leaving them to navigate a wilderness of tall virgin pines. Eventually they encountered a steep hillside that the wagons couldn’t navigate. The decision was made to send for help, pack out as much gold as possible, and bury the rest.\n\nMost of the men went missing, and the gold never arrived in Philadelphia. Pinkerton detectives who were dispatched to investigate never recovered the cache (although they did find two and a half bars). The National Archives holds no record of the shipment, but the legend of the lost gold “has captivated the attention of thousands of people over the past 150 years,” the historical society reports. And waves of fresh ambition, fortified by the forward march of metal-detecting technology, have continually fueled new searches.\n\nDennis Parada was just another dreaming amateur in 1974 when his employer hired Michael Malley—who performed at the time as the psychic Professor M.G. Malley—to present a “delightfully entertaining ESP presentation.” Parada missed the presentation during his shift in the furniture department. He thought the notion of a psychic was ridiculous anyway.\n\nHe was on his lunch break when Malley wandered by. Parada brandished a copy of Treasure Magazine with the Dents Run story, so one of his colleagues asked Malley whether he could help locate the gold. “What I’m about to tell you next,” Parada says of this encounter, would “change our lives forever.”\n\nMalley ran a finger over the article while Parada stood behind him thinking, What a bunch of bullshit. But Malley then went into a trance and began speaking in voices—Parada believes they were soldiers who’d lost the fateful gold shipment. Malley picked up the atlas Parada had with him, and with eyes looking toward the ceiling, brought a pen down on a spot where he instructed Parada to go. Later, using a soil sample Parada had collected, Malley told him to look for a cave entrance.\n\nParada became a believer, but the search ran aground when he was unable to locate the cave. He became preoccupied with life—opening several businesses, including an antique-furniture store, and raising a family. But he never forgot Dents Run; Kem, born in 1985, grew up hearing bedtime stories about that gold.\n\nFast-forward 30 years. It’s 2004, and Denny is sitting in a bar watching TV with a friend, Scott Farrell. The show is about treasure hunting, and it reminds him of Dents Run. Farrell asks Parada whether he wants to take another look. Soon afterward, they hike up the hill and Parada waves in the direction of the purported cave. Before he gets far looking further uphill, Farrell yells that he found something. “Don’t joke with me, Scott,” Denny calls back.\n\nBut Farrell (who has since died) had found it: a horizontal slit of an entrance on the slope below the logging road, just wide enough for a person to crawl in. Parada surmises that work crews had inadvertently sealed over the entrance when constructing the road, and erosion over subsequent decades had opened it back up. A trickle of water leaked from the opening.\n\nInside the grotto, Parada says, they found a hand-built wall of stacked stones. Their flashlight beams played over scorch marks on the ceiling, apparently from a torch. They later discovered Civil War-era bullets and other artifacts nearby, adding to their suspicion that troops had visited the site during the conflict.\n\nMalley had advised them that the cave was 32 feet deep. The stacked-stone wall was at 15 feet, but later Kem Parada was able to remove enough stones to find a second chamber behind it—and that one was also 15 feet deep. At the back of that chamber they located a shaft, but further excavation posed too much of a cave-in risk, so they backed off. The cave was muddy and damp—a claustrophobe’s nightmare—but the Paradas were exultant, feeling they were close to finding something, possibly the mythical cache of gold. Focusing on the ground above, they investigated further using a metal-detecting device called a GPL 200. (GPL stands for “ground penetrating locator.”) The user embeds stakes connected by wire around a plot of ground. By pulsing electrical current through the stakes, the device gauges the presence of metals and minerals below, based on how strongly the underground elements oppose—or “resist,” in geophysical terms—the charge. Gold, silver, and copper are highly conductive, so the lower the resistivity reading, the higher the odds that they’ve been discovered.\n\nThe Paradas’ GPL revealed a highly conductive metal mass just off to one side of the underground chamber. They also tested the site using ground-penetrating radar. That device emits radio frequencies into the earth’s surface, which then either bounce back or are absorbed, depending on what they encounter. To estimate what lies beneath, the device’s computer calculates the signal strength of the reflected radio waves and the amount of time they took to bounce back.\n\nIn 2010, the Paradas hired Terence Hamill, founder and chief geophysicist of GeoSearches Inc., an Ohio-based firm specializing in subsurface geophysical surveys. Hamill detected “a large metallic anomaly at depth, differentiated from the surrounding geology,” reinforcing Parada’s suspicion that something was there. “We could see that there was something completely different down there, and it could well be precious,” Hamill says.\n\nOver the next nine years, Denny and Kem Parada visited Dents Run about 300 times, capturing more than 100 readings. Kem says the results were unmistakable: “It all screamed gold at this same location.”\n\nWhen they’d first found the cave entrance, the Paradas had been hobbyists—guys out hunting for treasure on weekends and during their spare hours. The site is on state land overseen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and DCNR officials initially seemed unfazed by their activities, signing off on everything they asked to do short of sinking shovels into earth. “They kind of just let us do our thing,” Kem says.\n\nEventually the Paradas became such a regular presence at Dents Run that state officials sent them a letter identifying them as professional treasure hunters. The Paradas embraced the classification by forming Finders Keepers.\n\nBolstered by this veneer of legitimacy, they began to more intensively explore the question of whether they had actually struck gold. They secured permission from the DCNR to drill bore holes from above with non-commercial-grade equipment. “We basically spent years Swiss-cheesing this mountaintop,” Kem says.\n\nAs they drilled their 16th hole, the bit stopped about five and a half feet down. This was odd, because they were typically exploring as far as 12 feet down. They switched out their three-quarter-inch masonry drill bit for a one-inch bit, and Denny switched the machine onto high speed and put all his weight into it. The bit sent up a squealing sound—metal on metal, he says—and stopped dead. He shut the drill down to let it cool, but when he returned after lunch, the bit was so firmly wedged into something that it took two and a half days to extract it.\n\nWhen he finally retrieved the bit, yellowish smears were melted onto the end—a “gold shine,” as he puts it, though there was no way to test for it. At this point anyone would be sorely tempted to just start shoveling earth, but they were committed to doing things by the book. On November 1, 2010, Denny asked the DCNR for permission to drill a two-inch hole into the location and drop a camera inside. This time the answer was no. An official said they needed “to see gold metal on a drill bit in sufficient quantity to convince us” that such invasive procedures were warranted.\n\nThat was when things started to get weird. They’d been leaving their equipment at the site—including a generator and metal detectors—but someone began taking pieces of gear, including trail cameras hanging from trees, GPL stakes, and an extension cord. But the thieves missed one camera, and the images from it stunned Parada: The people removing his equipment were uniformed DCNR personnel. Parada demanded that his gear be returned, and over the course of several heated exchanges, his relationship with the state agency became adversarial. Parada even found evidence that he believes shows that people attached to the agency conducted their own dig on the site, though not in the place he had identified as holding the cache.\n\nThis escalation brought steep consequences. In 2014, the DCNR sent a certified letter demanding that the Paradas cease all activity there. “Once we drove down and hit the gold and had them on site, that’s when things changed,” Denny says. “It’s just big government bureaucratic stuff that pisses me off.”\n\nThat summer, the Paradas took a meeting with a staff member of the Pennsylvania legislature who offered to facilitate a dig permit. The person (whom the Paradas decline to name) claimed to be acting on behalf of individuals in state government—someone who controlled money going to DCNR, and someone working in the governor’s office. But there was a condition: The Paradas had to kick back three gold bars, or 12 percent of the haul, Denny says. He captured the incident on video, and the Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, reported the incident to the FBI, but no one was ever charged.\n\nFrustrated and stymied by the DCNR ban, the Paradas turned to other projects. More than four years passed, and they might have eventually forsaken Dents Run. But then, in November 2017, Denny’s phone rang.\n\nWarren Getler had come across the Paradas’ Dents Run adventure on a treasure-hunting online bulletin board. He was instantly intrigued. Getler had worked as a journalist for the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News, among other outlets, and had coauthored a book, Rebel Gold, about the Knights of the Golden Circle. The KGC, he told Denny, was a quasi-military secret society that took hold in the South and Midwest during the Civil War. Its founders opposed the abolitionist movement and sought to create a new slave-owning nation that encompassed the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean as a counterweight to the North. Operatives looted Union shipments to raise money for the cause, and then stashed plundered gold and silver in various locations around the country. Getler says many of those caches remain intact today—and he told Parada he believed the Dents Run gold was stolen by a KGC-affiliated group in the North called the Copperheads.\n\nGetler opined that while there was likely gold at Dents Run, the fable associated with its presence there is apocryphal. The gold was likely stolen and hidden there, he said, and the story of the lost supply wagons is, in part, a KGC “waybill”—a cryptic, coded message meant to indicate the location of a cache to insiders.\n\nThe Getler-Parada alliance formed with the suddenness and intensity of a thunderclap. They talked nearly every night for the next two months, and came to a powerful realization: Getler’s narrative gave them another avenue for pursuing the treasure. If the gold bars had come from the U.S. Mint, they were federal property. And the Feds could invoke eminent domain in order to dig on state land.\n\nGetler eventually left journalism to join a tech startup that focused on geophysics and subsurface target detection in Washington, D.C. He knew that the electrical-resistivity-sensing equipment Denny was using had certain limitations because the Dents Run soil contained high clay and water content. But the possibilities were compelling—so much so that he offered to arrange a meeting with the FBI to explore a possible gold recovery at the Pennsylvania site.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, the Paradas met Getler in Philadelphia. They ate slices of pizza together, then headed to the U.S. Attorney’s office, where they met two agents from the bureau’s Art Crime Team and an assistant U.S. attorney. The agents spent an hour listening and looking over the Paradas’ stuff. They were initially skeptical, Denny says, “but when I showed them what I had”—including various instrument readings—“they were more convinced.” Getler provided a colloquium on the KGC.\n\nWhen they’d finished, Special Agent Jake Archer told them, “I just want to be clear. If the gold is there, it’s ours. We are going to seize it.”\n\nDenny answered that he would request a finder’s fee, and Archer didn’t object. The agent also indicated that the three men could be on site if the government decided to dig. The next day, Archer called looking for directions, and the Paradas provided detailed GPS coordinates.\n\nOn January 31, the Paradas and Getler met a contingent of seven FBI agents led by Archer at a restaurant near Dents Run. Heading there, Kem noticed an unmarked SUV that appeared to be a law enforcement vehicle following them. He’d been a cop for nine years and knew everyone in the area, and he didn’t recognize it. “It was creepy,” he says.\n\nThe Paradas led the contingent up snow-draped Dents Run, where they generated readings from their GPL 200. They reproduced the test away from the target site, to show the contrast in readings. The agents conducted their own examination using a TF-900 metal detector, and then talked about what kind of earth-moving equipment would be necessary for an excavation.\n\nHicks Run Road, which provides access to the site, is a sparsely populated dirt lane. Garrett Osche lives closest to the site, on a property at the base of the mountain called Pine Valley Camp, which his family has owned for more than 80 years. Osche has tousled gray hair and piercing blue eyes and wore a camouflage shirt with cutoff sleeves. Over the years he’d become friendly with the Paradas, so he allowed the agents to park and change their clothes in his heated garage. When they came down the hill that day, they seemed excited. “They were chirping like a bunch of chickens,” Osche says. Archer, aware of Osche’s presence, shut them down, saying, “We’ll talk about this at the office.”\n\nGetler encouraged Archer to dive deeper into the science of underground detection before planning a dig. He suggested handheld EM-31 and GEM-2 units; these electromagnetic devices have been deployed by the U.S. military in Iraq to locate IEDs and tunnels. The other choice, even more ideal, was a gravimeter—a heavy, boxlike system that calculates the size, weight, and mass of underground objects. It works by comparing an object’s density to the soil in which it sits, and then feeding the data into a software algorithm that spits out analyses in the form of heat maps. The device shows clear contrasts between precious metals and regular soil. Gold, for example, would score a density reading of 18 or 19, whereas sedimentary rock would measure around 2.3. “You can get a pretty accurate depth reading to the center of an object,” Getler says. “It’s very accurate and very sensitive.”\n\nGetler recommended several geophysics companies that could conduct tests, and the bureau chose Enviroscan Inc., a respected firm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with more than 25 years in business, to conduct a gravimeter survey. Enviroscan’s principal geophysicist was Dr. Tim Bechtel, who in 2020 would be awarded the prestigious Public Service Award by the Geological Society of America. Four FBI agents returned on February 23 with an Enviroscan team, and with the Paradas looking on in a bone-cold, heavy downpour, the crew festooned the site with about 60 marker flags and logged more than 50 readings over two-foot increments.\n\nDuring a three-way call with Denny Parada and Getler several days later, Archer delivered Enviroscan’s findings: The gravimeter showed a mass with a density of 18 to 19—a result that indicated gold. And no small amount, either: The estimate was seven to nine tons. This was far more than the 26 gold bars from the Dents Run legend, which combined would have weighed only 1,300 pounds.\n\nParada’s mind reeled. Getler began bellowing. Nine tons of gold would be the largest land-based treasure in U.S. history—a haul worth $400 million to $600 million. The finding reinforced Getler’s theory that the site was an underground Copperhead depository.\n\nArcher said the FBI intended to get a warrant to excavate the site. He asked Denny and Kem to hide more cameras up there, and to check on the site as often as possible. Just over a week later, on March 10, Archer called again with news: The dig would happen in three days.\n\nThe FBI had worked quickly. Citing the Enviroscan findings and Getler’s historical research, the bureau on March 9 had obtained a federal warrant to dig up the hillside. Archer had written an affidavit stating there was “probable cause to believe that, in a cave on the Dents Run Site, approximately one or more tons of gold belonging to, and stolen from, the United States Mint… are secreted.” In signing the warrant, U.S. Magistrate Judge Richard Lloret had asserted the federal government’s power to push aside the state of Pennsylvania in a quest to reclaim gold that had been lost 155 years earlier. Archer wrote that he wanted to dig in secret, because tipping off state officials “could result in unlawful seizure of the stolen United States gold as abandoned property.” The federal government wanted to grab the gold before Pennsylvania could.\n\nThe affidavit is a fascinating 32-page document. Archer consulted experts from the National Archives, U.S. Mint, and other historical sites. He cited the lack of naturally occurring precious metals in the area, and spelled out the scientific rationale for a dig. The affidavit also reports the incident in which a Pennsylvania official dangled a dig permit in exchange for gold bars, and bores deeply into Dents Run mythology, adopting Getler’s theory that the Knights of the Golden Circle left waybills, codes, and symbols such as circles, rising suns, and turtles on rocks and trees to guide people to caches. Getler said the rock formation above the cave entrance looked like a turtle shell—and turtles are among the most important KGC symbols for gold. Citing the purported leaders of the ill-fated supply wagons in the Dents Run legend, Archer wrote, “It is very likely that Castleton and O’Rourke are fake names, and are in fact, code (Castle and Rook), with Castleton clearly being used as a pointer, as ‘castle’ was the key organizing unit of this secret subversive organization and ‘rook’ was a local unit of that organization.” Although this sounds like a passage lifted from a Dan Brown novel, the KGC is a documented part of the historical record of the era.\n\nHistory aside, Dents Run would have remained a sleepy and largely forgotten fold in the Pennsylvania hills without the Paradas, a team of untrained but hell-bent enthusiasts who had stalked the slopes for more than a decade, lugging equipment purchased at hardware stores. Their business name is taken from a childhood taunt, and their logo looks like a 1960s-style Looney Tunes creation. Stranger still? To this day, Denny credits Mike Malley, the ESP performer, with enabling the discovery—and has offered Malley a quarter of any funds he might receive for the gold.\n\nFor his part, Malley, now 82 and living in western Pennsylvania, says the show he performed for 22 years consisted entirely of staged illusions. “I certainly don’t call myself a psychic,” Malley says. “I don’t believe in psychics.”\n\nStill, on “very rare” instances—once every couple of decades—Malley says he’s able to intuit something. “It’s a certain feeling,” he says. “It’s like, somebody [asks] you, ‘Is it rainy outside?’ And you look outside—yeah, it’s raining. And you’re that certain of it. I can’t explain it.”\n\nMalley, who left show business in the 1980s to sell life insurance and annuities, seems genuinely at a loss to make sense of the Dent Run episode. But he says he’s been able to intuit information about the site on multiple occasions with Parada—starting when Denny handed him the magazine and atlas.\n\nOn the hourlong drive from their home base in Clearfield, Denny and Kem had the opportunity to contemplate the remarkable nature of everything that had happened up to that point. They were with Getler in Kem’s Mazda hatchback, because Archer had ordered them to travel incognito—no vehicles bearing the Finders Keepers logo. But when they arrived, Archer told them to stay in the car—the dig site was too crowded, and as a result too hazardous, to have them standing around.\n\nThe three men took in the scene through the Mazda windshield. The previous day, Kem had gone to check on the site and was surprised to see FBI agents already there. Now 25 vehicles sat at the base of the hill, along with four ATVs, a cargo truck, and a satellite van. At least 50 agents ringed the site’s perimeter. A staging area had been erected, including a green tent housing a command center. Portable toilets had been trucked in. They would later learn that the FBI had hired a local archeologist to provide expertise.\n\n“There was FBI all over that mountain,” Kem says. “It blew our minds.”\n\nHours crawled by with the three men pinned inside the Mazda. Archer stopped by occasionally to tell them to sit tight, saying they’d be able to hike up the mountain soon, but they grew increasingly impatient. When a local TV reporter showed up, agents hustled the trio inside the tent so they couldn’t talk.\n\nFinally, around 3 p.m., Archer led them to where the Paradas had spent countless hours over the years, many of them crawling in mud. About 30 agents wearing blue “FBI Evidence Response Team” jackets stood around a Kobelko excavator. Over the next hour, the machine dug down about seven feet before Archer called things to a halt.\n\nAs the Paradas and Getler recount, Archer said everyone was cold and hungry. “We’ve been here all day working; we’re gonna pack it up for the night,” the agent said. Archer instructed them to return at 8 a.m.\n\nThe three men were surprised, because there was plenty of daylight left. When they returned the next morning under a thin snowfall, Archer reported a glitch: The hole had filled with water, and they needed to check with the DCNR about potential environmental impacts. Once again, the Paradas and Getler were confined to their car, and the mood on the site shifted. Agents who’d previously been friendly barked at them, shooing them from the tent they’d taken shelter in the day before.\n\nAfter another five-hour-plus wait, Archer returned to again take them up the hill. The Paradas and Getler hustled from the car, excitement overriding their irritation—at last, they were about to see the results of their years of work. But Archer seemed downcast, as did the phalanx of agents who ringed the site. FBI personnel who had chatted amiably with them the previous day were stone-faced.\n\nThe Paradas and Getler took in the scene. The hole was free of water and mud, and had been dug 12 or 13 feet deep and about 25 feet wide. Archer asked Denny what he saw. The hole was empty. Parada replied, “I don’t see anything.”\n\nArcher announced, “That’s it, people, there’s nothing here, let’s go home,” Parada recalls. “I say, ‘No, wait a second. There’s nothing here now. It doesn’t mean there wasn’t something here yesterday or the day before. You’re the one that told me nine tons.’”\n\nParada was shouting. “You’re the one that wouldn’t let my guys up here while the dig happened,” he said. “You wouldn’t let us bring equipment.”\n\nAfter Denny vented, Archer ushered them downhill. Denny turned and asked him: “Did you or did you not find gold?\"\n\nThe agent refused to answer. Instead, Kem recalls, “Archer looked at the three of us and said, ‘I’m telling you right now, you don’t go to the media. You don’t put anything on Facebook. You put nothing online. You say nothing to nobody.’ He said, ‘If you do, there’ll be serious repercussions.’ And then he pointed at me and said, ‘and you got your law enforcement career to worry about.’”\n\nAnd with that, they were dismissed. Back at the car, Getler says, “I was literally in a state of shock.”\n\nThey couldn’t make sense of it. Their own extensive testing, and tests conducted by two professional outside firms, all showed the presence of a highly conductive and very dense mass—and even if it wasn’t gold, it was something. “I’ve been in this business too long,” Parada says. “You can have a false reading… If they would have pulled out some scrap metal of any kind, I wouldn’t question it. But to tell me nothing was found? No.”\n\nGetler observed: “When you do 50 scans with a very sensitive and precise gravimeter in five-foot increments, it’s a virtual geophysical fingerprint at that point.”\n\nWhen the Paradas returned a couple of days later with their GPL 200, the mass they had detected scores of times no longer turned up in their readings. The machine showed nothing at all.\n\nThat was eerie enough. Then they began to encounter people in nearby Weedville and Benezette, all of whom asked versions of the same question: “Did you see the armored trucks?”\n\nCheryl Elder knows what she heard.\n\nAs a resident who lives below the dig site, Elder had watched as dozens of federal vehicles rolled past and parked adjacent to her property. At 62, she’d never seen anything like it, and she’s lived her whole life in Elk County, the last 30 years in Dents Run. She served as constable for 20-plus years and had heard about the lost gold since she was a girl; her son had searched the hills with a metal detector.\n\nThe first full day they were there, she says, “I walked up, I was like, ‘What’s going on here?’ You know, you have FBI guys everywhere with their vests and guns and everything—they were guarding it. And he said, ‘Oh, nothing to worry about.’ I said, ‘Well, I live right here, I’m not worried. I mean, there’s enough FBI guys around here—why in the hell would I be worried?’”\n\nOn the night of March 13—in the hours after the FBI had sent the Paradas and Getler home—lights flooded the hillside, and Elder heard heavy work on the slope above: the sounds of a backhoe backing up, the rattling of a jackhammer. “They were digging all night up on that hill,” she says, sitting in her living room. “They had it so lit up that it looked like a city.”\n\nIn the middle of the night Elder called her husband, who was out of town. “I can’t sleep,” she told him. She was awake until nearly 3 a.m.\n\nWhen the FBI pulled out the next afternoon, agents blocked the road. A series of black Hummer-type armored vehicles passed, and in contrast to when they’d arrived, agents ordered her inside her house. She defiantly watched from her garage. “I just stood there with my dog watching them,” she says, “like, what are you gonna do, shoot me?”\n\nElder was baffled to hear the FBI’s claim that the search came up empty. “If they didn’t find anything, then why?” she says. “What was the big deal? Why would you have guards there?”\n\n“I know they found that gold,” she says.\n\nOther residents noticed unusual traffic on March 14 as well. Heather Selle of nearby Weedville told the Paradas that she saw armored cars around 8:30 a.m. as she loaded her child off to school. The vehicles looked like Lenco BearCat-type vehicles, capable of carrying more than two tons of cargo. A local cop called Kem to report that he’d watched armored vehicles, supported by two Humvees and a satellite truck, driving west on Route 555 from near Dents Run at about 10 a.m.\n\nAt Valley Farm Market in Weedville, various employees noticed FBI vehicles parked in an adjacent vacant lot for much of the day, and FBI personnel frequented the store. The shop, which features a variety of model trains and mounted deer heads, is the town’s nerve center.\n\nEmployee Mary Hogan says the FBI seemed to be mobilizing several armored vehicles. “It was an absolute circus in the vacant lot,” she says. “Why were they going through all this rigmarole if nothing was found?”\n\nGarrett Osche also noticed that the authorities had blocked roads in and out of Dents Run that day. “You don’t shut this road down… for two to three hours to send five armored trucks out of here that have nothing in ’em,” he says. The agents, he says, were “very sneaky about it, to put it mildly… As far as I’m concerned, this totally ruined my trust in the FBI.”\n\nGetler and the Paradas believe the vehicles’ movements were orchestrated. In the morning, the armored trucks that witnesses spotted came in after the three men had arrived at Dents Run. They think the vehicles circled around behind them to nearby Hicks Run, where the gold had been stored in SUVs overnight. “They were timing us to know when we’d be off the road so that those armored cars would come in behind us,” Getler says.\n\nThe vehicles waiting at Valley Farm Market were brought in to move the rest late in the afternoon, after the trio had been sent home. “This was done with military precision,” Getler asserts.\n\nThe developments left the rural town scandalized. “This is where we live,” Cheryl Elder says. “I mean, I’ve lived here all my life… How dare they?”\n\nThe worst part, she says—beyond how the Paradas were treated—is the lack of closure. “You’re going to take the gold, but give us the story,” Elder says. “Let us have the final version of what happened here. We grew up with this legend—this myth. Maybe it was real. At least tell us.”\n\nThe FBI issued a terse 44-word statement after the dig that stated, in part, “Nothing was found, and the excavation ended on Wednesday, March 14.” The bureau has said nothing further publicly ever since.\n\nAn FBI spokeswoman refused to make Archer available for questions. “Nothing was found in the excavation,” she declared via email. “The FBI unequivocally rejects any claims or speculation to the contrary. We’ll decline further comment.”\n\nBut the question of what happened on that hill has acquired its own gravitational pull. Emotions run high when people are short on facts. The Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, filed a Freedom of Information request in May 2018 seeking records pertaining to the dig. The FBI initially responded that no such records exist, but later—after Cluck enlisted the help of U.S. Senator Pat Toomey—the bureau conceded that it possesses 2,378 pages of records and 17 CDs of videos. The file is so voluminous that the records won’t be processed for release until around March 2024. In January, Anne Weissman, an attorney who specializes in government transparency and accountability, filed a lawsuit on the Paradas’ behalf, seeking to accelerate the process.\n\nCluck also submitted an open-records request to Pennsylvania’s DCNR, and learned that on the day before the dig, Assistant U.S. Attorney K.T. Newton had emailed DCNR counsel to convey details about the dig. “We believe the cache itself is in the neighborhood of 3x5x8 or 5x5x8,” she wrote.\n\nNewton says the FBI was going with the best information it had at the time—that based on the results of all the testing and surveying, “it was believed that this was the size of the cache. The best we could do was use the best scientific evidence available to us at the time for probable cause: ‘This is what we believe to be there.’”\n\nShe says that turned out to be inaccurate. “The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office would have been more than happy and delighted if we had uncovered what we thought was there, but nothing was found.”\n\nFor the Paradas, surreality pervaded the dig’s aftermath. Maybe the most bizarre footnote: The night the FBI packed up and moved out, Michael Malley, the psychic performer, called Parada to say that he’d intuited something. Both Parada and Getler recall Malley telling them, “They’re moving nine tons of gold out of the country.”\n\nThe next day, news broke that part of a shipment of 9.3 tons of gold had fallen from a cargo plane on a runway in Siberia. According to the reports, nearly 200 bars had come from a mine operated by the Canada-based Kinross Gold Corporation—whose initials happen to be KGC. It was almost certainly just a coincidence, Parada says, but it was still indelibly strange.\n\nThe key question the treasure hunters want answered is this: How did several different scientific instruments that are staples in the geophysics industry—most specifically the gravimeter—all produce false readings? Newton was unable to account for the discrepancy. “We hire reputable companies, the testing is done, this is what the results are,” she says. “It’s never guaranteed. It’s always within—I don’t even know what the reasonable probabilities are—but we can only base it on what the testing tells us. As to what the science is and how that’s done, I am not a geologist.”\n\nThe perpetual questions about what happened are troubling, she says. “It is disturbing for us to have this still being put out there, that somehow the FBI is lying about this—that somehow this huge amount of gold was found, and we managed to spirit it out of that location in the middle of the night,” she says. “What better outcome for us than to say, ‘Look what was found,’ right? As opposed to, for some reason, this allegedly is somehow secreted away somewhere. I can’t figure out what possibly anybody would gain from that.”\n\nWhen I suggest that opening the FBI records might resolve the matter, Newton disagrees. “We unsealed the affidavit, we laid out the basis for what we thought was there, and… there was nothing found,” she says. “So I don’t know what else needs to be put out in the public record on this.”\n\nThe Paradas’ lawyers disagree. “I can’t believe (FBI officials) haven’t bothered to issue a report to the federal court,” Bill Cluck says. “They haven’t bothered to get back to the companies whose equipment was used. Because frankly, I practice environmental law, and I’m not going to trust Enviroscan and this equipment now that I know it doesn’t necessarily work.”\n\nEnviroscan, unfortunately, is barred from defending itself or elaborating on its findings. “We are under quite a strict gag order,” founder Timothy Bechtel replied to an email seeking comment. “I am to direct all inquiries to Agent Jake Archer of the FBI.”\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the issue of the Paradas’ unreimbursed years of work on Dents Run. Cluck says Pennsylvania is the only state that lacks a definitive supreme court decision on treasure troves, and his research indicates that by common law, Finders Keepers has a right to petition federal courts “for their fair share [of the gold], if it was found.” Parada wants a 10 percent finder’s fee—$40 million to $60 million—and he believes a confirmed finding of gold would bring book and movie rights to his story.\n\nBut Parada says money is only part of the equation. Despite the business name he chose, Parada isn’t looking to possess any of his discoveries; he wants various finds returned to their rightful owners, if possible. If gold buried at Dents Run bore the markings of the U.S. Mint, he accepts that it’s government property. And when he leans away from the specifics of Dents Run in his mind, he sees something bigger: Malley’s help, along with other unspecified supernatural occurrences he declines to elaborate on, have convinced him that spirits of the departed help guide his efforts. He believes they want “somebody to come around to find these things and make sure they go to the right place. If souls that have crossed over are helping us, that means there’s an afterlife, and that’s a good thing.\n\n“I know it sounds crazy,” he adds after a beat. “But this is my life.”\n\nMalley feels conflicted about his role in what he characterizes as a borderline unhealthy quest. He’s suggested to Parada multiple times that he let Dents Run go. “It became an obsession, in my mind, of him going after (the gold),” Malley says. “I mean, no matter how hard I tried to talk him out of it, he wouldn’t budge… I said, ‘Dennis, this is too consuming for you; it’s not going to go anywhere.’ And he said, ‘I can’t stop now, Mike.’”\n\nThe layers of irony are unfathomably rich: Parada became convinced of psychic powers—and was propelled in his quest—by a performer who doesn’t believe in psychic powers. And he embraced the FBI in order to solve his life’s biggest mystery—and wound up with an even bigger one. Before, Parada was merely looking for the X that marks the spot; now, the answer resides inside a hall of mirrors—the treasure there but not there, seemingly receding further from him the closer he gets.\n\nParada’s unselfconsciousness through it all is both unsettling and disarming. He’s able to stand apart from his narrative, observe how absurdly unlikely it is, and then use that awareness to argue even more convincingly on his own behalf. Most people in his situation would cave in to exasperated uncertainty; his adversity and lived experience has only ripened into deeper conviction. He has no trouble reconciling the life that he’s lived to the one he imagines. His redemption could always be just a few shovelfuls of dirt away.\n\n“All I want is credit for solving these mysteries,” he says. “So many people have died for those treasures to be there. It’s not ours. The last thing we’d ever do is dig something up and put it in our pocket and never tell anybody. More than anything, I want the truth to come out. I wanna know where that gold went to.”\n\nThe good news for the Paradas is that they always have a new mission.\n\nThe day after visiting Dents Run in summer 2021, the Paradas and Getler take me to another site they’re investigating nearby. After the FBI dig, Denny received a call from a man who had grown up in an area known for harboring unidentified mounds and Civil War-era artifacts.\n\nExploring the site, the Finders Keepers team discovered what they believe are bullets, belt buckles from Union uniforms, and parts of a limber wagon, a two-wheeled cart that carried ammunition and artillery. They also found Knights of the Golden Circle symbols, including a circular stone carved in the shape of a Native American headdress similar to what appears on a copperhead penny. One of the team also found a “turtle rock”—a stone with an image of a turtle on it. Unfurling the map beforehand, Getler points to the spot. “That’s a turtle, no question,” he says. “If you read my book, the turtle always points to the treasure.” Getler also located a waybill—a KGC coded map—that matches certain features of the area.\n\nThe group returned with their array of detection equipment and located more underground metal masses and what appeared, on their instruments, to be a tunnel. Measuring off distances, they created a massive hand-drawn map. These efforts yielded an astonishingly far-reaching theory: They believe they’ve located a buried KGC garrison. Fifteen feet underground, they say, is essentially a military base the size of three football fields. Numerous tunnels lead to as many as 21 chambers potentially harboring Civil War cannons, arms, ammunition, and more. “I think every wagon they hijacked for gold or supplies, they brought back to this camp and buried them all,” Denny says.\n\nIf they’re correct about what they call Copperhead Central, they believe the site will rewrite history books. They theorize that it was the secret rendezvous point for General Robert E. Lee and his troops in late spring 1863—to collect looted gold and link up with KGC militia—when they fatefully ran into Union forces at Gettysburg. “If this is right,” Getler says, “you’re on to the biggest story you could ever imagine in terms of how outrageously wild it is.”\n\nBack in Clearfield, in the low-slung, tucked-away home that serves as the Finders Keepers headquarters, the three men unfold their map, several square feet in area, onto which they’ve overlaid a transparency showing the theoretical KGC compound. Items from Denny’s years of exploration, many of them rusty and crumbling, cover nearly every horizontal surface. A New York Times story about Finders Keepers, which includes a photo of Parada, hangs on the wall.\n\nAs with Dents Run, the Paradas are endeavoring to gird their towering theories with a scientific foundation. They’ve hired a New Jersey outfit, American Geophysics Inc., to scan the location using ground-penetrating radar and an EM-31. On the first of two days at the site, two members of the American Geophysics crew walk the site, flagging the ground at locations indicated by Parada and Getler. Then they scan it with their gear, which includes a 12-foot boom.\n\nGetler and the Paradas buzz with anticipation—but they’re also aware that the science may reveal gaps between their ironclad convictions and the reality of what lies underground.\n\nDCNR District Forester Douglas D’Amore, for one, is expecting the team of treasure hunters to leave the site disappointed. D’Amore is on site, watching and taking photographs, to ensure that the activity conforms to approved activities—scanning, but no digging. Parada regales him with earnest, bubbling-over theories about Copperhead Central, but D’Amore no-sells the pitch, standing with his body angled away and avoiding eye contact. Later, D’Amore offers a detailed alternative theory: Whatever lies underground on the site is far more likely the result of logging operations that were based there.\n\nIt’s not hard to channel D’Amore’s skepticism, trudging among the trees. The surroundings feel like one unremarkable patch of woods among hundreds of square miles of them. And the dynamic between the Paradas and Getler could be read as endlessly looping confirmation bias. Then there’s the zealous embrace of the supernatural and the unreconstructed use of dowsing rods. Yet everyone involved—Denny most of all—argues their case with the ferocity of a true believer. And in his contempt for government interference, Denny tends to characterize any bureaucratic speed bump —for example, the DCNR’s environmental permitting requirements—as evidence of persecution and obstruction.\n\nTheir collective quest exists inside the space where the supernatural meets science, ardent belief meets cold reality, and heat maps meet hard earth. They see themselves as an unstoppable force pitted against a movable object—if only they exert enough sweat and resources. It’s a years-long grind that few beyond the Paradas would countenance.\n\nBut: The American Geophysics crew produces a heat map showing four large, anomalous metal shapes underground, including a 10-foot mass. Optimism pulses through the gathering, and the Finders Keepers crew, feeling exultant, convinces D’Amore to try the dowsing rods.\n\nAfter receiving the final results from American Geophysics, the Paradas ask the state of Pennsylvania to excavate the site. When several months pass with no answer, Parada looks into obtaining permits to start digging, in the hope that a remarkable discovery will prompt an official entity—a museum or university—to take over.\n\nFor now, that leaves the Paradas in a kind of treasure-hunter limbo. If the truth emerges that tons of gold bars were on that Pennsylvania hillside, the story of their ardent and tenacious journey will become just as mythical and enduring as the cache of precious metal. Somehow, the scaffolding of belief they built around the site held up across more than a decade of gale-force bureaucratic headwinds.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the point of the bizarre tale of Dents Run. Maybe the truth of the gold—tantalizing though it may be—doesn’t really matter. Maybe what’s important is the manner in which Denny Parada embodies the yearning, the quest—the believing—for objects that transport us, time out of mind, to distant people and times. Who doesn’t yearn to follow the map to the mythical X, to crunch through the woods, staring at the ground, wondering what mysteries it holds?\n\nOf course, the most likely answer is that there’s nothing down there. But what if?\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on five businessmen linked to Russian state-owned oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft and targeted companies accused of circumventing sanctions on Russian oil by running ships for Moscow's shadow fleet of aging oil tankers.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nMember countries, notably France, have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

One proposal is to use some of the tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe.\n\n“The aggressor must pay,” Zelenskyy told the Dutch parliament earlier Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, he attended peace talks in Berlin with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Zelenskyy voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he told journalists. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nThirty-five countries backed the International Claims Commission, but they now must ratify the treaty, a process which usually requires legislature approval. That level of support is unprecedented for the start of a Council of Europe treaty.\n\nThe commission will assess claims made to the already operational register of damages, which was launched during a Council of Europe summit in 2023. Some 80,000 claims have already been filed with the register, which is based in The Hague.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told a press conference the bloc would give one million euros ($1.1 million) to finance the commission's operation. An estimated 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) are needed overall.\n\nMany of the same countries have also backed a new international court, also under the umbrella of the Council of Europe, to prosecute senior Russian officials for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

    "description": "The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.",
    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia's nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber's two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine\" supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force's work would include \"operating inside Ukraine\" as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine's forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO's military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine's postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington. Seung Min Kim and Darlene Superville in Washington; Pietro De Cristofaro in Berlin; Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine; and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",

    "fullText": "BERLIN (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country’s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.\n\nZelenskyy sat down with U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Ukrainian leader posted pictures of the negotiating table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sitting next to him facing the U.S. delegation.\n\nResponding to journalists’ questions in audio clips on a WhatsApp group chat before the talks, Zelenskyy said that since the U.S. and some European nations had rejected Ukraine’s push to join NATO, Kyiv expects the West to offer a set of guarantees similar to those offered to the alliance members.\n\n“These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,” he said. “And this is already a compromise on our part.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly occupied by Russian forces.\n\nPutin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control among the key conditions for peace, a demand rejected by Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said that the U.S. had floated an idea for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk and create a demilitarized free economic zone there, a proposal he rejected as unworkable.\n\n“I do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?” he said. “If we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact, if we are talking about some economic zone and we believe that only a police mission should be there and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5–10 kilometers, for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?”\n\nZelenskyy described the issue as “very sensitive” and insisted on a freeze along the line of contact, saying that “today a fair possible option is we stand where we stand.”\n\nPutin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of the Donetsk region even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.\n\nUshakov warned that a search for compromise could take a long time, noting that the U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been “worsened” by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.\n\nSpeaking to Russian state TV in remarks broadcast Sunday, Ushakov said that “the contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive,\" warning that Moscow will “have very strong objections.”\n\nUshakov added that the territorial issue was actively discussed in Moscow when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. “The Americans know and understand our position,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday just before the talks with Trump’s envoys, thanking him on X for his support and adding that “we are coordinating closely and working together for the sake of our shared security.”\n\nMacron vowed on X that “France is, and will remain, at Ukraine’s side to build a robust and lasting peace — one that can guarantee Ukraine’s security and sovereignty, and that of Europe, over the long term.”\n\nMerz, who has spearheaded European efforts to support Ukraine alongside Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Saturday that “the decades of the ‘Pax Americana’ are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well.”\n\nHe warned that Putin's aim is “a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders.”\n\n“If Ukraine falls, he won’t stop,” Merz warned on Saturday during a party conference in Munich.\n\nPutin has denied plans to restore the Soviet Union or attack any European allies.\n\nRussia and Ukraine exchange aerial attacks\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia overnight launched ballistic missiles and 138 attack drones at Ukraine. The air force said 110 had been intercepted or downed, but missile and drone hits were recorded at six locations.\n\nZelenskyy said Sunday that hundreds of thousands of families were still without power in the south, east and northeast regions and work was continuing to restore electricity, heat and water to multiple regions following a large-scale attack the previous night.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said that in the past week, Russia had launched over 1,500 strike drones, nearly 900 guided aerial bombs and 46 missiles of various types at Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 235 Ukrainian drones late Saturday and early Sunday.\n\nIn the Belgorod region, a drone injured a man and set his house ablaze in the village of Yasnye Zori, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nUkrainian drones struck an oil depot in Uryupinsk in the Volgograd region, triggering a fire, according to regional Gov. Andrei Bocharov.\n\nIn the Krasnodar region, the Ukrainian drones attacked the town of Afipsky, where an oil refinery is located. Authorities said that explosions shattered windows in residential buildings, but didn’t report any damage to the refinery.\n\nCiobanu reported from Warsaw, Poland.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

According to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 159 countries have recognized Palestine. The vast majority of the international community believes that a two-state solution is the only way to end decades of conflict.\n\nNetanyahu's government has said the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas.\n\nHere are some global reactions to the Australia shooting:\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei condemned the attack: “Terrorism and the killing of people, wherever they occur, are unacceptable and must be condemned.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington strongly condemned the attack and that “Antisemitism has no place in this world.”\n\nKing Charles III said he was “appalled and saddened.” He also leads the Commonwealth, and the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said Herzog had reached out to the king in September warning of an “epidemic of antisemitism” in three Commonwealth countries: Britain, Canada and Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, police in London said they would step up security at Jewish sites.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack “has left me speechless” and added that “this is an attack on our shared values. We must stop this antisemitism, here in Germany and worldwide.”\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified and that “My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hannukah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness.”\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the “ghastly terrorist attack” and said that “we stand in solidarity with the people of Australia in this hour of grief.”\n\nThe organization's president, Ronald Lauder, said that “No community should ever fear ​coming together to celebrate its faith, traditions, or identity,” adding: “Make no mistake, this will not break us.\"\n\n\"I’m surrounded by antisemitic graffiti constantly. I think for our community in the east (of Sydney), and as a Christian, I just want to declare I stand with the people of Israel,” Anglican pastor Matt Graham told Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he had been conducting a service at the nearby Bondi Anglican Church when panicked people began entering to take shelter.",

    "fullText": "DOUANKARA, Mauritania (AP) — The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips. Her chest barely moved. Drops of fevered sweat trickled down her forehead as medical workers hurried around her, attaching an IV drip.\n\nIt was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly. The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.\n\nHer family said the 14-year-old had been raped by Russian fighters who burst into their tent in Mali two weeks earlier. The Russians were members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russia's defense ministry that replaced the Wagner mercenary group six months ago.\n\nMen, women and children have been sexually assaulted by all sides during Mali's decade-long conflict, the U.N. and aid workers say, with reports of gang rape and sexual slavery. But the real toll is hidden by a veil of shame that makes it difficult for women from conservative, patriarchal societies to seek help.\n\nThe silence that nearly killed the 14-year-old also hurts efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe AP learned of the alleged rape and four other alleged cases of sexual violence blamed on Africa Corps fighters, commonly described by Malians as the “white men,” while interviewing dozens of refugees at the border about other abuses such as beheadings and abductions.\n\nOther combatants in Mali have been blamed for sexual assaults. The head of a women’s health clinic in the Mopti area told the AP it had treated 28 women in the last six months who said they had been assaulted by militants with the al-Qaida affiliated JNIM, the most powerful armed group in Mali.\n\nThe silence among Malian refugees has been striking.\n\nIn eastern Congo, which for decades has faced violence from dozens of armed groups, “we didn’t have to look for people,” said Mirjam Molenaar, the medical team leader in the border area for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, who was stationed there last year. The women \"came in huge numbers.”\n\nIt's different here, she said: “People undergo these things and they live with it, and it shows in post-traumatic stress.\"\n\nThe aunt of the 14-year-old girl said the Africa Corps fighters marched everyone outside at gunpoint. The family couldn't understand what they wanted. The men made them watch as they tied up the girl’s uncle and cut off his head.\n\nThen two of the men took the 14-year-old into the tent as she tried to defend herself, and raped her. The family waited outside, unable to move.\n\n“We were so scared that we were not even able to scream anymore,” the aunt recalled, as her mother sobbed quietly next to her. She, like other women, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, and the AP does not name victims of rape unless they agree to be named.\n\nThe girl emerged over a half-hour later, looking terrified. Then she saw her uncle's body and screamed. She fainted. When she woke up, she had the eyes of someone “who was no longer there,” the aunt said.\n\nThe next morning, JNIM militants came and ordered the family to leave. They piled onto a donkey cart and set off toward the border. At any sound, they hid in the bushes, holding their breath.\n\nThe girl's condition deteriorated during the three-day journey. When they arrived in Mauritania, she collapsed.\n\nThe AP came across her lying on the ground in the courtyard of a local family. Her family said they had not taken her to a clinic because they had no money.\n\n“If you have nothing, how can you bring someone to a doctor?” the girl’s grandmother said between sobs. The AP took the family to a free clinic run by MSF. A doctor said the girl had signs of being raped.\n\nThe clinic had been functioning for barely a month and had seen three survivors of sexual violence, manager Elidje said.\n\n“We are convinced that there are many cases like this,\" she said. \"But so far, very few patients come forward to seek treatment because it’s still a taboo subject here. It really takes time and patience for these women to open up and confide in someone so they can receive care. They only come when things have already become complicated, like the case we saw today.”\n\nAs Elidje tried to save the girl's life, she asked the family to describe the incident. She did not speak Arabic and asked the local nurse to find out how many men carried out the assault. But the nurse was too ashamed to ask.\n\nScratch marks are part of story she could not tell\n\nThousands of new refugees from Mali, mostly women and children, have settled just inside Mauritania in recent weeks, in shelters made of fabric and branches. The nearest refugee camp is full, complicating efforts to treat and report sexual assaults.\n\nTwo recently arrived women discreetly pulled AP journalists aside, adjusting scarves over their faces. They said they had arrived a week ago after armed white men came to their village.\n\n“They took everything from us. They burned our houses. They killed our husbands,” one said. “But that’s not all they did. They tried to rape us.”\n\nThe men entered the house where she was by herself and undressed her, she said, adding that she defended herself “by the grace of Allah.”\n\nAs she spoke, the second woman started crying and trembling. She had scratch marks on her neck. She was not capable of telling her story.\n\n“We are still terrified by what we went through,” she said.\n\nSeparately, a third woman said that what the white men did to her in Mali last month when she was alone at home “stays between God and me.”\n\nA fourth said she watched several armed white men drag her 18-year-old daughter into their house. She fled and has not seen her daughter again.\n\nThe women declined the suggestion to speak with aid workers, some of whom are locals. They said they were not ready to talk about it with anyone else.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry did not respond to questions, but an information agency that the U.S. State Department has called part of the “Kremlin’s disinformation campaign” called the AP’s investigation into Africa Corps fake news.\n\nWagner has a legacy of sexual abuse\n\nAllegations of rapes and other sexual assaults were already occurring before Wagner transformed into Africa Corps.\n\nOne refugee told the AP she witnessed a mass rape in her village in March 2024.\n\n“The Wagner group burned seven men alive in front of us with gasoline.” she said. Then they gathered the women and raped them, she said, including her 70-year-old mother.\n\n“After my mother was raped, she couldn’t bear to live,” she said. Her mother died a month later.\n\nIn the worst-known case of sexual assault involving Russian fighters in Africa, the U.N. in a 2023 report said at least 58 women and girls had been raped or sexually assaulted in an attack on Moura village by Malian troops and others that witnesses described as “armed white men.\"\n\nIn response, Mali’s government expelled the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Since then, gathering accurate data on the ground about conflict-related sexual violence has become nearly impossible.\n\nThe AP interviewed five of the women from Moura, who now stay in a displacement camp. They said they had been blindfolded and raped for hours by several men.\n\nThree of the women said they hadn't spoken about it to anyone apart from aid workers. The other two dared to tell their husbands, months later.\n\n“I kept silent with my family for fear of being rejected or looked at differently. It’s shameful,” one said.\n\nThe 14-year-old whose family fled to Mauritania is recovering. She said she cannot remember anything since the attack. Her family and MSF said she is speaking to a psychiatrist — one of just six working in the country.\n\nAid workers are worried about others who never say a thing.\n\n“It seems that conflict over the years gets worse and worse and worse. There is less regard for human life, whether it’s men, women or children,” said MSF’s Molenaar, and broke into tears. “It’s a battle.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "description": "A fight over words like \"execution,\" \"manifesto\" and \"Faraday\" is the undercard bout at Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence-suppression hearing in NYC.",
    "fullText": "Yes, it's a fight over a backpack — how it was seized, how it was searched, and whether the gun and notebook found inside will be tossed or kept as knockout-blow evidence in a future murder trial.\n\nBut Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence suppression hearing, playing out for two weeks in a Manhattan courtroom, is more than that.\n\nThe serious legal battle features an often amusing undercard bout: repeated sparring over nothing more than the naming of things.\n\nWas UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shot on a Midtown sidewalk last year? Or was he \"executed?\"\n\nIs the red notebook found inside Mangione's backpack a \"manifesto,\" or a \"journal?\"\n\nAnd is the aluminum-lined pouch found in Mangione's backpack a \"Faraday bag,\" meant to block his cellphone from being tracked during a five-day manhunt? Or was the bag simply \"waterproof?\"\n\nIt all depends on who is standing at the courtroom's podium: lead defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo or top prosecutor Joel Seidemann.\n\nThese pretrial rhetorical rumbles foreshadow how intensely these two adversaries — seasoned legal veterans with decadeslong experience — will fight next year, at a yet-scheduled trial in the same state-level courtroom.\n\nThe temperament of the judge is also being previewed. NY Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro has alternated between seeming mildly irked and utterly unfazed as he's refereed these sporadic wars of words over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Move on,\" Carro has said when the prosecutor and defense lawyer complain about each other — like when Friedman Agnifilo stood up on Thursday to say of Seidemann, \"He wants to play the word 'manifesto' over and over and over again!\"\n\nCarro's relative calm has only wavered once, on Monday, after the prosecutor repeatedly referred to Thompson's murder as an \"execution.\"\n\n\"You testified you were aware of the New York City shooting?\" prior to the arrest, Friedman Agnifilo had asked the third Altoona, Pennsylvania, cop to take the stand. (Mangione was arrested in a McDonald's there five days after Thompson's December 4, 2024, shooting, after being spotted by customers.) \"You were aware it did not involve a bomb?\" she asked, scoring a point.\n\n\"Were you aware it involved a premeditated execution?\" Seidemann clapped back minutes later, visibly eager to take that point back.\n\nThe judge's voice was sharp as he sustained Friedman Agnifilo's objection. Soon afterward, she stood to complain about the prosecutor's repeated references to \"manifesto\" and \"the execution of Mr. Thompson.\"\n\n\"He certainly won't do that at trial,\" the judge warned.\n\n\"I'll bear that in mind, your honor,\" the prosecutor answered.\n\nA small \"Faraday bag,\" featuring a protective lining that blocks electronic signals, triggered an extended semantic skirmish on Tuesday.\n\nBoth the lawyer and the prosecutor were asking a lot of questions at the time, about this one little pouch. The size of a business envelope, it held an Apple cellphone, Mangione's passport, and a small wallet with a driver's license and three charge cards inside.\n\nIn questioning the officer who first pulled it out of the backpack, Friedman Agnifilo referred to the pouch as \"a black bag that has Velcro.\"\n\nShe also called it a \"waterproof bag,\" noting that other items in the backpack had been damp that day. (The same cop had testified that inside the backpack she'd found a gun clip filled with nine hollow-point rounds — wrapped in a pair of gray underwear that was \"soaking wet.\")\n\nWeren't electronics and a passport \"items that you'd want to keep dry?\" Friedman Agnifilo asked. \"Yes,\" the officer answered.\n\n\"Is that a Faraday bag or a waterproof bag?\" the prosecutor asked on his next turn at the podium, pointing to an image of the pouch.\n\n\"It's a Faraday bag,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"And how do you distinguish a Faraday bag from a waterproof bag?\" Seidemann pursued.\n\n\"This bag had an aluminum lining,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"If we can continue,\" he then said, turning toward the audience with a slight smile.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to conclude next week. The judge has yet to say when he will rule on the admissibility of the backpack and its contents.\n\nThe Baltimore native is challenging the admissibility of evidence in both his state and federal murder prosecutions. Trial dates have yet to be set in both cases.",

    "title": "The next generation of heirs is rewiring family offices — and triggering a talent war",
    "description": "Wealthy heirs are reshaping family offices around impact and innovation, but the talent to run them is scarce, a new IMD report says.",
    "fullText": "The next generation of leaders wants their family offices to look different from those run by their parents — and that shift is driving fierce competition for a new class of talent.\n\nA new report from IMD's Global Family Business Center and the Family Business Network, based on 186 survey responses and 65 interviews with family principals across six continents in the first two quarters of this year, found that family offices are rapidly evolving as younger heirs step into leadership roles.\n\nThe report said younger family members increasingly prioritize impact investing, sustainability, technological innovation, and diversity and inclusion — particularly in the advisors and specialists they choose to hire.\n\nAs a result, they seek advisors who can navigate these areas — and job listings have surged for individuals with these skills, including alternative investment analysts, ESG specialists, and chief information officers who can modernize systems and streamline operations.\n\nBut the supply of qualified candidates \"has not kept pace,\" the report warned.\n\nFamily offices require a blend of hard technical skills and softer traits — trustworthiness, discretion, emotional intelligence, and the ability to work inside complex family systems — that's rare even in top-tier finance.\n\nThis \"changing of the guard,\" the report said, has created an acute scarcity of talent and a \"highly competitive market for top-tier professionals.\"\n\nFamily offices are multiplying rapidly, with Deloitte estimating a 31% increase from 2019 to late 2024, as founders cash out and heirs prepare for a historic wealth transfer, according to the IMD's report.\n\n\"By and large, we can see that there just isn't enough talent available for the families and their family offices,\" Peter Vogel, one of the report's authors and Director of the IMD Global Family Business Center, told Business Insider.\n\nVogel, also a professor of family business and entrepreneurship, said that the first big hires are usually investment-focused — people with backgrounds in private equity, private debt, real estate, or venture capital.\n\nFamilies that care about sustainability or impact will add ESG (environmental, social, and governance) expertise and impact-metrics skills on top, he added.\n\nBeyond technical chops, Vogel said families increasingly look for candidates who bring emotional intelligence, trustworthiness, and experience handling family dynamics — qualities he described as essential but hard to find.\n\nBut even when families are willing to pay, the pitch isn't always as attractive as it looks.\n\n\"One of the big questions is, what is the value proposition for a top shot to join a family office?\" Vogel said.\n\nVogel said that for senior hires like CIOs or CEOs, family offices offer limited upward mobility: once you reach the top job, there's nowhere else to go except a larger family office.\n\nVogel added that while family-office compensation can be strong, it often falls short of the millions of dollars top performers can earn in big banks, private equity, or hedge funds — especially without co-investment or carried interest.\n\nMichael Kosnitzky, Co-Leader of Pillsbury's Private Client & Family Office practice, previously told Business Insider that family offices are increasingly structuring \"golden handcuffs\" — long-term incentive packages designed to make it costly or unattractive for executives to leave — and carried-interest-style deals to stop their CIOs and dealmakers from being poached by rival funds or other family offices.\n\nOn top of that, Vogel said, the market itself is opaque.\n\nThe term \"family office\" isn't regulated, and titles are vague, he said, which makes it harder to find talent because roles vary widely from one office to another, and there's no standard job description. Many professionals also don't publicly name the families they work for.\n\n\"There's no big, qualified database of people saying, 'hand up, I'm a family office person,'\" Vogel said.\n\nFor now, families are improvising: pulling trusted bankers into newly created offices, experimenting with incentive packages, and relying heavily on headhunters and word of mouth, he said.",

    "description": "The T-7 Red Hawk will teach pilots to fly fifth-gen aircraft like the F-22 and F-35, as well as the new B-21 stealth bomber and planned F-47.",
    "fullText": "US Air Force pilots have a new training aircraft, the T-7 Red Hawk, promising to prepare them to fly fifth-generation fighters, stealth bombers, and the US' planned sixth-generation fighter.\n\nThe first T-7 Red Hawk trainer, made by Boeing, arrived at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas this month. The new training aircraft will replace Northrop Grumman's T-38 Talon, which pilots have been training on for six decades. The Air Force no longer deems the trainer sufficient for preparing the service's pilots for future warfare. That's why replacing the outdated Talon has been on the Air Force's to-do list for years.\n\n\"The T-38 has been life-extended multiple times,\" said Brig. Gen. Matthew Leard, director of plans, program, requirements, and international Affairs for Air Education and Training Command, in a statement. \"There's an escalating cost of retaining the airplane and keeping it flyable,\" he said, adding that the plane \"is no longer aligned with current or future aircraft.\"\n\nIn 2023, the Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, reported the Air Force was relying on the aging T-38 as a new flight simulator was delayed by a decade and new training aircraft were being developed. The aircraft, the GAO said, \"is increasingly expensive to maintain and is no longer reflective of modern combat aircraft.\"\n\nThe Air Force sees the transition to the new T-7 Red Hawk as a fundamental shift in how pilots are trained for high-stress, modern air combat.\n\n\"From day one, students won't just be learning to fly,\" Maj. Gen. Gregory Kreuder, the 19th Air Force commander, said in a statement. They'll be learning to manage information, interpret data from advanced sensors, and make critical decisions in a complex environment, all from within the trainer.\"\n\n\"This aircraft,\" he said, \"enables us to close the gap between basic pilot training and the realities of fifth generation plus warfare, producing more capable, intuitive warfighters right out of the gate.\"\n\nThe new T-7 Red Hawk will teach pilots how to fly some of the most advanced aircraft the US has, like the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II stealth aircraft.\n\nAnd under the hood of the sleek, red-tailed trainer is a flexible open design that can be updated with new features as they arrive. The trainer will also prepare pilots to fly aircraft still in development and testing, such as the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber and the upcoming sixth-gen F-47, which is being built by Boeing.\n\nAlong with the T-7 Red Hawk, new ground and maintenance training systems will help pilots build skills and keep aircraft mission-ready. A live-virtual-constructive setup — which links real flights and simulators into the same scenarios — will let the Air Force update training with new threats, platforms, and weapons without needing a new aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force still has several steps to take before the T-7 Red Hawk becomes operational.\n\nThe jet is still in development, and both pilots and maintenance personnel will need training on the systems. Instructor pilots will fly it first, with students following after. The T-7 is expected to reach initial operational capability in August 2027, with 14 aircraft expected at the 99th Flying Training Squadron at Randolph Air Force Base later that year. Until then, pilots will train on the T-6 Texan II.\n\nOther Air Force bases, like Columbus in Mississippi, Laughlin in Texas, Vance in Oklahoma, and Sheppard in Texas, will get more T-7 Red Hawks in the following years.\n\n\"The aircraft delivery is the first physical representation of progress within the program,\" Leard said.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.\n\nUsing a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.\n\nEU Council President António Costa said European leaders had committed in October “to keep Russian assets immobilized until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused. Today we delivered on that commitment.”\n\nIt’s a key step that will allow EU leaders to work out at a summit next week how to use the tens of billions of euros in Russian Central Bank assets to underwrite a huge loan to help Ukraine meet its financial and military needs over the next two years.\n\n“Next step: securing Ukraine’s financial needs for 2026–27,” added Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit.\n\nThe move also prevents the assets, estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion), from being used in any negotiations to end the war without European approval.\n\nA 28-point plan drafted by U.S. and Russian envoys stipulated that the EU would release the frozen assets for use by Ukraine, Russia and the United States. That plan, which surfaced last month, was rejected by Ukraine and its backers in Europe.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision means that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds.”\n\nThe vast majority of the funds — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.\n\nThe money was frozen under sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over the war it launched on Feb. 24, 2022, but these sanctions must be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday’s decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe – said on social media that it means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”\n\n“The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote. He said that Hungary “will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”\n\nIn a letter to Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that “would include covering Ukraine’s military expenses for the coming years.”\n\nHe warned “that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardize U.S. peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\n\nBut the commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is opposed to the “reparations loan” plan. It says that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,” and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nRussia’s Central Bank, meanwhile, said on Friday that it has filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it says were caused when Moscow was barred from managing the assets. Euroclear declined to comment.\n\nThe Belgian clearing house has around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in Russia and it’s unclear what would happen to that money if the legal challenge or others like it succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Central Bank also described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”\n\nBut EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is “legally robust,” and that he expects Russia “to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law.”\n\nChris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Consultancy, said that the timing of the court action is “clearly linked” to the EU’s intention to use the frozen assets.\n\n“The Russian Central Bank is making clear that it will respond with legal actions against all countries involved in the decision to take the Russian money,” he said.\n\nFriday's EU decision came hours after Germany summoned the Russian ambassador in Berlin following allegations of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and interference in its elections.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nThe remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there.\n\nKupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.\n\nLess than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.\n\nMoscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant.\n\nHe told Kommersant “it’s entirely possible that there won’t be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”\n\nFor months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.\n\nSince Moscow’s 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.\n\nUkraine says its constitution doesn’t allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.\n\nIn October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.\n\nIn recent months, Russia’s army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.\n\nIts slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.\n\nUkrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard’s Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.\n\nFighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.\n\nZelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.\n\n“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine’s Ground Forces Day.\n\nRussian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.\n\nUkraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.\n\nIts Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.\n\nThe ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.\n\nRussia’s air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.\n\nUkraine’s southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia. Associated Press writer Stefanie Dazio in Berlin contributed to this report.",

Seth Magaziner brought the veteran, Sae Joon Park, to the hearing over Zoom after he was deported to Korea earlier this year\n\nMagaziner accused Noem of not knowing \"the difference between the good guys and the bad guys\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was challenged during a hearing today about her department's controversial deportation practices.\n\nNoem, 54, testified before the House on Thursday, Dec. 11, about national security threats, where she was questioned by a representative about the deportation of military veterans by the Trump administration.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, how many United States military veterans have you deported?\" Rep. Seth Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island, asked Noem during the hearing.\n\nWhen she replied, \"Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,\" Magaziner began to express his respect for military members as a man who had been sitting behind him stood and brought over a tablet featuring a veteran calling into the hearing over video.\n\n\"As Americans, we owe everything to those who have served our country in uniform, particularly those who have served in combat. Do you agree with that?\" Magaziner asked.\n\nNoem began to say, \"Sir, I believe that people that are in the United States that are citizens have legal status here—\" before Magaziner interrupted to introduce the video guest.\n\n\"Madame Secretary, we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park,\" Magaziner said. \"He is a United States Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989.\"\n\nMagaziner said Park — a Purple Heart recipient — had struggled with PTSD and substance abuse issues after his time in combat, and had been arrested in the '90s for \"minor drug offenses.\" NPR previously reported that Park was charged with possession of a controlled substance and bail jumping while battling an addiction to crack cocaine.\n\nPark has been sober for the last 14 years, the congressman told Noem, before saying, \"Earlier this year, you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn't lived in since he was 7 years old.\"\n\nMagaziner then asked Noem to join him in \"thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country.\"\n\nShe responded by saying she is \"grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws, and knows that our laws are important and every one of them needs to be enforced.\"\n\nWhen he pressed her about looking into Park's case, Noem said she \"absolutely\" would, but added, \"Our programs need to have integrity, as well.\"\n\nMagaziner continued with his questioning when he introduced a Navy veteran named Jim Brown who is married to a woman who came to the U.S. from Ireland and has lived in the country for 48 years, but has been in prison for the last four months.\n\n\"She did not come here illegally, and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks totaling $80 ten years ago,\" Magaziner said.\n\nNoem claimed it was not \"my prerogative, my latitude or my job to pick and choose which laws in this country get enforced,\" but Magaziner hit back by claiming she has \"broad discretion\" as DHS secretary. When asked, she said she would review the case of Brown's wife.\n\nThe congressman also introduced a veteran whose father, Narciso Barranco, had been targeted by immigration agents over the summer and punched in the the head. He asked Noem to consider offering parole to Barranco.\n\nMagaziner went on to criticize Noem, telling her, “There are many problems with your leadership, but the biggest problem is this: You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Go after the bad guys, go after the terrorists, do not go after veterans, Marines, children, United States citizens.”\n\nNoem allegedly left the hearing early, according to The Hill and The Washington Post, claiming she had to attend another meeting that had been canceled. Noem’s office told The Hill the secretary found out the meeting had been called off after leaving the witness table.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nNoem has come under fire during her tenure at DHS for her attention-grabbing deportation tactics. Earlier this month, she said on X that she had been discussing ramping up travel bans with President Donald Trump.\n\nNoem recommended a \"full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"\n\nHer Dec. 1 post came not long after Trump, 79, said his administration planned to \"permanently pause\" migration from \"Third World Countries.\" He did not identify countries by name or clarify how he would implement the immigration pause.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine would join the European Union as early as January 2027 under the latest US plan to end the war with Russia, a senior source familiar with the matter told AFP on Friday.\n\nThe complicated EU accession process usually takes years and requires a unanimous vote from all 27 members of the bloc, and some countries, most notably Hungary, have consistently voiced opposition to Ukraine joining.\n\nThe idea of a speedy accession is included in the latest version of a US-led plan to end the war, which would also see Ukraine cede land to Russia, and has triggered a diplomatic frenzy across Europe in recent weeks.\n\n\"It's stated there but it's a matter for negotiation, and the Americans support it,\" the senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, referring to the US plan.\n\nWashington has the leverage needed to convince leaders opposed to Ukraine's membership to change their stance, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists, including AFP, on Thursday.\n\n\"The United States can take steps to unblock our path to the European Union,\" he said, adding that \"the US president has various levers of influence and that this will have an effect on those who are currently blocking Ukraine.\"\n\nKyiv has long strived for EU membership and has been implementing reforms since a pro-European 2014 revolution but has struggled to eradicate endemic corruption -- a core prerequisite for joining the bloc.\n\nAfter completing a diplomatic tour across Europe last week, Zelensky was due in Berlin on Monday for more talks on the plan, full details of which have not been released.\n\nZelensky will discuss \"the status of peace negotiations in Ukraine\" with \"numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the EU and NATO,\" Berlin said.\n\nMoscow on Friday indicated it was suspicious about the efforts to amend the US plan, which it has largely been supportive of and heeded to most of its core demands.\n\n\"We have an impression that this version, which is being put forward for discussion, will be worsened,\" Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told the Kommersant business daily.\n\n\"It'll be a long process,\" he added, saying that Moscow had not seen an updated version of the plan since discussions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow last week.\n\nZelensky said Thursday that Washington wants only Ukraine, not Russia, to withdraw its troops from parts of the eastern Donetsk region, where a demilitarised \"free economic zone\" would be installed as a buffer between the two armies.\n\nRussia, which has the numerical advantage in manpower and weapons, has been grinding forward on the battlefield for months, notching up its quickest advance for a year in November.\n\nHowever on Friday, Ukraine claimed to have retaken two settlements near Kupiansk -- a strategically important city and a key railway hub in the northeast of the country.\n\nZelensky visited the troops near Kupiansk to congratulate them -- and recorded a video of himself on a road at the entrance to the southwest of the city.\n\nA Russian air strike damaged a Turkish-owned cargo vessel in Ukraine's Black Sea region of Odesa, Kyiv and the operator said Friday, triggering fresh calls from Ankara to halt strikes on port infrastructure.\n\nTurkey earlier warned of a \"worrying escalation\" in the Black Sea after Ukraine claimed naval drone attacks on Russia-linked tankers in the area.",

    "description": "A virtual horizon on your phone can reduce inner ear conflict.",
    "fullText": "I get really carsick if I try to read in a moving vehicle. And there's a reason for that: my eyes and my sense of movement are out of sync.\n\nAt least, that's according to the CDC, which states that motion sickness, \"happens when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\" Your inner ear is a sack of fluid that moves when you do, giving you an innate sense of movement. If you're in a car and watching the horizon, your senses are aligned. But if you're looking at your phone, your senses are confusing each other. It's similar to the reason VR games make some people feel sick.\n\nThe free Android app KineStop aims to help. The application overlays a transparent horizon, and a number of transparent dots, across your entire screen. The accelerometer on your phone is used to move these reference points as your phone moves, helping to reduce the conflict between your eyes and your inner ear. You can turn the feature on manually in the application or, if you prefer, you can set it up to turn on automatically when you're in a moving car.\n\nI tried it out, wondering if it would help with my carsickness, and it did—surprisingly well. Normally I can't read for more than a few minutes without feeling sick, but the KineStop app helped me do so for longer, without discomfort. I'm still not going to be able to read novels during a long road trip, mind you, but I can look up the next restaurant on a road trip without vomiting, and I call that a win.\n\nKineStop is totally free, though there's a $3.50 pro version that adds themed overlays, including one that makes it look like your phone is a half-empty beer. It's great to support a developer, but I also think the free version will work fine for most everyone.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Rains drenched Gaza’s tent camps and dropping temperatures chilled Palestinians huddling inside them Thursday as winter storm Byron descended on the war-battered territory, showing how two months of a ceasefire have failed to sufficiently address the spiraling humanitarian crisis there.\n\nFamilies found their possessions and food supplies soaked inside their tents. Children’s sandaled feet disappeared under opaque brown water that flooded the camps, running knee deep in some places. Dirt roads turned to mud. Piles of garbage and sewage cascaded like waterfalls.\n\n“We have been drowned. I don’t have clothes to wear and we have no mattresses left,” said Um Salman Abu Qenas, a displaced mother in a Khan Younis tent camp. She said that her family couldn't sleep the night before, because of the water in the tent.\n\nAid groups say not enough shelter materials are getting into Gaza during the truce. Figures recently released by Israel's military suggest it hasn't met the ceasefire stipulation of allowing 600 trucks of aid into Gaza a day, though Israel disputes that finding.\n\n“Cold, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments heighten the risk of illness and infection,” the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X. “This suffering could be prevented by unhindered humanitarian aid, including medical support and proper shelter.\"\n\nSabreen Qudeeh, also in the Khan Younis camp, in a squalid area known as Muwasi, said that her family woke up to rain leaking from their tent's ceiling and water from the street soaking their mattresses.\n\n“My little daughters were screaming,” she said.\n\nAhmad Abu Taha, also living in the camp, said there wasn't a tent that escaped the flooding. “Conditions are very bad, we have old people, displaced, and sick people inside this camp,” he said.\n\nFloods in south-central Israel trapped more than a dozen people in their cars, according to Hebrew media. Israel's rescue services, MDA, said that two young girls were slightly injured when a tree fell on their school.\n\nThe contrasting scenes with Gaza made clear how profoundly the Israel-Hamas war had damaged the territory, destroying the majority of homes. Gaza’s population of around 2 million is almost entirely displaced, and most people live in vast tent camps stretching along the coast, or set up among the shells of damaged buildings without adequate flooding infrastructure and with cesspits dug near tents as toilets.\n\nAt least three buildings in Gaza City already damaged by Israeli bombardment during the war partially collapsed under the rain, Palestinian Civil Defense said. It warned people not to stay inside damaged buildings, saying they too could fall down on top of them.\n\nThe agency also said that since the storm began, they have received more than 2,500 distress calls from people across Gaza whose tents and shelters were damaged.\n\nWith buckets and mops, Palestinians laboriously scooped water out of their tents.\n\nAliaa Bahtiti said her 8-year-old son \"was soaked overnight, and in the morning he had turned blue, sleeping on water.” Her tent floor had an inch of water on it “We cannot buy food, covers, towels, or sheets to sleep on.”\n\nBaraka Bhar was caring for her 3-month-old twins inside her tent as the rain poured outside. One of the twins has hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluids in the brain.\n\n“Our tents are worn out ... and they leak rain water,” she said. “We should not lose our children this winter.”\n\nAid groups say that Israel isn't allowing enough aid into Gaza to begin rebuilding the territory after years of war.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel agreed to comply with aid stipulations from an earlier January truce, which specified that it allow 600 trucks of aid each day into Gaza, It maintains it's doing so, but The Associated Press found that some of its own figures call that into question.\n\nThe January truce also specified that Israel let in a number of caravans and tents. No caravans have yet entered Gaza during the ceasefire, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli group advocating for Palestinians’ right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, said on Dec. 9 it had “lately\" let 260,000 tents and tarpaulins into Gaza and more than 1,500 trucks of blankets and warm clothing.\n\nShelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, sets the number lower. It says the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations have gotten 15,590 tents into Gaza since the truce began, and other countries have sent about 48,000. Many of the tents aren't properly insulated, it says.\n\nAmjad al-Shawa, Gaza chief of the Palestinian NGO Network, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that only a fraction of the 300,000 tents needed had entered Gaza. He said that Palestinians were in dire need of warmer winter clothes and accused Israel of blocking the entry of water pumps to help clear flooded shelters..\n\n\"All international sides should take the responsibility regarding conditions in Gaza,” he said. “There is real danger for people in Gaza at all levels.”\n\nKhaled Mashaal, a Hamas leader, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Gaza needs the rehabilitation of hospitals, the entry of heavy machinery to remove rubble, and the opening of the Rafah crossing — which remains closed after Israel said last week it would shortly open.\n\nCOGAT didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the claims that Israel wasn’t allowing water pumps or heavy machinery into Gaza\n\nAmnesty accuses Hamas of crimes against humanity\n\nAmnesty International said in a report released Thursday that Hamas and other militant groups committed crimes against humanity in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 173-page report, Amnesty pointed to what it found to be widespread and systematic killing of civilians in the attack, as well as torture, hostage-taking and sexual abuse.\n\nIn the attack, Hamas fighters and other militants rampaged through southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 others hostage. Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 70,300 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count. Last year, Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denied.\n\nAmnesty said it conducted interviews with 70 people, including 17 survivors of the attack and family members of some of those killed. It also reviewed hundreds of open-source videos and photos from the day of the attack.\n\nContrary to Hamas claims it was targeting the military, it said, the attack was intentionally “directed against a civilian population” and met international law standards for crimes against humanity.\n\nIt said sexual assaults were also committed, though it said it could not reach a conclusion on their “scope or scale.” It interviewed one man who testified he was raped by armed men at the Nova music festival, as well as a therapist who said she provided intensive treatment to three other survivors of rape.\n\nHamas condemned the report, saying it “echoed false claims” by Israel.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister spokesperson Oren Marmorstein derided the report in a posting on X, saying it took more than two years for Amnesty to address the attack “and even now its report falls far short of reflecting the full scope of Hamas’s horrific atrocities.”",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nTan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters.\n\nTan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company.\n\nMeta’s interest spurred Intel to ​make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion.\n\nMeta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.\n\nThe events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources.\n\nIntel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.\n\nIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a ‌venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.\n\nSince Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian brigade has released footage of one of its uncrewed ground vehicles opening fire on a Russian armored personnel carrier, offering a rare glimpse at the emerging technology in action.\n\nThe 5th Separate Assault Brigade said on Wednesday that it deployed a Droid TW 12.7 — a remotely operated tracked system developed by a Ukrainian defense tech company — on a road deemed likely to be a route for advancing Russian troops.\n\nThe brigade said that the ground-based drone later encountered a Russian MT-LB, a lightly armored fighting vehicle often used to transport infantry.\n\nThermal footage filmed at night from the uncrewed ground vehicle, or UGV, shows it opening fire on the vehicle, its operator swerving a targeting reticle across the MT-LB's front.\n\nBusiness Insider could neither independently verify when nor where the footage was filmed.\n\nThe Droid TW 12.7 is equipped with an M2 Browning machine gun that fires .50 caliber rounds, which would typically pierce an MT-LB's armor.\n\nThe 5th Brigade said it used armor-piercing incendiary rounds for the mission.\n\nSparks fly from the armored vehicle's chassis as it slows to a crawl and drifts in front of the UGV, which continues firing point-blank.\n\n\"The 12.7 mm bullets punch through the MT-LB's side, striking the crew and onboard systems,\" a narrator said in the 5th Brigade's video, referring to the metric measurement for .50 caliber bullets.\n\nThe MT-LB appears to be aimlessly crawling past the drone, indicating that its driver is incapacitated or its controls are damaged.\n\nThe UGV then pivots and begins firing on the rear of the MT-LB, \"killing the infantry in the troop compartment,\" the narrator said.\n\nThe 5th Brigade said that it found in the morning that the MT-LB crew and their passengers were \"completely wiped out,\" publishing short clips of the aftermath shot by a first-person-view aerial drone.\n\nWednesday's published footage provides insight into how UGVs are increasingly used on the battlefield in Ukraine, where troops on both sides are experimenting with ground drones to perform missions that human soldiers must otherwise conduct.\n\nWhile official statistics show that uncrewed aerial vehicles still dominated the drone warfare space last month, the spread of UGVs offers a possible future where Kyiv can rely on remotely operated systems for ground operations instead of risking its troops.\n\nThis year, Ukraine said that it aims to manufacture and deploy at least 15,000 UGVs across the battlefield.\n\nUkrainian and Russian teams have developed hundreds of such systems, ranging from buggies that can ferry provisions near the front lines to trucks outfitted with remotely operated machine guns.\n\nThe 5th brigade and DevDroid, the company that makes the Droid TW 12.7, did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "World War II wasn’t just fought by men and women on the front lines, it was also defined by the machines they rode, drove, and sailed into history. From towering cannons that shook the earth to massive battleships that seemed unsinkable, these vehicles weren’t just tools of war, they were icons of an era.\n\nThey carried with them the hopes of nations, the fears of enemies, and the awe of anyone who ever laid eyes on them. Today, long after their thunder has faded, these machines remain unforgettable, living on in movies, documentaries, and the collective memory of a world that witnessed the most intense conflict in history.\n\nWe’ve gathered a dozen of the most iconic, the ones that left the biggest dents not just in the battlefield, but in the imagination of generations.\n\nDuring World War II, the Germans unveiled one of the most jaw-dropping superweapons ever constructed: the Schwerer Gustav. This massive railway gun wasn’t just a piece of artillery; it was a rolling symbol of intimidation and ambition. Imagine a weapon so large it had to be transported in pieces, assembled on specially laid tracks, and required a small army of men just to operate.\n\nIts sheer presence turned heads wherever it was moved, a physical reminder of how far nations were willing to push the limits of engineering in the pursuit of victory. The Gustav wasn’t practical in the traditional sense; it was slow to move, exposed to air attack, and required enormous logistical support, but it did manage to fire upon fortified positions with shells the size of small cars. When it thundered, the earth shook, and even those far from the battlefield could feel its echo.\n\nAccording to History.com, the Japanese battleship Yamato has become a near-legend of World War II, a floating fortress that seemed almost too big to be real. Launched as the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Yamato was designed to outgun anything that floated, carrying massive guns that could rain destruction over distances unimaginable for most ships of the time.\n\nBut its story is just as much about symbolism as it is about firepower. Japan built Yamato as a statement, a declaration that it would never be overshadowed on the high seas. When it sailed, it carried the weight of a nation’s pride, and its silhouette on the horizon inspired awe and dread in equal measure. Life aboard the ship was like living inside a steel city, and sailors felt both honored and burdened to serve on what was considered the ultimate warship. Yet Yamato’s greatness was undercut by the changing tides of war, where air power proved deadlier than naval guns.\n\nThe German battleship Bismarck was the terror of the Atlantic, a warship that embodied Germany’s determination to dominate the seas. When it set out, Allied sailors whispered its name with dread, knowing its guns could sink even the strongest battleships.\n\nIts most infamous moment came when it destroyed HMS Hood, Britain’s pride, in a clash that shocked the world. But this triumph only fueled the Allies’ obsession with bringing Bismarck down, sparking one of the most relentless hunts in naval history. The chase ended with the Bismarck crippled and sunk, a dramatic downfall that proved even legends could be cornered.\n\nThe Tiger I was more than just a tank; it was a monster of steel that rolled into battle like something out of a nightmare. German crews felt nearly unstoppable inside their armor, and Allied soldiers often spoke of Tigers with a mix of fear and respect.\n\nAlthough not the most numerous tank of the war, it became a symbol of German engineering and battlefield dominance. Its reputation was so fearsome that sometimes troops believed Tigers were present even when they weren’t. Stories of its invincibility spread faster than the tanks themselves, creating an aura that magnified its true impact.\n\nThe American Sherman tank wasn’t the most powerful or flashy, but it became the backbone of Allied ground forces. What made the Sherman iconic wasn’t unmatched strength, but its reliability and sheer numbers.\n\nThese tanks rolled across Europe in endless waves, a constant presence that wore down German defenses. Soldiers trusted the Sherman to get them where they needed to go, even if it wasn’t invincible against heavier armor. Its role in supporting infantry and keeping pressure on enemy positions was vital. The Sherman also carried symbolic weight as a machine that embodied America’s industrial might, producing vehicles faster than the enemy could destroy them.\n\nThe Soviet T-34 is often hailed as the tank that saved Russia, a machine built for resilience above all else. It was designed to fight in mud, snow, and harsh conditions that would have crippled more delicate machines.\n\nSoviet crews praised its toughness and mobility, and German soldiers learned to fear its sudden appearances. Unlike the Tigers, the T-34 wasn’t about prestige, it was about practicality and overwhelming numbers. It became the spearhead of massive offensives, pushing the Red Army deeper into enemy lines. Its silhouette is instantly recognizable, embodying the Soviet determination to endure and strike back.\n\nNicknamed “The Big E,” the USS Enterprise was the heart of the U.S. Navy’s carrier force during World War II. It fought in nearly every major battle in the Pacific, becoming a constant thorn in Japan’s side.\n\nSailors considered it a lucky ship, as it survived countless close calls and kept coming back stronger. Its aircraft struck decisive blows at battles like Midway, proving the aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the true ruler of the seas. Enterprise carried not just planes, but the morale of the Navy itself, a floating symbol of American resilience.\n\nThe British Lancaster bomber was the heavy hitter of the Royal Air Force, a night predator that struck deep into enemy territory. With its long wings and bomb bays, it could carry massive payloads and was trusted for the most dangerous missions.\n\nCrews often flew under moonlight and cloud cover, facing flak and fighters while keeping steady toward their targets. Perhaps its most famous mission was the daring “Dambusters” raid, which became a legend of ingenuity and courage. For many, the Lancaster represented Britain’s determination to hit back despite heavy losses.\n\nThe humble Jeep may not look as glamorous as a battleship or bomber, but it became one of the most beloved vehicles of the war. It was everywhere, carrying troops, hauling supplies, even serving as makeshift ambulances.\n\nSoldiers adored it for its toughness and simplicity, able to keep running through mud, sand, and rough terrain. The Jeep wasn’t about firepower, but about mobility, giving armies the ability to move fast and adapt. Its squat, boxy shape became instantly recognizable wherever Allied forces went.\n\nWhile not as intimidating as the Tiger, the Panzer IV was the true workhorse of Germany’s armored divisions. It fought in every theater of the war, proving versatile and adaptable to countless roles.\n\nGerman commanders relied on it heavily, knowing they could field it in large numbers. Its reputation wasn’t built on invincibility, but on consistency; it was always there, pushing the front lines forward. For Allied troops, facing a Panzer IV meant dealing with a determined and capable opponent.\n\nFew aircraft of World War II were as infamous as the Stuka dive bomber, its screaming sirens designed to terrify those below. German propaganda made the Stuka into a symbol of Blitzkrieg, a machine that delivered both destruction and dread.\n\nIts steep dive attacks were precise and shocking, leaving soldiers scrambling for cover. Early in the war, it seemed unstoppable, carving paths for advancing German forces. But as the skies grew more dangerous with Allied fighters, the Stuka became vulnerable.\n\nThe Soviet Katyusha rocket launcher was nicknamed “Stalin’s Organ” for the howling sound it made when firing. Mounted on trucks, it unleashed barrages of rockets that blanketed enemy positions in chaos.\n\nSoldiers described the experience as terrifying, both for those launching and those receiving the fire. Unlike traditional artillery, Katyushas could quickly move, strike, and vanish before counterattacks. Their power wasn’t in precision but in overwhelming force that rattled entire sectors.\n\nThe war ended generations ago, but the silhouettes of these machines are still etched in our minds. Whether it was the terrifying scream of a Stuka diving, the steady rumble of a Sherman column, or the towering presence of a battleship at sea, each one told a story larger than life.\n\nThese vehicles were characters in the grand part of history, and their stories remind us how innovation, ambition, and courage collided in a time of global upheaval. Today, we look back not to glorify war, but to understand how these machines became lasting legends. They are reminders of humanity’s power to build, to endure, and to remember. The steel has rusted, but the legends live on.",

    "fullText": "\"Germany invading Britain is always the funniest one to me. They could have smashed the RAF into oblivion and still not been able to invade. They quite literally did not have the boats to make a contested large-scale landing. They were gonna try and use river barges to do it. Good luck with that.\"\n\n\"Some of my countrymen even suggest that it would have been better if we were fully colonized by the Japanese, believing it would have made the people more disciplined. Others still hold on to the Japanese propaganda of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' or 'Asia for the Asians.'\"\n\n\"The really interesting thing about this idea is that it's come in since the war. In the war, with people from the political cartoonists to even Churchill himself in his most famous speech, brought up the fact that we, the British, were supported massively by the Empire.\"\n\n\"The American submarine campaign completely crippled, then outright suffocated Japan, dropping their shipping tonnage to only a fraction of what it once was by the end of the war, whereas U-boat crews were annihilated with a casualty rate of around 75%, atrocious and irreplaceable losses which led to the Kriegsmarine being a complete nonfactor in the war by 1944.\"\n\n\"The Germans invaded the USSR with more horses than trucks.\"\n\nHulton Archive / Getty Images, Bettmann / Getty Images\n\n\"For those who don't know, the British claimed carrots were one of the reasons German planes got shot down at night. It was, in reality, the invention and use of radar.\"\n\n\"The Sherman tank had one of the highest crew survival rates at the time as well. For example, American tanks had spring-loaded hatches, whereas German tanks didn't, meaning you had to open the hatch using brute force and sheer strength alone, something you don't want to do if you're wounded and trying to escape a burning tank.\"\n\n\"I was going to add that one. But I will say, the Soviets highly depended on American lend-lease early on, and I'm not convinced they beat back the Germans without that help.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally, this is true, though. American aid is essentially what won the war. Britain would never have been defeated, but Britain wouldn't have ever gone on any meaningful offensive without American aid and support. The USSR needed American aid to survive. Whilst the USSR did the heavy lifting in terms of casualties, it was the Western Allies who destroyed the means of German production.

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "fullText": "Ground drones are growing more popular on Ukraine's front lines, but they're still vastly overshadowed by the small aerial drones made famous in the war.\n\nIn November, uncrewed ground vehicles accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nUsage numbers were announced on Tuesday by Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, as he gave a statement on the war situation this winter.\n\n\"At the current stage of the war, it is unmanned aerial vehicles that provide about 60% of all strikes on enemy targets,\" Syrskyi wrote.\n\nThe military chief said that in November alone, Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, carried out over 304,000 missions, striking or destroying roughly 81,500 targets.\n\n\"Over the past six months, this indicator has been constantly growing,\" Syrskyi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs, carried out 2,000 missions in the same timeframe, he said.\n\nThe statistics underscore just how aerial drones continue to dominate the battlefield in Ukraine. UGVs, an emerging technology, are still finding their footing in the war as Kyiv moves to integrate them at a wider scale among its military units.\n\nAmid the push, dozens of Ukrainian companies and units have been debuting their own UGVs, which can range from miniature buggies to full-size trucks mounted with remote machine gun turrets.\n\nThe ground drones are particularly useful because they can perform dangerous frontline missions that human soldiers would otherwise be required to carry out. Ukrainians are building them to serve a variety of purposes, from direct assaults and mine-clearing to monitoring roads and delivering frontline supplies.\n\nSome units have begun using aerial and ground systems in tandem, such as troops in Pokrovsk who used a UGV to spot incoming Russian vehicles through fog and later attacked with exploding drones.\n\nRussia has also been pioneering new drones, including UGVs for logistics and rocket artillery. On the aerial front, the Kremlin's forces were the first to introduce unjammable, fiber-optic drones that are now proliferating on the battlefield.\n\nThis year, Moscow has repeatedly been reported to be more readily integrating drone warfare into its ranks, scaling up mass production, forming official drone units, and creating new warfighting doctrine after observing Ukrainian tactics.\n\nSyrskyi wrote that Russia had, at one point, reached a \"period of a certain parity\" with Ukraine in the use of first-person-view drones, or the small hobby drones souped up to fly explosives into targets.\n\n\"As reported by our intelligence bodies, the enemy seeks to reach monthly deliveries of up to half a million FPV drones to its troops,\" he wrote.\n\nNow, however, Syrskyi claimed that Ukraine has recently surpassed Russia in first-person-view drone usage.\n\n\"The Ukrainian response must be asymmetric and effective: strengthening the fight against enemy drones and destroying the infrastructure of the enemy's unmanned forces units,\" he added.\n\nSyrskyi's statement offered a grim recap of the war in recent months, saying that Ukraine's forces have \"faced some of the most serious challenges since the beginning of the full-scale war.\"\n\nBoth civilians and soldiers in the country must soon grapple with another brutal winter, as temperatures are expected to consistently drop below freezing in January and February. Russia has been targeting local energy grids, disrupting Ukraine's access to reliable heating.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "The fight between Netflix and Paramount over who will buy Warner Bros. is heating up. Here's what markets are thinking about the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "A bidding war has broken out over one of America's most iconic media companies, and investors in the three firms involved are mixed on the prospect of where it'll all shake out.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery have climbed on the back of a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance to acquire the film and television company, but they're still slightly below the competing bid from Netflix, which was announced as the winner of the sale process last Friday.\n\nParamount on Monday made an all-cash offer worth $30 a share to acquire Warner Bros. and its film studio and streaming services.\n\nIt's unclear which way Warner Bros. will go. The company's board of directors said on Monday that it wasn't changing its recommendation regarding its agreement with Netflix, but would review Paramount's offer over the next two weeks. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMarkets, though, are flashing some clues about what investors think might happen next. Here's what to watch.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose to $27.70 on Tuesday, just below Netflix's offer of $27.75 a share.\n\nIf the stock were to surpass that level, that could be a sign investors expect Warner Bros. to go with Paramount's offer, or that they expect Netflix to put together a better offer, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I would say that there's a combination of both of those things probably in play right now,\" Hogan said of investors pricing in both scenarios, though he noted that trading activity in Warner Bros. Discovery shares may also be reflecting uncertainty among investors as Paramount revealed its hostile bid on Monday.\n\nThere's also the issue of regulatory approval, which could explain the slight discount in Warner Bros. Discovery stock to Netflix's offer price. Comments from Donald Trump on Monday suggested Netflix's ownership of Warner Bros. could draw scrutiny from the administration.\n\nIn a statement after it unveiled its offer, Paramount said its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would offer shareholders around $18 billion \n\nNetflix stock is down 7% since last Thursday's close, with shares dropping through Friday's session as investors digested the news that the media giant would acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business.\n\nInvestors rarely reward the acquirer in a large M&A deal like this, and it appears they're also not thrilled about the prospect of a fierce bidding war.\n\nNetflix stock continued to slide through Monday's session on news of Paramount's competing bid, and dipped again on Tuesday. The streaming platform has agreed to pay Warner Bros. $5.8 billion if its deal doesn't go through.\n\nShares of Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, jumped on Monday on enthusiasm for a potential deal, but the stock slipped 3% on Tuesday.\n\nBettors don't see Paramount's hostile bid going through with ease. While Paramount has edged up slightly over Netflix on some open bets on Polymarket, other wagers have its chances of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery by mid-2026 at less than 50%.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors see a 43% chance Paramount will be the winning bid, compared to a 39% chance priced in for Netflix.\n\nOn Kalshi, the odds that Paramount will win are about 50-50.",

Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.",
    "fullText": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — One by one, the soldiers squeezed through a narrow entrance to a tunnel in southern Gaza. Inside a dark hallway, some bowed their heads to avoid hitting the low ceiling, while watching their step as they walked over or around jagged concrete, crushed plastic bottles and tattered mattresses.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military took journalists into Rafah — the city at Gaza's southernmost point that troops seized last year and largely flattened — as the 2-month-old Israel-Hamas ceasefire reaches a critical point. Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.\n\nSoldiers escorted journalists inside a tunnel, which they said was one of Hamas' most significant and complex underground routes, connecting cities in the embattled territory and used by top Hamas commanders. Israel said Hamas had kept the body of a hostage in the underground passage: Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old soldier who was killed in Gaza more than a decade ago and whose remains had been held there.\n\nHamas returned Goldin's body last month as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the war triggered by the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds taken hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says roughly half the dead have been women and children.\n\nIsrael and Hamas are on the cusp of finishing the first phase of the truce, which mandated the return of all hostages, living and dead, in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel. The body of just one more hostage remains to be returned.\n\nMediators warn the second phase will be far more challenging since it includes thornier issues, such as disarming Hamas and Israel’s withdrawal from the strip. Israel currently controls more than half of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to travel to Washington this month to discuss those next steps with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nPiles of rubble line Rafah's roads\n\nLast year, Israel launched a major operation in Rafah, where many Palestinians had sought refuge from offensives elsewhere. Heavy fighting left much of the city in ruins and displaced nearly one million Palestinians. This year, when the military largely had control of the city, it systematically demolished most of the buildings that remained standing, according to satellite photos.\n\nTroops also took control of and shut the vital Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only gateway to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel.\n\nIsrael said Rafah was Hamas’ last major stronghold and key to dismantling the group’s military capabilities, a major war aim.\n\nOn the drive around Rafah on Monday, towers of mangled concrete, wires and twisted metal lined the roads, with few buildings still standing and none unscathed. Remnants of people's lives were scattered the ground: a foam mattress, towels and a book explaining the Quran.\n\nLast week, Israel said it was ready to reopen the Rafah crossing but only for people to leave the strip. Egypt and many Palestinians fear that once people leave, they won't be allowed to return. They say Israel is obligated to open the crossing in both directions.\n\nIsrael has said that entry into Gaza would not be permitted until Israel receives all hostages remaining in the strip.\n\nThe tunnel that journalists were escorted through runs beneath what was once a densely populated residential neighborhood, under a United Nations compound and mosques. Today, Rafah is a ghost town. Underground, journalists picked their way around dangling cables and uneven concrete slabs covered in sand.\n\nThe army says the tunnel is more than 7 kilometers (4 miles) long and up to 25 meters (82 feet) deep and was used for storing weapons as well as long-term stays. It said top Hamas commanders were there during the war, including Mohammed Sinwar — who was believed to have run Hamas’ armed wing and was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has said it has killed both of them.\n\n“What we see right here is a perfect example of what Hamas did with all the money and the equipment that was brought into Gaza throughout the years,\" said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. \"Hamas took it and built an incredible city underground for the purposes of terror and holding bodies of hostages.”\n\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of siphoning off money for military purposes. While Hamas says the Palestinians are an occupied people and have a right to resist, the group also has a civilian arm and ran a government that provided services such as health care, a police force and education.\n\nThe army hasn’t decided what to do with the tunnel. It could seal it with concrete, explode it or hold it for intelligence purposes among other options.\n\nSince the ceasefire began, three soldiers have been killed in clashes with about 200 Hamas militants that Israeli and Egyptian officials say remain underground in Israeli-held territory.\n\nHamas has said communication with its remaining units in Rafah has been cut off for months and that it was not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of repeated violations of the deal during the first phase. Israel has accused Hamas of dragging out the hostage returns, while Palestinian health officials say over 370 Palestinians have been killed in continued Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was submitted for review by Israel’s military censor, which made no changes.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",
