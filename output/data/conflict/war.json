    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "fullText": "Former Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely nuts on President Donald Trump in a new interview, branding his Make America Great Again movement a “big lie” and accusing the president of ignoring U.S. citizens so that he can focus on waging “war on behalf of Israel.”\n\nThe ex-lawmaker shared her eyebrow-raising thoughts in an interview with political commentator Kim Iversen on YouTube on Thursday.\n\n“MAGA is — I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people,” Greene said.\n\nShe said Trump has completely turned on his base and is more worried about serving the “big big donors” who send money to his PACs and have pitched in for his new ballroom.\n\n“Those are the people that get the special favors, the government contracts, they get the pardons,” Greene said. “And it’s the foreign countries that are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.”\n\nGreene then accused the president of caring more about Iran than what’s going on in the USA.\n\n“I’m sorry, we’ve got civil war practically breaking out in Minnesota, can we not care about that?” she said.\n\nGreene then moved to bashing Israel, which she said Trump is fixated on. She accused him of overlooking “murdered” Gazans so that he can eventually build a new Trump hotel.\n\n“We’re seeing war on behalf of Israel,” Greene fumed. “We’re seeing the people in Gaza — innocent people in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of them completely murdered, so that they can build some new real estate development and money can pour in and everyone can get rich there in New Gaza.”\n\nHer comments come a few weeks after Greene resigned from Congress. She announced she was leaving public office last fall amid her feud with Trump, which largely stemmed from her accusing the president of not moving fast enough to release files on dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump in return gave her the nickname Marjorie “Traitor” Greene and said his former ally had “some sort of act going on.”\n\nWatch via The Kim Iversen Show.\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Bluntly Declares MAGA ‘Was All a Lie’ in Scalding Take on Trump’s GOP first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

    "fullText": "(refiles to fix hyperlinks in paragraph 8, 14)\n\nDUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's leadership warned of a regional conflict on Sunday if the U.S. were to attack it, stoking the tension between Washington and Tehran, and it ​designated EU armies as \"terrorist groups\" in a retaliatory move.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its naval presence in the ‌Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.\n\nDespite the ‌standoff between Iran's clerical rulers and the Trump administration, both sides have signalled they are ready to resume talks, and regional allies such as Turkey have sought de-escalation.\n\nAn Iranian official denied an earlier report by state-run Press TV that the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces would carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and Monday, telling Reuters they have no such plan and the media ⁠reports are wrong.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‌was quoted on state media as saying that although Trump says he has sent ships to the region, \"the Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred ‍by these threats\".\n\n\"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in ​the region, raising the risk of war after Iran's deadly crackdown in January on nationwide protests against Iranian leadership.\n\nTrump was weighing ‌options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces, Reuters has reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday Trump told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.\n\nTrump also said: \"I hope they negotiate something acceptable. You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

    "description": "Ukraine is showing how much drones can change the battle. But a British unit going all-in on them said much about war remains unchanged.",
    "fullText": "A British military unit that is leaning heavily into drones says that even though the technology may be the future of war, it probably won't fundamentally change most of infantry life as it is now, at least not anytime soon.\n\nThe Irish Guards, an elite infantry regiment within the British Army, have been preparing intensively to operate with drones after watching the heavy drone use in Ukraine and receiving advice from Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nBut Lt. Col Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of its 1st Battalion, told Business Insider that he believes most of an infantryman's job likely won't change even as drone technology proliferates.\n\n\"To me, it feels like 80% of the job of an infantryman is exactly the same and probably exactly the same as it was in a Napoleonic era,\" he said. \"You need to be fit. You need to be strong and robust. You need to be able to survive in the field. You need to be able to dig a hole.\"\n\n\"That hasn't changed,\" he said. \"I doubt it's going to change for a while longer.\"\n\nHe said that land warfare and infantry combat tend to be \"regressive,\" which is to say \"it doesn't matter how much technology you throw into the field, it doesn't matter how supremely trained your troops are. Sooner or later it ends up as two blokes in a muddy hole, slugging it out with a billhook or a spade.\"\n\n\"Once the tank's gone, you just regress to the next type of technology,\" he said — and eventually to soldiers on foot. \"So I don't think a huge majority of the job has changed.\"\n\nThat continuity, Irwin-Clark said, is reassuring rather than limiting. It means new technology can be layered onto an existing foundation rather than replacing it.\n\nStill, his unit is heavily embracing drones, driven by lessons from Ukraine and direct Ukrainian input.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. It has also created a \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones using tech like 3D printing, a technology it adopted on Ukrainian advice. It now uses drones in its exercises and has created a drone obstacle course for soldiers to train on.\n\nThe British officer isn't alone in his thinking on the impact of drones on war and the infantry.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, director of the US Army's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course designed to help the service catch up on drone warfare, told Business Insider that \"yes, warfare, the tools of warfare are changing, but the fundamentals of warfare have not changed.\"\n\nDrones, she said, are \"just another tool with which to combat specific types of missions, but not necessarily all missions,\" and other weaponry that the US Army has had for much longer may still be able to accomplish missions better than drones can.\n\nShe said she wants soldiers to view drones \"as a tool with which to accomplish a mission, but it may not be the tool given a certain mission set.\"\n\nGen. James Rainey, the former head of Army Futures Command, said in 2024 that technology like drones was having a majorly disruptive effect on land warfare and was something the US needed to get ahead of, but he also said that war will \"always be a human endeavor.\"\n\nDrones may not dominate future Western wars as they do in Ukraine — where shortages forced heavy reliance on them — but NATO militaries are still investing in drones and training to ensure they're ready to use them where they make sense.\n\nEven though he doesn't see much of infantry life changing, Irwin-Clark still described drones as being part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nHe said that what surprised him most was how quickly his battalion's members picked up the technology.\n\n\"Everything else that you learned in the army is a sort of quite laborious process of fixed lessons, right?\" he said. He said that things are done by the book, because those styles of warfare have been around for so long that \"there is literally a book.\"\n\nAfter 20 years in the army, he was used to a more formulaic approach to training. But with drone warfare, \"you can't do that because the text's changing all the time and the types of drones are changing all the time.\" He was fearful as a result that it would take quite a while for the battalion to get it. Instead, he was \"pretty blown away\" by how quickly soldiers were confidently flying using drones.\n\nHe said that the men and women in the battalion \"are incredible and can pick that up really quickly. They're really adaptable, and they are really tech savvy.\"",

    "fullText": "Hamburger chains dominated the fast-food sector in the 1980s and '90s after the \"burger wars\" launched among McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.\n\nThe burger wars transitioned into an original chicken sandwich war, also in the 1980s, among the same three rivals. It was revived in the new millennium with Popeyes' launch of its chicken sandwich in August 2019.\n\nRival Chick-fil-A countered Popeyes' new sandwich with a statement on Twitter that its sandwich was the original, introduced in 1964, and fast-food chains everywhere began introducing or reintroducing chicken sandwiches.\n\nWith all of these chicken sandwiches launching, fried chicken restaurants became the most popular concept in fast food.\n\nFried chicken dining chains are likely to remain the most popular subsector of the fast-food industry in 2026, if the concept continues the trend it set over the last year.\n\nTraffic to chicken concepts rose 3% in the year ending September 2025, while all concepts dropped 1% compared to the previous year, according to market research firm Circana, as reported by Fast Company.\n\nThe variety of chicken options offered, such as chicken pieces, chicken fingers, or chicken sandwiches, and how consumers enjoy their choices, may contribute to the continued popularity of the concept, an expert says.\n\n“This is due to the experiences the brands are creating as well as the variety of chicken and how you can enjoy it,” industry expert Reilly Newman of Motif Brands told The Food Institute. “This comes to no surprise, as the experience economy has been taking root across the globe.\n\n“Chicken allows for (ample) customization, sauces, and forms, depending on the buyer’s preferences,” Newman said.\n\nNot every fast-food chicken restaurant benefited from increased traffic in 2025, as some operators suffered financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy filings.\n\nA bankrupt operator of more than 130 Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen franchise restaurants has closed 17 underperforming locations in Florida and Georgia and filed a motion to reject all of the stores' leases.\n\nThe franchisee, Sailormen Inc., which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami to reject the leases after closing eight locations on Jan. 19, five locations on Jan. 20, and four locations on Jan. 22, according to court papers.\n\nThe debtor asserts that the leases should be rejected as of the petition date, since the restaurants were closed within one week of the petition date and before the hearing on the debtor's first-day motions.",

    "title": "Russia's Oil Revenue, the Lifeblood of Its War Machine, Is Plummeting",
    "description": "The new reality has forced the Kremlin to raise taxes and increase debt, and hovers over peace talks with Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "As Russia holds direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, the Kremlin’s most potent fuel for the war, oil revenue, is under mounting strain.\n\nThe price of Russian oil, the country’s primary export, has declined under the weight of surging global supplies and Western sanctions related to the war. Last year, Russia’s oil and gas revenue fell by almost a quarter, according to the Finance Ministry. The Kremlin is resorting to tax increases and deficit spending to bridge the gap.\n\nSo far, there is little sign that the economic strains, and any discontent they generate among business leaders and the public, will be enough to change President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculations on the war. Trilateral negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States are set to continue on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut with the economy stagnating and the Kremlin reaching the limit of what it can squeeze from it, the Russian people will have to bear more of the burden of a war whose costs exceed about $170 billion a year.\n\n“This situation is manageable,” said Yevgeny Nadorshin, an economist in Moscow who advises companies and banks. “But no one is comfortable with that.”\n\nThroughout his decades-long rule, Mr. Putin has taken pride in the stability he has brought to a Russian economy that was in free fall after the demise of the Soviet Union — slashing debt, streamlining taxes and taming inflation.\n\nA strong oil economy allowed the Russian state to deliver an improved standard of living. That, the Kremlin hoped, would keep the public content even as the government eroded personal freedoms.\n\nNow, the carefully cultivated economic stability is fracturing. The steep drop in oil revenue has sent Russia into a new era defined by sustained budget deficits, higher taxes and stubborn inflation.\n\nRussia’s oil trade has been battered by two forces. Oil prices have declined since April, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to gradually increase production after years of cuts. The Russian oil industry has also been hit in recent months by new Western sanctions and the heavier enforcement of existing ones.\n\nIn October, President Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft, which is state-owned, and Lukoil, which is private. Those penalties significantly undercut the companies’ ability to sell crude. Since then, Russia has also faced stepped-up enforcement of restrictions against the illicit “shadow fleet” of tankers it uses to ship oil.\n\nThis month, the U.S. military seized a Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic that had been used to carry Venezuelan oil. The French Navy also intercepted a tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of using a false flag and belonging to a Russia-linked fleet.\n\nBecause of the current global oversupply, buyers now have more alternatives to Russian crude. This allows them to either walk away entirely or demand significantly higher discounts to compensate for the risk of handling goods hit with sanctions, said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“Had it not been for this noticeable decrease in oil prices,” he said, “all these measures would have been far less effective.”\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil have grown drastically. The economy ministry said this month that the average price of Russian oil was $39 per barrel in December, down from more than $57 in August.\n\nAdding to Moscow’s problems, Ukraine has been using drones since November to strike Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Ukrainian military has also been attacking Russian refineries. That has contributed to fuel crises in several regions, forcing the government to temporarily ban the export of oil products.\n\n“The only factor that can change the situation is economic pressure on Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday. “Russia must run out of money for the war to start coming to an end.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Putin has dealt with a drop in oil prices. But in previous years, the Russian state had more options. It could cut expenditures or allow the currency to weaken to replenish the budget. But the costs of the war, which amount to about 30 percent of Russia’s $580 billion annual budget, make it hard to reduce expenses. And the currency, the ruble, has remained strong.\n\nPropped up by restrictions on imports and high interest rates, the ruble surged by about 45 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2025. A strong ruble means that the government receives less money for each barrel of crude that is sold.\n\nWith options dwindling, the Kremlin had little choice but to increase state debt as well as personal and corporate taxes. The Russian government also increased taxes on smaller enterprises like bakeries and shops, causing a rare uproar among owners.\n\nRussia’s budget deficit reached $72 billion in 2025, nominally the highest since 2009. Mr. Nadorshin, the economist, said he expected it to increase further this year.\n\n“The situation is becoming more complicated,” he said, “and it’s clear that the pace of this complication is, naturally, worrying.”",

    "description": "Find out more about King Charles' reaction to Prince Harry calling out Donald Trump following his claims about NATO allies on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump recently made claims that British soldiers stayed “off the front lines” during the war in Afghanistan, and his comments struck a chord, especially with Prince Harry, who served for over a decade in the British Army. The 41-year-old didn’t waste any time calling out the United States president, but his father, King Charles, reportedly wishes his son reacted differently. Keep reading \n\nAccording to Royal reporter Rob Shuter, Harry's very public reaction to Donald Trump's claims has put King Charles in a \"deeply uncomfortable\" position, especially ahead of King Charles and Queen Camilla's upcoming trip to the United States. Shuter reported that Charles \"understands the emotion, but he's horrified by the timing.\"\n\n\"This is diplomacy—not podcast politics,\" an insider told Shuter. \"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier. The King can't clap back—even if he agrees.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Donald Trump questioned if the NATO allies would \"be there\" if the United States \"ever needed them.\"\n\n\"I've always said, 'Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?\" he questioned.\n\n\"We've never needed them,\" he continued. \"We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nThese claims from Donald Trump angered many members of the NATO alliance, including England. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's claims \"insulting and frankly appalling,\" and even Prince Harry had more than a few words to say about it.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Prince Harry released a statement on the topic. \"In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first—and only—time in history,\" he said, referencing the mutual defense clause that was activated following the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call.\"\n\n\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" he continued. \"The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.\"\n\n\"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,\" he finished. Prince Harry has long since been a supporter and defender of British veterans, having founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international, Paralympic-style event for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel and veterans.",

    "fullText": "Darren Aronofsky used to be a director who made interesting, if sometimes polarizing, films like Black Swan, Mother!, Noah, and The Wrestler. But it seems like a safe bet that people won’t need to debate whether Aronofsky’s new project is any good. Because anyone with eyes can see that it looks like low-effort AI slop. To put it another way, it looks like absolute dogshit.\n\nAronofsky is producing a new short-form series with his AI production company Primordial Soup titled “On This Day… 1776,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. The series uses tech from Google DeepMind to create short videos about the Revolutionary War, published on the YouTube channel for Time magazine. In 2018, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time, and the cloud software giant is sponsoring this monstrosity of a series.\n\nThe series uses human voice actors who belong to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is clearly an attempt to tamp down on the inevitable backlash from both inside and outside Hollywood. Folks inside the movie and TV industry have fiercely pushed back against the use of AI to replace the skilled artists and actors who create the media we watch. That concern obviously comes from a place of self-interest because nobody wants to be pushed out of a job. But they also care about the quality of the work being produced. And there’s also been a revolt among the average consumer, people who’ve been inundated with the lowest-grade AI garbage imaginable. It’s really everywhere now.\n\nThe first episode, titled “The Flag,” is three-and-a-half minutes long and attempts to tell the story of George Washington raising the Continental Union Flag in Somerville, Massachusetts. It offers nothing compelling in the way of narrative. It’s the kind of thing that you’d skip over as a cut-scene in a particularly bad video game.\n\nEverything has a dead and creepy quality, as the actors’ audio is poorly synced with the lips of the AI concoctions.\n\nHave you ever seen a Spaghetti Western from the 1960s where the audio just doesn’t seem to match, even though it was clearly shot with actors speaking English, and the “dub” is in English? That happened because the audio was added in post-production, a result of direct sound recording being expensive in Italy during the post-war era. You get the same effect here, though there’s no good reason. Well, no good reason outside of presumably saving a ton of money on hiring human actors.\n\nThe second episode, titled “Common Sense,” tries to tell the story of Thomas Paine writing Common Sense. Benjamin Franklin makes an appearance, though it proves that the most recognizable of the founding fathers in this series are the weirdest to look at.\n\nThe episode jumps around incoherently, much like the first episode, without grounding the viewer in anything we should care about. It’s truly an ugly mess. And if you bother to pause the scenes, you can spot the kind of telltale anomalies that plague other AI-generated video projects, like strangely deformed hands in the background characters. Hands are always giving this stuff away.\n\nThen there are the words that appear on screen in the trailer, like the pamphlet that’s supposed to include the word “America” but instead reads something closer to “Λamereedd.”\n\nHappy to see that there is no need to worry about the historical accuracy of new 1776 AI slop because it happens in the mystical land of Λamereedd.\n\n— Mateusz Fafinski (@calthalas.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 1:33 PM\n\nThe series is specifically made for this sestercentennial year of America’s founding, and each episode will reportedly drop on the 250th anniversary of the day it happened, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And that’s certainly a fun concept if the final product were something worth watching. But it’s not. It’s garbage. The people who are making and distributing it obviously don’t think so.\n\n“This project is a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like — not replacing craft, but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before,” Ben Bitonti, president of Time Studios, told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe reaction on social media hasn’t been so kind. “I know my expectations were low but holy fuck Darren Aronofsky producing AI slop wasn’t on my bingo card,” one X user wrote. Over on Bluesky another joked, “Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he’d just employ Jared Leto.”\n\nAnd other users have been picking apart all the anomalies, with one Bluesky critic writing: “Love the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat.”\n\nLove the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat\n Masterful artsistic choice\n\n— Matt Baume 🏳️‍🌈 (@mattbaume.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 10:35 AM\n\n“Nothing represents The End of America after a 250-year run quite like using AI slop to depict the creation of the Declaration of Independence,” another user quipped.\n\nThe videos have been up at Time’s YouTube channel for over 7 hours as of the time of this writing, but they’re not gaining much attention in their original format. The first episode has just 5,000 views. The second episode has a little over 2,000. Social media posts ridiculing the production seem to be faring better, simply because people are making fun of them. One video on Bluesky has over 2,500 quote posts, with almost all seemingly making jokes about how awful it looks.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Ken Burns for comment, but didn’t immediately receive a reply.",

Tuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.  Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "title": "Ukrainian drone schools say there's little the West can teach them about fighting a drone war",
    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are closely following the fast-developing drone battle and say their expertise only comes from Ukrainians, not Western allies.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian drone schools say that Western militaries have little to offer them when it comes to training drone operators to fight Russia. Western armies know war, tactics, and combat power, but Ukraine has significant experience in novel elements of modern drone warfare learned over years of hard fighting.\n\nDrones of all kinds are used \n\nWhile drones are not new to Western militaries, they have never been used or adapted at this scale or speed. Facing an existential adapt-or-die situation, Ukraine is writing its own lessons.\n\nUkraine has a host of drone schools that have designed curricula to make the country's operators as effective as possible. And officials at three of them told Business Insider that their lessons are only informed by Ukrainian experiences.\n\n\"As of today, we do not receive any particularly useful information from our allies regarding the use of drones,\" other than training on any equipment that allies provide, one said.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that said 100% of his school's teachings come from feedback or information from soldiers who are in the field.\n\nOne example he gave was in stopping enemy drones: \"All experience in striking down drones is based only on the experience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.\"\n\nHe said there isn't time for theoretical tactics that may not work when needed most. \"We are in a situation where we need to respond quickly to new drones and the tactics of their use by the enemy,\" he said. \"Accordingly, techniques are being tested in practice, and only those techniques that really work are being retained.\"\n\nAnother drone school, Dronarium, said the school's training \"is based on existing combat experience, which changes very rapidly.\"\n\nBecause of that pace, instructors said Ukraine is often better positioned to share lessons than to receive them. \"In this sense, at the moment it is rather us who can share valuable information with them, rather than our foreign partners sharing it with us,\" Anastasia Sobova, Dronarium Academy's chief business development officer, told BI.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have been receiving Western training throughout the war, with mixed feedback. Some has been well received, while other elements have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of fighting Ukraine faces now.\n\nUkraine's troops say combat tactics can become out of date in a matter of only weeks; the drone war is no different.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of DroneShield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that the speed of battlefield changes has shifted weapon development cycles from months and years to weeks.\n\nThings change so fast on the battlefield that the schools need to frequently rewrite their lessons, sometimes as fast as every other week.\n\nThese drone schools stay on top of changes by sending their instructors to the front, maintaining constant contact with program graduates and other soldiers who send updates from the battlefield, and testing new technology.\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that his school's graduates exchange messages with the school to share new information about what's happening on the battlefield or get advice from teachers.\n\n\"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\" The information they get from those on the front line goes into the teaching for the next groups.\n\nPervak said in his school, \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge. Some instructors occasionally visit combat units of the UAV to see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nMany Western militaries, including the US, acknowledge they are behind on drone warfare and that their tactics need updating. It is an area where Ukraine is helping partner nations that have assisted it in its defense.\n\nWestern and NATO militaries are closely watching the war, concerned that Russia could threaten Europe and that drones would play a major role in any wider conflict. That worry has intensified efforts to learn from Ukraine's experience, particularly in drone operations and counter-drone tactics. The Ukrainians are attempting to meet that demand for expertise.\n\nUkraine agreed to help Poland with drone warfare training and has helped train Norway's drone operators.\n\nUkrainian military specialists traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises. Copenhagen said in April it intended to send unarmed soldiers to Ukraine for drone warfare training, though it is unclear if that has taken place.\n\nThe UK says Ukraine has influenced its drone doctrine as well. Britain leads an international effort to train Ukrainian troops, known as Operation Interflex, and those Ukrainian soldiers often arrive with more real-world drone experience than their trainers.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards, told Business Insider that one surprise from the training was \"how much we would learn.\" His unit now trains in drone warfare and 3D printing drone parts based on Ukrainian lessons.\n\nPervak described sharing expertise as a way to repay allies for their support. \"Not forgetting the fact that we are truly grateful for the remarkable support from our allies, it is time now to share our latest battlefield experience.\"\n\nDrones might not dominate a NATO war against Russia to the same extent they do in Ukraine — in part because Western militaries possess capabilities Ukraine lacks — but they are no longer viewed as a niche tool. Ukraine's experience has led to a realization that this tech may very well be the future of warfare.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but ​distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.\n\nTakaichi expressed ‌her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting ‌tensions with China with the earlier remarks.\n\nTies between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.\n\nChina claims sovereignty ⁠over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.\n\n“I ‌want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over ‍Taiwan),\" Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.\n\n\"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, ​there may be cases where we take joint action.\n\n\"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, ‌come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nJAPAN'S CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS DIRECT MILITARY ACTION\n\nWith an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the ⁠remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with ​Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of ​her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to \"earnestly reflect and correct its mistakes, and to stop its manipulation and reckless actions on ‍the Taiwan issue.\"\n\nJapan's pacifist constitution ⁠prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces ⁠a \"threat to its survival.\"\n\nTakaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election ‌on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - American composer Philip Glass withdrew the world premiere of his symphony \"Lincoln\" from the Kennedy Center on Monday, ​saying the work's values conflict with those of the performing ‌arts venue that was taken over by President Donald Trump.\n\nGlass is the latest musical luminary ‌to withdraw from the Kennedy Center since Trump named himself chairman and filled its board with his allies last year. The Washington National Opera said earlier this month it planned to leave its home of 50 years.\n\n\"After thoughtful ⁠consideration, I have decided to ‌withdraw my Symphony No. 15 'Lincoln' from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts,” Glass, who turns 89 ‍on January 31, wrote in a statement posted on X.\n\n\"Symphony No. 15 is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and the values of the Kennedy Center today are ​in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony,\" he wrote.\n\nThe ‌symphony had been scheduled to be performed in June.\n\nIn December, the institution's board voted to rename it as the Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, or Trump Kennedy Center for short.\n\nSince then, many groups and artists have withdrawn from scheduled performances, citing ⁠the Republican leader's takeover.\n\nDemocrats, noting that the ​center's name was established by Congress, have ​said Trump's rebranding has no force of law. John F. Kennedy's family denounced the renaming move as undermining the slain president's ‍legacy.\n\nGlass' Symphony No. ⁠15 \"Lincoln\" was commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra and the Kennedy Center, the Washington Post reported.\n\nIts premiere, already delayed, was due to ⁠be the centerpiece of the center's \"250 Years of Us\" program to mark 250 years since the ‌signing of the Declaration of Independence, the newspaper said.",

    "fullText": "For average wage earners in Russia, it's a big payday. For criminals seeking to escape the harsh conditions and abuse in prison, it's a chance at freedom. For immigrants hoping for a better life, it's a simplified path to citizenship.\n\nAll they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.\n\nAs Russia seeks to replenish its forces in nearly four years of war — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it's pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.\n\nSome come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia defend its Kursk region from a Ukrainian incursion.\n\nMen from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.\n\nStill hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.\n\nIndependent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.\n\nWhen a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.\n\nSince then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.\n\nThe flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.\n\nActivists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.\n\nThe government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.\n\nThere also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.\n\nDespite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.\n\nRecruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.\n\nForeigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.\n\nLaws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.\n\nIn November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.\n\nSome reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia.\n\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.\n\nAlso in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some \"grievously injured,” the agency said.\n\nWhen Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.\n\nIraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.\n\nForeigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.\n\nThis month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.\n\nIf true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUsing foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.\n\nBut recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.",

    "fullText": "KENNESAW, Ga. (AP) — As a deadly storm that brought crippling ice to the South and deep snow to the Northeast finally began to swirl out to sea Monday, it represented light at the end of the tunnel for some.\n\nBut thousands of Americans were still without power or heat, and temperatures were forecast to plunge well below freezing by early Tuesday in areas where the ice storm did its worst damage.\n\nMore than 800,000 power outages were reported nationwide Monday morning, with more than 150,000 of them in the Nashville, Tennessee, area, according to poweroutage.com. About 140,000 remained without power in hard-hit Mississippi, and 115,000 \n\nAfter a sleepless night in Iuka, Mississippi, Adrian Ronca-Hohn said he awoke Monday to what looked \"like a war zone.”\n\n“We couldn’t go 10 seconds without hearing what sounded like a gunshot,\" the 23-year-old football coach said of falling trees and branches. “You’d hear a pop, a hard pop, and you’d hear the whistle of it falling, and then it would crash to the ground and just kind of explode.”\n\nAs temperatures across the South are expected to reach their coldest this week early Tuesday morning, people without power are trying to survive.\n\n“We have a lot of people without heat, without power and without water,\" Ronca-Hohn said. We have a lot of mobile homes down here that aren’t very well-insulated.\"\n\nHere's a look at the storm by the numbers.\n\nOne inch of ice (2.5 centimeters) recorded in multiple communities across Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama, and South Carolina.\n\nThe temperature in Fahrenheit (minus 17 Celsius) that’s expected early Tuesday morning in Tennessee’s capital city, where thousands remain without power.\n\nInches of sleet (17 centimeters) that fell at Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas, according to preliminary totals.\n\nThe number of days it could take to restore power in Allen County, Kentucky, city officials said. Other communities estimated similar time frames. In New Albany, Mississippi, the city utility warned Sunday that restoring power to all its customers “will take a minimum of a week and possibly more depending on conditions.”\n\nInches of snow (56.4 centimeters) that fell during the storm in Sterling, Massachusetts. The number is a preliminary figure through Monday morning.\n\nThe number of places in Nashville where people without power can go to warm up and charge their phones, including fire and police stations.\n\nThe temperature in Fahrenheit (50 Celsius) inside Marshall Ramsey’s home in Oxford, Mississippi, on Monday morning after he lost power. The weekend ice storm “was like a demonic symphony of trees breaking, transformers blowing and thunder,” said Ramsey, a longtime editorial cartoonist who now teaches at the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe number of dogs rescued from a rural property in the Tupelo, Mississippi, area just before the ice storm by Paws of War. The New York-based nonprofit rescues animals and places them with veterans and first responders.\n\nThe number of customers without power in Mississippi on Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.com.\n\nThe number of Nashville Electric Service customers without power in the Nashville area on Monday afternoon, according to the company.\n\nThe number of customers without power in Tennessee on Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.com.",

    "fullText": "MAGA podcaster Tim Pool has called out President Donald Trump in the fallout of the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by Department of Homeland Security federal officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in less than three weeks.\n\nThe Culture War podcast host and longtime Trump suck-up has questioned the Trump administration’s narrative surrounding the killing of ICU nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, arguing that Trump is “weak” in the face of the ensuing chaos that is gripping the Twin Cities.\n\n“Empty hand, then gun in hand,” Pool wrote, commenting on slowed footage in the seconds surrounding Pretti’s shooting. “Appears the man may have been disarmed before being shot.”\n\n“This is a chain of events in a greater conflict. Neither side cares at this point what justifies it or doesn’t.\n\n“I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool concluded.\n\nPool, 39, heads his own independent media group, Timcast, and has some 2.5 million followers on X. His podcast covers right-wing talking points and conspiracy theories, and has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nDHS has said that the agents involved in the shooting acted in self-defence after the “armed suspect violently resisted.”\n\n“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” the department wrote in an official statement.\n\n“The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\"\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference that she agrees with the White House’s statement that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.”\n\n“This individual... committed an act of domestic terrorism. That’s the facts,” Noem argued.\n\nSimilar statements have been made by Trump’s closest political allies—including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who branded Pretti an “assassin”—as the administration closes ranks to unify on its messaging.\n\nPool appears not to be buying any of it, although he has not entirely flipped sides. In a separate tweet, the commentator argued that those impeding the work of “federal agents dispatched by a duly elected government” are “fascists.”\n\n“Trump should personally go to Minneapolis and force the whole thing to shut down, no more fighting, no more partisan conflict,” Pool argued.\n\n“Trump isn’t Lincoln, he’s Buchanan.”\n\nPresident James Buchanan is frequently cited as the worst leader in U.S. history. The 15th president, serving from 1857 to 1861, failed to stop the country from tearing itself apart, leading to the Civil War.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also spurned the official White House narrative surrounding the events in his state’s capital, branding them “nonsense” and “lies.”\n\nPretti’s own parents have said that the Trump administration is spreading “sickening lies” about their deceased son that are “reprehensible and disgusting.”\n\nVideo analysis from news networks, including CNN and Bellingcat, has concluded that federal officers took the gun from the licensed firearm holder Pretti before shooting him at least 10 times while he was on the ground.\n\nProtests have engulfed Minnesota since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mother of three, Renee Good, who was also killed by federal agents, not far from where today’s shooting took place.\n\nThe National Guard of Minnesota has been activated in Minneapolis as authorities work to ensure the ongoing protests remain peaceful.",

    "description": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?",
    "fullText": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?\n\nIn short, is the US still the world’s sole superpower, able to dictate terms to Beijing even just off the China coast – or can the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) now bring the long-standing “Pax Americana”, the rules-based international order, to a conclusive end?\n\nWe may find out quite soon now, even as Sir Keir Starmer travels to Beijing this week to break bread with Xi Jinping. Last week, away from the slopes of Davos and largely unnoticed outside the shipping industry, the geopolitical order shifted significantly. A bulk cargo ship named Winning Youth arrived in China carrying 200,000 tons of iron ore.\n\nBig cargoes of iron ore arrive in China all the time, of course, to feed the nation’s enormous appetite for primary steel. Normally, however, the ore comes from Australia (64pc) or Brazil (the other major supplier at 22pc).\n\nThe Winning Youth’s cargo was different. It was the first to be shipped from the enormous Simandou deposits in Guinea, West Africa. The ship departed from the Conakry anchorage on Dec 2.\n\nThe Simandou mines, the associated rail line to the coast, and the specially built barge port on the Morébaya river estuary from which the ore is loaded aboard ships in the anchorage, are a massive joint project.\n\nThis has complex finances, but according to analysis house Drewry: “Chinese entities collectively have the largest strategic influence across the entire project through both mine ownership and shared control of the rail-port infrastructure. China is the largest combined strategic stakeholder.”\n\nThe Simandou project is not yet properly online: it took three weeks to get the Winning Youth fully loaded, much longer than it will take to load a bulker once the railway and the barge terminal are up to full capacity. (The mine isn’t really a bottleneck: it’s more a matter of simply scooping ore up and putting it in railway cars rather than mining as generally understood.)\n\nBut Simandou is expected to ramp up fast over the next few years, perhaps shipping 120 million tons annually in the near term. It’s also expected that most – if not all – of that ore will go to China.\n\nThat matters, because Australian control over the bulk of China’s iron ore supply is often thought to be one of the factors holding Xi Jinping back from an active military campaign to conquer Taiwan. Australia would surely cease shipments of ore in response to such a campaign, and the damage to China’s enormous industries would be colossal.\n\nHowever, not many years from now, this would have much less effect as massive amounts of ore would still be shipping from Simandou. As the shape of the world’s cargo routes changes, so too will the calculus of power in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nConfrontation in the strait is in fact already under way, with Chinese military manoeuvres there now so menacing that the “Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis” is deemed to have been going on since 2022.\n\nThis is the background to Sir Keir’s visit to Beijing this week. Accompanied by British business leaders, his trip is reportedly aimed at restoring the “golden era” of Sino-British trade and investment seen under Theresa May.\n\nThe Starmer Government’s eagerness to woo China was apparent in its decision days ago to allow the new Chinese “super embassy” in London to go ahead – a decision described in The Telegraph by former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith as “a humiliating sell-out”.\n\nBritish messaging is mixed, however. Last week the nuclear-powered attack submarine HMS Anson arrived at Gibraltar. Gibraltar is the submarine’s first stop on her way to Australia, where she will probably spend at least six months based out of Perth as part of Submarine Rotational Force West.\n\nSRF-West is the first stage of the Australia-UK-US “Aukus” agreement, which will evolve into a tri-national force of nuclear attack boats based at Perth, and the infrastructure in Australia and the UK which will build and support them.\n\nSince Anson is probably the only serviceable attack submarine in the Royal Navy at the moment, and with the Russian threat in the Atlantic ever more present, it is clear that the Government is placing a very high priority indeed on Aukus.\n\nThe whole point of Aukus, of course, is to confront China’s growing power in the Pacific.\n\nMainland China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation which recognises Taiwan as independent.\n\nDiplomats, at least, believe that diplomatic relations with China are essential – although in the case of the UK the result appears to be a large piece of Chinese territory in central London occupied by a massive CCP spy fortress. Only a few small nations recognise Taiwan as independent, probably the best known being the Vatican.\n\nQuite a lot of nations, however, take an “ambiguous” stance towards Taiwanese independence. They have diplomatic relations with China, embassies and all, and they do not formally recognise Taiwan’s nationhood.\n\nThey do not have embassies in Taipei and Taiwan does not have embassies in their capitals, but there are people and buildings that do much the same thing.\n\nThe UK, for instance, has the British Office in Taipei, staffed by Foreign Office employees who would be diplomats if they were accredited as such.\n\nTaiwan has a similar “Taipei Representative Office” in Belgravia. There is a parking space across the street with “diplomats” painted on it, for all that the representatives in the office are – officially – not diplomats, which somewhat gives away the British Government’s real stance.\n\nRather more importantly, the entire US policy towards Taiwan has always been one of “strategic ambiguity”. What this has actually tended to mean, however, is fairly firm and evident American backing for Taiwanese independence and democracy.\n\nDuring the run up to the 1996 election in Taiwan, for instance, China made a serious attempt to frighten the Taiwanese into voting for the pro-Beijing candidate. More than 100,000 troops were mustered on the mainland side of the strait and amphibious invasion exercises took place.\n\nChina also fired ballistic missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters, causing enough upset that merchant shipping ceased using the strait twice and maritime insurance rates for Taiwan increased significantly.\n\nThis sabre-rattling, however, was largely negated by the arrival of two US aircraft carrier groups and other naval elements.\n\nThat confrontation is nowadays known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis (the first two, in the 1950s, involved artillery bombardments from the mainland against outlying Taiwan-controlled islands).\n\nChinese air and naval power was fairly negligible in the mid-1990s, a fact that was illustrated by the carrier USS Nimitz twice cruising through the strait along with various other US warships. The pro-Beijing candidate in Taiwan got less than 15pc of the vote.\n\nEver since then, the US military has assumed that a fight against China would be likely, with its traditional Cold War foe Russia relegated to second place.\n\nThis makes sense: the Chinese economy is now no less than 20 times the size it was in the mid-1990s and the CCP’s defence budget is the second biggest in the world, much bigger than that of Russia even with Vladimir Putin’s new war economy.\n\nNeedless to say, Chinese air and naval power are no longer negligible. Indeed, by count of warships the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is actually bigger than the US Navy, though America for the moment still has a considerable advantage in terms of overall tonnage and missile launch tubes – probably more important numbers.\n\nMeanwhile the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) now has hundreds of fifth-generation stealth fighters and more than 100 long-range strategic bombers able to mount devastating missile strikes against enemy fleets and bases far away.\n\nProbably more significantly still, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) – this is a separate arm of service in China – does not only have intercontinental nuclear missiles.\n\nIt also has more than 3,000 shorter-ranging ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles able to strike targets with conventional warheads at great distances. In particular, US bases in Guam, Japan and South Korea are threatened, and if US warships in the region can be located and tracked, they can potentially be sunk.\n\nThe US military ought nonetheless to be enormously more powerful than China’s. US nominal GDP is still half again that of China, and crucially the US spends proportionally more on defence, or as the new administration prefers to put it, on “war”: 3.4pc to China’s 1.7pc. America’s colossal military spending, approaching $1tn a year, is roughly triple that of China.\n\nBut that isn’t the whole picture. Both China and the US mostly make their own armaments and recruit from their own labour markets: and the cost of Chinese-made weapons, planes, ships, etc, is much lower than US-made ones. Chinese soldiers, sailors and airmen are much cheaper than Americans.\n\nThis cost difference is illustrated by the fact that China’s vast shipbuilding industry, far and away the biggest in the world, built warships of a combined tonnage equal to the entire Royal Navy in just the four years up to 2025 and this rate is accelerating. American shipyards, so expensive that they can mostly win business only from the Pentagon, are struggling even to replace existing US warships as they wear out – let alone expand the fleet.\n\nComparisons like this explain the fact that on a purchasing-power parity basis, as opposed to nominal GDP, the Chinese economy is actually a third again bigger than the US.\n\nThis suggests that in terms of buying and hiring power the American war department only enjoys a 50pc advantage, rather than a three-fold one.\n\nThen there is the fact that a battle in the vicinity of Taiwan would see US forces operating at long range from their bases and the Chinese close to theirs.\n\nIn the scenario of an amphibious invasion by China, a US Navy attack submarine – or perhaps an allied Aukus one, HMS Anson or one of her successors – might well slip past or fight through relatively unpracticed PLAN anti-submarine forces and into the Taiwan Strait.\n\nParts of the strait are too shallow for a nuclear attack boat, but this would still be a fox-in-the-henhouse event for the invasion fleet: the sub’s torpedoes and missiles would take a fearful toll of the Chinese amphibious forces. The submarine might well survive to escape once it was out of weapons.\n\nBut if such a submarine were part of the Aukus force at Perth, it would then have a journey of 4,000 miles back to base to re-arm itself, and then another equally long voyage to get back into the fight.\n\nThe sub captain might head instead for a closer US base such as Guam, but this would still be nearly 2,000 miles away. The boat might then arrive only to find the base knocked out, or might be sunk at the jetty by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a Chinese warship near Taiwan would be only briefly absent if it needed to resupply, meaning that each Chinese ship would deliver a lot more combat power than an equivalent US or allied one. The US president might choose to strike Chinese bases on the mainland, of course, but it is definitely possible that this would be viewed as overly escalatory – an ever-present consideration in a war where both sides have intercontinental nukes.\n\nAll these factors tend to erode the American spending advantage. It was not a total surprise when a Pentagon summary – the so-called “Overmatch Brief” – leaked last month.\n\nIt was based on years of US wargaming, classified intelligence briefings and simulations, and it stated categorically that America would “most likely suffer decisive defeat” if it attempted to intervene against any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan.\n\nOne reason that the Overmatch Brief is not surprising, of course, is that the Pentagon has every incentive to suggest that it needs more resources. Similarly the fact that it leaked to the media was not a shock – if nobody knows that such a document exists, it has much less effect. The Overmatch Brief may one day be compared to the “missile gap” and “bomber gap” ideas put forth by the US Air Force in the 1950s, claiming that the Soviet Union’s forces were hugely stronger than they actually were in an attempt to obtain a bigger budget.\n\nFactors of budget relative to scenario, indeed, have powerful effects on all militaries. For instance it seems clear that the first and quite probably decisive stages of any China-Taiwan-US shooting war would be an air and sea contest mostly involving long-range missiles. On the US side the missiles would mostly be launched from ships or aircraft.\n\nThis is a pleasing thought for the US Navy and the US Air Force. It is not at all pleasing for the US Army and Marine Corps, who would not wish to be left out.\n\nThis has led to the curious spectacle of the Marines converting many of their conventional combat units into so-called “Littoral Regiments” and the Army similarly creating what it calls “Multi Domain Task Forces”. Both of these are basically land-based missile units, a sort of American PLARF. The problem is that America would probably not wish to provoke China in advance, so they cannot be based on Taiwan and thus would probably not be all that much use.\n\nThese matters aside, the big question for Xi, Trump and the various China hawks in his team – undersecretary of defence for policy Elbridge Colby, for instance – is this: what would happen if China moved against Taiwan and the US intervened?\n\nThe usual way to find an answer to this sort of question is wargames – the military version of what is called “modelling”, if one is talking about subjects such as pandemic disease or climate change. There have been many wargames around the idea of a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nMost of them have taken place behind the curtain of classified information, as with the Overmatch Brief. Such models may benefit from better or more detailed data. What is almost always true is that secret modelling is even more likely to be driven by an underlying agenda than openly visible work.\n\nThat’s why it’s probably useful for most of us to look at public wargame modelling of a possible fight for Taiwan. An influential Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has made a strong effort here.\n\nThe CSIS wargames acknowledge some uncomfortable realities for the US forces.\n\nAmerican cruisers and destroyers, for instance, have truly amazing defences against incoming Chinese missiles of various kinds, and such defences can mean that even a major Chinese strike can be resisted by a US aircraft carrier strike group or another kind of US Navy surface taskforce.\n\nBut the numbers are remorseless. In one example, China sends out a force of 24 H-6 heavy bombers armed with four YJ-12 ship-killer missiles each. The bombers can range far out into the Pacific, sweeping large stretches of ocean with their radar. If they have any vague idea where a US Navy task force may be, they can locate it.\n\nIf the US force includes a carrier, its radar plane is likely to detect the Chinese bombers long before they can find the carrier, and in that case the carrier’s fighters are likely to solve the problem.\n\nThe CSIS model doesn’t acknowledge the reality that a strike package of H-6s would be unlikely to get past responding US Navy fighters, especially if they were armed with the new beyond-visual-range air-launched SM-6.\n\nThe bombers would probably all have been shot out of the sky before they ever got a sniff of the carrier, which would remain below their radar horizon.\n\nBut if there are no US radar planes or fighters in play, the hail of missiles from the Chinese bombers is likely to overwhelm even the extremely strong Aegis/Standard defence of US cruisers and destroyers, sinking most if not all of them.\n\nIf the US ships do beat off such an attack, the Chinese bombers fly home, re-arm and return in a matter of hours. The American ships’ missile tubes will be largely empty this time, and this is before the extra firepower of the far-away land-based PLARF batteries comes into play.\n\nThe CSIS wargames still do not predict the clear-cut defeat seen in the Overmatch Brief. Indeed, their results suggest that in fact if the US is committed to the fight and doesn’t hesitate at the start, it can knock China back with a very bloody nose in the event of any serious fight over Taiwan.\n\nThe end result would be a Taiwan Strait filled with burning and sinking Chinese wrecks and the survivors of the Chinese invasion force trapped on Taiwan with their supply lines from the mainland cut, eventually forced to surrender.\n\nBut the US Navy and Air Force would have suffered on a scale not seen since the Second World War. Hundreds of American fighter jets would have been destroyed, mostly wrecked on the ground in their bases in Japan and elsewhere by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nThe US Navy and its allies would lose dozens of ships and thousands of sailors. HMS Anson or her future successor on SRF-West would probably have done a huge amount of damage to the PLAN and its amphibious fleet, knowing our submariners, but they would in all likelihood have gone down fighting in the end, assuming they could rearm and get back in the battle often enough.\n\nBoth China and the US would be seriously damaged as global military powers, and Taiwan would still be free but shattered as a nation and an economy – and that would mean knock-on damage to all world economies, given how vital the Taiwanese semiconductor industry is to us all.\n\nThe lesson of history for us all to take away – not only the US, but Australia, Britain and everyone else in the West – is that ancient and well-tried truism: if you would have peace, prepare yourself for war.\n\nThe way to persuade Xi Jinping not to invade Taiwan is to make the chance of failure higher.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "‘Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm,’ the former Georgia congresswoman wrote",
    "fullText": "Marjorie Taylor Greene has urged fellow MAGA supporters – and other Americans – to “take off their political blinders” over the death of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, warning that they are being “incited into civil war.”\n\n“I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement,” Greene wrote on X Sunday, the day after the fatal shooting. “However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment.\n\n“Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.”\n\nDespite video showing that 37-year-old Pretti was filming federal officers but did not have a weapon drawn, the Trump administration has claimed he had tried to assassinate agents in an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nThe incident was captured from multiple angles, including one that showed Pretti being sprayed with mace and wrestled to the ground while attempting to help a woman who had just been sprayed herself and had fallen to the ground. After being swarmed by around seven officers a shot rings out, followed by at least nine more, and Pretti falls still.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing,” Greene said.\n\nThe former Congresswoman asked MAGA to consider another scenario in which she replaced the protesters in Minnesota with those who supported the action on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n“We lost our minds when we watched Biden’s FBI track down and aggressively carry out home invasions and arrest… peaceful J6’ers who walked in the Capitol through open doors,” she said.\n\n“Imaging [sic] if one of our MAGA independent journalists or even just a MAGA supporter stood in the street outside a J6’ers house while Biden’s FBI carried out a law enforcement operation, home invasion, and arrest.\n\n“Then Biden’s FBI goes to the MAGA guy videoing it all and shoves a woman with him to the ground and sprays them with bear spray then throws the MAGA guy to the ground as MAGA guy was trying to help the woman off the ground. Then Biden’s FBI beats MAGA guy on the ground, disarms MAGA guy, and then shoots him dead.\n\n“What would have been our reaction? Both sides need to take off their political blinders. You are all being incited into civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.”\n\nPretti’s death is the second fatal shooting to involve federal agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks, following the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7. Tensions and clashes between demonstrators have increased, as well as those between state and federal authorities.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said earlier Sunday that residents, as well as his own police department have “had enough.”\n\n“This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This has taken an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of trying to be the police department for a major city,” O’Hara told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nO’Hara noted that he has received no official information from the federal government related to Saturday’s shooting. “Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting,” he said.\n\nWhile the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was blocked from the scene of the shooting Saturday by federal officials, they were allowed access Sunday to canvas for witnesses.\n\nGreene’s comments represent the latest instance of her breaking from MAGA orthodoxy. Previously a firebrand Trump loyalist, she has publicly broken from the president in recent months over issues including the Epstein files and foreign policy. She stood down from Congress earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "UFC 324 results, highlights: Justin Gaethje wins interim gold following brutal war against game Paddy Pimblett originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor years, the UFC promoted Paddy Pimblett as the next big thing. His rise to the top was meant to result in the Liverpool-born fighter holding gold.\n\nHowever, in his path at UFC 324 was a dangerous Justin Gaethje, who brutalized “The Baddy” for five rounds to once again win interim lightweight gold.\n\nThe UFC’s first show on Paramount+ began with a retrospective on the promotion's history, honoring those who laid the foundations for what it is today. UFC 324 showcased the future, with fighters using their skills to deliver highlight-reel wins.\n\nIt also helped that the UFC recently upped the ante with performance bonuses ($25k for KOs), as the first four bouts ended via knockout. The theme of the night transitioned smoothly to the main event.\n\nGaethje (27-5) came into the fight looking to retire as champion by 2027. He started guns blazing and didn’t slow down. “The Highlight” landed several uppercuts and jabs that cut the face of Pimblett (23–4), participating in the toughest fight of his career.\n\nThe eyes of Pimblett got poked at one point. He attempted to use elbows to hurt Gaethje. At certain points, they were efficient. Gaethje’s strikes, which dropped Pimblett, were just too much.\n\nPIMBLETT IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE EARLY\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/ooBFDwjofz\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nPimblett had a second wind and proved his toughness against the toughest opponent of his career. He chopped Gaethje's legs in an attempt to keep him off balance. Pimblett even landed sharp uppercuts.\n\nGaethje, known for having a tough chin and attacking when smelling blood, was on another level.\n\nGaethje landed 178 significant strikes while Pimblett landed 169. The former landed 219 total strikes. The loss ended Pimblett's nine-fight win streak. Gaethje has now won two straight.\n\n\"That Scouser does NOT get knocked out.\" - Justin Gaethje\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/LvqwmMGxqQ\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nUp next for Gaethje? It all depends on the status of champion Ilia Topuria, who is dealing with a personal matter. The interim champion could also fight Arman Tsarukyan, the top contender within the division.\n\nSean O’Malley may have secured a title shot on the White House card after beating Song Yadong in the co-main event. O’Malley (19-3, 1 NC) battled against Yadong (22-9, 1 NC), the latter landing leg kicks that hurt. “Suga” won round one and did enough in round three to get the win.\n\nO’Malley called out Petr Yan for the UFC bantamweight title, likely on the White House card. He understood if former champion Merab Dvalishvili got a third fight with Yan, but it appears likely the UFC will book O’Malley against the champion.\n\nWaldo Cortes-Acosta took it to Derrick Lewis, hurting the big man following vicious shots on the floor.\n\nRanked fifth at heavyweight, the Dominican used jabs and kicks to slow Lewis (29-13, 1 NC) down. Following a slip by Lewis, Cortes-Acosta (17-2) took advantage to get his third straight win.\n\nMORE: All you need to know about the UFC's partnership with Paramount+\n\nNatalia Silva earned a win against a former champion for the third straight time when she beat Rose Namajunas. Silva (20-5-1), replacing Alexa Grasso, was tentative to start the fight. The first round could have gone to anyone, but all three judges favored Silva.\n\nAs time went on, Silva looked confident. She took Namajunas (14-8) down late in the third, and it was enough to secure a win. With 13 straight wins, Silva may be next for flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n\nArnold Allen and Jean Silva are known for their striking. They did so for three rounds, landing everything from leg kicks to uppercuts. Allen (20-4) used jabs to bloody Silva (17-3), while the latter used elbows and kicks to affect the spirit of Allen.\n\nSilva is back to his winning ways as a member of The Fighting Nerds.\n\nThe Sporting News provided results, analysis, and highlights from UFC 324.\n\nGaethje won via unanimous decision.\n\nRound five: Gaethje with several big shots. he missed and Pimblett took advantage.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump gives. And he takes away.\n\nOffended by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's increasingly assertive posture toward the U.S., Trump revoked an invitation to join his Board of Peace. Many Western allies are suspicious of the organization, which is chaired by Trump and was initially formed to focus on maintaining the ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas but has grown into something skeptics fear could rival the United Nations.\n\nAppearing at the World Economic Forum, Trump spoke of imposing tariffs on Switzerland — which he ultimately lowered — because the country's leader “rubbed me the wrong way” during a phone call. Before shelving sweeping tariffs on multiple European countries, Trump pressed Denmark to “say yes” to the U.S. push to control Greenland “and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember,” he said, imperiling the NATO alliance.\n\nOver his decades in public life, Trump has never been one for niceties. But even by his standards, the tumult of the past week stood out because it crystallized his determination to erase the rules-based order that has governed U.S. foreign policy — and by extension most of the Western world — since World War II.\n\nThe president and his supporters have dismissed that approach as inefficient, overly focused on compromise and unresponsive to the needs of people contending with rapid economic change. But in its place, Trump is advancing a system that is poorly understood and could prove far less stable, driven by the whims of a single, often mercurial, leader who regularly demonstrates that personal flattery or animus can shape his decisions.\n\nReturning to the U.S. from Davos, home to the World Economic Forum, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said the phrase she heard “over and over” was that “we are entering this new world order” as she described a sense of confusion among allies.\n\n“It may be you just had a bad telephone call with the president and now you're going to have tariffs directed at you,” she told reporters. “This lack of stability and reliability, I think, is causing what were traditionally reliable trade partners to be saying to other countries, ‘Hey, maybe you and I should talk because I’m not sure about what’s going on with the United States.’”\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing is hardly surprising for someone who accepted his first Republican presidential nomination in 2016 by declaring that “I alone can fix” the nation's problems. As he settles into his second term with a far more confident demeanor than his first, he has delighted supporters with his to-the-victor -goes-the-spoils style.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, recently told the Atlantic that Trump is pursuing a “maximalist strategy” and that he must keep going “until you meet resistance.”\n\n“And we haven’t met any resistance,” Bannon said.\n\nThat's certainly true in Washington, where the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to check Trump's impulses. But leaders of other countries, who have spent much of Trump's administration trying to find ways to work with him, are increasingly vocal.\n\nCarney is quickly emerging as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. Speaking in Davos ahead of Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”\n\n“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he continued. “We should not allow the rise of hard powers to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity, and rules will remain strong — if we choose to wield it together.”\n\nTrump did not take kindly to those remarks, responding with threats in Davos before yanking the Board of Peace invitation.\n\n“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nCarney, however, was unbowed, speaking of Canada as “an example to a world at sea” as he crafted a potential template for other world leaders navigating a new era.\n\n“We can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped toward authoritarianism and exclusion,” he said in a speech before a cabinet retreat in Quebec City.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blasted Trump on Friday for “insulting and frankly appalling” comments in which he expressed doubt that NATO would support the U.S. if requested. The president seemingly ignored that the only time Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which requires all member countries to help another member under threat, was invoked was after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.\n\nReferring to non-US troops, Trump told Fox Business Network, “You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\nStarmer, noting the 457 British personnel who died and those with life-long injuries, said he will “never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country.” Denmark, which Trump has belittled as “ungrateful” for U.S. protection during World War II, had the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nHis tactics have raised fears that Trump is imposing long-term damage on the U.S. standing in the world and encouraging countries to rethink their alliances and deepen their ties with China. Carney already traveled there earlier this month to meet with President Xi Jinping.\n\n“China’s leadership watched an American president fight with allies, insult world leaders, and engage in bizarre antics, and thought to themselves — this is nothing but good for us,” Jake Sullivan, former President Joe Biden's national security adviser, said in an email.\n\nThe administration is showing no sign of backing down. In a social media post referring to Canada's ties with Beijing, Trump said China “will eat them up.” And the Pentagon released a defense strategy late Friday telling allies to handle their own security.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was in Davos and participated in a bipartisan delegation to Denmark with Murkowski that was intended to show unity amid Trump's bid for Greenland. Recalling his conversations with other leaders, he told reporters on Friday that Trump has shown he only backs down when countries like China “showed toughness and a resiliency.”\n\n“Those who were accommodating and who negotiated in good faith, like the EU, which did not impose retaliatory tariffs, seemed to have not won any of his respect,” Coons said. “They can reach their own conclusions, but it would seem to me that trying to find a way to accommodate him when the foundation of his demands about Greenland is unhinged … seem to me to suggest a course of action.”",

    "fullText": "My colleague Ben Bergman rubbed shoulders with world leaders, tech gurus, and venture capitalists in Davos this week.\n\nThere's nothing better than being in the room where it happens. I asked Ben what he saw and heard. Here are his highlights:\n\nQ: What was the biggest tech thing that was talked about at Davos this year?\n\nIt's hard to compete with President Trump and Greenland, but aside from that, AI was what everyone was talking about.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about when businesses will start to see productivity gains that justify their huge AI spend and whether we are in a bubble.\n\nQ: What tech discussion/theme surprised you at Davos?\n\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always a highlight because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host \"houses\" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.\n\nIt is interesting to see who's here and who's not.\n\nDavos is not a tech conference, and I've usually thought of it as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies.\n\nWalking along the street this year, 80% of the houses were tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro \"Lighthouse.\"\n\nIt is also interesting to see who was not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition on Thursday.\n\nQ: What was the tone of the tech executives and tech investors there?\n\nIf executives and investors are worried about the future, they did not share that with me or on stage.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang described what is happening with AI as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" and not only that, but said it will drive job creation across the global economy.\n\nQ: What was the biggest concern expressed by tech executives and tech investors at Davos this year?\n\nWhile optimism ruled the week, the fear of being in an AI bubble was on everyone's mind.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella warned onstage Tuesday that there would be a bubble if the only companies using AI are other AI companies.\n\n\"For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,\" Nadella said.\n\nHuang cited the rising rental price of computer chips as evidence that we are not in a bubble.\n\n\"If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,\" he said.\n\nAnother concern from tech executives I spoke to was how hard it is to hire and retain top talent right now, especially as big AI labs spend like drunken sailors to hire.\n\n\"It's astronomical amounts of money at the big level,\" Winston Weinberg, CEO and co-founder of Harvey, told me. He said he spends 70% of his time on hiring.\n\n\"I'm super involved, and I think it's the most important thing at our company right now, Weinberg said.\n\nQ: Anything else tech folks should know from your time there?\n\nThere were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.\n\nI asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.\n\nWaiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.\n\nHe told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now chief AI officer at Meta, advised him Davos was highly useful because Wang last year said he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was here.\n\nWeinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli forces on Tuesday targeted at least two United Nations facilities, pushing forward with a crackdown against the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees tasked with delivering humanitarian services to millions of people across the region.\n\nCrews began bulldozing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ’s offices in Sheikh Jarrah and fired tear gas at a vocational school in Qalandia, marking Israel’s latest and most dramatic step against UNRWA.\n\nIsrael has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and saying that some of its employees were involved in the October 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. UNRWA leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday condemned Israel’s destruction of the agency's compound and called for it to be returned to the U.N.'s control.\n\n“The Secretary-General views as wholly unacceptable the continued escalatory actions against UNRWA, which are inconsistent with Israel’s clear obligations under international law,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy U.N. spokesperson.\n\nRoland Friedrich, the agency's West Bank director, said UNRWA received word that demolition crews and police arrived at their east Jerusalem headquarters early on Tuesday. Staff have not operated out of the facility for almost a year out of safety concerns, but Israeli forces confiscated devices and forced out private security guards protecting the facility.\n\n“What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against UNRWA in east Jerusalem,” Friedrich said.\n\nHe said forces also began firing tear gas outside the vocational school on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Tuesday afternoon before ultimately leaving. More than 300 young refugees receive job training in technology and welding there.\n\nSome children on their way home from the school were overcome by the tear gas and a 15-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Jerusalem governorate, which monitors Palestinian affairs in the area.\n\nIsraeli leaders celebrate demolition\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said the demolition enforced a new law banning UNRWA, noting that Israel owns the site and rejecting UNRWA’s claims that the move violated international law.\n\nIsrael has long claimed the agency has an anti-Israel bias. Often with little evidence, it says UNRWA employs and maintains ties with militant groups including Hamas. The U.N. has ardently denied such claims and UNRWA has said it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff.\n\nUNRWA's mandate is to provide aid and services to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps and also run schools and provided health care. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel — including east Jerusalem.\n\nThe agency said the demolitions could imperil operations at the vocational center in Qalandia and heath facility in Shu'afat, where it still provides education and health services.\n\nAn Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organization's fate. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called it “a historic day.”\n\nThe demolition marked the culmination of years of criticism from Israel and its leaders. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two years ago, it has ramped up such attacks, saying the militants used UNRWA facilities and seized aid. It has provided little evidence for the claims, which the U.N. has denied. The International Court of Justice said in October that Israel must allow the agency to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nSince Israel passed its law banning the agency last year, its facilities — schools and health centers — and its headquarters have repeatedly been closed, raided or left unprotected.\n\n“This must be a wake-up call,\" Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner-general, said in a statement on X. “What happens today to UNRWA will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”\n\nMore aid groups in Gaza face pressure\n\nIsrael's ban on UNRWA dovetailed with broader efforts to deregister aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel has passed laws requiring nongovernmental organizations not to hire staff involved in activities that “delegitimize Israel” or support boycotts, demanding they register lists of names as a condition of being allowed to work.\n\nIsrael told dozens of groups — including Doctors Without Borders and CARE — that their licenses would expire at the end of 2025. The organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm people desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank rose last year\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday that attacks carried out by Jewish settlers against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank increased by 27% last year compared with 2024.\n\nThere were 867 reports of “nationalistic crimes” — with the number of severe incidents up by more than 50%, according to internal statistics from the Israeli military and the country’s Shin Bet domestic security service.\n\nMounting settler violence in the West Bank has emptied villages since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group helping the residents.\n\nThe Israeli military has carried out large-scale operations in the West Bank targeting militants that have killed hundreds of Palestinians. There also has been a rise in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nIsraeli authorities have a mixed relationship with settlers, at times dismantling unauthorized outposts while also deploying forces to protect them from Palestinians.\n\nJulia Frankel and Shlomo Mor in Jerusalem and Edith M.

    "description": "Ishinomaki City has ordered drones carrying bear spray that can be operated remotely to deter bears.",
    "fullText": "A city in Japan has come up with a high-tech solution to its intense bear problem.\n\nIshinomaki City in Japan's eastern Miyagi Prefecture has ordered drones that will spray bear repellent at attacking bears.\n\nDrone manufacturer Terra Drone said in a press release on Monday that it will supply the city with what it calls \"bear repellent spray-equipped drones,\" which it said could remotely and safely repel bears without human intervention.\n\nA video of the drone's demonstration showed a drone spraying repellent on a human dressed in a bear suit, crouching on all fours to mimic a bear's stance.\n\nTerra Drone told Business Insider in an email that it would introduce one drone first and begin full-scale operations from next spring. The company expects the total project cost to be \"a few million yen.\"\n\nThe drones will be operated by a private company picked by the city's government to prevent bear damage, Terra Drone said.\n\nBear sightings and attacks have become a big problem for Japan. The word \"bear\" was one of Japan's words of the year in 2025.\n\nThe release, citing figures from Japan's environment ministry, said bear sightings increased 163% between 2021 and 2025, and there had been 100 bear attack-linked injuries and 12 deaths in Japan since April.\n\nJapan deployed troops from the Self-Defense Forces — the country's key military branch — in December to its northern regions, where several bear sightings had been reported. The troops set box traps to capture the bears.\n\nThe drones can be controlled from about half a mile away, and can spray the bears with \"pinpoint accuracy,\" the release said. Bear sprays contain capsaicin, a chemical found in chili peppers, which irritates the bear's eyes and nose, giving the human time to escape.\n\nIt added, \"This provides a highly effective method of scaring away bears, whose sense of smell is thousands of times stronger than that of humans, and allows them time to temporarily evacuate.\"\n\nThe bear-spray drones are not the only drone-based solution Japan has deployed thus far.\n\nIn November, Gifu Prefecture deployed barking drones that mimic the sounds of hunting dogs, along with firecrackers, to scare off incoming bears. The drones featured large googly eyes and loudspeakers.",

    "fullText": "PC; Inkle\nThe UK game developer’s latest is a database mystery constructed from an archive of fictional books. Their combined contents threaten to crack the code of reality\n\nBletchley Park: famed home of the Enigma machine, Colossus computer, and, according to the premise of TR-49, an altogether stranger piece of tech. Two engineers created a machine that feeds on the most esoteric books: treatises on quantum computing, meditations on dark matter, pulp sci-fi novels and more. In the mid-2010s, when the game is set, Britain finds itself again engulfed by war, this time with itself. The arcane tool may hold the key to victory.\n\nYou play as budding codebreaker Abbi, a straight-talking northerner who is sifting through the machine now moved to a crypt beneath Manchester Cathedral. She has no idea how it works and neither do you. So you start tinkering. You input a four-digit code – two letters followed by two numbers. What do these correspond to? The initials of people and the year of a particular book’s publication. Input a code correctly and you are whisked away to the corresponding page, as if using a particularly speedy microfiche reader. These pages – say, by famed fictional physicist, Joshua Silverton – are filled with clues and, should you get lucky, further codes and even the titles of particular works. Your primary goal is to match codes with the corresponding book title in a bid to find the most crucial text of all, Endpeace, the key to understanding the erudite ghosts of this machine.\n\nHidden within this rhizomatic network of information is a mystery so intriguing and elegant that it can unfold naturally from any individual player’s investigations – no matter which titles or authors you see first, or where your particular curiosities lead you thereafter. Connections can cascade, tumbling like a waterfall, before swerving in unexpected directions, defying the traditionally linear logic of mystery fiction. TR-49 gives you an in-game notepad to keep track of everything; I recommend also keeping an actual pen and paper beside you.\n\nYou might imagine TR-49 as a comment on the rise of AI large language models (LLMs) which “scrape” data as this game’s machine feeds on writing. Actually, its concerns are broader and more ambitious, recalling the heady recent books of Chilean author Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the World and The Maniac). Like Labatut, TR-49 brims with awe, scepticism and horror at the reality-shredding possibilities of scientific and technological advances made in the 20th century, all while pushing these concepts into a playful, fantastical space.\n\nLess compelling are conversations that play out between Abbi and her companions on the other end of a radio transmission. Where the mystery told through the machine itself is lavishly detailed, what happens outside it feels too thin: Abbi’s reasons for being there; the nature of the conflict raging above, which is sketched in frustratingly vague terms.\n\nStill, the interactive heart of TR-49 resides in trawling this codebreaking device for secrets. And in this regard, the game is an unqualified success; TR-49’s database mystery rivals Sam Barlow’s games Her Story and Immortality, though it is of an unashamedly literary nature compared to those more filmic works.\n\nCloser to TR-49’s beginning, you may feel crushed by this mass of inscrutable writings. Quickly, you will swim elegantly amid it, conversant in its many, many peculiarities. Across a handful of evenings, I relished disappearing into this archive, cavorting from log to log, title to title, following threads and losing track of time. Each scrap of paper, water-damaged periodical and rare first edition threatened to solve this mystery, yet none could in isolation. Just as the fictional maker of the archive fell under the spell of these records and materials, I too was seduced.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "description": "The figure offers insight into the war's growing financial toll as Kyiv pushes for more tools to defend against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "fullText": "Norway has issued thousands of letters to citizens warning that the army may have to seize their homes and vehicles if war breaks out with Russia.\n\nNorwegian military officials said the letters were an advance warning to those with assets that may need to be requisitioned.\n\nThe requisition policy covers vehicles, boats, machinery and property, and around 13,500 “preparatory requisitions” were issued on Monday, valid for one year.\n\n“The requisitions are intended to ensure that, in a wartime situation, the armed forces have access to the resources necessary for the defence of the country,” the Norwegian military said.\n\nThe letters will not have come as a shock to most recipients, as two thirds of them were simply renewing requisition notices from previous years.\n\nAnders Jernberg, the head of the military’s logistics organisation, said: “The importance of being prepared for crisis and war has increased dramatically in recent years.”\n\n“Norway is in the most serious security policy situation since the Second World War. Our society must be prepared for security policy crises and, in the worst case, war... we are undertaking a major build-up of military and civil preparedness,” he added.\n\nNorway plays a key role in Nato surveillance of the Arctic region, where the melting of the ice caps has created a scramble to secure new shipping routes and lucrative raw materials.\n\nThe Scandinavian country shares a maritime border – as well as a 123 mile-long land border – with Russia in the far northern Arctic region.\n\nRussia and China are seeking to expand their presence in the Arctic region, with the former building up old Soviet bases in the region and expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile on the Kola peninsula.\n\nThe requisition notices were issued amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis between the United States and Europe over president Donald Trump’s plans to annex Greenland, the minerals-rich Arctic island.\n\nMr Trump has cited Arctic security concerns as his main argument for annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish overseas territory that is part of the Nato alliance.\n\nHe has threatened military action to take over the island, a step that would probably destroy the Western alliance even as it faces the growing risk of war with Russia.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged that Mr Trump also wants to take over Greenland because he is upset with Norway for refusing to give him a Nobel peace prize last year.\n\nDenmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. They have the full support of Britain and the European Union.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said on Monday that he does not believe the United States is planning a military takeover of the island.\n\n“I don’t, actually. I think that this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of the principles and values that I’ve set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland, and making clear that the use of tariffs in this way is completely wrong,” he said.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Telegraph, Norway’s defence minister warned that Russia had recently launched a major expansion of its military bases in the Arctic region.\n\n“Russia is building up on the Kola peninsula ... where one of the largest arsenals of nuclear warheads in the world is located. They [the nuclear weapons] are not only pointed towards Norway, but towards the UK and over the pole towards Canada and the US,” Tore O. Sandvik told the Telegraph.\n\nMoscow is also trying to gain full control over the Arctic region in order to block Nato access to key shipping routes, he said.\n\n“We are the eyes and ears of Nato in this area, and we see that they’re testing new weapons, for example, hypersonic missiles, and they are testing nuclear-driven torpedoes and nuclear warheads,” he said.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Zillow's hottest housing markets for 2026 highlight areas where there are high prices, low inventory, and stiff competition — particularly, the Northeast.",
    "fullText": "Competition is often inevitable when buying a home.\n\nWhile some are moving to the Sun Belt and Snow Belt seeking more affordable places to settle down, many other markets in the country remain expensive precisely because they're in demand.\n\nZillow released its predictions for the hottest markets going into 2026 based on home price growth and housing market competition, and Northeastern metros appear on the list more than any other region. No Sun Belt cities made the list at all.\n\n\"Markets are hotter where supply is more constrained,\" Zillow Chief Economist Mischa Fisher told Business Insider. \"That's why you see that very pronounced cluster in the Northeast, where it can take longer to build, or it can be harder to build, or it can be more costly to build. Whereas in the Sun Belt, if you look at the inventory available compared to demand, home prices are, in many of those markets, down year-over-year.\"\n\nWhat Zillow defines as \"hot\" doesn't just measure where homes are selling the fastest, but also how often sellers are forced to cut prices, how many homes sell over the asking price, and where demand outpaces supply.\n\nSome of the cities on the list, like San Jose, California, have a high Zillow Home Value Index ($1,558,466), but finished in the top 10 mainly because of other high-performing metrics.\n\nAccording to Zillow, 55.6% of sales in San Jose, California, were over the list price as of November 2025 due to an inventory drop. \"The inventory is still strained in those areas, so you still have enough to maintain a lot of competition among buyers there,\" Fisher said.\n\n\"Whether it's a lower home value index, like in Hartford, Connecticut, or a higher one, like in San Jose, California, in both cases, building is not particularly easy. So if that's where people want to be, you're going to be supply constrained, and you're going to see demand among buyers be pretty pronounced.\"\n\nAffordability remains a key factor for most when deciding where to live, but other elements also drive those decisions.\n\nZillow analyzed the nation's 50 most populous metros to determine which ones were the most in-demand. Here are the top 10 metros that Zillow predicts to be in high demand in 2026.\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $369,303\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 2.1%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $383,275\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 2.1%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $941,869\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.1%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $717,711\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $378,054\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.7%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $1,558,466\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.2%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $503,409\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 3.0%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $704,284\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $277,499\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 2.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $381,760\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 3.9%",

    "description": "Your bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job. Not because they couldn’t do it safely. Because they smoked weed two weeks ago.",
    "fullText": "You’re standing at the bus stop. The app said the bus would arrive in 3 minutes. Then 5 minutes. Then it just disappears from the tracker entirely. No bus. No explanation. Just another 45-minute wait for the next one, assuming that one actually shows up.\n\nThis isn’t a story about infrastructure or funding.\n\nIt’s about United States federal drug policy.\n\nMore than 90% of transit agencies across the US can’t hire enough bus drivers.1 Not because people don’t want the jobs—because federal law won’t let them take them.\n\nIn Baltimore, one in five buses don’t complete their runs.2 LA Metro is short 600 drivers and cancels 10% of scheduled service every single day.3 Miami postponed its entire bus network redesign because it couldn’t find people to drive the new routes.4\n\nBefore the pandemic, LA Metro missed 1-2% of scheduled trips. Now it’s 10%. That’s not a marginal decline—that’s system failure.\n\nHere’s the problem: Under federal law (49 CFR Part 382), anyone with a commercial driver’s license must pass DOT drug tests that include marijuana.5 No exceptions.\n\nThis applies to every transit bus operator in America, regardless of what state law says about marijuana.\n\nNotably, these mandates do not apply to Uber or Lyft drivers.\n\nThe tests don’t measure impairment–they detect THC metabolites that linger for weeks after use.\n\nSomeone who smoked on Saturday tests positive on Monday despite being completely sober.\n\nOne positive test goes into a federal database and effectively ends your driving career.\n\nAccording to 2024 federal data, 44 million American adults used marijuana in the past month.6\n\nThat’s 15% of the US adult population—-the exact population transit agencies need to recruit from.\n\nTransit agencies are desperate to hire. They’re offering bonuses, raising wages, running recruitment campaigns.\n\nBut federal policy immediately disqualifies 15-25% of otherwise qualified applicants before they even walk in the door.\n\nThink about that math. There are 159,000 transit bus operators nationwide.7\n\nAgencies report shortages of 600-800 drivers at single large systems.\n\nThe workforce shortage is measured in thousands and federal policy is excluding millions.\n\nIn 24 states, recreational marijuana is already legal. In 38 states, medical marijuana is legal.8\n\nYou can walk into a licensed dispensary in Los Angeles, Denver, or Seattle, buy marijuana legally, use it at home on the weekend, and be permanently barred from driving a bus on Monday.\n\nEight states have passed laws explicitly protecting workers from employment discrimination based on off-duty marijuana use.9\n\nBut all those protections include an exception: they don’t apply if federal law requires drug testing. The state laws can’t override DOT regulations.\n\nSo someone in California (where marijuana has been legal for years) can be fired from a bus driving job or never hired in the first place for doing something that’s completely legal under state law.\n\nNot because they’re impaired at work, but because they tested positive for something they did on their own time that violated no state law.\n\nWhen agencies can’t hire drivers, the consequences are immediate and measurable:\n\nBuses don’t show up. Before the shortage, major agencies completed 98-99% of scheduled runs. Now many are at 85-90%. Each missed bus means missed connections, doubled wait times, and overcrowded buses when one finally arrives.\n\nRoutes get cut. Rhode Island cut service on 21 routes citing driver shortages.10 Pittsburgh reduced scheduled service by 4%.11 These aren’t strategic decisions—they’re forced reductions because there aren’t enough people to drive the buses that already exist.\n\nRiders give up. When you can’t trust the bus to show up, you stop planning your life around it. You buy a car. You take an Uber. You move closer to work. The system loses riders not because of a single bad trip, but because unreliability makes it unusable.\n\nRemoving marijuana from CDL drug testing wouldn’t cost transit agencies anything. They don’t need to buy new buses, build new facilities, or hire more mechanics. They just need access to the millions of workers federal law currently bars them from hiring.\n\nRight now agencies are spending thousands per driver on signing bonuses and retention incentives—band-aids that don’t fix the underlying problem.\n\nMeanwhile, 44 million Americans who could do the job are legally prohibited from applying.\n\nThe current policy forces agencies to compete for the 75-85% of adults who haven’t used marijuana recently, while excluding a massive pool of qualified workers for no reason related to job performance or safety.\n\nThe tests don’t measure safety. They measure past use.\n\nSomeone can be stone sober, fully capable of safely operating a bus, and still fail a marijuana test from use days or weeks earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the same test won’t catch someone who’s exhausted, hungover, on cold medicine, or impaired by any number of other factors that actually affect driving.\n\nNew York’s Department of Labor has explicitly said employers can’t test for marijuana because the tests don’t measure workplace impairment—they measure past behavior that has no bearing on current job performance.12\n\nIf safety is the concern, there are performance-based impairment tests that measure actual ability to do the job, regardless of cause.\n\nThose tests would catch impairment from any \n\nCurrent marijuana testing doesn’t do that.\n\nFederal marijuana policy treats cannabis like heroin—Schedule I, high potential for abuse, no medical value. That classification is why transit agencies must test for it. It’s also completely divorced from reality, medical research, and the laws in 38 states.\n\nThe fix is simple: remove marijuana from DOT drug testing requirements. That’s it. Transit agencies could immediately start hiring from a pool of 44 million additional workers. Service would improve overnight at zero cost to taxpayers.\n\nThe buses exist. The routes are planned. The riders are waiting.\n\nThe only thing missing is drivers—and federal drug policy is the reason they can’t get hired.\n\nYour bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job.\n\nNot because they couldn’t do it safely.\n\nBecause they smoked weed two weeks ago.\n\nAmerican Public Transportation Association, Transit Workforce Shortage Study (2022) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nStreetsblog LA, Missed Runs and Crowded Buses: Metro Falls Short of Restoring Full Pre-COVID Transit Service (October 1, 2021) ↩\n\nTransitCenter, Bus Operators in Crisis (2022) ↩\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, 49 CFR Part 382 - Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing ↩\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2024) ↩\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wages: Bus Drivers, Transit and Intercity (May 2024) ↩\n\nMarijuana Policy Project, Cannabis Legalization and Employment Protections ↩\n\nGovDocs, Marijuana Laws by State: Employee Protections (August 20, 2025) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, Port Authority to reduce service because of driver shortage (May 19, 2022) ↩\n\nAnderson Kill, New York Bans Employers From Testing (Most) Employees And Job Applicants For Marijuana (June 16, 2025) ↩",

    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says President Donald Trump is serious about annexing Greenland.\n\nTrump amped up the rhetoric on Saturday, announcing on Truth Social that the United States would impose new tariffs on Denmark, which controls Greenland, and other European countries unless they hand Greenland over.\n\nSpeaking to Kristen Welker on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Bessent said Trump's push to take over Greenland was not an empty land grab but a strategy to prevent future conflict.\n\n\"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president. This is a geopolitical decision, and he's able to use the economic might of the US to avoid a hot war, so why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nGreenland is strategically located in the Arctic, acting as a buffer between North America and Russia. It is also home to minerals important to the manufacturing of future technologies.\n\nTrump has recently said that at least part of his reasoning for wanting to annex Greenland is so it can house his Golden Dome missile defense project.\n\n\"The president is trying to avoid a conflict,\" Bessent said.\n\nThat project remains in early planning stages, however, and Denmark has never said it wouldn't allow Golden Dome infrastructure on its territory. The United States already has a military base in Greenland.\n\nThe spectre that the United States — recently emboldened by its surprise raid on Venezuela that netted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, allowing it to move to open the country's oil industry — could force Europe's hand by targeting its economy or even take Greenland by force, has rankled US allies across the Atlantic.\n\nEuropean Union leaders held an emergency meeting on Sunday, during which they called Trump's tariff threat economic blackmail.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the eight EU nations targeted by Trump said in a joint statement released on Sunday.",

    "description": "How do you auction off an armor-plated Mercedes-Benz? Here's a behind-the-scenes look at a virtual bidding war where no one bothers to kick the tires.",
    "fullText": "How do you auction off a former billionaire's armor-plated Mercedes?\n\nAs with virtually every bankruptcy auction these days, there's a one-word answer to that question — online.\n\nBusiness Insider followed the auction of a Mercedes-Benz Maybach S650, kicking the tires in person and watching the virtual action as it sold online to its 115th bidder, for $63,000.\n\nThe sale shows just how easy it is for buyers to purchase — sight unseen — the cars, motorcycles, even the cast-off wall sconces and used vacuum cleaners of the nouveau poor. All that's needed is an internet connection and the winning bid.\n\nBut behind the scenes, a small army of lawyers, bankruptcy judges, appraisers, and auctioneers labor to make it happen. It took four years of real-life effort before the virtual gavel fell on Thursday, and the Mercedes found its new owner.\n\nHere is the journey of a billionaire's luxury sedan — from a showroom in Manhattan, to a tow lot in New Jersey, and finally to the yard of a Connecticut auction house, where almost no one bothered to see the car in person before bidding tens of thousands of dollars to own it.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz was once the shiny new chauffeured conveyance of Miles Guo, who declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 2022.\n\nGuo was arrested a year later and remains in jail pending his Manhattan sentencing for a $1.3 billion fraud and racketeering-conspiracy scheme.\n\nCourt records show that Guo bought the car new in 2018, for $192,000, at a Mercedes-Benz showroom just south of Lincoln Center in Manhattan. It was, relatively speaking, one of his economy cars. Federal prosecutors said Guo's custom Bugatti Chiron, his costliest ride, was purchased for $4.4 million.\n\nThe four-door Benz was built for luxury.\n\n\"There's a mini-bar back here,\" auctioneer Mike Knudson said, giving Business Insider a tour of the car on Wednesday. The car was parked outside The Hamilton Group, the Connecticut auction and appraisal company he runs with his wife, Amy Maklari.\n\nKnudson leaned into the back seat and popped the door on the empty fridge between the rear seats. \"Two small bottles,\" Knudson said, estimating its capacity. \"Maybe a Coke, too.\"\n\nThe Mercedes' amenities also include a small jar that Knudson discovered only Wednesday, in the glove compartment, set inside a recessed holder called a \"flacon.\"\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked, pulling the jar out. The smear of amber-colored gum inside was scent for the Mercedes' diffuser system, controllable through high, medium, and low settings on the dashboard computer.\n\n\"Aroma therapy,\" Knudson joked, returning the jar, labeled \"Agarwood,\" to its holder.\n\nThe car was built for safety, too.\n\nGuo paid extra to have a German company install armor plating and bulletproof glass throughout. \"See how thick this glass is?\" Knudson told Business Insider, lowering one of the windows.\n\nGuo's bankruptcy trustee has spent years demonstrating the true ownership of Guo's cars, planes, and mansions, and linking these assets back to Guo.\n\nThe Mercedes, just one small piece of the bankruptcy puzzle, had been listed as an asset held by a Hong Kong-based shell company — in the name of Guo's son and, briefly, his chauffeur.\n\nAfter Guo's arrest, the car wound up abandoned in a New Jersey tow lot. It had to be moved via flatbed to the Hamilton Group's yard in Clinton, Connecticut, a half-hour east of New Haven.\n\nIt took Knudson another month or so to ready the car for auction. He needed to obtain a bond, replace the battery, and get an electronic key fob made by Mercedes-Benz specialists.\n\n\"That's when I learned it's pronounced \"My-bach,\" not \"May-bach,\" said Knudson, who has also auctioned furnishings and knick-knacks from Guo's Manhattan penthouse and his fleet of high-end motorcycles — \"one Ducati, two BMWs, and three Harleys,\" Maklari said.\n\nWednesday was the only day during the ten-day auction that the public could drop by without an appointment and personally examine the Mercedes. Not a single person showed up, besides Business Insider.\n\nOnline the next day, though, the bidding for the car, which had just 21,000 miles on the odometer, was strong.\n\nTwenty-four hours before the auction was to close, more than 80 bidders on BidSpotter.com had pushed the price up to $38,000.\n\nIn the last hour of bidding, interest accelerated. In the last five minutes, bidding climbed suddenly in $1,000 increments until it reached the winning bid of $63,000.\n\nThe sale price is in line with the Kelley Blue Book value, which sets the current resale value for a 2018 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S650 at $62,400 — not counting the custom armor plating and bullet-proof glass Guo had installed.\n\nPeople feel safe bidding on something so expensive — without actually seeing it in person — because of the clarity of auction listings.\n\nThe Mercedes' listing on BidSpotter included 49 photographs and a two-minute video. The clip shows Knudson popping the hood and trunk, and driving it around Hamilton Auction's front lot.\n\nPotential bidders could hear Knudson start and rev the car's engine, and watch as his camera lingered on a small ding in the rear right bumper and a hair-thin, vertical crack in the windshield.\n\nThere are dozens of online auction platforms catering to bankruptcies, estate sales, and companies and individuals with something to sell.\n\nMaklari ticked off a few names on Wednesday. AuctionNinja specializes in estates and furnishings. ProxiBid and BidSpotter deals in vehicles and heavy machinery. LiveAuctioneers handles collectibles and antiques.\n\nFor auctioneers, listing on these sites is an art.\n\nKnudson said he had appraised the Mercedes very conservatively, at around $35,000, for the bankruptcy trustee. But for the ten-day auction's launch, he had set the minimum bid at a strategically low-balled $20,000.\n\n\"It gets people engaged,\" he explained.\n\nThere's no risk to such lowballing, he said. \"Most assets will find their fair-market value these days,\" he said. \"People have a lot of ways, with the internet, to do their research.\"\n\nThe car's new owner wished to remain anonymous. Whoever they are, they'll need to pay a 15% fee to the auction company, and are responsible for their own transportation.\n\nThe sale proceeds will now go into the bankruptcy estate, where it will help pay off Guo's many creditors.\n\nIt's a drop in the bucket, given that Guo's bankruptcy debts hover around half a billion dollars.\n\n\"One Mercedes-Benz won't help anything,\" said Kevin Tung, the Queens, New York, lawyer for nine China-based contractors who say Guo owes them a combined $100 million. \"That's small potatoes.\"",

    "description": "The fight in Ukraine changes so rapidly that weapons makers can't afford to constantly overhaul and redevelop whole systems.",
    "fullText": "The battlefield in Ukraine is changing constantly, and weapons makers are rushing to keep up.\n\nDrone and ground robot makers said they're designing their systems in ways that allow them to be easily updated.\n\nThey're either modular, meaning parts can be swapped out, or designed so software changes are all that's needed.\n\nRapid changes on the battlefield in Ukraine are prompting Western weapons manufacturers to reassess how military technology is developed and upgraded.\n\nWith the fight evolving quickly, arms companies in Ukraine and Europe say that they can't afford to start from scratch and completely redesign entire systems each time conditions shift.\n\nInstead, companies making aerial drones and ground robots told Business Insider that their focus is now on creating weapons that can be upgraded by simply changing parts or software rather than overhauling the whole system.\n\nDesigns are modular, like Lego pieces, with parts being easily swapped out as new mission demands arise. Increasingly, companies are turning to software-first designs for more convenient upgrades.\n\nDefense technology has been moving in this direction, but revelations from Russia's war against Ukraine are injecting new urgency.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, the chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous uncrewed ground vehicles and has some in Ukraine, said that these changes are key to staying ahead, as they provide much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.\n\nUkraine's soldiers say that battlefield tech can become out of date in weeks and months, with electronic warfare, new drone countermeasures, and new tactics blunting once-effective systems.\n\nAmong the companies involved in this evolving technology battle is DroneShield, an Australian company that develops counter-drone technology and operates across Europe. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and has multiple systems in Ukraine.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, said that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cutting development cycles to weeks rather than months or years.\n\nThe only way to keep pace, he said, is to build \"systems that are not fixed, solving the problem of today, but ones that can address an issue today and adapt as needed.\"\n\nLithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy was one of the first companies to send drones to Ukraine. CEO Gediminas Guoba said the company needs to build systems that are not simply ready for this year or the next, but can be updated and upgraded for new operations even further into the future.\n\nThat means building systems that can be easily reworked. Anything else, he said, and \"we will lose the battle.\"\n\nMcCrann said the faster development cycle is why DroneShield has put greater emphasis on modular and adaptable designs.\n\nLikewise, Shepherd said that Milrem builds flexibility into its systems from the outset, allowing sensors, payloads, mission systems, and other components to be integrated, removed, or upgraded without redesigning the entire vehicle.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukraine's Ark Robotics, which makes autonomous robots used by nearly two dozen Ukrainian brigades, said the company focuses on making its platforms \"as cheap and as mass producible as possible.\" He spoke to Business Insider using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\n\"And then when we get this right, we can do surface-level customization,\" like adding armor or additional equipment. The base platform remains the same, letting the company scale production without driving up costs.\n\nLatvia-based Origin Robotics manufactures both drones and drone interceptors used by Ukrainian and NATO forces. Its CEO, Agris Kipurs, told BI that the company also prioritizes modular systems to adapt quickly to battlefield changes.\n\nModular designs aren't just for companies striving to keep their edge in a competitive industry. Warfighters need them too. Ukrainian soldiers have said they need flexible systems that can be easily modified at the front.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that the ground robots his unit uses can be configured for different missions, be it evacuating wounded troops or attacking Russian positions. He said the robots work like Lego bricks.\n\nShepherd said that Milrem's robots follow the same logic, avoiding designs built around a single mission. They can be customized by soldiers for evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles.\n\nIn some cases, soldiers adapt systems in ways manufacturers did not anticipate.\n\nWestern companies say they are learning from those changes. McCrann said Ukraine has been technologically innovative \"because they have to be,\" and that this is driving industry adaptation.\n\nCompanies sometimes have group chats and FaceTime calls with Ukrainian soldiers to get real-time feedback, and weapons software is where they can make the biggest changes the fastest.\n\nShepherd said that software is now playing a central role in adapting systems, whether for command-and-control integration or mission management. \"Software updates can be developed, tested, and deployed much more quickly, allowing lessons learned from the field to be integrated on shorter timescales,\" he said.\n\nMcCrann said DroneShield has focused on a software-first approach, where upgrades add new capabilities without hardware modifications.\n\nGuoba said Granta Autonomy's drones have not changed much over the last year or two, but the software inside them, on the other hand, \"is changing every month.\"\n\nSoftware can be remotely pushed to weaponry already in Ukraine, eliminating the need to ship gear back to the factory. That speed, and the ability to test changes quickly, has made software the preferred tool for rapid adaptation.\n\nUltimately, Ark Robotics' Achi said, \"software is easier to do.\"\n\nArk's aerial drones and ground robots rely on onboard and server-based software, and the company is developing systems to allow thousands of platforms to operate together with minimal human involvement.\n\nHe said Ark also deploys engineers forward to implement software changes tailored to specific units or missions. It follows a similar approach for hardware, though those changes take longer to implement.\n\nKipurs said Origin makes its systems \"software-intensive\" so development is continuous, \"with updates regularly pushed to improve systems that have already been delivered.\"\n\nIt only uses hardware changes \"when they provide clear benefits across all intended users.\" Because the company also builds for NATO customers, systems must remain broadly interoperable.\n\nShepherd said companies still need to strike a balance. Systems must remain reliable, so not every update can be rushed to the field. The key, he said, is close collaboration with Ukrainian soldiers and fast but disciplined feedback loops.",

    "description": "Andrea...",
    "fullText": "Formed to oppose the Iraq War, Madres Contra La Guerra have now spent decades trying to end Puerto Rico’s role at the center of the US war machine in Latin America.\n\nIn a blurry black-and-white Polaroid from 1971, Sonia Santiago Hernández reenacts an image of the Madonna and Child. Only 21 years old, she wears a miniskirt and sandals, and oversize sunglasses sit perched on her forehead. She stands in contrapposto outside the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras in San Juan, gazing serenely at her newborn son Gabriel. Since his birth, Gabriel had been her companion at every Vietnam War protest that she attended, shuffling between student comrades who took turns holding him. In the months before her pregnancy, Santiago had been on hunger strike for 26 days.\n\nOn a colonized island where one-third of all Puerto Rican women had been forcefully sterilized from the 1930s to the ’70s, holding the baby for a photo felt like an act of resistance. Gabriel was raised in a house plastered with peace-sign magnets, pins, posters, and stickers—his playpen devoid of toy guns or weapons.\n\n“Maternity is life,” Santiago told me. “War is death. We fight for peace.”\n\nIn 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, and Puerto Rico became overrun with military recruiters. Lurking in malls, colleges, and other youth haunts, they promised financial benefits and opportunity for those who enlisted. More than 38,000 Boricua youth were deployed—including Gabriel.\n\nSantiago’s grief and devastation at her son’s involvement in US war led her to found Madres Contra La Guerra, or Mothers Against War, in May 2003. When the United States attacked Venezuela and abducted Nicolás Maduro on January 3, killing 80 people in the process, Santiago saw Iraq’s history repeating itself. She found herself ridden by the same indignation. “Once again, they are trying to justify their aggression under the rhetoric of narcotrafficking, falsely attributing the origin of drugs in the region to Venezuela,” Santiago said in a Madres’ press release, recalling the threat of weapons of mass destruction that convinced her son to enlist in Iraq. “This is a fabricated narrative designed to cover up a war of plunder.”\n\nAfter waking up to the news in Caracas, Madres coordinated a protest with the Venezuelan Solidarity Network outside of the federal building in San Juan. Their message, beyond an end to the escalation, was directed at Puerto Rican youth soldiers: Don’t become accomplices to the war on Venezuela.\n\nThe attacks of January 3 did not surprise Santiago and other Puerto Ricans, who over the last several months had seen military training exercises take over their public beaches. Since the United States sank the first Venezuelan ship in early September, the supposedly dormant Roosevelt Roads naval base in Ceiba came back to life. The last few months brought the largest military ramp up in the Caribbean since the 1994 invasion of Haiti. Ceibeños often hear the deafening noise of the fighter jets. Their silverware trembles and their lamps shake as F-35s, V-22 Ospreys, and UH-60 Black Hawks roar overhead. Some 15,000 US soldiers have been garrisoned at the base.\n\nLong before the US started its war games with Venezuela, Puerto Rico had operated as the linchpin of the US invasions in the region. In 1954, US militia invaded Guatemala from the Ramey Base in Aguadilla as part of a coup against President Jacobo Arbenz, whose agrarian reform threatened the profits of the United Fruit Company. In 1965, US troops trained in Roosevelt Roads were sent to the Dominican Republic following the overthrow of Juan Bosch. In 1983, Puerto Rico served as a staging ground for the US invasion of Grenada, and again for the 1989 invasion of Panama. Maduro’s first stop on his way out of Venezuela was through Aguadilla. In the now-viral image of Maduro in a gray Nike Tech jumpsuit, he clutches a Nikini water bottle, a brand sold in Puerto Rico.\n\nSantiago notes that the invasions that preceded the attacks on Venezuela were also a reflection—not of “manifest destiny” but of US economic and geopolitical interests. “They are using this invasion to guarantee forced access to their resources, the oil and natural resources that belong to the Venezuelan people.” Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, which will now trade exclusively with the United States.\n\nWhat began as an anti-recruitment group advocating for conscientious objection to the Iraq War became an organization devoted to peaceful civil disobedience. Since its inception, the group’s protests have shut down the entry points of prominent recruitment centers and military bases. Madres’ coalition of 200 families formed part of a broad anti-military resistance in Puerto Rico, which, in addition to protesting the Iraq War, was trying to push the US military out of Vieques.\n\nVieques is a tiny appendage off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico that housed the Vieques Naval Training Range, the construction of which displaced 10,000 Viequenses. The US military used the base to perform countless experiments with toxic weapons, including agent orange, napalm, white phosphorus, and heavy metals. In 1999, a bombing accident killed a local security guard, David Sanes Rodriguez. That year, activist and Independence Party president Rubén Berríos began a year-long civil sit-in at the navy’s high-impact zone, sparking a wave of fierce opposition. A few years later, Vieques closed; along with it, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, once one of the largest bases in the world.\n\nThe media often uses the word “remilitarization” to describe the situation in Puerto Rico.Santiago rejects that characterization. “It’s not ‘remilitarization’; it’s reactivation,” she said. “They’re doing the same thing they always did. They were just passive for a while. But they never left.”\n\nThe “passive” period that Santiago mentions was filled with broken promises. When the military shuttered Vieques, it promised a cleanup, but thousands of acres remain contaminated. Cancer rates are 30 percent higher in Vieques than on the rest of the island. Fort Allen, Camp Santiago, and Fort Buchanan never closed. Nor did the Muñiz Air National Guard Base in Carolina, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spouted made-up propaganda about a fictional Venezuelan drug cartel.\n\nImmediately following the January 3 attacks on Venezuela, the US military held “Army of the Caribbean Week ’26” at Fort Buchanan. It is the first event of its kind, and it involved deploying thousands of troops and beefing up military equipment for a week of training in a “commitment to duty and readiness in the Caribbean.” Press releases about Army Week are vague, intentionally distanced from Venezuela, but Trump warned that he could target Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico next. If that happens, it’s more than likely that Puerto Rico will again be the staging ground.\n\nThe strikes on Venezuelan ships came from Roosevelt Roads, and it led Madres Contra La Guerra to block the entry to the base for the first time in 20 years. Now 67, Santiago leads a group of mothers, elders, and youth in a bus en route to Ceiba. She wears red lipstick and a black peace-sign T-shirt that reads, “War is the Antithesis of Life.” Over the clamor of helicopters, the Madres chant, “Basta ya, basta ya, No a guerra criminal”—“Stop it now, Stop it now, No to criminal wars”—to the percussive rhythms of bomba (ironically and unrelatedly, Spanish for “bomb”). Accompanying the protesters is a group of drummers, Tambores Por Palestina.\n\nA central tenet of the Madres’ philosophy is solidarity with other colonized countries and mothers. It began with Iraq and has now extended toPalestine and Venezuela. Every Tuesday since October 2023, Madres can be found wearing keffiyehs outside the Israeli consulate in San Juan leading the islands’ most prominent anti-genocide protests. Their visibility has earned Madres multiple visits from the FBI. Yet they remain unflinchingly vocal about the shared colonial struggle of Palestine and Puerto Rico, swinging both flags in communion.\n\nSimilarly, Madres often refer to Venezuela as a “sister country.” “We understand that Venezuela, like every Latin American country, is being accosted by US imperialist interests,” Santiago said. “But beyond that, there’s an enormous cultural and linguistic affinity between us, a shared history of liberation struggles.” Santiago references Simón Bolívar in Venezuela and Ramón Emeterio Betances in Puerto Rico, whose cries for independence reverberate through present decolonial movements across the island.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Dani McClain\n\nA significant element of Madres activism is fighting for restitution for the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the agreement that handed over Puerto Rico, Cuba, Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam to the United States after the Spanish-American War and made them de facto military colonies. Santiago sees the treaty as the origins of Puerto Rico as a colonial war laboratory. “It’s important to emphasize it, denounce it, and demand reparations. They need to return those lands on a national level,” Santiago said. “Those aren’t Roosevelt’s roads, those are the roads of my people, the Ceibeños. They steal land and then name it after themselves. It’s not right.”\n\nSantiago still speaks of motherhood with reverence and affection. She claims it is the undercurrent of her solidarity and her struggle for peace. “When you create life, you’re not thinking that you will raise them to kill or be killed,” she said, evoking her son Gabriel, now a veteran who struggles with PTSD. “That thread of maternity can be extrapolated not only onto your child, but for all of humanity.”\n\nHer words echo the sentiments of “militant mother” movements across Latin America—Madres de la Plaza de Mayo in Argentina and Madres Buscadoras in Mexico. Santiago and some of her peers have travelled to Argentina. They’ve broken bread with mothers in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador and accompanied them in their grief and sense of political possibility. Santiago maintains that the maternity knows no border.\n\nThere’s anger, frustration, and indignation embedded in mothers’ movements like Madres Contra la Guerra. Yet Santiago stressed revolutionary kindness above all. “Maternity is derived from tenderness and love. Solidarity is tenderness between communities,” she explained, recalling Venezuela, Palestine, and her own children. “It’s really simple. It’s philosophical, yes, but it’s actually the simplest feeling there is.”",

    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 active reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "title": "Arms makers say that the fast-moving war in Ukraine is changing how they design and upgrade weapons",
    "description": "The fight in Ukraine changes so rapidly that weapons makers can't afford to constantly overhaul and redevelop whole systems.",
    "fullText": "Rapid changes on the battlefield in Ukraine are prompting Western weapons manufacturers to reassess how military technology is developed and upgraded.\n\nWith the fight evolving quickly, arms companies in Ukraine and Europe say that they can't afford to start from scratch and completely redesign entire systems each time conditions shift.\n\nInstead, companies making aerial drones and ground robots told Business Insider that their focus is now on creating weapons that can be upgraded by simply changing parts or software rather than overhauling the whole system.\n\nDesigns are modular, like Lego pieces, with parts being easily swapped out as new mission demands arise. Increasingly, companies are turning to software-first designs for more convenient upgrades.\n\nDefense technology has been moving in this direction, but revelations from Russia's war against Ukraine are injecting new urgency.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, the chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous uncrewed ground vehicles and has some in Ukraine, said that these changes are key to staying ahead, as they provide much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.\n\nUkraine's soldiers say that battlefield tech can become out of date in weeks and months, with electronic warfare, new drone countermeasures, and new tactics blunting once-effective systems.\n\nAmong the companies involved in this evolving technology battle is DroneShield, an Australian company that develops counter-drone technology and operates across Europe. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and has multiple systems in Ukraine.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, said that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cutting development cycles to weeks rather than months or years.\n\nThe only way to keep pace, he said, is to build \"systems that are not fixed, solving the problem of today, but ones that can address an issue today and adapt as needed.\"\n\nLithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy was one of the first companies to send drones to Ukraine. CEO Gediminas Guoba said the company needs to build systems that are not simply ready for this year or the next, but can be updated and upgraded for new operations even further into the future.\n\nThat means building systems that can be easily reworked. Anything else, he said, and \"we will lose the battle.\"\n\nMcCrann said the faster development cycle is why DroneShield has put greater emphasis on modular and adaptable designs.\n\nLikewise, Shepherd said that Milrem builds flexibility into its systems from the outset, allowing sensors, payloads, mission systems, and other components to be integrated, removed, or upgraded without redesigning the entire vehicle.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukraine's Ark Robotics, which makes autonomous robots used by nearly two dozen Ukrainian brigades, said the company focuses on making its platforms \"as cheap and as mass producible as possible.\" He spoke to Business Insider using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\n\"And then when we get this right, we can do surface-level customization,\" like adding armor or additional equipment. The base platform remains the same, letting the company scale production without driving up costs.\n\nLatvia-based Origin Robotics manufactures both drones and drone interceptors used by Ukrainian and NATO forces. Its CEO, Agris Kipurs, told BI that the company also prioritizes modular systems to adapt quickly to battlefield changes.\n\nModular designs aren't just for companies striving to keep their edge in a competitive industry. Warfighters need them too. Ukrainian soldiers have said they need flexible systems that can be easily modified at the front.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that the ground robots his unit uses can be configured for different missions, be it evacuating wounded troops or attacking Russian positions. He said the robots work like Lego bricks.\n\nShepherd said that Milrem's robots follow the same logic, avoiding designs built around a single mission. They can be customized by soldiers for evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles.\n\nIn some cases, soldiers adapt systems in ways manufacturers did not anticipate.\n\nWestern companies say they are learning from those changes. McCrann said Ukraine has been technologically innovative \"because they have to be,\" and that this is driving industry adaptation.\n\nCompanies sometimes have group chats and FaceTime calls with Ukrainian soldiers to get real-time feedback, and weapons software is where they can make the biggest changes the fastest.\n\nShepherd said that software is now playing a central role in adapting systems, whether for command-and-control integration or mission management. \"Software updates can be developed, tested, and deployed much more quickly, allowing lessons learned from the field to be integrated on shorter timescales,\" he said.\n\nMcCrann said DroneShield has focused on a software-first approach, where upgrades add new capabilities without hardware modifications.\n\nGuoba said Granta Autonomy's drones have not changed much over the last year or two, but the software inside them, on the other hand, \"is changing every month.\"\n\nSoftware can be remotely pushed to weaponry already in Ukraine, eliminating the need to ship gear back to the factory. That speed, and the ability to test changes quickly, has made software the preferred tool for rapid adaptation.\n\nUltimately, Ark Robotics' Achi said, \"software is easier to do.\"\n\nArk's aerial drones and ground robots rely on onboard and server-based software, and the company is developing systems to allow thousands of platforms to operate together with minimal human involvement.\n\nHe said Ark also deploys engineers forward to implement software changes tailored to specific units or missions. It follows a similar approach for hardware, though those changes take longer to implement.\n\nKipurs said Origin makes its systems \"software-intensive\" so development is continuous, \"with updates regularly pushed to improve systems that have already been delivered.\"\n\nIt only uses hardware changes \"when they provide clear benefits across all intended users.\" Because the company also builds for NATO customers, systems must remain broadly interoperable.\n\nShepherd said companies still need to strike a balance. Systems must remain reliable, so not every update can be rushed to the field. The key, he said, is close collaboration with Ukrainian soldiers and fast but disciplined feedback loops.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is pointing the finger at an unlikely target after his much-touted efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine failed to gain traction.\n\nAsked why U.S.-led peace talks have stalled, Trump blamed the victim of the invasion, claiming it was the Ukrainian leader’s fault. Asked directly what was standing in the way, he gave a one-word answer to Reuters: “Zelensky.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump argued that Moscow is prepared to conclude the conflict, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is eager to bring the nearly four-year invasion to a close. “I think he’s ready to make a deal,” Trump said, adding, “I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Kremlin said they agree with Trump’s remarks, which are in contrast to those of European allies, who have long maintained that Moscow is not genuinely interested in ending the conflict, instead aiming to seize additional territory while avoiding new Western sanctions.\n\nTrump, who previously said he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day” if he won a second term, has frequently clashed with Zelensky over the past year.\n\nNegotiations took a sharp turn in March last year when a public clash between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office derailed a widely promoted agreement that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, with the Ukrainian president leaving the White House without signing the deal. In the aftermath, Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing, though both were restored the following month.\n\nSince then, the interactions between the two presidents have improved, with Ukrainian officials being deeply involved in recent peace talks, led by the U.S.\n\nRecent U.S.-led diplomacy has focused on what security guarantees Ukraine would receive after a ceasefire to prevent another Russian attack. As part of those discussions, American negotiators have broadly urged Kyiv to consider relinquishing control of the eastern Donbas region in exchange for an agreement with Russia.\n\nZelensky, however, has repeatedly rejected any suggestion of territorial concessions, insisting Ukraine’s constitution bars the government from surrendering any of its land to Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces have continued to press their offensive in Ukraine despite Trump’s claims that his pressure campaign and peace efforts are gaining traction with the Kremlin.\n\nIn mid-January, Moscow confirmed the launch of a hypersonic Oreshnik missile into western Ukraine near the EU border, a high-speed strike that hit infrastructure in the Lviv region. Western officials condemned it as an escalation even as peace proposals were being discussed.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has repeatedly carried out large waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure while diplomatic talks have continued. In December, Ukrainian authorities reported hundreds of drones and missiles targeting power stations and other sites across the country, causing multiple injuries and widespread damage even as discussions on ending the war persisted.\n\nMoscow’s foreign ministry has also signaled reluctance to accept partial ceasefires as credible.\n\nIn his New Year’s message, Zelensky warned that Moscow was deliberately continuing its war, saying that “Russia deliberately brings war” with night time shelling and large drone attacks, and thanked Ukrainian defenders for repelling many of them.\n\nWhen asked why he believes Zelensky has resisted moving forward with peace talks, Trump told Reuters: “I just think he’s, you know, having a hard time getting there.”",

    "description": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.",
    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 activist reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.",

Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a post on Wednesday.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, added Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union at the State Department.\n\n\"The overall market appeal of such arms has clearly been diminished,\" following the US's military operation, he wrote.\n\nSome $2 billion to $3 billion in annual trade between Russia and Venezuela could also \"cease altogether,\" he added.\n\nThose concrete economic losses contrast with more intangible political upsides for Moscow in a shifting global order, he added.\n\n\"The Trump administration's emphasis on preserving a US sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere could also seem to validate Russia's claims for a similar sphere in its own neighborhood,\" Sestanovich wrote.\n\nThe developments come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy, as its war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year next month.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions and depressed oil prices are squeezing Russia's revenues, putting pressure on the funds Moscow uses to sustain the war effort and support the broader economy.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the US's operation in Venezuela.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Wide-scale desertions and 2 million draft-dodgers are among a raft of challenges facing Ukraine's military as Russia presses on with its invasion of its neighbor after almost four years of fighting, the new defense minister said Wednesday.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov told Ukraine's parliament that other problems facing Ukraine’s armed forces include excessive bureaucracy, a Soviet-style approach to management, and disruptions in the supply of equipment to troops along the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\n“We cannot fight a war with new technologies but an old organizational structure,” Fedorov said.\n\nHe said the military had faced some 200,000 troop desertions and draft-dodging by around 2 million people.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy appointed 34-year-old Fedorov at the start of the year. The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "title": "Most Bizarre Military Vehicles That Made History",
    "description": "Military history is full of bizarre engineering born of desperation. These \"fever dream\" machines challenged physics to solve the impossible problems of war.",
    "fullText": "Military history is filled with sleek fighters, massive tanks, and iconic weapons, but scattered among them are machines so bizarre they look like they were designed during a fever dream after binge-watching too many sci-fi movies. Some were prototypes that never made it past testing but still flew, rolled, or fired in real life, proving that just because you can build something doesn't mean you should.\n\nOthers were actually put into full service, where their strange shapes and awkward designs became unlikely heroes of war. These weren't the most polished, but rather eccentric solutions born of necessity, wild ambition, or the kind of desperation that makes you think \"what if we just duct-tape a howitzer to this truck chassis?\"\n\nFrom tanks that resembled mobile barns to flying boats that seemed half-alien, each one demonstrates how engineers sometimes disregard physics textbooks to see what happens.\n\nWe didn’t simply pick vehicles that looked odd (although that's quite fascinating in its own right). Our ranking was based on three factors:\n\nHow unusual their concept or design was\n\nWhether they worked in practice\n\nTo capture the full spectrum of strangeness, we split the list into two parts. The first half covers vehicles that were experimental or never saw true combat, but were still real machines that left the drawing board and proved themselves in tests. The second half highlights the bizarre vehicles that actually went into service or saw combat, showing that weirdness didn’t stop at the prototype stage.\n\nOur goal wasn’t to judge them on technical specs or battlefield performance, but on how boldly and bizarrely they challenged conventional design. In the end, each machine earned its spot by being both strange and real, either as a functioning oddity or as a combat-tested curiosity.\n\nNot every wild idea made it to the battlefield, but that didn't stop engineers from building and testing them anyway. These machines were strange, ambitious, and often about as practical as a screen door on a submarine; yet they were real, and they proved that even the craziest concepts could take shape in steel and wings.\n\nSpecs: 183 mm L4A1 gun, Centurion-based chassis, about 50.8 tonnes combat weight; very tall, lightly armored turret\n\nAt first glance, the FV4005 Stage II looked like someone had welded a garden shed onto a tank chassis and declared it battle-ready. This wasn't subtle engineering: this was the British saying, \"if bigger guns win wars, let's build the biggest bloody gun we can fit on tracks.\"\n\nThe turret was so absurdly tall and thin that crews nicknamed it \"The Barn,\" and honestly, most barns probably had better structural integrity. The tank was so top-heavy that firing the main gun required lowering a rear recoil spade into the ground, essentially turning it into a temporary artillery piece.In trials, recoil could noticeably lift the front of the vehicle (reported on the order of a few dozen centimeters at some elevations); which is either impressive engineering or a fantastic way to launch your tank crew into orbit. Maybe both.\n\nThe 183mm gun could theoretically penetrate any Soviet armor at ridiculous ranges, but good luck getting there without tipping over. Tank crews took one look at this mechanical giraffe and probably started updating their wills. Though it never entered service, it remains a favorite among tank enthusiasts who appreciate the pure audacity of strapping a ship's cannon to a tank and hoping for the best.\n\nSpecs: Allison YT40-A-14 turboprop, 5,850 hp, a tailsitter VTOL concept (intended to take off and land vertically, but it never demonstrated operational vertical takeoffs/landings in testing), maximum pucker factor\n\nThe Lockheed XFV was probably the result of someone asking, \"What if we made a plane that lands like a rocket?\" and nobody had the sense to say, \"That sounds terrible.\" This tail-sitting fighter looked like a conventional plane that had been stood on its tail by a very confused ground crew.\n\nThe idea was brilliant in theory: vertical takeoff meant no runways were needed, making it perfect for carriers or forward bases. In practice, it meant asking test pilots to land while looking over their shoulder at the ground rushing up to meet them. The landing gear looked like something stolen from a NASA launch pad, because conventional gear would have snapped like toothpicks.\n\nTest pilot Herman \"Fish\" Salmon (yes, that was his real name) described flying it as \"interesting,\" which in test pilot speak translates to \"holy heck, I can't believe I survived that.\" The XFV flew conventionally using temporary landing gear and conducted limited testing related to the VTOL concept, but it did not prove routine vertical takeoff-and-landing operations, and likely give any pilot who flew it nightmares for weeks.\n\nThe program was scrapped when everyone realized that asking pilots to thread the needle of a vertical landing while enemy fire was incoming might not be the best career move. The XFV proved that sometimes the laws of physics and human psychology should take precedence over engineering ambition.\n\nSpecs: Two Soloviev D-30 turbofans, inflatable pontoons, maximum weirdness coefficient achieved\n\nThe VVA-14 looked like what you'd get if a submarine, a seaplane, and a hovercraft had a three-way collision and decided to make the best of it. Soviet engineers were tasked with building an anti-submarine aircraft that could operate from water, and apparently decided that conventional design principles were for capitalists.\n\nThis flying doorstop featured inflatable pontoons that resembled giant water wings, stubby wings that seemed too small to keep a paper airplane aloft, and a fuselage that appeared to have been designed with a ruler and little imagination. The whole thing looked as if it were perpetually surprised to be airborne.\n\nThe VVA-14 was supposed to hunt NATO submarines using ground effect, basically flying so close to the water that it could barely clear the waves. Watching it take off was like seeing a concrete mixer attempt flight. Soviet test crews reported it handled \"adequately,\" which is probably the most damning praise ever recorded in aviation history.\n\nDespite looking like a flying mistake, it actually worked. The program stalled largely because the intended lift-engine set (for VTOL/ground-effect ambitions) was never delivered, and after Bartini’s death the project lost momentum. The VVA-14 remains proof that Soviet engineers could make literally anything fly if they were given enough vodka and state funding.\n\nSpecs: Standard Meteor F8 airframe, pilot lying face-down, ergonomics designed by sadists\n\nSomeone at Gloster Aircraft looked at the perfectly functional Meteor fighter and thought, \"You know what this needs? The pilot should be lying on their stomach like they're getting a massage.\" The theory was that prone positioning would help pilots better handle high G-forces. The reality was more like asking fighter pilots to dogfight while planking.\n\nThe modified cockpit looked like a medieval torture device with windows. Test pilots had to operate all controls while lying flat, which meant reaching forward for everything and craning their necks to see where they were going. Photos of the test setup resemble someone trying to cram a grown man into a torpedo tube.\n\nRAF test pilot Eric George Franklin flew the prone-pilot Meteor during evaluation flights; the concept proved impractical for operational use. Coming from a guy who test-flew captured German jets and lived to tell about it, that's practically a death sentence for any aircraft design.\n\nThe program was quickly abandoned when everyone realized that asking pilots to fly combat missions while doing permanent push-ups wasn't exactly conducive to air superiority. The Prone Pilot Meteor remains a testament to the fact that just because you can redesign something doesn't mean you should.\n\nSpecs: Forward-swept wings, fly-by-wire flight controls, maximum instability by design\n\nThe X-29 resembled a fighter jet assembled from a kit without consulting the instructions first. Its forward-swept wings made it appear to be flying backwards even when sitting still, defying every basic principle of aircraft design that had worked perfectly well since the Wright Brothers.\n\nThis wasn't an accident, the forward-swept design was intentional, designed to improve maneuverability and reduce drag. The problem was that forward-swept wings want to twist themselves off the aircraft at high speeds, which is generally considered poor form in aviation circles. The X-29 used a triply redundant digital fly-by-wire flight-control system (with additional backup), because the airframe was intentionally unstable to operate constantly, just to prevent it from tearing itself apart in flight.\n\nNASA test pilots reported that the X-29 was incredibly agile but required the reflexes of a caffeinated mongoose to fly safely. The computer systems made about 40 flight-control corrections per second, because apparently the X-29's natural inclination was to immediately flip upside down and head for the nearest patch of ground.\n\nDespite looking completely wrong, the X-29 proved several important points about advanced aerodynamics and flight control systems. It also proved that American engineers could make anything fly if they were given enough computers and test pilots with nerves of steel.\n\nSome bizarre vehicles didn't stay as experiments: they actually rolled, floated, or flew into service. Awkward, odd, or downright laughable, these machines still managed to make their mark in real battles and operations, proving that sometimes weird just works.\n\nSpecs: 800mm gun, 1,350-ton weight, required an enormous support effort, on the order of thousands for transport, assembly, security, and rail work, while the firing crew itself was far smaller (often cited around 500), subtlety rating: zero\n\nThe Schwerer Gustav is what happened when German engineers were asked to build the biggest possible gun and forgot to ask, \"Why?\" or \"Is this necessary?\" This railway cannon was so absurdly oversized that it looked like someone had confused the blueprints for a battleship turret with those for a mobile artillery piece.\n\nEach shell weighed as much as a small car and could designed for extreme bunker-busting, often described in terms of several meters of reinforced concrete or around a meter of armor plate, depending on the shell. The gun itself required its own railway infrastructure, complete with curved tracks to handle the recoil. Moving Gustav required a logistics operation that would make Amazon's shipping department envious.\n\nThe entire setup looked like a mobile steel mountain. German artillery crews likely felt as though they were operating a mechanical volcano rather than a weapon. Gustav fired 47 rounds during the Sevastopol siege, where each shot cost roughly as much as a small fighter aircraft.\n\nDespite its impracticality, Gustav did exactly what it was designed to do: it obliterated anything it aimed at with the subtlety of a nuclear weapon and twice the engineering complexity. It remains the largest gun ever used in combat and possibly the most expensive way to deliver explosives ever invented.\n\nNecessary? I guess not. Worth it? Yes.\n\nSpecs: 6x6 amphibious capability, 2.5-ton payload, looked ridiculous, worked perfectly\n\nThe DUKW (pronounced \"Duck\") looked like what would happen if a truck and a boat had an awkward one-night stand and decided to make it work for the kids. This amphibious vehicle was essentially a standard GMC truck that had been taught to swim, with results that were both ungainly and brilliant.\n\nOn land, it looked like a boat with delusions of grandeur. In water, it looked like a truck having an identity crisis. The DUKW could carry supplies from ship to shore without needing docks, piers, or any infrastructure beyond a beach capable of supporting its weight.\n\nMilitary mechanics quickly learned to appreciate the Duck despite its unusual appearance. It could haul ammunition across rivers, deliver supplies to isolated units, and even serve as an impromptu ferry for troops. The DUKW became the Swiss Army knife of amphibious warfare, ugly, versatile, and absolutely indispensable.\n\nFrom Normandy beaches to Pacific atolls, the Duck waddled its way through every major amphibious operation of WWII. Soldiers might have laughed at it initially, but they learned to appreciate anything that could bring hot food and dry ammunition to the front lines. The DUKW proved that sometimes the best military vehicles are those that appear to have been designed by committee and built by optimists.\n\nSpecs: Half motorcycle, half tank, all weird, Opel 4-cylinder engine producing about 36 hp (26 kW), maximum confusion factor\n\nThe Kettenkrad resembled someone who had started building a motorcycle and, halfway through, decided it needed tank tracks instead of a rear wheel. German engineers deliberately created this mechanical centaur to handle terrain that would stop both motorcycles and tanks.\n\nWith handlebars like a Harley and tracks like a Panzer, the Kettenkrad could tow anti-tank guns through mud that would swallow a truck whole. German troops quickly discovered it could go places that wheeled vehicles couldn't reach and fit through spaces too small for tracked vehicles.\n\nThe steering system was a pure example of German engineering logic: the front wheel steered like a normal motorcycle at low speeds, but at higher speeds, differential braking on the tracks took over. This meant learning to drive one was like learning two completely different vehicles, depending on how fast you were going.\n\nDespite its odd appearance, Wehrmacht units loved the Kettenkrad. It could lay communication cables across rough terrain, tow equipment through forests, and even serve as a mobile command post for forward observers. German mechanics appreciated that it was reliable, serviceable, and could be repaired with standard motorcycle and tank parts.\n\nThe Kettenkrad remained in production throughout the war and was utilized in every theater where German forces were deployed. It proved that sometimes the best solution to a complex problem is to combine two working designs until something useful emerges.\n\nSpecs: Standard lorry chassis, roughly 6 inches (about 150 mm) of concrete armor (typically with reinforcement), mobility rating: \"eventually\"\n\nThe Bison wasn't sophisticated military engineering: it was what happened when Britain faced invasion and someone said, \"Let's pour concrete on trucks and see what happens.\" Built during the darkest days of 1940, these improvised armored vehicles were essentially mobile pillboxes for the Home Guard.\n\nThe concept was brilliantly simple: take a standard truck, build wooden forms around it, pour in concrete mixed with steel reinforcement, and voila, instant armored vehicle! The results looked like construction equipment that had gotten lost on the way to a building site and decided to join the army instead.\n\nThese concrete-clad lorries were slow, heavy, and about as maneuverable as their name suggests. British crews joked that the Bison could stop rifle bullets but not much else... Including hills, mud, or sharp turns. The weight of the concrete armor stressed every component of the truck chassis beyond its design limits.\n\nDespite their limitations, Bisons were deployed to guard airfields, coastal installations, and key infrastructure across Britain. Home Guard units appreciated having something that offered protection from small arms fire, even if it looked like a cement mixer with delusions of grandeur.\n\nThe Bison represented the spirit of British improvisation during WWII: it wasn't elegant, it wasn't sophisticated, but it was available, and it could stop a bullet.\n\nSpecs: Ground effect vehicle, 8 Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofans, about 340 mph (≈550 km/h) maximum cruising speed for the Lun-class, physics-defying capabilities\n\nThe ekranoplane resembled what would happen if a jumbo jet and a naval destroyer had a baby and were raised on a steady diet of rocket fuel and Soviet ambition. This ground-effect vehicle was designed to skim just above the water's surface at incredible speeds, utilizing aerodynamic principles that most Western engineers considered theoretically interesting but practically insane.\n\nThe Lun-class was essentially a flying missile boat, equipped with six Moskit anti-ship missiles and enough turbofan engines to power a small airline. It could cruise at 380 mph just 10 feet above the waves, making it nearly impossible to detect on radar until it was too late.\n\nSoviet naval aviation crews described flying the ekranoplane as surreal, traveling at jet speeds while close enough to the water to see fish swimming below. The ground effect allowed it to carry massive payloads that would be impossible for conventional aircraft, but required perfect weather conditions and calm seas to operate safely.\n\nWestern intelligence agencies were baffled by early satellite photos of the ekranoplane. It was too big to be a conventional aircraft but clearly capable of flight, leading to speculation about everything from captured alien technology to secret nuclear programs. The reality was somehow even stranger than the rumors.\n\nThe Lun entered limited service with the Soviet Navy in the late 1980s but proved too specialized for practical deployment. It required specially trained crews, perfect weather conditions, and extensive support infrastructure. The project was abandoned after the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving the remaining ekranoplanes as monuments to the fact that Soviet engineers could make anything fly if you gave them enough engines and a creative interpretation of physics.\n\nSpecs: 45 tons, 5 turrets, ypically a 10-man crew (some sources cite higher numbers depending on variant or counting attached personnel), maximum chaos potential\n\nThe T-35 was the result of Soviet tank designers being asked to build a heavy tank, and they decided that if one turret was good, five turrets must be five times better. This mechanical monster bristled with weapons in every direction, looking like someone had taken a naval destroyer and taught it to drive on land.\n\nWith one main turret mounting a 76mm gun and four smaller turrets sporting 45mm guns and machine guns, the T-35 could theoretically engage multiple targets simultaneously. In practice, coordinating fire from five different turrets while moving across rough terrain proved about as practical as conducting an orchestra during an earthquake.\n\nThe T-35 was a crowd-pleaser at Red Square parades, where its imposing size and multiple turrets made it look unstoppable. Soviet propaganda films loved showing these mechanical fortresses rolling past the Kremlin, symbolizing the industrial might of the socialist state.\n\nCombat proved less impressive than parades. Several T-35s were deployed during the German invasion of 1941, where they were eventually knocked out or abandoned due to mechanical failures. Crews who operated them reported that coordinating five different weapons systems while under fire required skills that no amount of training could provide.\n\nThe T-35's greatest weakness wasn't enemy fire... It was its own complexity. With 11 crew members spread across five turrets, communication became a nightmare during combat. The tank was also mechanically unreliable, with a transmission that regularly failed under the strain of moving 45 tons of steel across rough terrain.\n\nDespite its poor combat record, the T-35 remains unforgettable for its sheer audacity. Soviet tank designers took the concept of \"more is better\" to its logical extreme, creating something that looked like it could conquer Europe single-handedly. The reality was more mundane, but the T-35's unique silhouette earned it a permanent place in military history.\n\nFrom prototypes that resembled designs by aliens to combat vehicles that actually made it to the battlefield despite appearing completely wrong, these machines remind us that military engineering has always walked the fine line between genius and madness.\n\nEngineers were often tasked with solving seemingly impossible problems with limited resources and boundless imagination. Sometimes the answers came in shapes that defied common sense and challenged every design principle ever written. The results were vehicles that might not have been beautiful, practical, or even particularly effective, but they worked well enough to earn their place in history.\n\nWhat unites all these mechanical oddities is their willingness to challenge convention. These weren't incremental improvements on existing designs, they were bold leaps into uncharted territory, powered by caffeine, determination, and the kind of engineering confidence that comes from never having been told something is impossible.\n\nSome never went beyond testing, while others waddled, crawled, or flew their way into real combat. However, they all demonstrate that the line between brilliant innovation and spectacular failure is often thinner than the blueprints on which they were drawn. And sometimes, the weirdest ideas are the ones that teach us the most about what's actually possible when you stop worrying about what things are supposed to look like.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "description": "Injuries in Ukraine largely come from shrapnel and explosions. Medics say they're seeing damage to multiple parts of the body all at once.",
    "fullText": "The war in Ukraine is one of blast and shrapnel injuries, not gunshot wounds, a local medic and US veterans providing medical care in front-line areas told Business Insider.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is characterized by fighting in extensive trench networks, where grenades continue to prove their worth, intense artillery fire, missile barrages, and drone attacks. Land mines also continue to be a problem.\n\nGunfights, however, are becoming less common.\n\nUS veterans and a Ukrainian medic told Business Insider that most combat injuries are caused by fragmentation and burns and that amputations are often necessary.\n\nThese injuries are not unusual for industrial, artillery-heavy conflicts, or more modern kinds of warfare, for that matter, but they are being exacerbated by new technology, such as exploding one-way attack drones and others that drop grenades and other deadly explosives.\n\n\"This is not a war of direct small-arms contact,\" the medic shared, \"but a war of remote destruction.\"\n\nKaterina Zirka, the Ukrainian combat medic, said that she increasingly sees injuries that affect multiple parts of the body at once, often without a single identifiable \"entry wound,\" but instead dozens of micro-injuries from blasts and shrapnel. The medical equipment she carries has changed as a result.\n\nMedics are also seeing internal blast injuries that don't come with external wounds, such as concussions, ruptured eardrums, and lung injuries from rapid changes in pressure, she said.\n\nSoldiers fighting in Ukraine have told Business Insider about being injured by exploding drones, mines, and falling debris when buildings are hit. Mortars, artillery, and rockets have also done their fair share of damage.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and served as a combat medic for his unit previously told Business Insider that he saw a significant number of injuries from explosions, like burns, concussions, traumatic brain injuries, and wounds from shrapnel that resulted in amputations.\n\n\"Artillery is fucking everywhere out there. You go anywhere near the front, it's just artillery shell, artillery shell, artillery artillery,\" he said, speaking to BI on the condition of anonymity for operational security reasons.\n\nThe threats, however, are far more than artillery.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is involved in medical training for front-line Ukrainian civilians through a nonprofit organization, Task Force Antal, that also provides supplies and evacuation assistance. He shared details about the kinds of injuries he's seen in this role.\n\n\"Mostly people aren't being shot, even on the front lines,\" he explained. \"It's injuries that come from a missile, a drone, or a glide bomb.\"\n\nMark Antal, the co-founder of Task Force Antal and a veteran of the elite US special operations unit Delta Force, told Business Insider that he had to tell some of his group's medics that \"the soldiers on the front line, less than 2% of them are being shot. All of the wounds are from drones, from shrapnel.\"\n\nAnd with civilians, \"it's crush injuries, it's blast injuries.\"\n\nChristine Quinn Antal, a US Army veteran and former national security advisor who co-founded the nonprofit, said that with other injuries being significantly more prevalent, members have taken \"things like chest seals,\" tools used for gunshot wounds, out of their medical kits. \"We've moved away from that,\" she said.\n\nAway from the cities, out on the front lines, drones dominate warfare, but even in the close-quarters fighting, explosives, not necessarily guns, are key. There is still a role for guns in this war, but drones and other new tech are taking over classic combat roles, even the precision strike role of snipers.\n\nDrones are used in this war more than in any other conflict in history, and have fundamentally changed the shape of the war. Their ubiquity is shown by Ukraine's own stats. Its commander in chief said in November that drones were responsible for around 60% of all Russian targets hit.\n\nDrones direct traditional weapons but also engage targets as well. They are deadly tools readily available in large quantities at low costs, making them increasingly desirable tools as the war drags on.\n\nZirka said that injuries have changed because now, \"most engagements actually take place in the air through the use of drones. As a result, gunshot wounds are encountered much less frequently.\" Soldiers have told BI that drones have created a roughly 10-kilometer kill zone at the front.\n\nGuns are not gone from Ukraine, far from it, but it is a different kind of fighting. Soldiers carry and are trained on various guns for different missions, some of which sometimes actually lead to injuries that aren't gunshots.\n\nSoldiers often arm themselves against the ever-present threat of drones with electronic warfare tools and shotguns, among other systems. Shooting down drones, like the fiber-optic drones resistant to jamming, can generate dangerous shrapnel that can pierce or shred the skin.\n\nTroops also carry guns into trench warfare, which has been a prominent part of this fight.\n\nBut much of that fight also relies on other weapons, such as explosives like grenades and mines. These weapons are used to booby trap trenches and to try to clear them. The trenches can be so tight that it can make using firearms like assault rifles difficult.\n\nDrones are also used in trench battles, including by dropping grenades into enemy trenches or diving down on soldiers and exploding.\n\nLikewise, explosives are often used to clear bunkers as well. Charging into one for an extremely close-quarters firefight is exceptionally dangerous. A grenade, on the other hand, lowers the risk.\n\nUkraine has mounted machine guns and other weapons on its uncrewed ground robots, creating new ways to fire on the Russians using guns without putting its troops at risk, but these weapons are still quite limited for the time being. The same is true for the automated gun turrets.\n\nAs Zirka indicated, this war is more of a remote-explosive fight than a gunfight.",

    "fullText": "A picture is worth a thousand words. A video makes a statement.\n\nFacing down the threat of a potential criminal indictment, Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn't write a press release.\n\nInstead, he turned to the camera, literally, to respond to what he described as the Trump administration's \"threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nThe choice was out of character for Powell, who's known for measured, not reactionary, responses during his Fed tenure. But the video enabled Powell to project calm while also signaling the significance of the moment, communication and leadership experts told BI's Ana Altcheck and Tim Paradis.\n\n(If you need a refresher, here's the backstory on Powell's Senate testimony that's the basis for the DOJ probe.)\n\nPowell's response is worth examining as President Donald Trump continues to pick fights across the business world. Look no further than the oil industry, where Trump said he's \"inclined\" to keep ExxonMobil out of Venezuela after its CEO said the country is currently \"uninvestable.\"\n\nIt's a strategy we've seen before from Trump.\n\n\"Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen,\" writes BI's Peter Kafka.\n\nIt's also part of a new form of capitalism that Trump is ushering in, including the government sometimes taking stakes in individual companies and leaning on public offices meant to remain independent. We're following it all this year with our series on \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nEven if Trump wins the battle with Powell, he could still lose the war on rate cuts\n\nHeading into the year, investors expected two standard cuts from the central bank in 2026. Now JPMorgan is questioning if we'll even get one.\n\nStrong job and GDP growth, coupled with inflation sitting above 3%, has JPMorgan predicting the Fed will hold rates steady for the entire year. And that's even if Trump installs a Fed chair who's more keen to cut rates.\n\n\"Against this anticipated macro backdrop, we do not see the new dovish Fed chair being able to sway the FOMC to cut,\" wrote Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief US economist.\n\nAs if things couldn't get worse, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has an even starker prediction: a rate hike.\n\nSløk said the massive amount of AI-led borrowing means companies issuing more bonds. The increase in investment-grade bonds could draw investors away from the Treasury market, potentially forcing rates higher.",

Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

After all, it’s turning out to be a once-in-a-lifetime event full of incredible spectacles, UFC champions, and world-class guests.\n\nThe event is expected to garner such attention and attract dignitaries from around the world that France isn’t willing to go head-to-head with UFC on Trump’s birthday. Can you blame them?\n\n🚨 France is delaying this year’s G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event on June 14 👀\n\n(via @politico) pic.twitter.com/0XXqSHM8IS\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to a recent report by news outlet Politico, France will move its annual G7 Summit — which seven major industrial countries discuss key global policy issues — from June 14-16 to June 15-17. This clears the way for UFC’s White House card and Trump’s birthday bash on June 14. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office declined to confirm that the rescheduling is directly related to the UFC event and said the change of date is “the result of our consultations with G7 partners.”\n\nWhen asked about the G7 Summit delay a White House official told Politico: “As the leader of the free world, our partners believed that President Trump’s attendance at the G7 Summit was essential. They kindly shifted dates to accommodate the U.S. president’s schedule.”\n\nDana White reshares the news that France has delayed the 2026 G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event. 😅 pic.twitter.com/xKiSKRSgx3\n\n— MMA Orbit (@mma_orbit) January 9, 2026\n\nFor more UFC White House 2026 news and coverage click HERE.",

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

Putin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024.",
    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",

    "title": "Arsenal seemed to lose the summer signing battle - but could win the war",
    "description": "Liverpool spent big on flashy signings in the summer but cannot compete with the strength and depth of Arsenal’s bench",
    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta first turned to Myles Lewis-Skelly. Then he went to a double bill of Gabriels, with both Jesus and Martinelli. Next came Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze.\n\nThere were five substitutions before Liverpool’s first. Even that was enforced. Injury time proved a sadly accurate term as Conor Bradley was stretchered off and Joe Gomez came on.\n\nArsenal 0-0 Liverpool finished 5-1 in one respect: changes. “I think there are other things to talk about where both teams are at the moment than talking about the bench,” countered Arne Slot. The league table shows a 14-point gap and Slot cited a 20-goal difference in their respective set-piece balances, to borrow his term.\n\nBut champions and their probable successors have pursued different policies in their attempts to win the title. Liverpool were famously the biggest spenders, but Arsenal had the largest net spend. Slot got the flashiest signings. Arteta did not. Indeed, the last pair he brought on, Madueke and Eze, were summer arrivals but do not seem to figure in his first-choice side.\n\nHe filled out his squad, filled in every gap. It was the Polyfilla approach to winning the title, ensuring there were no cracks left in the group.\n\nThere was a case, reduced by their autumnal struggles and stumbles, to say that Liverpool had the strongest starting 11. It remains utterly uncontroversial to say that Arsenal have the best squad. No one else has quality in such depth. Arsenal, Slot had said the day before the stalemate at the Emirates, were a team with no obvious weaknesses. “The complete package,” he called them. Liverpool remain an incomplete package.\n\n“We showed that in the big games we are able to compete with any other team,” Slot argued; but Arsenal have competed with every team. Liverpool had their £450m refit but ended with a smaller squad than Arsenal and with at least three players, in Federico Chiesa, Rio Ngumoha and Wataru Endo, who Slot is reluctant to start in the Premier League.\n\nSlot fielded no striker at Arsenal, with Chiesa left unused. He has been down to two centre-backs for parts of the campaign, with Giovanni Leoni’s campaign curtailed and Gomez unfit at times. There have been times when he was without a specialist right-back. Recently, he had no out-and-out winger, Chiesa and Ngumoha apart. Liverpool did not follow Arteta’s model of two players for every position; sometimes they have not even had one.\n\nThey have been left with an overworked core. Apart from the Carabao Cup, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate have started every game this season. Apart from a one-game ban, Dominik Szoboszlai has only missed seven minutes. It has been just as well; even with them, Liverpool have felt short of players.\n\nMeanwhile, the sense that Arteta is prepared for every eventuality is underlined by the versatility of his players. None of Slot’s full-backs is particularly equipped to stand in as a centre-back. Three of Arteta’s, in Riccardo Calafiori, Jurrien Timber and Ben White, have spent part of their careers there. He has a midfielder, in Mikel Merino, who has flourished as a stand-in striker. The Spaniard scored home and away against Liverpool last season. He did not even make it off the bench on Thursday.\n\nThose options can justify Arteta’s policy of splitting his budget more ways, of signing four players each for £50m rather than bringing in two £100m men; one of Liverpool’s, in Alexander Isak, is injured and has been ineffective anyway.\n\nIt is no secret Arteta admired the Swede. He instead bought the cheaper, and distinctly limited Viktor Gyokeres. The theory was that he would be the final piece in the jigsaw; instead of winning the league because of the Swede, they may do so in spite of him. There are reasons to wonder if Gyokeres will soon be Arsenal’s fourth-choice centre-forward, even if, on form this season, Isak should be Liverpool’s second option, behind Hugo Ekitike, when each is fit.\n\nIn trying to build a title-winning side, Liverpool may have aimed for the highest ceiling, but Arsenal had the platform of the highest floor. Liverpool’s vision of a glorious attacking force, with Florian Wirtz as the creator in chief and Isak the scorer extraordinaire, may one day be realised; but even if so, it will not bring them Premier League glory this season.\n\nArsenal may have a more prosaic brand, a style that – with apologies to artists such as Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka – is based on efficiency. It has not brought much of a reward in two games against Liverpool; over 21 in a campaign, however, it has given them a six-point lead, and 14 ahead of Liverpool.\n\nAnd over a season, Arteta’s decision to prioritise strength in depth is justified by other markers. They top the second-half table, with most goals. They have 10 goal involvements from substitutes. They are alone among England’s Champions League representatives in going unbeaten in the Premier League games immediately after a European midweek.\n\nLiverpool could hold them over 90 minutes. Yet a glimpse at the benches, a sight of Freddie Woodman, Calvin Ramsay, Trey Nyoni and Ngumoha and the nine pedigree players Arteta had in reserve told a tale of where the title could be decided.",

The Tigers filed at $19 million.\n\nThat's the widest gap in the history of MLB's arbitration process.\n\nMORE: Guardians take a step forward with Steven Kwan\n\nThe arbitration process determines the salaries for players in their fourth, fifth and sixth years of service time with a team in the major leagues.\n\nIf a team and player don't agree to a contract ahead of time, they go into arbitration, where the player and team each submit a value, kind of like a bid.\n\nThey each then go into a room and pitch their case, and at the end, an arbitrator picks which side has won, and that's the player's salary for the season ahead.\n\nSkubal will eventually be looking at the largest contract ever given to a pitcher.\n\nRight now, he's just trying to get fair compensation for his last season before free agency.\n\nThere's no way Skubal can appreciate the difference in opinion being this wide. The back-to-back AL Cy Young winner is as valuable as any pitcher in the sport not named Paul Skenes.\n\nIt's not clear whether this will lead to a change in the Skubal trade rumors or timeline. But it doesn't seem like this can help the Tigers' cause in being thought of favorably by Skubal.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nReds have a promising prospect named Ichiro Cano\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nHunter Pence's nephew has the best name and a 100 MPH fastball",

    "description": "Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.  Israel said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.  The effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.\n\nThe effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.\n\nThe military's statement, which did not name Hezbollah or any other armed groups, came before President Joseph Aoun met with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government to discuss the deployment and disarmament plans. Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nLebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement.\n\nA statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the Cabinet meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon.\n\n“The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,\" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.”\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said in a later statement that the group is “rearming faster than it is being disarmed,\" and showed a map of alleged Hezbollah compounds, launch sites, and underground networks south of the Litani River.\n\nPlan to restrict weapons at an ‘advanced stage’\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river.\n\nHezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a procedure to implement prior United Nations Security Council agreements that call for disarmament of non-state groups and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, and for the Lebanese state to have full control of its territory.\n\nInformation Minister Paul Morcos said after the Cabinet meeting that the army will start working on a plan for disarmament north of the Litani river that will be discussed by the government in February. He added that the army will also continue the process of weapons “containment” in other parts of Lebanon, meaning that they will not be allowed to be used or moved.\n\nThe Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels, rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September.\n\nThe government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons.\n\n“The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities.”\n\nHezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese announcement.\n\nOfficials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase.\n\nIsrael continues to strike Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control.\n\nRegular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps.\n\nIsrael accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts.\n\nLebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war.\n\nHezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened.\n\nHezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

    "fullText": ", \n Peter Brown\n , and \n Aron Garst\n on January 8, 2026 at 4:57PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nCall of Duty is a cultural touchpoint in gaming. It has held the title of most popular first-person shooter for years, in a genre filled with high-quality multiplayer games that have constantly gunned for the top spot. While major elements persist across titles, each game tends to introduce--or at least attempt to introduce--something new to the formula, as Activision bounces development duties between internal studios including Treyarch and Infinity Ward.\n\nThe series goes back to 2003 with the original Call of Duty fighting with Medal of Honor and Battlefield--two franchises that already had established reputations--for player attention. All three were set during World War II, and Call of Duty would continue down that path for both Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 3.\n\nAfter several games set in the most devastating international conflict the world has ever seen, the series went in a different direction with the release of the widely-acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. A gripping narrative, memorable characters, and fast-paced multiplayer gave fans a rush of adrenaline and the series reached a height it had never achieved before. The positive reception ensured a steady stream of modern- or future-set sequels, including multiple Call of Duty: Black-Ops and two more Modern Warfare (Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3) games in the years to come.\n\nCall of Duty moves in cycles, and it was in 2017 that Activision took the series back to World War II for Call of Duty: WWII. It was a return to form that seemed like the right move at the right time--a good way to shake up the flow of the previous 10 years. Following Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 in 2018--which abandoned a single-player campaign but introduced a series-first battle royale mode--the franchise rebooted the Modern Warfare series in 2019.\n\nActivision took potentially the biggest step forward for the franchise to date by launching a free-to-play battle royale standalone game called Warzone in 2020. That has gone on to become a massive success for the publisher, eclipsing the standard game by several metrics. The main series continued with annual releases, with Black Ops Cold War coming out alongside Warzone in 2020. We saw both parts of Activision's Call of Duty ecosystem intertwine, with Black Ops guns coming into Warzone and a map redesign themed around Cold War's 1980s setting.\n\nCall of Duty's reach is vast, and it has resonated with casual and hardcore players for a wide variety of reasons. We've collected GameSpot's Call of Duty reviews from over the years and compiled them here to illustrate the series' rise to prominence, and to provide a historical snapshot of each individual games' place in the process. But if there's a particular game that made you fall in (or out) of love with Call of Duty, shout it out in the comments below!\n\n\"Call of Duty is an all-around excellent game that confidently challenges, head-on, all the other WWII-themed shooters out there and comes out on top. When a game is outstanding, like this one is, some people invariably expect it to be something completely different from what's already available. That's not true of Call of Duty, which is directly comparable to Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and other such games. Yet, on its own merits, this game is executed extraordinarily well, and, therefore, can be wholeheartedly recommended not just to fans of other WWII-themed shooters but to anyone looking for a first-rate action game.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Overall, Call of Duty: Finest Hour is still a competent shooter, and those who enjoy World War II-based games will still have a good time with it. Had the feel of the weapons been a little better, and had the campaign been more consistently intense, Finest Hour could have been a much better game. As it is, though, it enters a market that becomes more and more competitive with each passing month. Judged against the standards of so many other quality first-person shooters, Finest Hour is difficult to wholeheartedly recommend.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Call of Duty 2 is just about everything you would hope for and expect from the sequel to one of the most successful World War II shooters of all time. Its varied campaign, excellent sound and gameplay design, and generally good AI make it a worthy successor to the original. At the same time, though, it's still a World War II shooter, and if you've grown weary of them, then Call of Duty 2's lack of new material might turn you away. It can also be murderous on your computer if you have modest hardware. What Call of Duty 2 does do well is nail down just about all aspects that define an ideal first-person shooter. If you liked the original and have been thirsting for more, Call of Duty 2 will definitely deliver that.\" [Read the review]\n\nOverall, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One is still a worthwhile first-person shooter. The game has made noticeable strides over the previous Call of Duty game on consoles with an interesting, but short, campaign. While the game has its moments, particularly with the turret shooting and vehicle portions, Big Red One still falls short of the standard the series set for itself on the PC because of pedestrian sound effects, poor AI, and a lack of intensity in the infantry combat. The multiplayer action on the Xbox and PS2 is also only serviceable, so it's worth a bullet point on the back of the box...and not much more. Unless you're a hardcore WWII game fanatic, Big Red One's probably only worth a rent.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"From start to finish, Call of Duty 3 is an intense experience and a great game. The visuals are fantastic and the sound is some of the best in any game to date. Though there's no question that Call of Duty 3 is every bit as good as its predecessor, and without question the multiplayer is vastly improved, none of the changes or additions to the single-player campaign significantly alter the way the game plays. If the Call of Duty series hasn't won you over previously, Call of Duty 3 isn't going to do much to change your mind. But for anyone else, Call of Duty 3 is a must-own.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Call of Duty: Roads to Victory isn't a terrible game--it's just unnecessary. While it may look like Call of Duty and for a while feel like Call of Duty, nearly all of the things that make the Call of Duty games so enjoyable are watered down or missing.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"COD 4 is available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, and each version holds up admirably. The differences between the two console versions feel mostly negligible. Both systems deliver good frame rates and have good, easy-to-use multiplayer setups that most closely resemble Halo 2 and 3's party system and matchmaking playlists. The PC version of the game uses a more traditional server browser to get you into games. Both systems work just fine on their respective platforms. The PC version has the ability to run in a higher resolution, if you're equipped with a PC that can handle it, but it seems to scale quite well. You can also create servers that allow up to 32 players to play at once on the PC, as opposed to a limit of 18 in the console versions, but given the size of the multiplayer maps, putting 32 players in them makes things a little too crowded. Despite listing 1080p support on the back of the box, COD 4 appears to prefer 720p on the PlayStation 3. The only way to get it to run in 1080p is to tell your PS3 that your TV doesn't support 720p or 1080i, but the difference seems minor. Either way, you'd be hard-pressed to tell it apart from its Xbox 360 counterpart. And all versions control just fine, making the decision over which version to buy totally dependent on which controller you like the most.\n\nIt's a shame that the single-player is so brief, but you should only skip out on Call of Duty 4 if you're the sort of person who doesn't appreciate great first-person shooter multiplayer. The quality of the content in the campaign is totally top-shelf, and the multiplayer is some of the best around, making this a truly superb package.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The bigger issue is the lack of any sort of online play. It'll take you roughly eight hours to finish the campaign, which you'll probably spread out over two or three play sessions just to give your eyes and hands ample rest. Beyond that, the multiplayer mode is restricted to four players who happen to be in the same room as you. There's a decent selection of environments while the layouts are well suited to the different deathmatch and capture-the-flag options, but realistically speaking, how likely are you to convince four of your friends to buy one DS game then arrange for everyone to get together to take advantage of its multiplayer mode? Not very likely. As such, the game's longevity stems mainly from its single-player campaign. That's Call of Duty 4 on the DS in a nutshell: intensely satisfying, but over in a day or two.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"By staying largely true to the formula that made Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare so successful, Call of Duty: World at War has ensured a proven level of technical quality, particularly in the multiplayer arena. On the other hand, one of Modern Warfare's strengths was its fresh approach, and by embracing a familiar setting and familiar mechanics, World at War achieves greatness but falls short of excellence. This is only a bad thing if you are expecting this game to top its benchmark predecessor. If, however, you are hoping for an exciting campaign, fun cooperative play, and engaging multiplayer action, then you'll find a lot to be happy about in World at War.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"All told, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Reflex Edition does right by the source material. The expertly scripted and intensely exciting campaign is just as entertaining as it was two years ago on other systems, and even the occasional lapses in visual fidelity and control precision can't keep it from being a must-play for Wii shooter fans. Though the multiplayer will feel familiar to World at War veterans, the modern guns, equipment, and perks will make it feel new again, and the expanded gameplay modes offer a lot more variety. Though there are a few hitches to deal with, the core excellence of this game shines through, giving Wii owners a great shooter to keep them entertained for months to come.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Fortunately, the action generally remains on the good side of hectic, and the stream of rewards is as satisfying as ever. Two new elements, title and emblem, are little graphics and titles that you earn through your match performance, and these range run the gamut from serious to totally goofy. While not exactly in keeping with the serious tone of the campaign, they add an amusing way to further customize your online presence. With a robust variety of playlists in which to ply your deadly trade, Modern Warfare 2's competitive multiplayer is the best in the series and one of the best available on consoles. The inelegant campaign plot may make you feel like you're just along for the ride, but it is such an intense, roaringly great ride that you will be glad just to have played it. The cooperative missions provide a uniquely fun angle on the action that rounds out the package superbly, making Modern Warfare 2 thoroughly entertaining, thoroughly rewarding, and thoroughly worth the wait.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"While it may not take the signature Call of Duty action to dizzying new heights, Black Ops is a thoroughly excellent game. New modes and mechanics give a jolt of energy to the lively competitive multiplayer, and the engrossing new campaign develops into one of the best in the series. Combat training allows anyone to enjoy the thrills of arena combat and the satisfaction of leveling up, and the opportunities for cooperative play, local competition, and community video creation provide even more outlets for entertainment. Call of Duty: Black Ops lives up to the top-notch pedigree that the series has earned, giving players an awesome new shooter to enjoy just in time for the holidays.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare 3 doesn't take any chances with the tried-and-true formula. At launch, even the matchmaking playlists feature standard fare, but the robust Private Match customization options let you tweak the standards to your liking (even offering some of Black Ops' more interesting modes) and hold the possibility of odd permutations to come. Whatever diversions or innovations may lie in Modern Warfare 3's future, the competitive multiplayer still offers the same sweet satisfaction you've come to expect from the series. This is some of the best online shooter action around, and with the daunting challenges of Spec Ops and the exciting, globe-trotting campaign, Modern Warfare 3 stands tall as another great descendant of the game that changed a generation.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Though zombies mode is stagnating, the rest of Black Ops II is lively, and it's great to see some shifting in the familiar structure. Developer Treyarch's storytelling prowess has once again resulted in an engaging, exciting campaign, and the addition of league play to the online multiplayer arena is an intriguing change that could reinvigorate the formula that has endured for so long. By reaching forward while remaining rooted in the things it does so well, Black Ops II offers a great shooter experience.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Crashes occur on a fairly regular basis, locking the system up. It's tough to stay connected to games, and even remaining hooked up to Wi-Fi can be a challenge. Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified is a massive disappointment that tarnishes this highly regarded franchise. What's more, this is a blown opportunity for the Vita to garner itself a headline game and franchise that could have really energized the system. Instead, we get a quick, forgettable knockoff cranked out simply to take advantage of the buzz around the Black Ops name.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"From an exuberant campaign full of spectacle and variety to the way Extinction's unpredictable aliens force you to use those targeting skills in entirely new ways, Ghosts strikes an excellent balance between the familiar and the novel. This is a game that's keenly aware of the series' strengths, but doesn't find itself beholden to them. No matter what standard you apply, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a terrific first-person shooter.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The last time Call of Duty had “Warfare” in its subtitle, it led to a well-received trilogy that deftly transitioned the series away from a well-trodden global conflict to modern-day combat. If the settings of today have run their course just as World War II did years ago, Advanced Warfare makes for a convincing foundation of futuristic yet relatable combat that is worth exploring and expanding further. The huge change in player mobility is less of a paradigm shift and more of an overdue retooling for an 11-year-old FPS franchise, especially in a year of mobility-focused shooters. Yet for all its predictability, Advanced Warfare is a deluge of action-film bravado, and it's difficult to not be carried away by its tidal forces.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"There are fleeting moments when Black Ops III's cybernetic modifications change the way you play. These abilities let you control enemy drones, stun human opponents, or set fire to robots' internal systems. The powers would be more impactful, though, if there wasn't such a lack of enemy variety. Aside from flying drones and the occasional mech mini-boss, enemy variants just require differing numbers of bullets to take down. And when you're using them on such a repetitive group of targets, who react the same way every time, the abilities lose their novelty.\n\nAlthough Black Ops III offers the option to play the campaign cooperatively, its problems only multiply as a result. Instead of creating deeper scenarios involving teamwork and communication between up to four players, Black Ops III decides to just throw more hardened enemies at you. One Warlord--an enemy that requires several magazines to bring down--is bothersome enough. Four of them together is downright frustrating. They feel more like brick walls than sentient soldiers.\n\nBlack Ops III's narrative doesn't support the campaign in any meaningful way, either. It tells an incomprehensible story about AI ascendancy and the moral grays of a hyper-connected future, raising intriguing questions but never bothering to answer them. At the end of it all, after hours of soulless shooting and unremarkable storytelling, Black Ops III delivered its nebulous twist, and I didn't dwell on it.\n\nIn its undead modes, and the first 10 hours of multiplayer, it excels. But in its campaign, it merely crawls forward. Black Ops III doesn't offer anything remarkable to the series, but does just enough to maintain the Call of Duty status quo. The franchise, however slowly, continues its inexorable march.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"By venturing beyond Earth--and not just to other planets, but to space itself--Call of Duty found a canvas to produce its best story in years. It reinforces the notion that a game's narrative is only as good as its characters. Given the campaign's accomplishments in space combat, it's puzzling that no effort was made to replicate its zero-G sensations in Infinite Warfare's multiplayer. Consequently, the well-crafted Zombies mode is a more attractive, time-consuming proposition for those looking to play with friends. While no Call of Duty game has matched the comprehensive excellence of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the exploits of Reyes and Ethan are at least as memorable and moving as any deeds from “Soap” MacTavish and John Price during from the series' heyday.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Ultimately, if every shooter set in the European Theater of World War II is measured by how it depicts its D-Day landing--assuming it has such a mission--Call of Duty: WWII emphatically succeeds in its impactful designs and delivery. The sensation of riding the troop carrier as it approached the beach filled me with depression more than dread, knowing I'd survive eventually while many of my surrounding brothers in arms wouldn't. While not equally emotional, this battle's reinterpretation in War mode proves to be a highlight in a superb suite of competitive modes. Zombies rounds off this stellar return to form, effectively blending the ferocity of online cooperative play with the goal-driven satisfaction of found in the campaign. As one of the most comprehensive and filler-free Call of Dutys in recent memory, Call of Duty: WWII successfully capitalizes on the series' strengths\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Black Ops 4 isn't short on content, and its three main modes are substantial. Multiplayer introduces more tactical mechanics without forcing you into them, and it largely strikes a good balance. Zombies has multiple deep, secret-filled maps to explore, though its returning characters don't hold up and prove distracting. Finally, Blackout pushes Call of Duty in an entirely new direction, making use of aspects from both multiplayer and Zombies for a take on the battle royale genre that stands on its own. Sure, there isn't a traditional single-player campaign, but with the depth and breadth of what is there, Black Ops 4 doesn't need it.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare makes old observations and presents them with new flourishes. Those new flourishes do make for a good campaign and solid multiplayer. But it's when Modern Warfare asks you to think harder that it falls short. [Read the review]\n\n\"Warzone is a great sophomore attempt at a battle royale from Call of Duty, which finally manages to carve out its own identity with interesting spins on the existing formula. Its subversion of death and the nail-biting Gulag duels give you more ways to stay in a match, while also forcing you to be aware of your surroundings even after wiping a rival squad. Its looting is streamlined enough to make early moments feel fast, but Warzone also loses some of the messy magic from hobbled together loadouts by letting you drop in prebuilt ones far too easily and frequently. Still, if you're comfortable with Call of Duty's latest iteration of multiplayer antics and thrive in the stressful setting of battle royales, Warzone is a strong contender for your attention.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"As with any annual game franchise, it's hard not to compare Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War to last year's Modern Warfare. On the campaign side, Cold War does much better than last year's outing, showing that Call of Duty fares far better when it errs on the side of fantasy. This is true within Cold War's campaign, where the inclusion of Ronald Reagan is a bizarre fit for an otherwise larger-than-life story about espionage and brainwashing, and it's true when comparing its story to that of last year's self-serious Modern Warfare.\n\nIn Zombies, Cold War has a far more successful co-op mode than Modern Warfare's Spec Ops, though it's still in need of some balance tweaks. Multiplayer, however, is where Cold War struggles; it falls flat overall, and that's especially apparent in Warzone's shadow.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"The thing about Call of Duty games is that, with each yearly iteration, you pretty much know what you're getting--and that's largely the case here. It's both a blessing and a curse for Vanguard, however. Elements of Vanguard feel like good additions to the franchise, but its ideas also don't always mix well with the series' framework. That framework is still strong, and the solid gunplay, exciting multiplayer, and inventive moments of the campaign are worth seeking out. But forcing those two parts together exposes the seams in Call of Duty: Vanguard at times, weakening both parts of the game rather than pushing either one to the forefront.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Modern Warfare 2's gunplay and the fast time-to-kill all feel very much the same as Modern Warfare 2019. However, Infinity Ward definitely improved a lot on what worked and didn't work in the previous game. The scaled-back maps definitely make for better pacing, the less hectic movement is not so overwhelming, and all the new maneuverability features make the game so enjoyable from match to match. No one should load into a match expecting this game to be anything like the original Modern Warfare 2, but all issues aside, this rebooted version's gameplay does serve as a positive successor to Modern Warfare 2019.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Although its narrative setup is enjoyable, Modern Warfare 3 can't get out of its own way, with nearly half of the missions being the underwhelming Open Combat style. The bumpy pacing and abrupt ending make Makarov's big return a disappointment, dragging Modern Warfare 3 down as the weakest entry of an otherwise strong reboot series.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"Between Omni-movement, map design, and new options for loadouts, Black Ops 6 is full of relatively small adjustments that fit well with the underlying Call of Duty formula, without drastically changing it. Those adjustments often do tend to favor one kind of play over others--the bunny hopping, dolphin diving, in-your-face aggressive approach--but that's not necessarily always a bad thing, and playing with Black Ops 6's new movement system makes for some phenomenal action moments and great-feeling gunfights. The effects of Omni-movement and smaller battlefields have a tendency to have a limiting effect on what works in Black Ops 6 multiplayer at times, but with well-built maps, quick traversal, intense weapons, and interesting loadout options and rewards, the things the game does well are still a whole lot of fun.\" [Read the review]\n\n\"One big change for Black Ops 7 is the reintroduction of classic matchmaking. This is the Call of Duty matchmaking formula present in the games that came before 2019's Modern Warfare reboot. This means open matchmaking with minimal skill consideration, whereas the recent games had strict skill-based matchmaking (or SBMM). This is something that a vocal portion of the community has been requesting to change in Call of Duty, but I don't think this is a positive for everyone. On one hand, I enjoy the classic matchmaking and the varied lobbies it provides. Some matches you get paired against really skilled opponents, and other times you're the better player. Call of Duty's strict SBMM of recent years made it difficult for players of various skill levels to play together. It also made some players feel punished for having a really good game, because the lobbies would seemingly increase in difficulty afterwards. On the other hand, I recognize there are players who might find the change jarring, if skill-based matchmaking was heavily protecting them. This is a big change for Call of Duty, and the impact of this remains to be seen.\n\n\"Overall, the multiplayer package is really strong in Black Ops 7. The movement is fun and fluid, the gunplay is as satisfying as ever, and the map designs greatly improve the experience from last year. Combined with the smaller quality-of-life change and the futuristic themes, Black Ops 7 feels like a fresh experience that avoids any dreaded fatigue.\" [Read the review]",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOle Miss football games are soundtracked by a familiar refrain.\n\nBetween touchdowns, canons and cheers exists a six-line sonnet that has proven especially memorable in Oxford, Miss.\n\nHotty Toddy has been a steady part of the Rebels' game day routine for the better part of a century. The chant is a rhythmic one, filled with whimsy, intensity and camaraderie like few other war cries in the nation.\n\nSo, just what does Hotty Toddy mean? The Sporting News gives you the inside scoop on all things related to Ole Miss' signature phrase.\n\nMORE: How Trinidad Chambliss went from Ferris State to Ole Miss stardom\n\nDubbed the \"unified holler of Ole Miss fans\" by the Magnolia Tribune in 2024, Hotty Toddy is the Rebels' beloved rallying cry. Its origins are mysterious, having first been published in Ole Miss student newspaper The Mississippian (now known as The Daily Mississippian) in 1926.\n\nIt's something of a mating call amongst Rebels enthusiasts, a classic call-and-response chant that exists in a similar space to other famed slogans like Mississippi State's \"Hail State\" and Alabama's \"Rammer Jammer.\" The chant itself is always preceded by a simple query: \"Are You Ready?!\"\n\nMORE: Lane Kiffin's timeline of teams coached and career record\n\nThe ensuing dialogue flows like honey, each word growing more memorable than the last.\n\nThe Hotty Toddy lyrics are as follows:\n\nHotty Toddy is undoubtedly a full-body experience. It grasps at three different senses at once. Those who deliver the chant don't merely see and hear it. They feel the rhythm, too, courtesy of a hand gesture. Most fans who utter the phrase do so while pulling off the landshark or \"Fins Up\", a simple signal which sees users point their hand sideways and bring it up to their head to mimic a shark's fin underneath waves.\n\nThe gesture began in 2008 when then-linebacker threw it up after corralling then-Rebels quarterback Jevan Snead multiple times during a summer practice.\n\nMORE: Where is Trinidad Chambliss from?\n\n\"Fins Up\" was born, a tradition that has paired harmoniously with the Hotty Toddy chant over the years.\n\nIt's unclear why the Rebels have grown so fond of Hotty Toddy. Its meaning is muddled, with different Ole Miss supporters delivering different definitions of the term.\n\nSome think it's a play on the phrase hoity-toity, perhaps a reference to the high-brow nature of tailgating typically present at Vaught Hemingway Stadium, the Rebels' home ground.\n\nMORE:How Ole Miss-Mississippi State rivalry got Egg Bowl name\n\nThere's also the case of the Hot Toddy, a tea-like cocktail that tends to feature hot water, lemon, honey and your choice of dark liquor. Some believe the chant is a nod to the famous spirit. It's quite possible that Rebels enthusiasts delivering the phrase do so as liquid courage seeps into their bellies.\n\nThere is some evidence that the phrase is derived from World War I-era banter. Still, all roads to the tagline's origins are shrouded in dust and fog. One thing is for certain, though: Ole Miss students have no interest in retiring the chant any time soon.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the first published use of Hotty Toddy took place in the mid-1920s. It is likely that the phrase was around for some time before then.\n\nMORE:11 most expensive coach buyouts in college football history\n\nThe cheer was initially known as \"Heighty Tighty\", with its lyrics slightly altered compared to its present-day version. Here's a look at the chant in its initial form, per Magnolia Tribune.\n\nHell, yeah! Damn right! \nHeighty Tighty, Gosh Almighty,\nWho The Hell Are We? Hey!\nFlim Flam, Bim Bam\nOle Miss By Damn!\n\nThe hot toddy is not believed to be related to the Ole Miss chant. However, the warm alcoholic beverage is a favorite of fans at The Grove and figures to feature prominently in the fanbase's pregame rituals, particularly when temperatures drop.",

    "fullText": "One of Ukraine's first F-16 pilots said they had to create new tactics for the fighter because the West's original training didn't fit the war against Russia.\n\nUkraine's air force released a video interview on Monday with the pilot, whose name wasn't disclosed, in which he spoke about the F-16 Fighting Falcon's performance and the early challenges he faced when learning to fly the aircraft.\n\nThe pilot said he flew Kyiv's Soviet-made combat aircraft in the initial days of Russia's full-scale invasion, before being sent abroad to train to fly the F-16s donated by the West.\n\nOnce he returned to the war, he and his fellow pilots \"encountered reality,\" he said.\n\n\"The tactics that we were taught abroad do not entirely fit the war we have here, because those tactics are also based on wars in which the partners previously took part,\" the pilot said. \"And this war is fundamentally different from those wars.\"\n\nUkrainian pilots had to devise their own tactics, he said.\n\n\"How we would destroy cruise missiles, strike drones, how we would fight with the enemy near the line of combat contact,\" the pilot added.\n\nUkraine's Western allies have been taking note of some of those lessons, he added.\n\n\"When the partners see our effectiveness, they understand how, in our limited conditions, we are able to carry out flights with such effectiveness,\" he said. \"And they even, I would say, learn from us. They learn the tactics and adjust the tactics that they taught us when we were abroad.\"\n\nThe pilot didn't go into exact detail about the types of new tactics Ukrainians developed for the F-16, but spoke about a daring maneuver he recently conducted in the Donbas region.\n\nHe said his three-ship formation had encountered heavily saturated Russian defenses, including surface-to-air missile systems and unspecified air assets, that \"did not allow us the possibility to approach\" their target.\n\n\"We drew two missiles from the enemy, because there were two launches from different directions, and we gave the opportunity for our strike aircraft to destroy the target,\" he said.\n\nThe pilot said the entire group returned safely after the mission.\n\nUkraine has officially received 44 of the 87 F-16s that European nations have promised to donate to Kyiv. Its first crews for the American-made aircraft were trained in Romania, where a coalition of NATO member states, including the US, worked to teach Ukrainian pilots, technicians, and other staff to service and fly the planes.\n\nIn his interview, the pilot said the language barrier was one of his biggest challenges when learning to fly the F-16, and that while waiting to be sent abroad for training, he studied English grammar, colloquial language, and aviation terms as he rested between combat flights.\n\n\"It was very hard, because after a combat sortie, as a rule, a pilot has to rest, because he does not know whether at some moment he might fly again,\" he said.\n\nThe first of Ukraine's F-16s entered the war in August 2024 and were primarily used for defensive purposes against strike drones and cruise missiles.\n\nKyiv has since lost four of the aircraft, but its pilots have also been recorded achieving notable feats, including one reportedly destroying six missiles in a single flight.\n\nThe interviewed pilot praised the F-16 as a fighter that performs \"flawlessly,\" but also said he wished for the more advanced, Block 70/72 version of the aircraft. These latest iterations have been upgraded with fifth-generation technology, including powerful radars with stronger jamming resistance and a modernized cockpit.\n\n\"If we were given such an opportunity to carry out tasks on these aircraft, I think that in our tally there would be not only destroyed strike drones and cruise missiles, but also enemy aircraft that are carrying out tasks along the line of combat contact,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "description": "The U.S. Navy has some of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Its newest addition is named after an important World War II ship.",
    "fullText": "The United States Navy has the largest fleet of nuclear submarines on the planet, and it just added a new one to the inventory. This new fifth generation submarine is an incredible machine, and it was named in honor of one of World War II's biggest and best vessels. On December 15, 2025, the U.S. Navy took ownership of the USS Idaho (SSN-799). The ship was named to carry on the honor of the battleship USS Idaho (BB-42), which was first commissioned in 1919 and went on to be awarded seven battle stars during WWII.\n\nThe new Idaho is the 26th Virginia-class boat. The ship is the fifth U.S. Navy vessel to carry the name \"Idaho. The first was a wooden steam sloop that was turned into a full-rigged sailing ship commissioned in 1866. The second was the BB-24, a Mississippi-class battleship. During World War I, motorboat SP-545 also carried the name before \"Idaho\" was transferred to a New Mexico-class battleship of WWII. That warship was known as \"The Big Spud\" for the state's most famous crop.\n\nIt's common for the U.S. Navy to reuse ship names in honor of historical vessels. The most well-known example is probably the USS Enterprise, as there have been nine thusly-named vessels, three of which are aircraft carriers. The new USS Idaho will undergo a series of sea trials prior to its official commissioning, which will likely take place sometime in the spring of 2026. In the meantime, dedicated submariners will get to know the boat, which is expected to help strengthen the nation's undersea warfare capabilities.\n\nThe USS Idaho (SSN-799) is one of the most advanced nuclear submarines in the world. Virginia-class subs are designated to be attack platforms with the capability to launch cruise missiles. They're used primarily for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, and they can operate in blue-water oceans as well as in littoral areas along coastlines. The class is slowly replacing the cruise-missile variant of the Ohio class and other nuclear submarines in the Los Angeles class.\n\nAs of this writing, three Virginia-class boats are earmarked for the Royal Australian Navy, while the rest remain with the U.S. Navy. The USS Idaho measures 377 feet long with a displacement of 10,200 tons of seawater when submerged. The boat utilizes an S9G reactor alongside an auxiliary diesel engine and has a maximum speed of around 29 mph. Like other vessels of its class, the Idaho will be home to 128 enlisted personnel and 17 officers.\n\nBecause the boat is powered by nuclear energy, it has virtually an unlimited range and will likely remain in service for at least 40 years. In terms of armament, the USS Idaho features two Virginia Payload Tubes and four additional payload tubes capable of firing the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile.

    "fullText": "A preschool teacher was arrested on camera as soon as she finished a TV interview criticizing Donald Trump, fueling the debate over protest policing and free speech.\n\nJessica Plichta, 22, said she was the only person arrested among roughly 200 demonstrators at an anti-war protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday, hours after Nicolas Maduro was detained in Caracas by the U.S. military.\n\nIn the broadcast footage, two officers could be seen approaching from behind as she wrapped her interview with WZZM, the city’s ABC affiliate, then escorted her away as she told them, “I am not resisting arrest.”\n\nWZZM said an officer cited “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command,” and that Plichta had been charged with failure to obey a lawful command.\n\nPlichta later told Zeteo: “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that as soon as I finished an interview speaking on Venezuela, I was arrested.”\n\nShe told the outlet the officers shoved her into the back of a patrol car without fastening her seat belt, then drove a short distance down the street—out of view of cameras and bystanders.\n\nAccording to Plichta, they stopped again, pulled her out, bent her over the vehicle, patted her down, and took her belongings. She recalled one officer saying they moved her because she was “making a scene.”\n\nShe also said officers repeatedly pressed her on whether she was Venezuelan, what her connection to Venezuela was, and why she had attended the protest. Plichta claimed they tried to get her to identify other demonstrators.\n\n“We are so accustomed to, and used to, repression when we speak out on anti-war topics. When we speak out for Venezuela, when we speak out for Palestine, we expect the police to want to shut that down,” she told Zeteo.\n\n“It just shows how much they feel they can get away with things, how easy it is for them to isolate people from the public eye when they’re doing this.”\n\nPlichta said she largely stayed quiet as officers took her to jail, where she said the same questions continued. She was released about three hours later after other protesters gathered to demand she be freed and was seen punching the air in a video shared on Facebook.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department disputed her claims in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nA spokesperson said more than “25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group [of protesters] to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” but that they had “refused lawful orders” to move to the sidewalk and “began blocking intersections.”\n\nAdding that supervisors told officers they could arrest anyone who could be “positively identified,” the spokesperson confirmed only one arrest was made. The Beast followed up to ask why only Plichta had been arrested, but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nThe mayor of Grand Rapids is David LaGrand, a Democrat.\n\nThe incident came to light as Trump, 79, tries to sell the Maduro operation at home, despite signs of public unease.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Monday found about one in three Americans approve of the U.S. strike, while 72 percent worry the U.S. will become too involved.\n\nIt is also a small part of a much larger information war that has even seen Trump amplify mislabeled footage on Truth Social to claim mass celebrations after the Maduro capture—a video that fact-checkers traced to an unrelated 2024 protest.",

    "description": "Market experts say geopolitical conflict is becoming a permanent force impacting commodities pricing, rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.",
    "fullText": "It might be hard to tell by looking at the stock market, but investors are living in a new era of geopolitical risk.\n\nWhile equity markets have largely shrugged off the latest geopolitical shocks, the last few years of hot and cold wars have rewired commodities. From Ukraine to Venezuela, ongoing and emerging conflicts have impacted everything from oil to gold to copper.\n\n\"Geopolitical risk has always influenced commodity prices, but it is increasingly acting as a persistent pricing factor rather than a transitory shock,\" a team of commodities researchers at Oxford Economics wrote. \"While acute events can still trigger sharp price moves, markets now tend to embed a standing risk premium reflecting ongoing supply-chain fragility, trade fragmentation, and resource nationalism.\"\n\nUltimately, conflict is becoming a permanent pricing mechanism rather than a temporary blip on traders' radars.\n\n\"As a result, geopolitical considerations are more systematically incorporated into pricing, investment decisions, and procurement strategies across many commodity markets, rather than being quickly priced out once an event fades from headlines,\" they added.\n\nMany traders and experts say the start of this new era for commodity markets began in 2022 with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In nearly four years since then, the world has seen fresh fighting across the Middle East, rising tensions between China and Taiwan, and, most recently, the surprise US raid on Venezuela.\n\nThese episodes have been potent drivers of gold's rapid rally. Investors have flocked to the safe-haven metal as forecasters see the potential for further conflicts through the rest of this decade.\n\nFlare-ups across the Middle East between Israel and Iran and a two-year war between Israel and Hamas have only heightened gold's status as a hedge, while also boosting silver.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of geopolitical uncertainty,\" said Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, an economic policy think tank. \"When you get that, you get movement into precious metals as one of the safe havens. But added to that is the United States reliability as a partner to question is called into question.\"\n\nOil is an outlier in the new era, with prices steadily sliding even as geopolitical forces send investors flocking to other commodities. Crude fell 20% in 2025, with the summer's Israel-Iran conflict only causing a brief jump in the price of Brent.\n\nStill, energy investors are once again being forced to digest the potential for new conflicts to impact the market, mulling the potential for the US takeover of Venezuela to increase supply down the road.\n\nJeff Le, a managing principal at consulting firm 100 Mile Strategies, agrees that a new era has arrived for commodities.\n\nSpeaking with Business Insider, he highlighted how quickly the landscape appears to be shifting, pointing to rising prices not just of precious metals but of industrials as well.\n\n\"The surge of industrial metals over the last year, including gold to over $4,000 represents gains not seen in over four decades,\" he told Business Insider. \"This rush could be representative of a new chapter of the commodities market.\"\n\nBoth Le and Lachman noted the possibility of the US' action in Venezuela setting a new precedent for geopolitical action, highlighting its importance as a driving force for commodities.\n\n\"The Trump administration and growing global tensions appear to be more of a feature than a bug,\" Le noted. \"With three more years to follow, it's possible that geopolitical risk is not only a permanent consideration in the commodities market but a more important weight to investors.\"",

    "fullText": "The Fallout episode this week also depicted an important event from a beloved DLC.\n\n on January 7, 2026 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.\n\nThis week’s episode of Fallout was an explosive one. Between Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper (Walton Goggins) finally arriving in New Vegas, Maximus (Aaron Moten) causing conflict within the Brotherhood of Steel, and Vault 31 struggling to survive without their waterchip, there was no shortage of exciting events. With exciting events come easter eggs and deeper ties to the Fallout video games that are a treat for new and returning fans. Let's take a look at some of this week’s easter eggs as the show arrives in the City of Sin.\n\nThis week’s episode began with a pre-war flashback depicting Cooper fighting on the Alaskan front. In Fallout lore, Alaska was occupied by Communist Chinese forces and fought the United States over control of Anchorage. The liberation of Anchorage was most famously depicted in the Operation: Anchorage DLC for Fallout 3, which saw the player character entering a simulation to relive the historical battle.\n\nThe Alaska flashback also depicts the first time the United States deployed the T-45 power armor, which helped to aid their victory against the Chinese forces. Power armor ends up becoming the main tool of the Brotherhood of Steel after Roger Maxson left the United States army to form the organization, but longtime fans will also recognize the T-45 model of the armor as the centerpiece on the cover of the original 1997 Fallout game.\n\nWhen Lucy recovers we learn that she was being pumped up with Buffout, a chem from the video games that provides a boost to strength stats and is essentially a powerful, in-world steroid. Like many other chems in the games, Buffout becomes addictive after prolonged use and leads to negative stat effects unless the player keeps using it regularly or goes many in-game days without use. With no time on her side, Lucy has to keep using Buffout or face negative repercussions from her addiction.\n\nThroughout the episode--particularly whenever they run into trouble on The Strip--Cooper suggests that they take a detour to Freeside to either avoid combat or learn information. Players of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize Freeside as one of the last locations they can visit before they reach their destination of The Strip. Overrun by gangs such as The Kings (who appear in this episode as ghouls), Freeside is inspired by the real-life location of Fremont Street. The real world location is disconnected from the Las Vegas Strip and offers cheaper (and sometimes more rambunctious) entertainment options for travelers and tourists.\n\nWhile Lucy is high on Buffout and gets into a shootout with The Kings, her final kill is showcased with a slow motion gory headshot that is very cinematically pleasing. This shot replicates a critical headshot in V.A.T.S. from the Fallout video games. The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System allows players to slow down or freeze time to line up gory head and body shots and was introduced in Fallout 3 as a way of replicating the turn-based combat of the first two entries.\n\nThe credits of the episode depict an abandoned Camp McCarran inside a derelict Las Vegas International Airport. In Fallout: New Vegas Camp McCarran was the largest active military base of the New California Republic and served as the NCR’s stronghold in their activities against Caesar’s Legion. With the NCR all but non-existent in the Mojave Wasteland as of late, it’s not surprising to see Camp McCarran has met the fate it has.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nA potential New York bidding war could be forming around Kyle Tucker, and if the market goes that way, the New York Yankees and New York Mets could find themselves battling it out.\n\nEarly predictions had Tucker in the $400 million range, but as the offseason has unfolded, that no longer feels safe to say, and that matters for two teams that are always willing to spend some money when it matters most.\n\nTucker is still viewed as one of the best players in baseball. He impacts the game on both sides of the baseball, can really swing it, and fits most lineups.\n\nFor the Yankees, he’d provide another middle-of-the-order presence with Aaron Judge. For the Mets, he’d represent another franchise bat to pair with Juan Soto.\n\nBoth New York teams have shown a willingness to spend, and both could use a player of his caliber after disappointing years a season ago.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman, both squads have checked in on the left-handed hitting slugger.\n\n“Though he might not reach the early $400M predictions after his typically excellent but ultimately unsatisfying platform season with the Cubs, the all-around star (he, Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and José Ramírez are the only players to post a 4 WAR the past five seasons) should still be worth $300M-plus based on past deals and comps. But if he doesn’t mind resetting, the Dodgers could become an option for a short term and high AAV. The Yankees and Mets (and all big-market teams) have checked in, but Cody Bellinger’s versatility and lower price tag make him the New York mark — at least for now,” he wrote.\n\nIf Tucker’s asking price continues to come down, don’t be surprised if New York City turns into the center of his free-agency race.\n\nKyle Tucker now viewed as ‘fallback option’ for Yankees amid Cody Bellinger rumors\n\nAmid Jazz Chisholm rumors, Yankees predicted to sign Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette to $180 million contract\n\nRed Sox have shown interest in an All-Star the Yankees have been linked to in trade talks\n\nMariners reportedly willing to move top prospects for Yankees trade target, possibly take New York out of contention\n\nCubs predicted to make a deal for former Yankees dud and Blue Jays infielder who ruined World Series\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

    "fullText": "Rosen, who led Sega from the 1960s into the 90s and who died on Christmas Day, was a hugely important figure in the history of arcade and home gaming\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "fullText": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin’s state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "description": "Patria, Finland's biggest defense contractor, is scaling up production as it deals with an order backlog of over 1,000 vehicles from NATO allies.",
    "fullText": "Alarms blare over the factory floors, and work at Patria's Hämeenlinna facility grinds to a halt.\n\nThe soft thrum of an explosion echoes through the campus. Moments later, roughly 700 workers continue making their armored vehicles bound for Japan, Sweden, Slovakia, and other countries. The blast is not a test-firing of its new combat vehicle, but part of the construction for its expanding manufacturing facility.\n\nPatria, Finland's largest defense company, is planning to nearly double production at its main hub just north of Helsinki, clearing rocks with explosives on-site to make way for several new assembly lines.\n\nThe Hämeenlinna factory manufactures Patria's 8×8 armored personnel carrier and a relatively new, up-and-coming vehicle: a wheeled 6×6 troop transport that's receiving surging demand from northern and western Europe.\n\nWork on the 25-foot-long, 17-ton vehicle began in 2020 under a joint program between Finland and Latvia called the Common Armored Vehicles System. Both countries sought a cost-effective, mass-produced armored vehicle that could be used by their militaries for interoperability.\n\nLatvia has since sent at least 42 of these vehicles to Ukraine, armed with heavy machine guns and rolled out in batches over the last year. The vehicle can cross tundra and even rivers while shielding up to 10 troops it carries from land mines and artillery fire to get them to forward positions.\n\nWhen Business Insider visited Patria's factory, representatives for the company — which is majority-owned by the state of Finland — said the firm wasn't authorized to share details about the 6×6's performance in Ukraine.\n\nBut the CAVS 6×6 program has been quickly drawing attention from the rest of Europe: What began as a partnership between two countries has expanded into a consortium of seven member states.\n\nSweden joined the Common Armored Vehicles System program in 2022, followed by Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway in subsequent years.\n\nFinland and Latvia have placed orders for just under 500 of these vehicles, while Sweden has requested 415 of the 6×6s to be delivered over the next five years. Stockholm's latest order for 94 vehicles, announced in early December, priced each one at about $1.75 million.\n\nGermany has become the program's largest buyer, signing contracts in mid-December to acquire 876 of the 6×6 vehicles, valued at $2.3 billion. These vehicles will be split into four variants, including one that features a mortar turret.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark, which joined the program this year, has already placed an order for 129 6×6 vehicles.\n\nThe UK and Norway are still negotiating 6×6 orders with Patria.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 can accommodate roughly 10 troops, along with a typical crew of two or three, and features up to NATO standard level 4 armor designed to withstand direct hits from large-caliber machine gun fire, mine explosions, and nearby artillery blasts.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 competes with other wheeled troop transports, such as Rheinmetall's Boxer and General Dynamics Land Systems' Stryker, the latter of which is extensively fielded by the US Army.\n\nThe Finnish company said it can tweak the vehicle for each customer's needs, but a typical model features climate control that enables the vehicle to operate in temperatures as low as -40°F.\n\n\"Inside, it will be comfortable enough to easily survive. We are talking about temperatures of the plus centigrades,\" Mikko Rantanen, Patria's director for 6×6 vehicle programs, told Business Insider from inside the rear compartment of one of the vehicles.\n\nThe 6×6's rear interior is spartan: Cloth-covered metal-frame seats and headrests for five people on either side, with space behind each seat for equipment and small arms.\n\nThere's just enough room for a soldier to sit with their knees touching the opposite passenger's. A few fire extinguishers inside are connected to an automatic suppression system that can detect a blaze in the rear cabin.\n\nScreens allow troops to see outside the vehicle through exterior cameras, while a rear hatch provides the option of fitting a machine gun or crewed weapon module on top of the 6×6.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the vehicle, a small passageway also lets troops pass between the rear compartment and the driver's cabin, which resembles that of a truck and features an automatic gearbox.\n\nOptional propellers on the 6×6's underside enable it to transition seamlessly from traversing land to crossing small bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes.\n\n\"We can enter the water without needing preparation in this configuration,\" said Rantanen.\n\nHowever, the 6×6's speed in the water is just under 5 mph, and Rantanen added that it's not meant to be a landing craft or amphibious assault vehicle.\n\nOn land, it's designed to drive at speeds of over 60 mph, easily cross trenches that are four feet wide, and surmount obstacles about two feet high.\n\nBuilding weapons and vehicles specifically for arctic terrain is a specialty for contractors in Finland, a country renowned for holding off the Soviet Union for over 100 days in deep snow and dense forest during World War II.\n\nPatria said that while the 6×6 can be outfitted for various terrain types, including the desert, the arctic domain is its forte.\n\nSnow isn't the only challenge in arctic warfare. Few roads are available on Finland's border with Russia — the priority threat for NATO — and its vast hinterland is peppered with thousands of small lakes and marshland that can bog down armored transport.\n\n\"In the wintertime, it's snow,\" said Petri Hepola, Patria's executive vice president for sales and marketing and its chief program officer for the F-35. \"In the summer, lots of wet soil and swampy areas. One of the most important features is how fast you can move your troops and tools through these areas.\"\n\nFinland and Norway are the only two members of Patria's 6×6 program that share Arctic borders with Russia.\n\nHowever, as northern Europe, especially the Baltic and Nordic states, grows increasingly concerned about conflict with Moscow, the Kremlin has been bolstering its military presence in the high north, repopulating key bases and transforming its Arctic fleet into a separate strategic theater.\n\nSince Finland joined NATO in 2023, alliance forces have been rushing to train on the country's terrain and frigid temperatures, making it one of the most active spots for joint exercises in recent years.\n\n\"Our products have been surviving very well in that environment,\" Hepola said.\n\nWith an order backlog of nearly 2,000 6×6 vehicles, Patria hopes its new facility in Hämeenlinna will be ready for production by 2027. The factory campus serves only the tail end of the entire manufacturing cycle, which can take weeks in most cases, or several months for more complicated variants.\n\nInside, hundreds of workers conduct welding, surface treatment, assembly, tests, and other final processes that can each take weeks to complete. Dozens of vehicles line the factory floors, and dozens more sit in parking lots, each marked with a flag to designate the country for which it has been modified.\n\nBefore delivery, each one is supposed to be driven at least 200 km, or 124 miles.\n\nRantanen, director of the 6×6 program, said Patria has been integrating counter-drone systems, such as jammers, on the vehicle.\n\nArmored vehicles in Ukraine have especially struggled against pervasive minefields and small drones with explosive payloads, some of which are controlled via a fiber optic cable connection that can't be jammed. In response, soldiers there have relied more on firearms such as shotguns and machine guns to counter such attacks.\n\nRantanen said Patria hasn't yet officially added any kinetic weapons that can take down drones.\n\n\"The drone threat is currently evolving at such a speed that it's hard to keep track of it closely,\" he said. \"But we are hard at work for the countermeasures against drones as well.\"",
